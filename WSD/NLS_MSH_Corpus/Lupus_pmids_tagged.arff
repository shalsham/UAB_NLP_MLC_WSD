19928663,"[<e>Lupus</e> vulgaris as a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis--case report]Tuberculosis is a contagious disease induced by Mycobacterium species, acid-fast bacilli. These are mostly human type--Mycobacterium tuberculosis, less often cattle type--mycobacterium bovis or other: mycobacterium avium, kansasii, marinom, scrofulaceum, heamophilium, gordonae. The infection can affect all organs, but pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common form. The importance of tuberculosis is definitely rising in the context of massive population migrations in regions affected by its higher incidence, increased HIV infections and AIDS development. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a particular tuberculosis form with differentiated clinical picture. Non-typicalness of skin changes and oligobacilleous course of extrapulmonary tuberculosis forms are repeatedly causing difficulties in adequate diagnosis and early treatment. In differential diagnostics of cutaneous tuberculosis one must take leishmaniasis, actinomycosis, leprosy, syphilis and deep mycosis (among others) into consideration. The study is presenting a case of lupus vulgaris as a complication of past pulmonary tuberculosis. In bacteriological diagnostics of skin changes bioptates, no tuberculosis mycobacteria were found. The disease was diagnosed based on specific granulation presence in histopathology test, tuberculin hypersensivity, bacilli DNA presence in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and skin changes regression after anti-mycobacterium treatment. According to authors of the study, the described case confirms the usefulness of PCR nucleonic acids amplification test in cutaneous tuberculosis diagnosis.",M1

OBJECTIVES: To report a case of lupus vulgaris in a locus minoris resistentiae (a site of reduced resistance) and to use a unique set of clinical circumstances and laboratory tests to reconstruct the pathogenesis of the lesion and the response to treatment. CONCLUSION: Lupus vulgaris can occur in a locus minoris resistentiae; local trauma and possibly other factors, such as increased temperature, topical corticosteroids, and the virulence of the infecting strain, may facilitate the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis present at a locus minoris resistentiae as a result of a silent bacillemia.",M1

She visited many hospitals without resolution and the plaque gradually enlarged. Recently, she was misdiagnosed with eczema and prescribed topical steroids that had no effect, and she subsequently visited our outpatient clinic. A diagnosis of lupus vulgaris was made based on histopathology, culture and polymerase chain reaction, and isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol were administered as antituberculosis treatment.

We identified a mutation of a cadherin superfamily member, namely, desmoglein 4 (Dsg4), in early onset of death (EOD)( hage ) mice with hypotrichosis. The mutation was induced by the insertion of an early transposon II-beta into intron 8 of Dsg4. Mast cell hyperplasia was observed in the skin of EOD( hage ) mice. The abnormally expanded population of lpr T cells, i.e., CD4(-)CD8(-)B220(+)Thy1.2(+) alphabetaT cells, in the splenocytes of EOD mice was reduced in EOD( hage ) mice. Therefore, it was suspected that the long-living mutant EOD( hage ) mice were selected from lupus-prone EOD mice because of their immunological immaturity. These findings clearly indicate that Dsg4 is an important molecule for the formation of hair follicles and hypothesize that unorganized hyperplastic hair follicles in anagen due to the Dsg4 mutation provide niches for mast cell precursors in the skin.",M1

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine its existence and its clinical pattern in Tigray, a northern region of Ethiopia. METHODS: We report 202 cases of CT who attended the Italian Dermatological Centre in the 34-month period between January 2005 and October 2007. The diagnosis was made on a clinical, cytological and histological basis. RESULTS: Clinically, 143 cases of scrofuloderma, 22 of <e>lupus</e> vulgaris, 18 of gumma, 11 of lichen scrofulosorum, 6 of tuberculosis verrucosa cutis and 2 of erythema induratum of Bazin were observed in our department. All patients were aged between 18 months and 69 years, and 49 were paediatric cases. Forty-five were HIV positive. CONCLUSION: The number of CT cases observed in the period of 34 months indicates a high incidence of the disease in the region also in the paediatric age. CT is still underdiagnosed due to the low number of dermatologists as well as the poor life conditions of the population and the traditional belief in magic medicine. The current study may therefore provide some indication about the epidemiology of CT in Ethiopia.",M1

Mainly immunocompetent individuals are affected by this result of an endogenous reinfection on a lymphogenous-less frequently hematogenous-pathway. Lupus vulgaris has been observed to develop in more than 50% of all patients who already suffer from other manifestations of tuberculosis. The development of a squamous cell carcinoma in the lupus vulgaris is a rare complication; therefore, lupus vulgaris is deemed a facultative precancerosis.A 68-year-old female Serbo-Croatian patient presented with an extensive ulcerative nose and facial tumor. Her anamnesis included a squamous cell carcinoma of the nose that had been excised alio loco 3 years before. Further examinations revealed enlarged cervical lymphoma on both sides, and pulmonary metastases were also suspected. The tumor biopsy revealed a necrotic, granulomatous inflammation. No acid-fast rods were seen on Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The tuberculous origin of this ulcerative skin tumor-the lupus vulgaris-as an endogenous reinfection of pulmonary tuberculosis manifestation was confirmed by the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in polymerase chain reaction and the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis colonies in the bacterial culture (skin biopsy and bronchial secretion). The skin tumor as well as the pulmonary manifestation were successfully treated with combined tuberculostatic therapy and showed a dramatic response within 3 months.",M1

Cutaneous forms of tuberculosis account for approximately 10% of all cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Cutaneous tuberculosis may be because of true infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or because of tuberculids. Tuberculids are immunological reactions to haematogenously spread antigenic components of M. tuberculosis. True cutaneous tuberculosis may be because of inoculation or haematogenous spread of M. tuberculosis to the skin. Lupus vulgaris is the commonest form of true cutaneous tuberculosis. Other forms of true cutaneous tuberculosis are tuberculous chancre, tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, scrofuloderma, periorificial tuberculosis and miliary tuberculosis of the skin. Lupus vulgaris is usually chronic and progressive. It occurs in patients with moderate to high immunity against M. tuberculosis as evidenced by strongly positive tuberculin test. Long-standing cases of lupus vulgaris may be complicated by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

With the appearance of resistance to different kinds of pathogenes, HIV-immunodeficiency and decreasing standard of living, the incidence of skin tuberculosis increases. Lupus vulgaris is a chronic form of the secondary tuberculosis of the skin. CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a 66-year-old woman who presented with a growing, painless, brownish-red, slab-shaped, jelly, cutanesous mass, 2.5 centimeters in diameter, on the tip of her nose, reaching the mucous membrane of the nose. RESULTS: Apart from accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43/73) and a positive tuberculosis test (Mantoux 10 TU = 25x25 mm), all relevant findings were within reference values. Using Ziehl-Neelsen staining, no acido-resistent bacilli were found. The skin scraping sample, taken from the affected skin and the mucous membrane, was cultivated in Lowenstein medium base, and this resulted with cultivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Using three-drug combination therapy for ten months, complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSION: Successful cultivation of pathogens represents an absolute diagnostic criterion. We present a case of a woman with lupus vulgaris, because there is a small number of cases documented around the world where the diagnosis was confirmed by culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",M1

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 12 patients with lupus-associated PH (age 43+/-10 years, mean+/-SD, all female) treated with pulmonary vasodilators. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had severe PH: median six-minute walk distance (6MWD) 266 m (95% confidence interval [CI], 106 to 362); functional class III (n=7) and IV (n=5); mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 52 mmHg and cardiac index 2.23 L/min/m(2). Eight patients were started on epoprostenol and 2 each on bosentan or treprostinil. After a mean follow-up of 41+/-25 months, 5 patients were on combination therapy (3 epoprostenol plus bosentan, 1 treprostinil plus bosentan, 1 bosentan plus sildenafil) and 7 were on monotherapy (2 epoprostenol, 4 bosentan, 1 sildenafil); 6MWD increased by 139 m (95% CI, 36 to 259, p=0.007), 8 patients were functional class I or II and 4 were class III; right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) decreased by 22 mmHg (95% CI, 6 to 36; p=0.012), mPAP decreased by 18 mmHg (95% CI, 8 to 29; p=0.014), and cardiac index increased by 1.44 L/min/m(2) (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.08; p=0.016).

17374624,"Drug-induced <e>lupus</e> associated with synthetic conjugated estrogens.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of drug-induced lupus (DIL) in a patient taking Cenestin, a combination product of synthetic conjugated estrogens. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old white female presented with a 4 month history of bilateral arm pain that developed and progressively worsened after initiating Cenestin 0.625 mg daily. The patient's symptoms, findings on physical examination (eg, degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint), and laboratory test results (eg, antinuclear antibody titer 1-640 [normal &lt;1-40]) were suggestive of DIL. Her symptoms rapidly resolved with discontinuation of Cenestin and promptly resumed with reinitiation of the drug. Laboratory test values also improved significantly with discontinuation of Cenestin. Based on these findings and the Naranjo probability scale score, this reaction was probably associated with Cenestin. DISCUSSION: DIL differs from systemic lupus erythematosus in that it is caused by prolonged exposure at adequate doses to a drug rather than being an autoimmune reaction. The most commonly reported and studied medications are hydralazine, quinidine, and procainamide. Other medications have been associated with DIL; however, data are limited in these reports, especially with estrogen. There have been no previous reports in the literature of synthetic estrogen products associated with DIL. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of DIL can be very challenging to make, especially since there are no clear criteria on which to base it. While estrogen has rarely been reported to be associated with DIL, it may be considered as a possible cause.",M1
17366961,"Minocycline-induced <e>lupus</e> in adolescents: clinical implications for physical therapists.STUDY DESIGN: Resident's case problem. BACKGROUND: In the United States, minocycline is a frequently prescribed medication for the treatment of moderate to severe acne, a common condition in adolescents. The use of minocycline has been associated with severe adverse effects that frequently comprise a musculoskeletal component, including drug-induced lupus. Physical therapists have the responsibility to identify drug reactions that mimic musculoskeletal symptoms. The patient described herein was a 15-year-old adolescent boy who had taken minocycline for 14 days. He was initially treated by his primary physician on the 15th day of minocycline therapy for symptoms of fever, joint swelling, and a rash. The patient presented to a physical therapist on the 22nd day with complaints of severe myalgia, arthralgia, and severely limited mobility secondary to pain. The patient was referred to a pediatric rheumatologist because of the systemic nature and severity of the symptoms. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was subsequently diagnosed as having drug-induced lupus by a pediatric rheumatologist. The patient's myalgia and arthralgia subsided within 6 weeks, but his strength, coordination, and endurance did not reach their prior levels for 3 to 4 months. DISCUSSION: Physical therapists who include a comprehensive pharmacovigilance component in their patient examination may recognize musculoskeletal symptoms that arise from a nonmusculoskeletal origin. Minocycline is commonly prescribed in the United States as an antibiotic and for treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, physical therapists should screen for minocycline use when an adolescent patient or a patient with rheumatoid arthritis presents with diffuse musculoskeletal symptoms. An automated medication monitoring system would provide physical therapists with a means of accessing current information on medication use.",M1

To confirm the presence of these traits, our laboratory introgressed homozygous NZB chromosome 4 intervals extending from either 114 to 149 Mb or 32 to 149 Mb onto the lupus-resistant C57BL/6 background (denoted B6.NZBc4S and B6.NZBc4L, respectively). Characterization of aged cohorts revealed that B6.NZBc4L mice exhibited a striking increase in splenic B1a and NKT cells in the absence of high titer autoantibody production and significant renal disease. Tissue-specific expansion of these subsets was also seen in the peritoneum and liver for B1a cells and in the bone marrow for NKT cells. Staining with CD1d tetramers loaded with an alpha-galactosylceramide analog (PBS57) demonstrated that the expanded NKT cell population was mainly CD1d-dependent NKT cells. The lack of both cellular phenotypes in B6.NZBc4S mice demonstrates that the genetic polymorphism(s) that result in these phenotypes are on the proximal region of NZB chromosome 4. This study confirms the presence of a locus that promotes the expansion of B1a cells and newly identifies a region that promotes CD1d-restricted NKT cell expansion on NZB chromosome 4. Taken together, the data indicate that neither an expansion of B1a cells and/nor NKT cells is sufficient to promote autoantibody production and ultimately, renal disease.",M1

Mehl's tentative therapy was superseded by technological methods of sunlight treatment, as developed by the Danish doctor Niels Ryberg Finsen. In 1903 Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work while Mehl's discovery remained practically unknown. This episode in the history of medicine demonstrates how the recognition of a new method not only depends on criteria of its efficacy, but equally so on the degree of its conformity with preconceived notions and accepted standards.",M1
17156859,"Antibody induction of <e>lupus</e>-like neuropsychiatric manifestations.Although systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is usually evaluated with regard to autoimmune reactivity toward the kidney, there are multiple psychiatric abnormalities associated with this autoimmune disease. Lupus-prone male NZM88 mice, derived from NZB/NZW F1 mice, develop early neuropsychiatric manifestations without any signs of nephritis. In addition to the usual repertoire of antibody specificities, including autoantibodies to dsDNA and renal antigens, mice of this inbred strain express autoantibodies to numerous brain antigens. Here, we show that autoantibodies to brain antigens, assessed by Western analysis, are as individually varied as are the diverse neuropsychiatric manifestations observed in SLE patients. Additionally, a monoclonal antibody derived from the spleen of an untreated NZM88 male when injected into healthy BALB/cByJ, but not C57BL/6J, mice induced behaviors similar to those of lupus-prone NZM88 mice. This monoclonal antibody, which is specific to dynamin-1, binds preferentially in BALB/cByJ cortex and induces substantial expression of cytokines mainly in the hypothalamus. Thus, an antibody to just one brain antigen can induce multiple behavioral changes, and multiple autoantibodies to different brain antigens exist in lupus-prone mice; however, susceptibility to the induction of neurobehavioral deficits is dependent on host genetics.",M1

17146841,"Torque teno virus (TTV): current status.Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family Circoviridae, genus Anellovirus, was first found in a patient with non-A-E hepatitis. TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of approximately 3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with approximately 2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2- and 2.6-kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in &gt; 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and <e>lupus</e>. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work.",M1
17085465,"The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-11 protein in various types of glomerulonephritis.BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated to play important roles in a number of pathological processes such as inflammation. In human glomeruli, the mesangial matrix turnover is controlled by a dynamic equilibrium between synthesis and degradation to which metalloproteinases are known to contribute. Metalloproteinase-11 (MMP-11) was originally discovered as a gene whose expression was associated with tissue remodelling. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MMP-11 protein is expressed in various types of glomerulonephritis and to elucidate the role of this expression. METHODS: Using standard immunohistochemistry, we analysed MMP-11 expression in renal biopsies from 95 patients with primary glomerulonephritis (n = 44) and secondary, either <e>lupus</e>-associated glomerulonephritis (n = 22) or pauci-immune, ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis due to small vessel vasculitis (n = 23) or Wegener's granulomatosis (n = 6). The examined cases were divided into two groups (proliferative and non-proliferative). Anti-Ki67 and -CD68 immunostaining was also performed in order to estimate cell proliferation and number of macrophages, respectively. RESULTS: MMP-11 immunopositivity was detected in the glomeruli of the majority of pathological samples. The highest incidence of MMP-11 immunopositivity (26.3%) was noticed in glomerulonephritides associated with microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener's granulomatosis. Generally, MMP-11 was often expressed in segmental areas of sclerosis, microadhesions, cellular and fibrocellular crescents. Fibrotic crescents and fibrotic glomeruli were constantly MMP-11-immunonegative. In MMP-11 immunoreactive glomeruli, increased numbers of macrophages were often detected in the mesangium (P = 0.001), while no such observation could be made with regard to proliferating cells (P = 0.170). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-11, like an inflammatory mediator, may exert a chemotactic influence on macrophages which aggregate in the mesangium; MMP-11 is not likely to have a parallel mitogenic or antifibrotic effect in diseased glomeruli.",M1

17015709,"Kinetics of human B cell behavior and amplification of proliferative responses following stimulation with IL-21.Although recent studies indicated that IL-21 is an important regulator of human B cell activation, detailed comparison of the effects of IL-21 on distinct B cell subsets have not been performed. Our studies revealed that IL-21R is expressed by naive and germinal center B cells, but not memory or plasma cells. IL-21R was increased on naive and memory B cells following in vitro activation. Investigation into the kinetics and magnitude of responses of human B cells to IL-21 revealed that IL-21 potently augmented proliferation of CD40L-stimulated neonatal, splenic naive, and memory and tonsil germinal center B cells. This response exceeded that induced by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, cytokines that also induce B cell proliferation. Remarkably, CD40L/IL-21-stimulated naive B cells underwent the same number of divisions as memory cells and exhibited a greater enhancement in their response compared with CD40L alone than memory B cells. Therefore, IL-21 is a powerful growth factor for naive B cells. This may result from the higher expression of IL-21R on naive, compared with memory, B cells. Stimulation of human B cells with CD40L/IL-21 also induced IL-10 production and activation of STAT3. We propose that IL-21 may have therapeutic application in conditions of immunodeficiency where it could expand naive B cells, the predominant B cell subset in such patients. Conversely, because IL-21 is increased in murine models of <e>lupus</e>, dysregulated IL-21 production may contribute to perturbed B cell homeostasis observed in systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, antagonizing IL-21 may be a novel strategy for treating Ab-mediated autoimmune diseases.",M1

METHODS: In the dermatological clinics of two major teaching hospitals in Chennai, 213 patients with suspected clinical manifestations of cutaneous tuberculosis underwent examination and a skin biopsy for bacteriological and histological tests. They were treated with a daily regimen of rifampicin and isoniazid for 9 months and follow-up for 3 years. RESULTS: Bacteriological and/or histological confirmation of tuberculosis was obtained in 88% of the cases. <e>Lupus</e> vulgaris lesions were seen mainly in the extremities and verrucosa cutis occurred predominantly on the sole and foot, while the cervical and axillary regions were the commonest sites for scrofuloderma.

A peptide, designated hCDR1, based on the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 1 of an autoantibody, ameliorated the serological and clinical manifestations of lupus in both spontaneous and induced murine models of lupus. The objectives of the present study were to determine the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects induced by hCDR1. Adoptive transfer of hCDR1-treated cells to systemic lupus erythematosus-afflicted (NZBxNZW)F1 female mice down-regulated all disease manifestations. hCDR1 treatment up-regulated (by 30-40%) CD4+CD25+ cells in association with CD45RBlow, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, and Foxp3 expression. Depletion of the CD25+ cells diminished significantly the therapeutic effects of hCDR1, whereas administration of the enriched CD4+CD25+ cell population was beneficial to the diseased mice. Amelioration of disease manifestations was associated with down-regulation of the pathogenic cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma and IL-10) and up-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta, which substantially contributed to the suppressed autoreactivity. TGF-beta was secreted by CD4+ cells that were affected by hCDR1-induced immunoregulatory cells. The hCDR1-induced CD4+CD25+ cells suppressed autoreactive CD4+ cells, resulting in reduced rates of activation-induced apoptosis. Thus, hCDR1 ameliorates lupus through the induction of CD4+CD25+ cells that suppress activation of the autoreactive cells and trigger the up-regulation of TGF-beta.",M1

16723695,"Nephritogenic <e>lupus</e> antibodies recognize glomerular basement membrane-associated chromatin fragments released from apoptotic intraglomerular cells.Antibodies to dsDNA represent a classification criterion for systemic lupus erythematosus. Subpopulations of these antibodies are involved in lupus nephritis. No known marker separates nephritogenic from non-nephritogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies. It is not clear whether specificity for glomerular target antigens or intrinsic antibody-affinity for dsDNA or nucleosomes is a critical parameter. Furthermore, it is still controversial whether glomerular target antigen(s) is constituted by nucleosomes or by non-nucleosomal glomerular structures. Previously, we have demonstrated that antibodies eluted from murine nephritic kidneys recognize nucleosomes, but not other glomerular antigens. In this study, we determined the structures that bind nephritogenic autoantibodies in vivo by transmission electron microscopy, immune electron microscopy, and colocalization immune electron microscopy using experimental antibodies to dsDNA, to histones and transcription factors, or to laminin. The data obtained are consistent and point at glomerular basement membrane-associated nucleosomes as target structures for the nephritogenic autoantibodies. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling or caspase-3 assays demonstrate that lupus nephritis is linked to intraglomerular cell apoptosis. The data suggest that nucleosomes are released by apoptosis and associate with glomerulus basement membranes, which may then be targeted by pathogenic anti-nucleosome antibodies. Thus, apoptotic nucleosomes may represent both inducer and target structures for nephritogenic autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.",M1

We investigated the role of ICOS in the development of autoimmune diseases in MRL/Mpj-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice. ICOS was expressed on CD4(+) T cells from adult MRL/lpr mice. ICOS-deficient MRL/lpr mice showed mild lymphoadenopathy and a decreased memory type CD4(+) T cells in the spleen. The anti-dsDNA antibody levels were decreased. CD4(+) T cells from ICOS-deficient MRL/lpr mice showed less of a bias to Th1 and an enhanced production of IL-4 in response to anti-CD3 antibody in comparison to those from wild-type MRL/lpr mice. Although ICOS-deficiency abrogated renal vasculitis completely, the severity of glomerulonephritis was not altered.

16542467,"Targeting Toll-like receptor signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and autoreactive B cells as a therapy for <e>lupus</e>.This review focuses on the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in lupus and on possibilities to treat lupus using TLR modulating inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides (INH-ODNs). TLRs bridge innate and adaptive immune responses and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Of particular interest are TLR3, -7, -8, and -9, which are localized intracellularly. These TLRs recognize single-stranded or double-stranded RNA or hypomethylated CpG-DNA. Exposure to higher order CpG-DNA ligands or to immune complexed self-RNA triggers activation of autoreactive B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. INH-ODNs were recently developed that block all downstream signaling events in TLR9-responsive cells. Some of these INH-ODNs can also target TLR7 signaling pathways. Based on their preferential cell reactivity, we classify INH-ODNs into class B and class R. Class B ('broadly reactive') INH-ODNs target a broad range of TLR-expressing cells. Class R ('restricted') INH-ODNs easily form DNA duplexes or higher order structures, and are preferentially recognized by autoreactive B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, rather than by non-DNA specific follicular B cells. Both classes of INH-ODNs can block animal lupus. Hence, therapeutic application of these novel INH-ODNs in human lupus, particularly class R INH-ODNs, may result in more selective and disease-specific immunosuppression.",M1

Lupus DCs showed an altered ex vivo costimulatory profile, with a significant increase in the expression of CD40, decreased expression of CD80 and CD54, and normal expression of CD86. DCs from young lupus-prone NZM2410 mice, before the development of the disease, expressed normal levels of CD80 and CD86 but already overexpressed CD40. The increase in CD40-positive cells was specific for DCs and involved the subset of myeloid and CD8alpha+ DCs before disease onset, with a small involvement of plasmacytoid DCs in diseased mice. In vitro data from bone marrow-derived DCs and splenic myeloid DCs suggest that the overexpression of CD40 is not due to a primary alteration of CD40 regulation in DCs but rather to an extrinsic stimulus. Our analyses suggest that the defect of CD80 in NZM2410 and NZB-W/F1 mice, which closely resembles the costimulatory defect found in DCs from humans with systemic lupus erythematosus, is linked to the autoimmune disease. The increase in CD40 may instead participate in disease pathogenesis, being present months before any sign of autoimmunity, and its downregulation should be explored as an alternative to treatment with anti-CD40 ligand in lupus.",M1

16425572,"The effect of TNFalpha blockade on the antinuclear antibody profile in patients with chronic arthritis: biological and clinical implications.Since the first proof of efficacy of TNFalpha blockade, both the number of patients treated worldwide and the number of indications for treatment with TNFalpha blockers have grown steadily. Surprisingly, the profound immunomodulation induced by anti-TNFalpha therapy is associated with a relatively low incidence of immune-related complications such as <e>lupus</e>-like syndromes and demyelinating disease. This contrasts sharply with the prominent induction of autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-dsDNA antibodies during TNFalpha blockade. Although this phenomenon has been recognized for several years, the clinical and biological implications are not yet fully understood. In this review, recent studies analysing the effect of TNFalpha blockade (infliximab and etanercept) on the ANA profile in autoimmune arthritis will be discussed. Taken together, these reports indicate that the prominent ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibody response is 1) not a pure class effect of TNFalpha blockers, 2) independent of the disease background, 3) largely restricted to the induction of short-term IgM anti-dsDNA antibodies, and 4) not associated with other serological or clinically relevant signs of lupus.

These beneficial effects were accompanied by a significant reduction in serum autoantibody and cytokine levels. Underlying these protective effects was the ability of suppressive ODNs to bind to and prevent the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT4, thereby blocking the signaling cascade central to the initiation and/or perpetuation of these disease states.

16339572,"Complement-dependent apoptosis and inflammatory gene changes in murine <e>lupus</e> cerebritis.The role of complement activation in the brains of MRL/lpr lupus mice was determined using the potent C3 convertase inhibitor, CR1-related y (Crry), administered both as an overexpressing Crry transgene and as Crry-Ig. Prominent deposition of complement proteins C3 and C9 in brains of MRL/lpr mice was indicative of complement activation and was significantly reduced by Crry. Apoptosis was determined in brain using different independent measures of apoptosis, including TUNEL staining, DNA laddering, and caspase-3 activity, all of which were markedly increased in lupus mice and could be blocked by inhibiting complement with Crry. Complement activation releases inflammatory mediators that can induce apoptosis. The mRNA for potentially proinflammatory proteins such as TNFR1, inducible NO synthase, and ICAM-1 were up-regulated in brains of lupus mice. Crry prevented the increased expression of these inflammatory molecules, indicating that the changes were complement dependent. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed complement-dependent up-regulation of glutamate receptor (AMPA-GluR) expression in lupus brains, which was also validated for AMPA-GluR1 mRNA and protein. Our results clearly demonstrate that apoptosis is a prominent feature in lupus brains. Complement activation products either directly and/or indirectly through TNFR1, ICAM-1, inducible NO synthase, and AMPA-GluR, all of which were altered in MRL/lpr mouse brains, have the potential to induce such apoptosis.

This ability appears to be associated with the low molecular weight and adjuvanticity of hydrocarbon. n-Hexadecane (C(16)H(34)), which is present in petroleum, has adjuvant activity and induces arthritis in rodents like other lupus-inducing oils. In addition to dietary exposure to n-hexadecane in mineral oils, exposure also occurs via inhalation of oil mist, jet fuel, or diesel exhaust or by absorption through the skin. Since n-hexadecane is a low molecular weight adjuvant hydrocarbon oil similar to other lupus-inducing hydrocarbons, the present study examined whether it can also induce lupus-related autoantibodies in mice. Female BALB/cJ mice received a single i.p. injection of 0.5 ml of n-hexadecane, pristane, or saline (control). Pathology and serology (immunoglobulin levels, autoantibodies by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and ELISA) were examined 3 months later. Unexpectedly, all n-hexadecane-treated mice, but none in the other groups, developed inflammatory ascites within 2.5 months. n-Hexadecane induced hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG1, IgG2a), antinuclear (titer&gt;1:160, 67%) and -cytoplasmic antibodies (58%) and autoantibodies to nRNP/Sm (25%), Su (33%), ssDNA (83%), and chromatin (100%). Therefore, non-specific inflammation caused by n-hexadecane resulted in the production of a limited set of specific autoantibodies. These previously unrecognized immunological effects of n-hexadecane may have implications in monitoring human exposure to hydrocarbons and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",M1

A 53-year-old woman developed such a carcinoma. She suffered from alcoholism, a well known risk factor for tuberculosis. The diagnosis of lupus vulgaris was confirmed by biopsy when an erythematous lesion on her arm that had been present for 25 years enlarged and subsequently ulcerated. Chemotherapy was discontinued because of lack of compliance and the ulcer grew markedly over the following 16 months. Therefore the entire lesion was excised. Histology showed a squamous cell carcinoma within the ulcer. Neither further systemic manifestations of tuberculosis nor metastases of the carcinoma were found. Under continuous combined antituberculous therapy, the patient remained free of symptoms. This case underlines the problems associated with a disease that has been nearly forgotten in the western countries. It also shows that alcoholism is a risk factor for tuberculosis, along with debilitating diseases such as lymphoma and AIDS as well as immunosuppressive therapy.",M1

In the lupus-prone (SWR x NZB)F1 (SNF1) thymus, introduction of the lupus TCR transgene caused no deletion, but marked down-regulation of the Tg TCR and up-regulation of endogenous TCRs. Paradoxically, autoimmune disease was suppressed in the alphabetaTCR Tg SNF1 mice with induction of highly potent regulatory T cells in the periphery. By contrast, in the MHC-matched, normal (SWR x B10. D2)F1 (SBF1), or in the normal SWR backgrounds, marked deletion of transgenic thymocytes occurred. Thymic lymphoid cells of the normal or lupus-prone mice were equally susceptible to deletion by anti-CD3 Ab or irradiation. However, in the steady state, spontaneous presentation of naturally processed peptides related to the nucleosomal autoepitope was markedly greater by thymic dendritic cells (DC) from normal mice than that from lupus mice. Unmanipulated thymic DC of SNF1 mice expressed lesser amounts of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules than their normal counterparts. These results indicate that apoptotic nucleosomal autoepitopes are naturally processed and presented to developing thymocytes, and a relative deficiency in the natural display of nucleosomal autoepitopes by thymic DC occurs in lupus-prone SNF1 mice.",M1

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay did not reveal the presence of mycobacteria in a lesional biopsy sample. Culture of biopsied tissue on Loewenstein-Jensen medium was negative. Although the tuberculosis culture and PCR did not confirm tuberculosis, a diagnosis of lupus vulgaris was made considering the clinical and histopathological findings.

Exposure to FB1 causes organ-specific diseases in various species, e.g., equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary edema; in mice the response is hepatotoxicity. We earlier reported that ceramide synthase inhibition by FB1, the initial biochemical effect of this mycotoxin, results in modulation of cytokine network in response to accumulated free sphingoid bases. In the current study we used NZB/NZW-F1 (NZBW) mice that have modified cytokine expression and develop lupus beginning at 5 months of age. The NZBW and C57BL/6J (CBL) mice (appropriate control) were given five daily subcutaneous injections of either saline or 2.25 mg FB1/kg/day and euthanized 24 h after the last treatment. Peripheral leukocyte counts were higher after exposure to FB1 in CBL but not in NZBW. FB1 treatment caused increases of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity in CBL mice indicating hepatotoxicity; no elevation of circulating liver enzymes was recorded in NZBW mice. Hepatotoxic responses were confirmed by microscopic evaluation of apoptotic cells. The FB1-induced proliferation of cells observed in CBL strain was abolished in NZBW animals. The sphinganine accumulation in liver after FB1 was equal in both strains of mice. The NZBW strain lacked the FB1-induced increases in the expression of liver tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, receptor interacting protein (RIP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), observed in CBL. Results confirmed our hypothesis that initial altered sphingolipid metabolism caused by FB1 leads to perturbation of liver cytokine network and ultimate cellular injury; the mice deficient in cytokine signaling are refractory to FB1 hepatotoxicity.",M1

In fact, the real origin and the treatment of this affection are unknown. In this study we try to specify the major histological and clinical points of diagnosis, the evolution in the mid-term and the different possibilities of the treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the patients diagnosed with lupus miliaris and followed-up by one of us (P.M.) between 1990 and 2000. RESULTS: There were 6 patients in this study, 5 males and 1 female. The mean age was 37 years old at the time of diagnosis. The patients exhibited a facial eruption, notably in the middle of the face, eyelids and peri-oral area. All the patients had a polymorph eruption of inflammatory and smooth papules. Many of these papules progressed in several weeks to round scars with a perpendicular carved shape. Histologically and depending of the stage of evolution of the lesion, there were some epithelioid cell and giant cell granulomas organized around the necrosis. All of the trial treatments led to failure or semi-failure. Four of the patients followed-up for several years spontaneously recovered from this disease within 2 to 4 years. DISCUSSION: Based on the anatomical and clinical similarities observed in these 6 patients, our study confirms the authenticity of the  lupus miliaris . It did not correspond to a particular form of acne, rosacea, tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The scars are pathognomonical of this type of eruption. No treatment seems to be efficient. However our study seems to confirm the general idea of spontaneous recovery with 2 to 4 years.",M1

In the present study, mice were fed either ad libitum or energy-restricted (a 40 % lower energy intake than the diet ad libitum), semi-purified diets containing 5 % maize oil or 5 % fish oil supplementation. To estimate the renal damage associated with oxidative stress, the total amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cyclooxygenase-derived ROS and levels of guanidino compounds were measured. Additionally, we assessed the putative action of ER and FO on several key antioxidant enzymes measured in the kidney post-mitochondrial fraction. Results showed that the age-related increase in creatinine level was significantly reduced by ER and FO in old mice. In contrast, arginine and guanidino acetic acid levels showed a decrease with age but were increased by ER and FO. The GSH:GSSG ratio showed a significant decrease with age, whereas ER and FO feeding prevented the decrease. The age-related decrease in antioxidant scavenging superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were all reversed by ER and FO. The moderately decreased glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase activities with age were significantly increased by ER and FO. Furthermore, the increased total ROS and cyclooxygenase-derived ROS levels were effectively reduced by ER and FO. In conclusion, our data strongly indicate that ER and FO maintain antioxidant status and GSH:GSSG ratio, thereby protecting against renal deterioration from oxidative insults during ageing.",M1
16011443,"Adalimumab: a review of side effects.Adalimumab (Humira) is a human monoclonal TNF-alpha antibody that blocks the effects of TNF-alpha. It is administered by subcutaneous injection. It has been approved alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the EU and US. Approval for its use for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is expected in the near future. Its side effect profile is favourable when compared with traditional systemic treatments for these diseases. It does not require laboratory monitoring. The most common side effects of adalimumab are injection site reactions. Adalimumab increases the risk of rare serious infections. There is a two-fold risk of serious infections with the use of adalimumab, as reported in the Premier trial. This risk should not be minimised in this way. It should not be used during periods of active infection. Its most notable infectious complication is the reactivation of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis screening should be according to country standards and may or may not include purified protein derivative test or chest X-ray. Deep fungal and other serious and atypical infection can also be promoted by adalimumab. It has been associated infrequently with skin rashes. Rare side effects include: worsening or initiation of congestive heart failure, a <e>lupus</e>-like syndrome, a promotion of lymphoma, medically significant cytopenias, and worsening or initiation of a multiple sclerosis/neurological disease. There has been reported pancytopenia and elevated transamines with the use of adalimumab, which suggest that laboratory monitoring blood counts and liver functions, at least intermittently, are useful. In patients with any of the foregoing problems, its use should be extremely carefully considered. Adalimumab is a useful medication which can be safely used if its side effects are recognised.",M1

This condition has always been believed to occur more commonly in dark-skinned patients; however, recent observations have revealed CGPD to occur also in white patients. OBSERVATION: We report an 11-year-old Japanese boy with the characteristic features of CGPD. Although sarcoidosis and acne/granulomatous rosacea could be differentiated from CGPD, we could find no essential differences between CGPD and lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (LMDF). The cases of LMDF in children, which were recorded in the Japanese literature, had highly similar clinicopathological features to those of CGPD. This case responded dramatically to topical tacrolimus in combination with the oral administration of minocycline. CONCLUSIONS: The entity 'facial idiopathic granulomas with regressive evolution' is considered to include LMDF (a common adult form), CGPD (a rare childhood form) and perioral dermatitis (a peculiar form exacerbated by topical corticosteroids). Topical tacrolimus may be recommended as one of the therapies for LMDF as well as CGPD.",M1
15968469,"The therapeutic potential of tumor necrosis factor for autoimmune disease: a mechanistically based hypothesis.Excess levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been associated with certain autoimmune diseases. Under the rationale that elevated TNF-alpha levels are deleterious, several anti-TNF-alpha therapies are now available to block the action of TNF-alpha in patients with autoimmune diseases with a chronic inflammatory component to the destructive process. TNF-alpha antagonists have provided clinical benefit to many patients, but their use also is accompanied by new or aggravated forms of autoimmunity. Here we propose a mechanistically based hypothesis for the adverse events observed with TNF-alpha antagonists, and argue for the opposite therapeutic strategy: to boost or restore TNF-alpha activity as a treatment for some forms of autoimmunity. Activation defects in the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB leave autoreactive T cells sensitive to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Treatment with TNF-alpha, by destroying autoreactive T cells, appears to be a highly targeted strategy to interrupt the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, <e>lupus</e> and certain forms of autoimmunity.",M1

20559388,"TLR recognition of self nucleic acids hampers glucocorticoid activity in <e>lupus</e>.Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, regimens used to treat many such conditions cannot maintain disease control in the majority of SLE patients and more aggressive approaches such as high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy are used to provide transient reductions in disease activity. The primary anti-inflammatory mechanism of glucocorticoids is thought to be NF-kappaB inhibition. Recognition of self nucleic acids by toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9 on B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) is an important step in the pathogenesis of SLE, promoting anti-nuclear antibodies and the production of type I interferon (IFN), both correlated with the severity of disease. Following their activation by self-nucleic acid-associated immune complexes, PDCs migrate to the tissues. We demonstrate, in vitro and in vivo, that stimulation of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 can account for the reduced activity of glucocorticoids to inhibit the IFN pathway in SLE patients and in two lupus-prone mouse strains. The triggering of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 by nucleic acid-containing immune complexes or by synthetic ligands activates the NF-kappaB pathway essential for PDC survival. Glucocorticoids do not affect NF-kappaB activation in PDCs, preventing glucocorticoid induction of PDC death and the consequent reduction of systemic IFN-alpha levels. These findings unveil a new role for self nucleic acid recognition by TLRs and indicate that inhibitors of TLR7 and 9 signalling could prove to be effective corticosteroid-sparing drugs.",M2

BACKGROUND: Autoantibody-positive mothers are frequently referred for serial echocardiography because of the elevated fetal risk of developing immune-mediated heart block. Little is known why only some and not all offspring are affected. METHODS: All cases referred since 2000 for serial fetal echocardiography or cardiac complications related to maternal antibodies were included. Patients without cardiac NLE (group 1) and with cardiac NLE (group 2) were compared. Antibody levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a cutoff value of 8 U/ml for a positive test result. RESULTS: Group 1 included 146 serially screened fetuses with normal pregnancy outcomes. Group 2 consisted of 40 fetuses/neonates with a diagnosis of heart block or endocardial fibroelastosis or both, and included 4 fetuses diagnosed during serial screening. All cardiac complications were associated with moderate (&gt;or=50 U/ml; 15%) or high (&gt;or=100 U/ml; 85%) maternal anti-Ro levels, independently of anti-La antibody titres. The event rate of complete heart block was 5% for prospectively screened fetuses with Ro-values &gt;or=50 U/ml (odds ratio: 7.8) and 0% for fetuses with lower titres (p &lt; 0.0001). Infants with pre-natal exposure to high-titre anti-La levels &gt;or=100 U/ml were the most likely to have noncardiac features of NLE (event rate: 57%; odds ratio: 4.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that the amount of maternal antibodies, rather than their presence, is associated with fetal tissue injury. As anti-Ro levels correlate with the risk of cardiac complications, serial echocardiography should be limited to women with high anti-Ro-titres.",M2

METHODS: Data derived from 755 adult participants from the 2004 to 2007 Lupus Outcomes Study (LOS) resulted in a sample of 2,926 repeated-measures observations. The outcome measure was the number of physician visits in the prior 12 months. Information on disease activity and manifestations, demographics, health insurance, and specialty of the participants' main SLE physician was collected through yearly LOS interviews. Local area measures including neighborhood poverty, the number of subspecialists per capita, and hospital market areas were added from secondary data sources. We used a mixed model with repeated measures to estimate the number of physician visits for SLE by SES and health care access characteristics, as well as the extent of concentrated poverty and number of subspecialists per capita in the local community, and whether these relationships varied by specific hospital market area. Multivariate models were adjusted for demographic and health status covariates. RESULTS: LOS respondents reported a mean +/- SD of 11.8 +/- 10.7 (range 0-52) physician visits for SLE. After adjustment, having less than a high school education, receiving care in a health maintenance organization, being treated by a generalist, and living in a community of concentrated poverty were associated with a significantly lower number of physician visits for SLE. These relationships varied by hospital market areas.

METHODS: Clinical data, including comorbidities, were recorded yearly. Vascular events were recorded and attributed to atherosclerosis or not. All of the events met standard clinical criteria. Factors associated with atherosclerotic vascular events were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square tests. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of factors with vascular events attributed to atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Since 2000, 1,249 patients have been entered into the cohort. There have been 97 vascular events in 72 patients, including: myocardial infarction (n = 13), angina (n = 15), congestive heart failure (n = 24), peripheral vascular disease (n = 8), transient ischemic attack (n = 13), stroke (n = 23), and pacemaker insertion (n = 1). Fifty of the events were attributed to active lupus, 31 events in 22 patients were attributed to atherosclerosis, and 16 events were attributed to other causes. The mean +/- SD time from diagnosis to the first atherosclerotic event was 2.0 +/- 1.5 years. Compared with patients followed for 2 years without atherosclerotic events (n = 615), at enrollment, patients with atherosclerotic vascular events were more frequently white, men, older at diagnosis of SLE, obese, smokers, hypertensive, and had a family history of coronary artery disease. On multivariate analysis, only male sex and older age at diagnosis were associated factors. CONCLUSION: In an inception cohort with SLE followed for up to 8 years, there were 97 vascular events, but only 31 were attributable to atherosclerosis. Patients with atherosclerotic events were more likely to be men and to be older at diagnosis of SLE.",M2

METHODS: Pediatric rheumatologists answered 2 Delphi questionnaires to achieve consensus on a common definition of juvenile SLE flare and identify variables for use in candidate flare criteria. The diagnostic accuracy of these candidate flare criteria was tested with data from juvenile SLE patients (n = 98; 623 visits total). Physician-rated change in the juvenile SLE course (worsening, yes/no) between visits served as the criterion standard. RESULTS: There was 96% consensus that a  a flare is a measurable worsening of juvenile SLE disease activity in at least one organ system, involving new or worse signs of disease that may be accompanied by new or worse SLE symptoms. Depending on the severity of the flare, more intensive therapy may be required.  Variables suggested for use in flare criteria were: physician-rated disease activity (V1), patient well-being, protein:creatinine ratio, a validated disease activity index (V2), the Child Health Questionnaire physical summary score (V3), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complement levels. Using multiple logistic regression, several candidate flare criteria were derived with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as high as 0.92 (sensitivity &gt;or=85%, specificity &gt;or=85%); classification and regression tree analysis suggested that V1, V2, and V3 suffice to identify juvenile SLE flares (AUC 0.81; sensitivity = 64%, specificity = 86%).

However, there have been limited demographic data on which to base recommendations for screening. We have studied the largest unselected series of patients to date to evaluate the risk of toxicity and the relevance of purported risk factors. METHODS: We studied 3,995 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus who had used HCQ, including 1,538 current users. We screened for self-reported toxicity, and followed up on positive cases with detailed interviews and specialist confirmation. We categorized cases as  definite or probable  if there was bull's eye maculopathy or visual field loss. RESULTS: Of the lifetime users of HCQ, 6.5% discontinued therapy because of an eye problem, including 1.8% who reported HCQ retinal problems. However, definite or probable toxicity was documented in only 0.65% (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.93). The risk of toxicity was low in the initial 7 years of exposure, and was approximately 5 times greater after 7 years of usage (or 1,000 gm total exposure). Toxicity was unrelated to age, weight, or daily dosage. Eye examinations were obtained annually by 50.5% and every 6 months by 40.4% of patients. CONCLUSION: HCQ toxicity remains uncommon, but increases markedly with the duration of therapy and exceeds 1% after 5-7 years. Toxicity was unassociated with age, daily dosage, or weight.

So, the SLE, as an autoimmune disease, is certainly related to disorders caused by activation of complement system, that finally leads to tissue damage. It may also be caused by hereditary deficiency (complement genes mutations). In such case, some components of the complement system might be inactivated. There are mutations that cause disorders in each of three complement system activation pathways (classical, alternative and lectin).The serum samples of SLE patients show the presence of specific autoantibodies for some complement components. Today, for clinical management of SLE patients, determination of level of C1q-CIC and C3 complement component in serum specimens have great diagnostic and therapeutic importance. During the year 2000, we analyzed a numerous serum samples from patients suspected to autoimmune diseases (SLE especially). The samples were collected from several clinics in the Clinical Center of University of Sarajevo, mostly from Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine and Gastroenterohepatology Clinic.

We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn(-/-) mice). Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis. Basophils were also present in the lymph nodes and spleen of subjects with SLE.

The prevalence of rheumatic diseases may change over time, and therefore, we sought to estimate the prevalence of rheumatic diseases in an adult population of central Greece. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional population survey, a random sample of adult population was drawn from poll catalogues of a region in central Greece. A postal questionnaire was sent to 3,528 people for the presence of any rheumatic disease. All positive cases were further confirmed by clinical examination using the American College of Rheumatoloy criteria. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for rheumatic diseases. RESULTS: The response rate was 48.3% (1,705 answers). Four hundred and twenty individuals (24.6%) had a rheumatic disease. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was 0.58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.87), of psoriatic arthritis was 0.35% (95% CI, 0.33-1.13), of ankylosing spondylitis was 0.29% (95% CI, 0.28-0.94), of primary Sjögren's syndrome was 0.23% (95% CI, 0.22-0.75) and of systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus was 0.11% (95% CI, 0.11-0.37).

20500682,"Primary immunodeficiency and autoimmunity: lessons from human diseases.Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are a genetically heterogenous group of &gt;150 disorders that affect distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system and are often associated with autoimmune diseases. We describe PID affecting T-regulatory cells, complement and B cells or their products and discuss the possibility of a cause-effect relationship. The high concordance of T-regulatory cell defects to organ-specific autoimmune disease implies an obligatory role of these cells in maintaining tolerance to epithelial and endocrine tissues; the absence of central nervous system involvement may reflect immunological privilege. Congenital defects in C1q, C1r/s and C4 are strongly associated with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE), and this pattern along with laboratory evidence suggests a major importance of classical pathway activity in safe elimination of immune complexes and prevention of immune complex disease (ICD). It is debatable whether this ICD is to be regarded as an autoimmune disease (resulting from a breakdown of immunological ignorance to antigens that are normally hidden), as autoantibodies may be absent, and tissue damage because of deposition of immune complexes could account for all of the pathology observed. Evidence for a causative link between primary antibody deficiencies and autoimmune disease is much less compelling and may in fact involve a common genetic background. However, arguments have also been made in favour of the notion that an intense antigen load as a result of recurrent or persistent infections may affect either tolerance or ignorance, e.g. by molecular mimicry or the presence of superantigens. Similar immunological mechanisms might account for the vast majority of autoimmune diseases.",M2

20483768,"African-derived genetic polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 mediate risk for autoimmunity.The TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) is an ubiquitin-modifying enzyme and an essential negative regulator of inflammation. Genome-wide association studies have implicated the TNFAIP3 locus in susceptibility to autoimmune disorders in European cohorts, including rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, psoriasis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE). There are two nonsynonymous coding polymorphisms in the deubiquitinating (DUB) domain of TNFAIP3: F127C, which is in high-linkage disequilibrium with reported SLE-risk variants, and A125V, which has not been previously studied. We conducted a case-control study in African-American SLE patients using these coding variants, along with tagging polymorphisms in TNFAIP3, and identified a novel African-derived risk haplotype that is distinct from previously reported risk variants (odds ratio=1.6, p=0.006). In addition, a rare protective haplotype was defined by A125V (odds ratio=0.31, p=0.027). Although A125V was associated with protection from SLE, surprisingly the same allele was associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. We tested the functional activity of nonsynonymous coding polymorphisms within TNFAIP3, and found that the A125V coding-change variant alters the DUB activity of the protein. Finally, we used computer modeling to depict how the A125V amino acid change in TNFAIP3 may affect the three-dimensional structure of the DUB domain to a greater extent than F127C. This is the first report of an association between TNFAIP3 polymorphisms and autoimmunity in African-Americans.",M2
20483747,"MicroRNA-21 and microRNA-148a contribute to DNA hypomethylation in <e>lupus</e> CD4+ T cells by directly and indirectly targeting DNA methyltransferase 1.Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease caused by genetic and epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation abnormalities play an important role in systemic lupus erythematosus disease processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including human lupus. Whereas previous studies have shown miRNAs can regulate DNA methylation by targeting the DNA methylation machinery, the role of miRNAs in aberrant CD4+ T cell DNA hypomethylation of lupus is unclear. In this study, by using high-throughput microRNA profiling, we identified that two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-148a) overexpressed in CD4+ T cells from both patients with lupus and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, which promote cell hypomethylation by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. This in turn leads to the overexpression of autoimmune-associated methylation-sensitive genes, such as CD70 and LFA-1, via promoter demethylation. Further experiments revealed that miR-21 indirectly downregulated DNMT1 expression by targeting an important autoimmune gene, RASGRP1, which mediated the Ras-MAPK pathway upstream of DNMT1; miR-148a directly downregulated DNMT1 expression by targeting the protein coding region of its transcript. Additionally, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-148a expression in CD4+ T cells from patients with lupus could increase DNMT1 expression and attenuate DNA hypomethylation. Together, our data demonstrated a critical functional link between miRNAs and the aberrant DNA hypomethylation in lupus CD4+ T cells and could help to develop new therapeutic approaches.",M2
20483718,"<e>Lupus</e> serum IgG induces skin inflammation through the TNFR1 signaling pathway.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by high autoantibody levels and multiorgan tissue damage, including kidney and skin. Cutaneous manifestations are frequent in patients with SLE, yet the etiology and pathogenesis of skin injury in SLE remains unclear. We reasoned that lupus serum containing high levels of autoreactive Ig contributes to skin injury. In this article, we report that serum from SLE patients and lupus-prone mice induces skin inflammation following intradermal injection into normal mice. Lupus serum depleted of IgG failed to cause skin inflammation. Monocytes, but not lymphocytes, were found to be crucial in the development of lupus serum-induced skin inflammation, and lupus serum IgG induced monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs). TNF-alpha and TNFR1, but not TNFR2, were required for the development of lupus serum-induced skin inflammation. TNFR1, not TNFR2, represented the main molecule expressed in the skin lesions caused by injected lupus serum. Our studies demonstrated that lupus serum IgG causes skin injury by involving the TNFR1 signaling pathway and monocyte differentiation to DCs. Accordingly, disruption of the TNFR1-mediated signaling pathway and blockade of DC generation may prove to be of therapeutic value in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus.",M2
20481272,"Microembolic signals in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.INTRODUCTION: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a common and less understood aspect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Microembolic signals (MES) have been reported in SLE. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the frequency of MES among patients with CNS involvement and those without. The main aim of the study is to clarify the pathophysiology of the CNS involvement in SLE. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty eight patients with a diagnosis of SLE (60 females, 8 males) participated in the study. Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored using transcranial Doppler for 60 min to detect MES. All cases underwent neurology and psychiatry assessments. RESULTS: MES were detected in 7/68 patients (10.3%) with the mean number of 3.5 per hour. MES were significantly higher in patients with CNS involvement (6/24, 25%) than those without (1/44, 2.2%) (P=0.006). SLE disease activity index, duration of disease, plaque formation, intima-media thickness, and antiphospholipid antibodies were not associated with MES. MES were more frequent in patients receiving Aspirin and/or Warfarin (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MES may be a predictor for CNS involvement in SLE patients at risk for neuropsychiatric syndromes. Cerebral embolism may be implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric SLE.",M2
20479222,"Contribution of IRF5 in B cells to the development of murine SLE-like disease through its transcriptional control of the IgG2a locus.Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 5 is a key transcription factor for the activation of innate immune responses downstream of Toll-like receptor signaling. Based on recent genetic analyses, IRF5 is a focus for its potential involvement in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE), although how IRF5 contributes to SLE is uncertain. In this study, we demonstrate a requirement for IRF5 in the development of murine SLE via its role in B lymphocytes. We show that antinuclear autoantibodies and Ig glomerular deposits, hallmarks of SLE, are absent in Irf5(-/-) mice challenged to develop SLE by pristane injection. In particular, production of autoantibodies of the IgG2a subtype, the most prominent isotype in inducing autoimmunity, requires IRF5. Finally, we provide evidence for the critical role of this transcription factor in the secretion of pathogenic antibodies through its direct control of class switch recombination of the gamma2a locus. By demonstrating a B-cell-intrinsic role, this study places IRF5 in a context that may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of human SLE.",M2

20439745,"Impairment of neutrophil extracellular trap degradation is associated with <e>lupus</e> nephritis.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which patients develop autoantibodies to DNA, histones, and often to neutrophil proteins. These form immune complexes that are pathogenic and may cause lupus nephritis. In SLE patients, infections can initiate flares and are a major cause of mortality. Neutrophils respond to infections and release extracellular traps (NETs), which are antimicrobial and are made of DNA, histones, and neutrophil proteins. The timely removal of NETs may be crucial for tissue homeostasis to avoid presentation of self-antigens. We tested the hypothesis that SLE patients cannot clear NETs, contributing to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. Here we show that serum endonuclease DNase1 is essential for disassembly of NETs. Interestingly, a subset of SLE patients' sera degraded NETs poorly. Two mechanisms caused this impaired NET degradation: (i) the presence of DNase1 inhibitors or (ii) anti-NET antibodies prevented DNase1 access to NETs. Impairment of DNase1 function and failure to dismantle NETs correlated with kidney involvement. Hence, identification of SLE patients who cannot dismantle NETs might be a useful indicator of renal involvement. Moreover, NETs might represent a therapeutic target in SLE.",M2
20439539,"Invariant NKT cells limit activation of autoreactive CD1d-positive B cells.Faulty activation of autoreactive B cells is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases like systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE). An important feature restricting activation of autoreactive B cells is efficient removal of apoptotic material. Mounting evidence also connects a primary defect in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells to autoimmune disease development. However, exactly how this unconventional T cell subset is involved remains to be defined. Here, we identify a suppressive role for iNKT cells in a model where autoantibody production is triggered by an increased load of circulating apoptotic cells, resembling the situation in SLE patients. Absence or reduction of iNKT cells as well as absence of CD1d-expression on B cells, needed for direct iNKT-B cell interaction, leads to increased autoreactive B cell activation and symptoms of disease. The suppression mediated by the iNKT cells is observed before B cell entry into germinal centers and can be rescued by transferring iNKT cells to deficient mice. This links iNKT cells to handling of dying cells and identifies a novel peripheral tolerance checkpoint relevant for autoimmune disease. Thus, these observations connect two clinical observations in SLE patients previously considered to be unrelated and define a new target for immunotherapy.",M2

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether low serum vitamin D concentrations are related to disease activity of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: 378 patients from several European and Israeli cohorts were pooled and their disease activity was measured by two different methods: 278 patients had SLE disease activity-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 100 patients had European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scores. In order to combine the two systems the scores were converted into standardised values (z-scores), enabling univariate summary statistics for the two variables (SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM). The commercial kit, LIAISON 25-OH vitamin D assay (310900-Diasorin) was used to measure serum concentration of 25-OH vitamin D in 378 patients with SLE. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was demonstrated between the serum concentration of vitamin D and the standardised values (z-scores) of disease activity scores as measured by the SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM scales (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=-0.12, p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with SLE originating from Israel and Europe vitamin D serum concentrations were found to be inversely related to disease activity.",M2
20438730,"Comparison between multiplex assays for autoantibody detection in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.The performance of immunoassays for the detection of autoantibodies is of critical importance to the diagnosis and assessment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our objective was to compare 3 multiplexed assays for measurement of multiple autoantibodies and their association with global disease activity, active nephritis and cumulative organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Stored sera, clinical and laboratory data from the enrollment visit of a long-term lupus registry were used. Autoantibodies were measured using the BioPlex 2200 ANA screen (Bio-Rad), QuantaPlex ENA8 (INOVA Diagnostics) and recomLine ANA/ENA (Mikrogen). The analytes included dsDNA, chromatin, ribosomal P protein, SS-A/Ro60, Ro52, SS-B/La, Sm, U1-RNP, centromere B, topoisomerase 1 and Jo-1 (histidyl tRNA synthetase). Global SLE disease activity was measured by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and cumulative organ damage by the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI). One hundred ninety two patients (87% female; 91% Caucasian; mean disease duration 8.8years) were studied. Agreement between the 3 assays varied from 70% to 99% (Cohen's kappa: 0.04-0.88). There were significant associations between SLEDAI scores (excluding anti-dsDNA) and ANA (INOVA, Mikrogen), anti-dsDNA (Bio-Rad, Mikrogen), anti-chromatin (Bio-Rad, INOVA), anti-Ro (Mikrogen), anti-Sm and anti-U1-RNP (all 3 immunoassays) (p=0.002-0.05). Concurrent lupus nephritis was associated with anti-dsDNA (Bio-Rad (p=0.017) or Bio-Rad and Mikrogen together (p=0.015)). There was no significant association between autoantibodies and SDI scores. The overall agreement between assays for the detection of autoantibodies was reasonable. The greatest discordance (70-83%) occurred with those autoantibodies most strongly associated with global SLE disease activity (ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-chromatin and anti-Sm). Furthermore, there were differences between assays in their associations with global SLE disease activity and lupus nephritis.",M2
20436082,"Hydroxychloroquine and glycemia in women with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between current hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use and 2 indicators of glycemic control, fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, in nondiabetic women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Nondiabetic women with SLE (n = 149) or RA (n = 177) recruited between 2000 and 2005 for a cross-sectional evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors were characterized by HCQ usage status. Unadjusted and multivariately adjusted mean fasting glucose, median insulin, and insulin resistance [assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) calculation] were compared among HCQ users and nonusers for disease-specific groups. RESULTS: More women with SLE were taking HCQ than those with RA (48% vs 18%; p &lt; 0.0001; mean dose ~ 400 mg vs ~ 200 mg). For women with SLE or RA, after adjustment for age, waist circumference, disease duration, prednisone dosage, C-reactive protein, menopausal status, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and disease-specific indicators, serum glucose was lower in HCQ users than in nonusers (SLE: 85.9 vs 89.3 mg/dl, p = 0.04; RA: 82.5 vs 86.6 mg/dl, p = 0.05). In women with SLE, HCQ use also was associated with lower (log)HOMA-IR (0.97 vs 1.12, p = 0.09); in those with RA, no differences in (log)HOMA-IR were seen. HCQ usage was not associated with fasting insulin levels in either patient group. CONCLUSION: HCQ use was associated with lower fasting glucose in women with SLE or RA and also lower (log)HOMA-IR in the SLE group. The use of HCQ may be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk by improving glycemic control in these patients.",M2
20435933,"Identification and characterization of a <e>lupus</e> suppressor 129 locus on chromosome 3.The 129-derived Sle16 is a susceptibility locus for systemic autoimmunity when present on the C57BL/6 (B6) background. Genetic analysis of a (129xB6)F2 cross identified a region from the B6 chromosome 3 (Sle18) with positive linkage to antinuclear Abs. In this study, we have generated a B6 congenic strain harboring the 129 allele of Sle18 and intercrossed this line with the lupus-prone B6.129-Sle16 strain. The presence of the 129-Sle18 allele in the B6.129-Sle16Sle18 double congenic mice suppressed the development of Sle16-mediated autoantibody production and ameliorated the renal pathology. The 129-Sle18 locus rectified the B cell abnormalities detected in the B6.129-Sle16 mice, such as the reduction in the percentage of marginal zone B and B1a cells and the increased number of germinal centers. The B6.129-Sle16Sle18 spleens still displayed an increased percentage of activated T and B cells. However, in the B6.129-Sle16Sle18 strain the percentage of naive T cells was equivalent to that in B6.129-Sle18 and B6 mice and these cells showed a reduced proliferative response to anti-CD3 stimulation compared with B6.129-Sle16 T cells. There was a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+)FoxP3(+)regulatory T cells in all congenic strains. These cells had normal regulatory function when tested in vitro. Thus, 129-Sle18 represents a novel, non-MHC lupus-suppressor locus probably operating as a functional modifier of B cells that, in combination with other factors, leads to lupus resistance. Further characterization of this locus will help to uncover the immune mechanism(s) conferring protection against lupus.",M2
20433772,"Increased concentration of two different advanced glycation end-products detected by enzyme immunoassays with new monoclonal antibodies in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: Levels of pentosidine (representative of advanced glycation end-products) in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are increased when compared with sera of other diagnoses or healthy controls. These levels have been reported to correlate with clinical indices of rheumatoid arthritis activity and with laboratory markers of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to find out if these findings pertain to other advanced glycation end-products. METHODS: We have developed two immunoassays based on new monoclonal antibodies to advanced glycation end-products. Antibody 103-E3 reacts with an unidentified antigen, formed in the reaction of proteins with ribose, while antibody 8-C1 responds to Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl)lysine. We have used these monoclonal antibodies to measure levels of advanced glycation end-products in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus, osteoarthritis, and healthy controls. We calculated the correlations between advanced glycation end-product levels in rheumatoid arthritis sera and the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), age, disease duration, CRP, anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor and treatment with corticosteroids, respectively. RESULTS: Levels of both glycation products were significantly higher in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis when compared with sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, or the healthy controls. Neither the level of Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl)lysine nor the level of the 103-E3 antigen in rheumatoid arthritis sera correlated with the DAS28-scored rheumatoid arthritis activity. The levels of both antigens in rheumatoid arthritis sera did not correlate with age, gender, corticosteroid treatment, or levels of CRP, anti-CCP antibodies, and rheumatoid factor in sera. CONCLUSIONS: We report highly specific increases in the levels of two advanced glycation end-products in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This increase could be explained neither by rheumatoid arthritis activity nor by inflammation. We propose a working hypothesis that presumes the existence of a link between advanced glycation end-product formation and induction of autoimmunity.",M2

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether T-bet gene (TBX21) polymorphisms or its haplotypes are associated with SLE in a Chinese population. METHODS: The study included 248 cases with SLE and 261 gender- and age-matched healthy controls. The polymorphisms T-1993C (rs4794067) and T-1514C (rs17250932) in the TBX21 promoter were identified by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. RESULTS: The frequency of both the -1993T and the -1514T allele were significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls. By haplotype analysis, there was significantly decreased frequency of the haplotype at positions -1993C/-1514C in the case group compared with the control group (p = 0.0002). Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that individuals with CC/CC haplotype homozygotes had a decreased susceptibility to SLE [p = 0.0004, odds ratio (OR) 0.316, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.167-0.599].

METHOD: Thiol groups and MDA-protein adducts were first assessed among 65 SLE patients and 60 healthy controls. Then, the reactivities of SLE immunoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies towards MDA-modified and unmodified proteins were compared using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: An increase in the levels of MDA-modified proteins and a decrease in the concentration of thiol groups among SLE patients (p &lt; 0.05) were observed. IgG circulating autoantibodies in the sera of SLE patients exhibited a significant enhanced reactivity (p &lt; 0.05) against catalase and SOD-modified proteins. The same data were observed in the different protein fractions extracted from cultured cells (p &lt; 0.05).

20427764,"Blockade of Notch1 signaling alleviates murine <e>lupus</e> via blunting macrophage activation and M2b polarization.Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are found to be accompanied with innate immunity dysregulation including abnormally macrophage activation. But the functional polarization of the activated macrophages and its underlying molecular mechanism during the pathogenesis of SLE remains unknown. As an important local cellular interaction mechanism responsible for cell fate determination, Notch signaling is reported to exert crucial functions in the development and differentiation of various immunocytes, whereas its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. In this study, in the SLE murine model generated by immunization with activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA), infiltrated macrophages in the nephritic tissues were found to exhibit activation and M2b functional polarization. Notch1 signaling activity was significantly upregulated in the ALD-DNA-induced M2b macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ALD-DNA-induced M2b polarization was found to be dependent on enhanced Notch1 signaling through accelerating NF-kappaB p50 translocation into the nucleus mediated by PI3K and MAPK pathways. Moreover, blockade of Notch1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment before or after the disease initiation could ameliorate murine lupus through impeding macrophage M2b polarization. Our results implied that Notch1 signaling-dependent macrophage M2b polarization might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE, which could provide Notch1 signaling blockade as a potential therapeutic approach for SLE disease.",M2

20422909,"Cardiac autonomic dysfunction in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e>, rheumatoid arthritis and sudden death risk.INTRODUCTION: The manifestations of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in autoimmune diseases have been the subject of many studies. However, the published results pertaining to such research are controversial. Sudden cardiac death due to fatal arrhythmias is frequent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE: To analyse risk predictors of sudden cardiac death related to the degree of autonomic dysfunction. METHODS: We performed cardiovascular ANS assessment in 90 patients in this case-controlled study, including 52 (6 male, 46 female) patients with SLE, 38 (6 male, 32 female) with RA and 41 (23 male, 17 female) healthy subjects. The methodology included a comprehensive ECG analysis (with Schiller software AT-10) of QTc interval, late potentials, short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and nonlinear HRV (Poincare plot) analysis; 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring with ECG QTc interval analysis, HRV analysis; 24-hour blood pressure monitoring with systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability; cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (according to Ewing). Vagal dysfunction was established by performing 3 tests: Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing test and heart rate response to standing test. Dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system was examined by applying 2 tests: blood pressure response to standing and handgrip test. RESULTS: In all cardiovascular reflex tests, the frequencies of abnormal results were significantly higher among the patients than among the healthy subjects. Severe autonomic dysfunction was more common in RA. QTc interval was more prolonged in patients with SLE. Both diseases were associated with depressed heart rate variability compared to controls, the reduction being greater in RA patients. In the patients with SLE, autonomic dysfunction is predominantly with higher sympathetic activity while in RA vagal predominance is evident. CONCLUSION: SLE and RA are associated with severe autonomic dysfunction and the presence of significant risk predictors related to the onset of sudden cardiac death.",M2

This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between dysregulated IFN-I production and the presence of depression or fatigue in lupus patients. Through cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis we found no significant correlation between abnormal IFN-I levels (as measured by peripheral blood expression of IFN-I-stimulated genes) and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Elevation of endogenous serum IFN-I levels is unlikely to account for the depression and fatigue associated with SLE.",M2

When she was diagnosed as SLE 5 years earlier, her renal function was normal and her urine protein excretion was 0.15 g/day. Renal biopsy revealed class V lupus nephritis, and she was treated with intravenous steroid (1 g methylprednisolone per day) for 3 days. The prednisolone dose was then reduced from 30 mg/day to 5 mg/day and maintained at that level until she was admitted to our hospital. Her abdominal X-ray, and CT scan showed massive ascites and excessive colonic gas. She was diagnosed as having ileus resulting from lupus peritonitis. The dose of prednisolone was increased up to 50 mg/day. After 1 week, the ascites disappeared and serum albumin and complement levels, lymphocyte count, and urine protein level returned to the normal range. When the prednisolone dose was reduced to 40 mg, however, UCG and an abdominal CT scan revealed thrombus in her right atrium, and inferior vena cava. Urokinase, argatroban and heparin were administered intravenously and warfarin was administered thereafter. Her thrombus gradually disappeared and she was discharged.

We report a case of biopsy-proven lupus vasculopathy, with lupus nephritis class IV-G (A). She developed SLE at 15 years of age, and was treated with prednisolone(PSL) and cyclophosphamide (CTX). Sometimes she experienced a flare-up clinically or serologically, requiring a dose increase of oral PSL.

Renal biopsy findings showed the glomerular changes of lupus nephritis, WHO class IV-G (A), and lupus vasculopathy, which is marked luminal narrowing or total occlusion by abundant subendothelial accumulation of immunoglobulins and complement components. In addition to PSL, intravenous pulse CTX promptly achieved clinical remission. When lupus vasculopathy is complicated, CTX may be useful.",M2
20414206,"FcgammaRIIB in autoimmunity and infection: evolutionary and therapeutic implications.FcgammaRIIB is the only inhibitory Fc receptor. It controls many aspects of immune and inflammatory responses, and variation in the gene encoding this protein has long been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune disease, particularly systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE). FcgammaRIIB is also involved in the complex regulation of defence against infection. A loss-of-function polymorphism in FcgammaRIIB protects against severe malaria, the investigation of which is beginning to clarify the evolutionary pressures that drive ethnic variation in autoimmunity. Our increased understanding of the function of FcgammaRIIB also has potentially far-reaching therapeutic implications, being involved in the mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulin, controlling the efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy and providing a direct therapeutic target.",M2
20410000,"[Novel therapeutic possibilities in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus]Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder involving different organs and organ systems with consequent characteristic clinical and serologic symptoms. Despite of the improvement in lupus survival, approximately 10-20% of patients do not respond to traditional immune suppressive therapies. Relapses are more frequent; e.g. after cyclophosphamide therapy diffuse proliferative nephritis flares in 1/3 of patients. Different immune competent cells and inflammatory mediators participate in the pathogenesis of SLE involving both the adaptive and innate immunity. Several pathogenic elements and mechanisms may serve as therapeutic targets, consequently. Authors summarize novel therapeutic possibilities and their mechanisms regarding the pathogenesis of SLE. Immune modulation of B and T cells, co-stimulatory pathways, cytokine network, soluble mediators and autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation are discussed.",M2
20400961,"A CD8+ T cell transcription signature predicts prognosis in autoimmune disease.Autoimmune diseases are common and debilitating, but their severe manifestations could be reduced if biomarkers were available to allow individual tailoring of potentially toxic immunosuppressive therapy. Gene expression-based biomarkers facilitating such tailoring of chemotherapy in cancer, but not autoimmunity, have been identified and translated into clinical practice. We show that transcriptional profiling of purified CD8(+) T cells, which avoids the confounding influences of unseparated cells, identifies two distinct subject subgroups predicting long-term prognosis in two autoimmune diseases, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a chronic, severe disease characterized by inflammation of medium-sized and small blood vessels, and systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE), characterized by autoantibodies, immune complex deposition and diverse clinical manifestations ranging from glomerulonephritis to neurological dysfunction. We show that the subset of genes defining the poor prognostic group is enriched for genes involved in the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) pathway and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and those expressed by memory T cells. Furthermore, the poor prognostic group is associated with an expanded CD8(+) T cell memory population. These subgroups, which are also found in the normal population and can be identified by measuring expression of only three genes, raise the prospect of individualized therapy and suggest new potential therapeutic targets in autoimmunity.",M2

20398025,"Cerebral lesions in patients with connective tissue diseases and systemic vasculitides: are there specific patterns?This study was performed to evaluate whether specific patterns of cerebral lesions can be identified in different rheumatic disease entities. In 132 patients with different connective tissue diseases and vasculitides (systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus [SLE], systemic sclerosis [SSc], mixed connective tissue disease [MCTD], Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], immunocomplex vasculitides, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS]), cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed. Patients were examined clinically, and laboratory parameters including autoantibodies were determined. Distinct distibution patterns could be identified; in WG, most lesions were seen in the cortex, the periventricular region, basal ganglia, and pons. In both SSc and MCTD, highest numbers of lesions could be detected in the corticomedullary junction. In APS, basal ganglia and periventricular white matter were involved predominantly. Generally, the maximum score of cerebral lesions correlated significantly with patients' age. Pathological values for antinuclear antibodies and increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly correlated with the presence of cerebral lesions. WG patients and patients with other vasculitides most frequently showed neurological abnormalities. This study in patients with different rheumatic diseases showed distinct distribution patterns of cerebral lesions, which might help to differentiate between them.",M2
20398006,"The immunomodulatory effects of estrogens: clinical relevance in immune-mediated rheumatic diseases.Immunological, epidemiological, and clinical evidence suggest that female sex hormones play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of chronic immune/inflammatory diseases. Several significant factors generate confusion and opposite conclusions in evaluating the role of estrogens in these diseases, including relatively superficial translational studies from animals to the human condition, the different effects of estrogens on their different receptors or on different target cells, the different estrogen concentrations employed, and opposite effects (especially on cell proliferation) exerted by different peripheral estrogen metabolites. A preponderance of 16alpha-hydroxylated estrogens, as observed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluids, is an unfavorable sign in synovial inflammation. Since 17beta-estradiol administered during hormone replacement therapy will rapidly increase estrone sulfate after conversion in adipose tissue by aromatases, hormone replacement therapy can have proinflammatory effects by providing estrone sulfate to the inflamed synovial tissue. In addition, it appears that the use of combined oral contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of at least systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus. In conclusion, estrogens are generally considered as enhancers of cell proliferation and humoral immune response.",M2

Afobazole treatment (30-60 mg/day for 1 month) in addition to standard therapy decreased spontaneous level of DNA damage in blood cells. The level of ex vivo hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage decreased by 49% in this group of patients. The number of cells hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide yielding DNA comets with highly damaged DNA also decreased by 51%. No significant changes in the analyzed parameters were found in the placebo group.

We examined if the incidence of ESRD due to SLE was higher in geographic areas with poorer access to care. METHODS: In this population-based ecological study, we tested associations between the incidence of ESRD due to SLE and the proportion of hospitalizations with no insurance, Medicaid or managed care insurance, residence in a primary care-provider shortage area or rural area, and rate of hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, by ZIP code in California in 1999-2004. RESULTS: The incidence of ESRD due to SLE was higher in ZIP codes with higher proportions of hospitalizations with no insurance (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.0001) or Medicaid (r = 0.21, p &lt; 0.0001), and in ZIP codes with higher rates of hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (r = 0.23, p &lt; 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, incidences were higher in ZIP codes with higher proportions of hospitalizations with Medicaid (p &lt; 0.0001) and higher rates of hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (p = 0.06), independent of the socioeconomic status of the ZIP code residents. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ESRD due to SLE is higher in areas with higher proportions of residents who have public insurance and higher rates of avoidable hospitalizations, suggesting that limited access to care may contribute to this complication of SLE.",M2

20391512,"Development and initial validation of a self-assessed <e>lupus</e> organ damage instrument.OBJECTIVE: The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) is a validated instrument for assessing organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Trained physicians must complete it, thus limiting utility where this is impossible. METHODS: We developed and pilot tested a self-assessed organ damage instrument, the Lupus Damage Index Questionnaire (LDIQ), in 37 SLE subjects and 7 physicians. After refinement, 569 English-speaking SLE subjects and 14 rheumatologists from 11 international SLE clinics participated in validation. Subjects and physicians completed the instruments separately. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, Spearman's correlations, and agreement using the SDI as the gold standard. Six hundred five SLE participants in the community-based National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB) study completed the LDIQ and we assessed correlations with outcome and disability measures. RESULTS: The mean LDIQ score was 3.3 (range 0-16) and the mean SDI score was 1.5 (range 0-9). The LDIQ had a moderately high correlation with the SDI (Spearman's r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.001). Specificities of individual LDIQ items were &gt;80%, except for neuropathy. Sensitivities were variable and lowest for damage, with &lt;1% prevalence. Agreement between the SDI and LDIQ was &gt;85% for all but neuropathy, reduced renal function, deforming arthritis, and alopecia. In the NDB, the LDIQ correlated well with the comorbidity index (r = 0.45), the Short Form 36 physical component scale (r = 0.43), the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (r = 0.40), disability (r = 0.37), and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Questionnaire score (r = 0.37). CONCLUSION: The metric properties of the LDIQ are good compared with the SDI. It has construct validity and correlations with health assessments similar to the SDI. The LDIQ should allow expansion of SLE research. Its ultimate value will be determined in longitudinal studies.",M2
20391487,"Frequent use of the emergency department among persons with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients who are frequent users of the emergency department and to identify predictors of frequent emergency department use. METHODS: Data for this study were derived from the University of California, San Francisco Lupus Outcomes Study, a large cohort of persons with SLE who undergo annual structured interviews. Participants were categorized into 1 of 3 levels of emergency department utilization: nonusers (no visits in the preceding year), occasional users, (1-2 visits), and frequent users (&gt; or =3 visits). We compared characteristics of the 3 groups and determined predictors of frequent emergency department use (&gt; or =3 visits) using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for a variety of potential confounding covariates. RESULTS: Of 807 study participants, 499 (62%) had no emergency department visits; 230 (28%) had occasional emergency department visits (1-2 visits); and 78 (10%) had frequent (&gt; or =3 visits) emergency department visits. Frequent users were younger, less likely to be employed, and less likely to have completed college. They also had greater disease activity, worse general health status, and more depressive symptoms. Frequent emergency department users were more likely to have Medicaid as their principal insurance. In multivariate logistic regression, older age predicted a lower likelihood of frequent emergency department visits, whereas greater disease activity and having Medicaid insurance predicted a higher likelihood of frequent emergency department visits. CONCLUSION: In persons with SLE, greater disease activity and Medicaid insurance are associated with more frequent emergency department use.",M2
20391486,"Possible protective effect of hydroxychloroquine on delaying the occurrence of integument damage in <e>lupus</e>: LXXI, data from a multiethnic cohort.OBJECTIVE: To determine the features predictive of time to integument damage in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from a multiethnic cohort (LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture [LUMINA]). METHODS: LUMINA SLE patients (n = 580) age &gt; or =16 years, with a disease duration of &lt; or =5 years at baseline (T0), of African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian ethnicity were studied. Integument damage was defined per the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (scarring alopecia, extensive skin scarring, and skin ulcers lasting at least 6 months); factors associated with time to its occurrence were examined by Cox proportional univariable and multivariable (main model) hazards regression analyses. Two alternative models were also examined: in model 1, all patients, regardless of when integument damage occurred (n = 94), were included; in model 2, a time-varying approach (generalized estimating equation) was employed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (6.7%) of 580 patients developed integument damage over a mean +/- SD total disease duration of 5.9 +/- 3.7 years, and were included in the main multivariable regression model. After adjusting for discoid rash, nailfold infarcts, photosensitivity, and Raynaud's phenomenon (significant in the univariable analyses), disease activity over time (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.09-1.26) was associated with a shorter time to integument damage, whereas hydroxychloroquine use (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.47) and Texan-Hispanic (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.87) and Caucasian ethnicities (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.99) were associated with a longer time. Results of the alternative models were consistent with those of the main model, although in model 2, the association with hydroxychloroquine was not significant. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that hydroxychloroquine use is possibly associated with a delay in integument damage development in patients with SLE.",M2
20391485,"Hydroxychloroquine treatment in a community-based cohort of patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: In recent years hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has emerged as a key therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We determined the rates of HCQ use in a diverse, community-based cohort of patients with SLE and identified predictors of current HCQ use. METHODS: Patients were participants in the University of California San Francisco Lupus Outcomes Study, an ongoing longitudinal study of patients with confirmed SLE. We examined the prevalence of HCQ use per person-year and compared baseline characteristics of users and nonusers, including demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and health system use variables. Multiple logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used to evaluate predictors of HCQ use. RESULTS: A total of 881 patients contributed 3,095 person-years of data over 4 interview cycles. The prevalence of HCQ use was 55 per 100 person-years and was constant throughout the observation period. In multivariate models, the odds of HCQ use were nearly doubled among patients receiving their SLE care from a rheumatologist compared with those identifying generalists or nephrologists as their primary sources of SLE care. In addition, patients with shorter disease duration were more likely to use HCQ, even after adjusting for age and other covariates. CONCLUSION: In this community-based cohort of patients, HCQ use was suboptimal. Physician specialty and disease duration were the strongest predictors of HCQ use. Patients who are not using HCQ, those with longer disease duration, and those who see nonrheumatologists for their SLE care should be targeted for quality improvement.",M2
20391479,"Prospective validation of the provisional criteria for the evaluation of response to therapy in childhood-onset systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate the provisional criteria for the evaluation of response to therapy in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In this multicenter study, childhood-onset SLE patients (n = 98; 81 girls, 17 boys, 50% white, 88% non-Hispanic) were followed every 3 months for up to 7 visits (total number of visits 623). The 5 childhood-onset SLE core response variables were obtained at the time of each visit: 1) physician assessment of overall disease activity, 2) parent assessment of patient well-being, 3) Child Health Questionnaire, 4) proteinuria, and 5) global disease activity measure score, as measured by the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM), the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), or the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). Physician-rated relevant changes in the disease course (clinically relevant improvement, no change in disease, or worsening) between visits served as the criterion standard. Mixed models were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the 4 highest-ranked provisional definitions of response to therapy. RESULTS: There were 89 episodes of clinically relevant improvement between 2 consecutive visits, and 448 episodes without improvement. Irrespective of the choice of the global disease activity measure (ECLAM, SLAM, SLEDAI), sensitivities of all 4 highest-ranked definitions were low (all &lt; or =31%), whereas their specificities were excellent (all &gt;88%). Using logistic models, alternative definitions can be developed with both 80% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: The provisional criteria of response to therapy in childhood-onset SLE may have considerably lower sensitivity than previously reported. Additional validation in clinical trials is necessary to further evaluate the measurement properties of the provisional Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/American College of Rheumatology criteria for response to therapy in children with SLE.",M2
20391423,"Evaluation of fetuses in a study of intravenous immunoglobulin as preventive therapy for congenital heart block: Results of a multicenter, prospective, open-label clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate of anti-SSA/Ro-associated congenital heart block (CHB) is 17%. Sustained reversal of third-degree block has never been achieved. Based on potential reduction of maternal autoantibody titers as well as fetal inflammatory responses, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was evaluated as preventive therapy for CHB. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, open-label study based on Simon's 2-stage optimal design was initiated. Enrollment criteria included the presence of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies in the mother, birth of a previous child with CHB/neonatal <e>lupus</e> rash, current treatment with &lt; or = 20 mg/day of prednisone, and &lt;12 weeks pregnant. IVIG (400 mg/kg) was given every 3 weeks from week 12 to week 24 of gestation. The primary outcome was the development of second-degree or third-degree CHB. RESULTS: Twenty mothers completed the IVIG protocol before the predetermined stopping rule of 3 cases of advanced CHB in the study was reached. CHB was detected at 19, 20, and 25 weeks; none of the cases occurred following the finding of an abnormal PR interval on fetal Doppler monitoring. One of these mothers had 2 previous children with CHB. One child without CHB developed a transient rash consistent with neonatal lupus. Sixteen children had no manifestations of neonatal lupus at birth. No significant changes in maternal titers of antibody to SSA/Ro, SSB/La, or Ro 52 kd were detected over the course of therapy or at delivery. There were no safety issues. CONCLUSION: This study establishes the safety of IVIG and the feasibility of recruiting pregnant women who have previously had a child with CHB. However, IVIG at low doses consistent with replacement does not prevent the recurrence of CHB or reduce maternal antibody titers.",M2

METHODS: With a case-only design, a total of 258 cases were enrolled in this study, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PDCD-1 and CTLA-4 genes were determined by means of PCR-RFLP. With the aid of Poisson loglinear mode, interactions between gene-gene and gene-environment were fitted under the dominant, recessive, additive and multiple models, respectively. RESULTS: It was found that interaction existed between GG genotype of PD1.6 and UV history under separate inherent models of the recessive mode (OR = 3.714, 95%CI: 1.235 - 11.179) and additive mode (OR = 3.199, 95%CI: 1.023 - 10.004). For CTLA-4 locus, there existed interactions between TT/TC genotype of -1722T--&gt;C and UV history under the dominant model (OR = 4.874, 95%CI: 1.119 - 21.242), and interaction between T allele and UV history was also found under the multiple model (OR = 1.470, 95%CI: 1.047 - 2.065). While, under the additive mode for CTLA-4, it was found that interactions existed between TT genotype of -1722T--&gt;C and UV history (OR = 4.744, 95%CI: 1.037 - 21.737), as well as between TC genotype of -1722T--&gt;C and UV history (OR = 4.973, 95%CI: 1.110 - 22.287). CONCLUSION: The interactions between UV history and polymorphisms of CTLA-4 and PDCD-1 gene for SLE were observed, which indicates that there may be association of their interactions with the development of SLE in Han nationality females population in the south regions of Changjiang River in China.",M2

Many investigations have shown the high rate of endothelial dysfunction (ED) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, clinical data on ED in patients with SLE are scarce; which seems to be generated by difficulties in the diagnosis of this condition and to necessitate the modification of the existing diagnostic methods. The signs of ED were detected in 40% of the patients. Its development was associated with the activity of SLE, the presence of Raynaud's syndrome, elevated systolic blood pressure, plasma fibrinogen levels, and the larger daily dose ofprednisolone. The method proposed by the authors to study endothelialfunction from the diagnostic capacities on the basis of volumetric compression oscillometry is comparable with the standard ultrasound method, which allows its clinical use to evaluate the endothelial state.",M2
20385827,"A defunctioning polymorphism in FCGR2B is associated with protection against malaria but susceptibility to systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease more prevalent in people of African and Asian origin than Caucasian origin. FcgammaRIIb is an inhibitory Fc receptor with a critical role in immune regulation. Mouse data suggest that FcgammaRIIb deficiency increases susceptibility to autoimmune disease but protects against infection. We show that a SNP in human FCGR2B that abrogates receptor function is strongly associated with susceptibility to SLE in both Caucasians and Southeast Asians. The minor allele of this SNP is more common in Southeast Asians and Africans, populations from areas where malaria is endemic, than in Caucasians. We show that homozygosity for the minor allele is associated with substantial protection against severe malaria in an East African population (odds ratio = 0.56; P = 7.1 x 10(-5)). This protective effect against malaria may contribute to the higher frequency of this SNP and hence, SLE in Africans and Southeast Asians.",M2
20384873,"The kinin system in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus exhibiting mucocutaneous lesions: a clinical study.In the present study, we evaluated the kinin system components in the plasma of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus exhibiting mucocutaneous lesions. Fifteen women with active cutaneous lupus (P) and 15 normal healthy women (C) were studied. Low molecular (LKg) and high molecular (HKg) weight kininogen were determined by ELISA (expressed microg Bk/ml). The activities of tissue kallikrein (TKal), plasma kallikrein (PKal) and kininase II were assayed by their action on selective substrates. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The patients presented increased plasma levels of LKg (P = 2.98, C = 0.79) and HKg (P = 1.78, C = 0.5) associated with the increased activity of PKal (P = 2.50, C = 1.63 U/ml), TKal (P = 1.87, C = 1.30 microM pNa/ml) and kininase II (P = 1.50, C = 0.51 microM Hys-Leu/ml), when compared to the values observed in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001 for each comparison). Thus, the increased concentration of all parameters of the kinin system in these patients indicate an overactivity of the kinin system in the acute phase of lupus, corroborating with the participation of these mediators in lupus pathogenesis.",M2
20374380,"The immunological basis of B-cell therapy in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.Loss of B-cell tolerance is a hallmark feature of the pathogenesis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production. These autoantibodies lead to formation of immune-complex deposition in internal organs causing inflammation and damage. Autoreactive B-cells are believed to be central in the pathophysiology of SLE. Other than its role in the production of antibodies that mediate humoral immune response, B-cells also function as antigen-presenting cells and are capable of activating T-cells. Activated B-cells may also produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate local inflammation. Abnormal B-cell homeostasis has been described in SLE patients. This may occur as a result of intrinsic B-cell defect or from aberrant regulation by maturation and survival signals. B-cell-based therapy is the current mainstream of research and development of novel therapies in SLE patients with severe and refractory disease. Potential cellular and molecular targets for B-cell therapies include cell surface molecules such as CD20 (rituximab) and CD22 (epratuzumab); co-stimulatory molecules involved in B-cell-T-cell interaction such as CTLA4 and B7 molecules (abatacept); maturation and growth factors such as B-cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand (belimumab, briobacept, atacicept) and B-cell tolerogen (abetimus). This article provides an overview on normal B-cell physiology and abnormal B-cell biology in SLE that form the immunological basis of B-cell-targeted therapy in the treatment of these patients with refractory diseases.",M2

We report a case of refractory vasculitic ulcers responding to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 cells leading to prolonged B cell depletion. This treatment was initiated after treatment with high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants were ineffective/associated with significant side-effects. Following treatment with rituximab, there was sustained clinical improvement and subsequent reduction of prednisolone dose. Rituximab was well-tolerated. Concomitant methotrexate therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may have aided the recovery of the patient's vasculitic ulcers. This case and anecdotal reports have illustrated the efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of refractory SLE-related vasculitic ulcers. Further studies to determine the long-term efficacy and side-effects would be useful.",M2

AIM: We aim to present our experience regarding the manifestations and outcomes of Salmonella infections in a group of Filipino SLE patients. METHODS: This study reviewed the medical records of Filipino SLE patients with documented Salmonella infection seen at the Rheumatology Clinics of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Hospital, Manila, Philippines from 2002 to 2009. RESULTS: Included were 12 patients (11 female), with mean age of 25.75 years (range 11-53 years) and average SLE disease duration 4.45 years to Salmonella infection. Five had septic arthritis (knee in 4, hip in 1), one of whom had concomitant typhoid fever. Another two patients had typhoid fever only. Sepsis syndrome was noted in three. One patient each had soft tissue abscess and meningitis. Salmonella typhi was isolated in seven patients, Salmonella sp. in four, and S. enteritidis in one patient. Two patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), another had mixed Salmonella and Klebsiella pneumonia. Eleven patients were on high-dose steroids for active disease, including one patient with antecedent first infusion of cyclophosphamide plus rituximab.

The family of fragment crystallizable receptors for immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Fc gammaR) represents a good example of how controlling the simultaneous triggering of activatory and/or inhibitory receptors results in a balanced immune response. Fc gammaRs play a crucial role in linking the antibody-mediated recognition of pathogens, allergens or auto-antigens to the cellular arm of the immune response. In this review, we detail how dysfunction in Fc gammaR pathways is linked to the development of the autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus.",M2
20374356,"Recurrent fractures in an elderly patient with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is an important problem that remains undertreated, even by rheumatologists. We present a case of an elderly patient with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed more than 40 years ago, who suffered from recurrent fractures and attendant complications despite a bone mineral density (BMD) score in the osteopenic range and treatment with bisphosphonates. With improved treatment and outcome of lupus, an increasing number of elderly patients who are susceptible to osteoporotic fractures are expected. This case serves to highlight that rheumatic disease patients on steroids should be screened for GIO, as effective treatment and preventive measures are available. Teriparatide is a promising treatment for patients who have failed bisphosphonate treatment or who are at high risk for fracture. We should also bear in mind that BMD scores alone are not indicative of fracture risk, and other tools such as the WHO-FRAX (Fracture risk assessment tool), serum vitamin D3 levels and bone turnover markers should be used where appropriate. Other measures including attention to factors that contribute to falls should also be considered, necessitating a multi-disciplinary approach.",M2

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of SLE patients diagnosed and confined for a CNS infection at the University of Santo Tomas Hospital in Manila, Philippines, from 1997 to 2007. RESULTS: A total of 23 SLE patients (22 females) diagnosed with CNS infection were included in this study. The mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at SLE diagnosis, and 30.9 years (range 14-58) at CNS infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). Nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. The etiologic agents were identified as Cryptococcus neoformans in seven (30.4%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), Salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), Corynebacterium bovis with Actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five (21.7%). The average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. Most cases had active SLE; the lone patient in disease remission had S. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy. The most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). The infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. CONCLUSION: We described the etiology and outcomes of CNS infections in a group of Filipino patients with SLE. Risk factors included active SLE in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. Although C. neoformans and M. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. A high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.",M2

20374326,"Anti-nucleosome antibodies as a disease activity marker in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.AIM: To measure the level of anti-nucleosome antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of these antibodies in the diagnosis of the disease and to evaluate the relationship between the levels of anti-nucleosome antibodies, anti-dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) and SLE disease activity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. All patients attended either a medical specialist clinic or were admitted to the medical wards of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia with the diagnosis of SLE (n = 90), other connective tissue diseases (n = 45) or were normal controls (n = 90) within the period from July 2004 until September 2005. They were tested for anti-nucleosome antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and anti-DNA antibodies by immunofluorescence. SLE disease activity was evaluated by SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score. RESULTS: Out of 90 SLE patients, anti-nucleosome antibodies were positive in 47 (52.2%) patients, whereas these antibodies were positive in three (6.7%) patients with other connective tissue diseases. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were positive in 33 (36.7%) SLE patients, whereas these antibodies were positive in four (8.9%) patients with other connective tissue diseases. Anti-nucleosome antibodies were positive in 40 (97.6%) patients with active SLE, whereas these antibodies were positive in seven (14.3%) patients with inactive SLE. Anti-nucleosome antibodies had a stronger correlation than anti-dsDNA antibodies with SLEDAI score. There was a significant association between anti-nucleosome antibodies and disease activity. CONCLUSION: Anti-nucleosome antibodies test is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SLE, especially when the anti-dsDNA antibodies are absent. They are additional disease activity markers in the assessment of SLE disease activity.",M2
20373598,"A red face in a <e>lupus</e> patient: thinking beyond lupus rash.A 61-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a facial rash followed by fever. The diagnosis of lupus flare was made by the general practioner who prescribed corticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable and the patient was hospitalized. On admission, she presented with high fever and a sharply demarcated papular erythema overlying her cheeks. Biology was inflammatory with elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate and leucocyte count. The diagnosis of erysipelas of the face was made on the basis of the malar and non pruritic papular erythema, fever, the high C-reactive protein levels and the absence of response to corticosteroids. The evolution was favorable under intravenous antibiotics and rapid tapering of the corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of facial erysipelas in a patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. This coincidence is a rare condition which may lead to erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate therapy.",M2
20371395,"Monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins and their complications: targeting B cells in autoimmune diseases.The immune system consists of a complex array of immunocompetent cells and inflammatory mediators that exist in complex networks. These components interact through cascades and feedback circuits, maintaining physiologic inflammation and immunosurveillance. In various autoimmune conditions, a foreign or auto-antigen may upset this fine balance, leading to dysregulated immunity, persistent inflammation, and ultimately pathologic sequelae. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress delineating the specific components of the immune system that contribute to normal immunity and specific disease states. With this greater understanding of pathogenesis coupled with advances in biotechnology, many immunomodulatory agents, commonly called biologic agents, have been introduced. The 2 most common classes of biologic agents are monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins. These agents can inhibit targets with exquisite specificity to optimize outcomes and minimize toxicity. B cells contribute significantly to the initiation and perpetuation of the immune responses. B cells not only can produce potentially pathologic autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines but also can present antigens to T cells and provide costimulatory signals essential for T-cell activation, clonal expansion, and effector function. This review focuses on biologic agents targeting B cells in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.",M2
20369745,"[Renal involvement in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus]Lupus nephropathy belongs to the most severe clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In 40-60% of patients impairment in renal function is stated on diagnosis and in 10-25% of them the disease progresses to the end-stage renal failure. There is an ample of evidence that the kidney is involved very early in the course of SLE and the occurrence of low-level proteinuria and haematuria may be associated with a significant renal disease. Glomerular lesions are the main prognostic factor. Two classifications of these lesions exist at present, i.e.: the World Health Organization classification from 1982 and the new one developed by the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society in 2003. Since new morphological presentations with glomerular necrosis and crescent formation, associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies have been reported, some difficulties in the interpretation of glomerular lesions further exist. Despite this complexity, the assessment of the kidney biopsy specimen remains the  gold standard  in handling with patients with lupus nephropathy.",M2
20369736,"[Prevalence of autoantibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus]In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients photosensitivity is considered as a factor which may cause exacerbation of skin lesions and provoke organ damage. Therefore in all therapeutic standards photo protection is recommended which may diminish vitamin D synthesis. Because of the enhanced activity of the humoral immunity which is present in the course of disease one postulates the possibility of the production of antibodies directed against vitamin D, that would be able to intensify this deficiency independently from consequences of photoprotection. THE AIM of the study was to estimate the frequency of occurrence of antibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 in patients with SLE and to assess serum concentration of 25 (OH)D3 in comparison with clinical and laboratory parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 45 patients with SLE. The control group in the 25(OH)D3 investigation comprised 49 healthy individuals but in autoantibodies against 1,25(OH)2D3 evaluation involved 30 sera obtained from healthy blood donors. In the determination of autoantibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 ELISA method was employed. The concentration of 25 (OH)D3 in the serum was evaluated with automatized electrochemi-luminescence method on the automatic platform Elecsys 2010 in the control system DEQAS (vitamin D external quality assessment scheme). RESULTS: Serum concentration of 25(OH)D3 was significantly decreased in SLE patients in comparison with the control group (15.03 +/- 8.69 vs 23.37 +/- 12.34 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.0005). Vitamin D deficit (25(OH)D3 &lt; 10 ng/ml) was ascertained in 16 patients (35.55%), deficiency (10-20 ng/ml) in 16 (35.55%) and hypovitaminosis (20-30 ng/ml) in 10 (22.22%). Values within the recommended range (30-80 ng/ml) were established in 3 (6.66%) patients. The risk for vitamin D deficiency was 3.28 folds higher in SLE patients than in healthy controls (OR = 3.28; p = 0.005). Autoantibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 were found in 4 (8.88%) patients. No statistically significant difference in the concentration of 25 (OH)D3 between SLE anti-1,25(OH)2D3 positive and anti-1,25(OH)2D3 negative patients was disclosed. The study did not reveal the correlations between the presence of antibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 and the occurrence of ascertain clinical and laboratory parameters of SLE. The winter times was found to be the risk factor for vitamin D deficiency (OR = 7.33; p = 0.005). Sunscreen usage was revealed to be the predictor of serum 25(OH) vitamin D, concentration (beta = -0.44; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The low concentration of vitamin D in lupus patients indicates that they are at the essential risk for vitamin D deficiency, however the presence of the antibodies directed against 1,25(OH)2D3 seems not to influence vitamin D status.",M2
20369733,"[The role of CR1 complement receptor in pathology]CR1 (Complement Receptor 1, CD35) is a membrane receptor for C3b and C4b expressed on erythrocytes, leukocytes and podocytes. It plays an important role in removal of immune complexes and pathogens coated with C3b and C4b. It also regulates the complement cascade activation by preventing formation of classical and alternative pathway convertases and by acting as a cofactor for factor 1 mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, C3c and C3dg. CR1 is a polymorphic molecule differing in molecular weight and the level of the CR1 expression on erythrocytes. It takes part in pathogenesis and development of various autoimmune and infectious diseases. The difference in expression of CR1 seems to correlate directly with the development of systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE) and severe form of malaria. The therapeutical potential of soluble CR1 (sCR1) is at present the subject of many investigations.",M2
20368280,"Protective and pathogenic roles for B cells during systemic autoimmunity in NZB/W F1 mice.Delineating the relative contributions of B lymphocytes during the course of autoimmune disease has been difficult. Therefore, the effects of depleting all mature B cells using a potent CD20 mAb, or of depleting circulating and marginal zone B cells using a ligand-blocking CD22 mAb, were compared in NZB/W F(1) mice, a model for human systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus. Single low-dose mAb treatments depleted B cells efficiently in both NZB/W F(1) and C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic B cell depletion by repeated CD20 mAb treatments prolonged survival during pristane-accelerated lupus in NZB/W F(1) mice, whereas CD22 mAb had little effect. Despite effective B cell depletion, neither mAb treatment prevented autoantibody generation. In addition, CD20, CD22, and control mAb-treated NZB/W F(1) mice developed anti-mouse IgG autoantibodies in contrast to parental NZB and NZW strains, which may have reduced the effectiveness of B cell depletion. Despite this, low-dose CD20 mAb treatment initiated in 12-28-wk-old mice, and administered every 4 wk thereafter, significantly delayed spontaneous disease in NZB/W F(1) mice. By contrast, B cell depletion initiated in 4-wk-old mice hastened disease onset, which paralleled depletion of the IL-10-producing regulatory B cell subset called B10 cells. B10 cells were phenotypically similar in NZB/W F(1) and C57BL/6 mice, but were expanded significantly in young NZB/W F(1) mice. Thus, B cell depletion had significant effects on NZB/W F(1) mouse survival that were dependent on the timing of treatment initiation. Therefore, distinct B cell populations can have opposing protective and pathogenic roles during lupus progression.",M2
20368275,"Docosahexaenoic acid-enriched fish oil attenuates kidney disease and prolongs median and maximal life span of autoimmune <e>lupus</e>-prone mice.The therapeutic efficacy of individual components of fish oils (FOs) in various human inflammatory diseases still remains unresolved, possibly due to low levels of n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or lower ratio of DHA to EPA. Because FO enriched with DHA (FO-DHA) or EPA (FO-EPA) has become available recently, we investigated their efficacy on survival and inflammatory kidney disease in a well-established animal model of human systemic lupus erythematosus. Results show for the first time that FO-DHA dramatically extends both the median (658 d) and maximal (848 d) life span of (NZB x NZW)F1 (B x W) mice. In contrast, FO-EPA fed mice had a median and maximal life span of approximately 384 and 500 d, respectively. Investigations into possible survival mechanisms revealed that FO-DHA (versus FO-EPA) lowers serum anti-dsDNA Abs, IgG deposition in kidneys, and proteinuria. Further, FO-DHA lowered LPS-mediated increases in serum IL-18 levels and caspase-1-dependent cleavage of pro-IL-18 to mature IL-18 in kidneys. Moreover, FO-DHA suppressed LPS-mediated PI3K, Akt, and NF-kappaB activations in kidney. These data indicate that DHA, but not EPA, is the most potent n-3 fatty acid that suppresses glomerulonephritis and extends life span of systemic lupus erythematosus-prone short-lived B x W mice, possibly via inhibition of IL-18 induction and IL-18-dependent signaling.",M2

Subjects and methods. Sixty-five patients, including 25 with SLE, 20 with SDS, and 20 with atherosclerosis (AS) obliterans of lower extremity peripheral arteries, were examined. A control group consisted of 30 apparently healthy individuals matched with the study groups for gender and age. The ultrasound technique described by D. Celermajer, et al. was employed to evaluate endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EIVD). Endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIVD) was assessed by the nitroglycerin test. The coefficient of BA susceptibility (CS) to reactive hyperemia was calculated. RESULTS: In all study patient groups EDVD values were significantly lower (7.3 +/- 1.35% in SLE, 6.91 +/- 0.9% in SDS, and Z7.64 +/- 1.9% in AS; p &lt; 0.05) than in the controls (11.23 +/- 1.1%). An adequate vascular bed response was found in 5 (20%) patients with SLE and in 2 (10%) patients with SDS. A paradoxical vasoconstrictor response to reactive hyperemia was encountered in 9 (36%) patients with SLE, 11 (55%) with SDS. In all the study groups, the patients had normal EIVD with lower CS. In SLE and SDS, CS was decreased than that in the controls. The impaired BA responsiveness in SLE and SDS significantly correlated with the duration and activity of the disease, Raynaud's syndrome, capillaritides, mean blood pressure, renal lesions, as well as with the laboratory values of the activity of inflammation and blood lipid composition. CONCLUSION: In SLE and SDS, there was a reduction in EDVD and EIVD, as well as paradoxical vasoconstriction. CS is an independent indicator of endothelial dysfunction with the normal values of EIVD. Impaired BA responsiveness was associated with the course of systemic inflammation and severe lesion of organs.",M2
20361524,"PI3K/Akt signaling in peripheral T lymphocytes from systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus patients.PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular proliferation and growth signaling. It was demonstrated that murine models presenting activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in lymphocytes develop features of systemic autoimmunity, linking this pathway to autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the goal of our study was to analyze this signaling axis in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), the prototype of systemic autoimmune diseases, focusing on Akt and p70S6k, two components of this pathway. Our results demonstrated that both expression and phosphorylation levels of Akt are more increased in SLE than in healthy donors (HDs) CD4+ T cells suggesting an up-regulation of PI3K and mTOR activities. This result was also suggested when p70S6k, one of mTOR substrate, was evaluated. Indeed, in SLE CD4+ T cells an enhancement of p70S6k activity, in direct correlation with its expression level, was found. Since p27kip1, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, is one of the Akt substrates, we analyzed its expression level in relationship with cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that p27kip1 expression level was significantly decreased in SLE than in HDs CD4+ T cells. In SLE p27kip1 level was inversely correlated with the percentage of peripheral lymphocytes in apoptosis and in S phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, the increased activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and, as a result, the drop of p27kip1 levels observed in CD4+ T cells isolated from SLE patients might explain the accumulation of SLE lymphocytes in S and G2/M cell cycle phases where they undergo apoptosis.",M2

20360192,"Education, zip code-based annualized household income, and health outcomes in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of socioeconomic status [SES; education and zip code-based annual household income (Z-AHI)] and ethnicity with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Data on 211 subjects from a cross-sectional study (LupusPRO) using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire to evaluate physical health scores (PCS) and mental health scores were used to obtain education and zip code. The 2000 US Census was used to obtain each zip code's median annual household income. RESULTS: Education and Z-AHI correlated with PCS (education standardized beta = 0.17, 95% CI 0.47, 3.65, p = 0.01, r(2) = 0.03; Z-AHI standardized beta = 0.15, 95% CI 0.57, 8.30, p = 0.02, r(2) = 0.02) on regression analysis. Z-AHI was linked to PCS, independent of education. Ethnicity was associated with PCS through disease activity and SES. CONCLUSION: SES is associated with HRQOL in SLE. Z-AHI and education are equally predictive surrogates of SES; however, Z-AHI, independent of education, was predictive of HRQOL. Z-AHI has less subject bias and is easily obtainable, therefore its use for future HRQOL studies is suggested.",M2
20360189,"Secondary Sjogren's syndrome in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus defines a distinct disease subset.OBJECTIVE: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) may occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We sought to determine whether the presence of SS in a large cohort of patients with SLE defines a subset with distinctive sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory features. METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Lupus Cohort was divided into 2 groups, based on the presence or absence of SS, defined by the presence of an objective measure of sicca or an abnormal minor salivary gland biopsy in a patient with sicca symptoms. These groups were compared with regard to sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory features. Multivariable logistic regression was then performed to adjust the findings for potential sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory confounders. RESULTS: The 259 patients with SS (14% of the cohort), when compared with the 1531 patients without SS, were older at the time of SLE diagnosis and were more commonly women and white. Photosensitivity, oral ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-Ro antibodies, and anti-La antibodies had a significant positive association while renal disease, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies, and anti-dsDNA antibodies had a negative association with the presence of SS after adjustment for age (at last cohort visit), gender, ethnicity, and anti-Ro antibodies. The older age at diagnosis of SLE among the patients with SS did not remain a significant finding after adjustment for the age of the patient at last cohort visit. CONCLUSION: The subset of patients with SLE and SS has a distinct clinical and laboratory phenotype, with a higher frequency of older white women with photosensitivity, oral ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-Ro antibodies, and anti-La antibodies and a lower frequency of renal disease, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and anti-RNP antibodies.",M2

Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with the lupus anticoagulant at baseline have a 50% chance of a deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus in the next 20 years.

20353968,"The dual role of innate immunity in the antiphospholipid syndrome.The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), as both a primary syndrome and a syndrome in association with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE), can be a devastating disease. It is unclear what factors (genetic and/or environmental) lead to the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). It is equally unclear why only certain individuals with aPL develop clinical events. We hypothesize that innate immune activation plays a critical role at two distinct stages of APS, namely, the initiation phase, in which aPL first appear, and the effector phase, in which aPL precipitate a thrombotic event. According to the model we propose, aPL alone are insufficient to cause thrombosis and a concomitant trigger of innate immunity, e.g. a toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, must be present for thrombosis to occur. Here, we discuss our findings that mice immunized with beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR ligand, produce high levels of aPL and other SLE-associated autoantibodies, and develop lupus-like glomerulonephritis. We also discuss our data showing that autoantibodies to heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), an 'endogenous TLR ligand', promote thrombus generation in a murine model of arterial injury. Thus, both pathogen-derived TLR ligands (e.g. LPS) and endogenous TLR ligands (e.g. HSP60) may contribute to the pathogenesis of APS. This putative dual role of innate immunity provides new insight into the generation of aPL as well as the enigma of why some individuals with aPL develop APS, while others do not.",M2

METHOD: We collected 53 patients diagnosed with SLE, in a specialized consultation of autoimmune diseases. The patients were characterized clinically (by means of SLICC/ACR, SLEDAI, length of disease and therapy) and psychologically at the same time. The psychological evaluation was made by the application of self-measured questionnaires, namely AAS, BSI, HADS, SF-36, EMBU and NEO-FFI, and also by the completion of a psychological interview. RESULTS: SLE patients adopted, mostly, an anxious, insecure attachment style. We found high levels of somatisation and psychopathological morbidity, particularly depression. We also observed an impairment of the quality of life in these patients. We found statistically significant and positive correlations between the insecure attachment styles and psychopathological morbidity, we also noticed negative associations with the dimensions of quality of life. By means of multiple linear regression models, some clinical variables (SLEDAI and SLICC/ACR) highlight as predictors of insecure attachment styles. CONCLUSION: SLE has specific and particular characteristics that lead to insecure attachment styles, psychopathological morbidity and impairment of quality of life. Thus arises the need for a specific and complementary psychotherapeutic intervention, adapted to the needs of these patients.",M2

Electroacupuncture (EA) therapy was performed in two courses (14 treatment sessions) 1 month apart. A needle was inserted in the proximal (or medial) side of the painful joint and another needle was inserted in the distal (or lateral) side of the same joint and a 50 Hz stimulus was applied (3 s bursts with 1 s gaps) for 15 min. A visual analogue scale was used to evaluate pain intensity. Cold provocation testing was conducted before and after EA sessions to determine the vasomotor response. Visual analogue scale scores were lower after EA sessions than before. Before starting EA, the skin temperature of the right mid fingertip was 27.9 degrees C and that of the left mid fingertip was 28.3 degrees C. In contrast, after the EA sessions, the skin temperature of the right mid fingertip was 34.8 degrees C and that of the left mid fingertip was 34.7 degrees C. In the last EA session, the patient reported that the cold in her fingers and toes had eased and Raynaud's phenomenon, in which nail colour tone changed from white to red, had disappeared. In the cold-provocation test, before EA, the temperature recovery rates of mid fingertips after cold exposure reached over 80% in 20 min. In contrast, after EA had been completed, the temperature recovery rate exceeded 80% in 10 min, thus the delay of temperature recovery was alleviated.",M2
20350481,"mTOR signaling: a central pathway to pathogenesis in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus?Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease with unclear etiology. Treatments for it often provide inadequate control of disease activity or are limited by side effects. Recent studies have shown that rapamycin can be an effective treatment in both murine lupus models and human SLE. We demonstrated that rapamycin could directly alter molecular abnormalities in SLE T cells related to calcium signaling but not mitochondrial function. However, in light of increased knowledge of the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling throughout the immune system, several other potential sites of rapamycin action have been revealed. Specifically, mTOR regulates the production of interferon-alpha and the maintenance of immune tolerance at the level of the regulatory T cell and the dendritic cell, and can promote Th2 versus Th1 immune responses. Thus mTOR offers a window into diverse facets of lupus pathogenesis as well as a unifying narrative in our understanding of the therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin in SLE.",M2

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 61 premenopausal women with SLE treated for lupus nephritis (n=58), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (n=1) and central nervous system involvement (n=2). Thirty-nine patients received prolonged treatment with 1 g/m2 intravenous (IV) CYC pulses (group I). 22 patients received 5-7 monthly 1 g/m2 IV CYC pulses and afterwards 2 g/day MMF (group II). RESULTS: Disease activity was equally controlled using either regimen (p=0.76 and p=0.31 for disease remission and relapse respectively). Amenorrhea developed in 56% of women in group I (n=22) and 14% in group II (n=3) (p=0.01), whereas sustained amenorrhea developed in 51% (n=20) of women in group I versus 4% (n=1) in group II (p=0.05). Most women with amenorrhea in group I (86%) did not resume menses after the cessation of therapy versus one woman (33%) in group II. In logistic regression, group I had a 4-fold higher risk of amenorrhea and 5-fold higher risk of sustained amenorrhea compared to group II (p=0.001 and p=0.009 respectively). Age (p&lt;0.001), cumulative CYC dose (p=0.001) and anti-Ro antibodies (p=0.002) were significant in terms of amenorrhea, while sustained amenorrhea was significantly associated with the patient age (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: We suggest that treatment with MMF following 5-7 IV pulses of CYC is an effective mean to control disease activity and preserve ovarian function in premenopausal women with SLE.",M2
20346238,"Increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for hospitalisation of women with <e>lupus</e> during pregnancy: a nationwide population-based study.OBJECTIVES: Using a nationwide population-based dataset to examine the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with and without SLE hospitalisation during pregnancy. METHODS: We identified 1,010 pregnant women who had SLE during 2001 2003 as the study cohort and 5,050 randomly selected pregnant women (five for every woman with SLE) as a comparison cohort. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between women with and without SLE and the risk of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth, and babies small for gestational age (SGA), after adjusting for the characteristics of the infant, mother, and father. RESULTS: We found that there were significant differences in the risk of LBW (14.9% vs. 7.2%), preterm birth (14.4% vs. 8.5%), and SGA (28.5% vs. 17.5%) for women with SLE compared to women without. In addition, the adjusted odds of LBW, preterm birth, and SGA babies for women who had SLE during pregnancy were 6.15 (95% CI=4.15-9.13), 4.19 (95% CI=2.77-6.36), and 4.25 (95% CI=2.95-6.11) times, respectively, compared to women without any chronic illness. The adjusted odds of LBW, preterm birth, and SGA babies for women who had SLE but were not hospitalized during pregnancy were 1.80 (95% CI=1.43-2.26), 1.62 (95% CI=1.30-2.03), and 1.63 (95% CI=1.38-1.94) times, respectively, compared to unaffected mothers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that SLE can impact the pregnancy outcomes, especially if hospitalisation occurs during the pregnancy.",M2
20346232,"Development of new osteonecrosis in systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus patients in association with long-term corticosteroid therapy after disease recurrence.OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are at high risk of developing osteonecrosis, as they require corticosteroid therapy for life. The purpose of this study was to use periodic MRI analysis to clarify (1) the incidence of new osteonecrosis associated with long-term corticosteroid therapy in SLE patients, and (2) the risk factors for delayed osteonecrosis in SLE patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied 291 joints (134 hips and 157 knees) in 106 SLE patients without osteonecrosis after initial corticosteroid therapy, with a mean follow-up period of 13.6 years and a follow-up rate of 71%. All patients had undergone periodic MRI examination of the hip and knee joints for &gt;10 years. RESULTS: New osteonecrosis developed in 6 joints (3%) and only occurred after SLE recurrence in association with increased corticosteroid doses (to&gt;30 mg/day [p=0.008]). New lesions were delayed for a mean 5.9 years after initial corticosteroid administration. The mean time from SLE recurrence to appearance of new lesions was 6.2 months. SLE recurrence occurred in 131 joints (45%), while SLE was well controlled in 160 joints (55%). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that with respect to long-term effects, total cumulative dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy do not contribute to osteonecrosis. However, SLE recurrence is a risk factor for new osteonecrosis. We recommend MRI screening for osteonecrosis at SLE recurrence.",M2
20345977,"Altered expression of signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors CS1 (CD319) and 2B4 (CD244) in patients with systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.CS1 (CRACC, CD319) and 2B4 (CD244), members of the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors, regulate various immune functions. Genes encoding SLAM family receptors are located at 1q23, implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we have investigated the expression and alternative splicing of CS1 and 2B4 in immune cells from SLE patients. The surface expression of CS1 and 2B4 on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T, B, natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes in 45 patients with SLE and 30 healthy individuals was analysed by flow cytometry. CS1-positive B cell population was increased significantly in SLE patients. Because CS1 is a self-ligand and homophilic interaction of CS1 induces B cell proliferation and autocrine cytokine secretion, this could account for autoreactive B cell proliferation in SLE. The proportion of NK cells and monocytes expressing 2B4 on their surface was significantly lower in patients with SLE compared to healthy controls. Our study demonstrated altered expression of splice variants of CS1 and 2B4 that mediate differential signalling in PBMC from patients with SLE.",M2
20345339,"Allogenic bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation as a novel therapy for systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) are multipotent non-hematopoietic progenitor cells that are being explored as a promising new treatment for tissue regeneration. Although their immunomodulatory properties are not yet completely understood, their low immunogenic potential together with their effects on immune response make them a promising therapeutic tool for severe refractory autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Our aim is to discuss recent progress in understanding the role of malfunctioning BMMSC in etiopathogenesis of SLE and to explore allogenic BMMSC transplantation as a potential therapy for SLE. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Recent evidence suggests that the functions of BMMSC are disrupted in SLE pathology. This malfunction may result as a corollary of the disease, or may play a more fundamental role in its etiopathogenesis. We provide a brief characterization of BMMSC immunomodulatory effects, and describe our current understanding of the mechanisms by which it plays a part in treating SLE. We also present our clinical trial using allogenic BMMSC in this context. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Allogenic BMMSC appear to be a safe therapeutic option for treatment-resistant SLE as illustrated in our clinical trial.",M2
20333761,"Myth and reality: practical test system for the measurement of anti-DNA antibodies in the diagnosis of systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE).The myth persists that only the labor intensive Farr radioimmunoassay and Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence (CL-IFA) are systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-specific tests. We compared them to ELISA with bacteriophage lambda DNA (EL-dsDNA) and denatured calf thymus DNA (EL-ssDNA). By percentile ranking, the specificity cut-off level was set both out of clinical context (SOCC) on 100 blood bank donors, and in clinical context (SICC) on 100 patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma (50/50). Clinical sensitivity was calculated on 100 random SLE patients. At 95% SICC, the sensitivity of Farr, CL-IFA, EL-dsDNA, and EL-ssDNA was similar (95%CI): 76% (66-84), 76% (66-84), 63% (53-72), and 75% (65-83), respectively; 87% of the patients were positive by at least one method and 55%by all methods. At 99% SICC, the sensitivity was also similar (95% CI): 57% (47-67), 47% (37-57), 58% (47-67), and 43% (33-53), respectively. The areas under ROC curve were similar (95% CI) when patients were used as controls for specificity. At 99% SOCC, EL-ssDNA identified 89% positive, 2 negative but positive by another method at 95% SICC, and 9 negative (i.e. 89/2/9), followed by CL-IFA (80/6/14), Farr (76/12/12), and EL-dsDNA (64/23/13). Thus, at relatively low cost and easy automation, under the same conditions of specificity, the two ELISA tests combined were at least as good, if not superior, to CL-IFA or Farr: they showed similar clinical sensitivity and also identified more patients with anti-DNA antibodies.",M2
20333624,"Class switching and consecutive loss of dsDNA-reactive B1a B cells from the peritoneal cavity during murine <e>lupus</e> development.B1a B cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus; however, their precise contribution to the disease remains unclear. Here we analysed isotype expression, organ accumulation and autoreactivity of B1a cells in the NZB/W F1 murine model for systemic lupus erythematosus using flow cytometry, ELISPOT and adoptive cell transfer. In the course of lupus, the B1a compartment is expanded and B1a cells class switch to IgG. Class-switched B1a B cells were excluded from the peritoneal cavity but accumulated in the spleen and target organs such as kidneys and thymus. Autoreactive B1a B cells preferentially class switch, which leads to a subsequent loss of autoreactive B1a cells from the peritoneal cavity. We propose a model whereby autoreactive B1a B cells become activated early in the course of lupus and class switch to IgG. These autoreactive B1a B cells accumulate in the spleen and affected organs where they presumably secrete autoantibodies and contribute to the local and systemic pathogenesis.",M2

However, the data on their frequency and clinical relevance remain inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the frequency as well as clinical and serological relevance of anti-P autoantibodies in Polish patients with SLE and to determine the significance of these antibodies in the diagnosis of SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-P antibody levels were measured in the sera of 100 SLE patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. All patients underwent a routine clinical and laboratory evaluation. Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score. RESULTS: Anti-P antibodies were detected in 14 of 100 patients. When compared to anti-P-negative patients, this group was characterized by earlier onset of SLE, higher disease activity, more frequent occurrence of fever and facial erythema, decreased serum levels of complement, and elevated levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases. In 2 cases, anti-P antibodies were the only serological marker of SLE detected in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: SLE with the presence of anti-P antibodies is characterized by an early onset and high disease activity.",M2
20303780,"Interferon-alpha and interleukin-6 in SLE serum induce the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells derived from CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells.The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the cytokines IFN-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 present in the serum of systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (SLE) patients on the differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs). CD34(+) HPCs cultured in SLE serum containing elevated levels of IFN-alpha or IL-6 differentiated into DCs showing an increased expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86, decreased IL-12 secretion along with increased IL-10 production, and an increased ability to stimulate allogenic T-cell proliferation, compared with DCs cultured in normal serum. DCs cultured with high levels of IFN-alpha increased the proportion of both CD3(+)CD8(-)IFN-gamma(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) T-cell subsets, and increased the production of IFN-gamma in the allogenic MLR. DCs cultured with high levels of IL-6 decreased the proportion of both IFN-gamma(+) T-cell subsets, and decreased the secretion of IFN-gamma, but increased the production of IL-10. The IL-10 present in SLE serum did not significantly alter the phenotype or function of the DCs. IFN-alpha and IL-6 present in SLE serum induce CD34(+) HPCs to differentiate into DCs with different regulatory effects on T-cell differentiation, which might be involved in the initiation and maintenance of SLE.",M2

20297867,"B cell-targeted therapies for systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus: an update on clinical trial data.In the past year there has been remarkable activity and some important success in the development of B cell-targeted therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The most promising studies were BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, large phase III studies that demonstrated measurable efficacy for belimumab, a monoclonal antibody against B cell-activating factor (BAFF). The moderate-sized phase II/III trials EXPLORER and LUNAR that tested rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, for treatment of non-renal and renal lupus, disappointed many investigators with anecdotal success in refractory patients. These rituximab trials were intended to detect a large clinical effect in patients with very active disease and this was not found. Nevertheless, arguments can be made for additional studies in targeted populations or with a change in design to detect smaller or longer-term effects. Epratuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the B cell surface antigen CD22, and atacicept, a chimeric molecule formed by a receptor for BAFF and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) with immunoglobulin (Ig)-G, have both been promising in initial small trials and now larger clinical trials are underway. Thus, recent clinical trial data show that B cell-targeting therapies are beginning to fulfil their promise as treatments for SLE and there are good reasons to hope for further progress in the near future.",M2
20236656,"Prognostic impact of atypical presentation in pediatric systemic <e>lupus</e> erythematosus: results from a multicenter study.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to assess the rate of atypical manifestations at onset in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate their effect on disease outcome. STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A manifestation was considered atypical if it was not included in the American College Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE but was reported in literature as associated with SLE. Unfavorable outcome was considered presence of organ damage in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index at the last available evaluation. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled in the study; 24% presented atypical clinical features at onset. Univariate analysis showed a significant association of worse outcome variables with the presence of atypical manifestations at onset (P = .004), as well as renal involvement (P = .027). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that atypical manifestations at onset (P = .018), renal involvement at onset or during follow up (P = .024), and central nervous system disease involvement during follow up (P = .021) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a relatively high rate of atypical onset in pediatric SLE. Presence of atypical manifestations at presentation and early kidney disease correlate with poor outcome. Similarly, during follow-up, kidney and central nervous system diseases are associated with worse outcome.",M2
20199547,"Measuring disease activity and damage in discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.BACKGROUND: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a disfiguring inflammatory skin disease. There is no specific tool for measuring disease severity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the features needed in a score measuring activity and damage in DLE and to investigate the score's reliability and its correlation with the physician's global assessment of disease severity and the patient-reported Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI). METHODS: The content of the score was determined following a peer review, pilot work in patients and a preliminary inter-rater reliability study. The Score of Activity and Damage in DLE (SADDLE) measures severity of activity (erythema, scale, induration) and damage (scarring/atrophy and dyspigmentation) attributable to DLE. Summed scores range between 0 and 195. Inter- and intrarater reliability of the score was tested using six assessors and nine patients with DLE. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) &gt; 0.7 were considered evidence of good inter- and intrarater agreement. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD SADDLE score of nine patients in the inter-rater reliability study was 47 +/- 22 (range 14-102). There was good inter-rater agreement for the total score [ICC 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.95] and for the activity and damage scales, the individual physical signs and the total scores at individual body sites. The total score demonstrated excellent intrarater reliability (ICC 0.98; 95% CI 0.86-1.00). Although there was poor inter-rater agreement for global assessments (ICC 0.28; 95% CI 0.06-0.66), a good correlation was demonstrated between total scores and global assessments (r = 0.7). A weaker positive correlation was observed between disease activity scores and DLQI (r = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: The SADDLE measures activity and damage in patients with DLE. It demonstrates good inter- and excellent intrarater agreement, over and above that for global assessment. It correlates well with global assessment scores. Further studies are required to investigate SADDLE's responsiveness to change with therapy.",M3

METHODS: Private and public physicians specializing in dermatology, rheumatology, and internal medicine were asked during the year 2000 about lupus cases. We reviewed hospitals' files in data-processing departments. RESULTS: Twenty new cases of CCLE, mostly discoid form, were identified during this 5-year period in this population of predominantly African descent. The average annual incidence of the disease was 2.59 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval 1.5-4). However, our methodology could introduce underestimation of the incidence of the disease. CONCLUSION: The average annual incidence of CCLE in FG appears to be low in this retrospective study, but is very similar to the only previously published data in the US.",M3

Although many diseases have association with blood-group systems, this fact was not enlightened in discoid lupus erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between blood groups (ABO and Rh) and discoid lupus erythematosus. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study assessing clinical information, blood group systems (ABO and Rh), FAN and C4 serum levels from discoid lupus patients without characteristics of systemic disease, was carried out at a clinic from a Brazilian university hospital. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, 71.0% were females (p1:160 in 31.9%, and low levels of C4 in 8.7%. There was no significant difference between the frequency of blood groups from discoid lupus patients and local population, however, blood group A was associated to disseminate forms of the disease (OR 4.1 and p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Discoid lupus erythematosus patients with ABO and Rh blood groups exhibit similar frequencies as in the general population; nevertheless, disseminate clinical forms were more prevalent among group A patients.",M3
20026850,"Follicular red dots: a novel dermoscopic pattern observed in scalp discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.BACKGROUND: Scalp dermoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of hair and scalp disorders, and specific dermoscopic patterns have recently been associated with several disorders causing noncicatricial alopecia, such as androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, trichotillomania, and tinea capitis. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the morphologic and pathologic features of a new dermoscopic pattern, referred to as  follicular red dots,  that was found in scalp lesions of 5 patients with active discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Follicular red dots appear as erythematous polycyclic, concentric structures, with a diameter ranging from 0.16 to 0.47 mm, regularly distributed in and around the follicular ostia. In the pathologic findings, red dots correspond to widened infundibula plugged by keratin and surrounded by dilated vessels and extravasated erythrocytes. Retrospective blinded evaluation of the dermoscopic images of 155 patients with cicatricial alopecia suggests that follicular red dots are a specific feature of DLE because the pattern was not identified in the images of cicatricial alopecia resulting from other diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The follicular red dot pattern is a specific feature of scalp lesions of active lupus erythematosus of the scalp. Recognition of this distinctive dermoscopic pattern may help the clinician to differentiate DLE from other diseases causing cicatricial alopecia.",M3

We report four cases of women with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) who responded to this treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated one patient with subacute LE having a contraindication to antimalarials and to thalidomide and three patients with chronic LE (lupus panniculitis, lupus tumidus and disseminated discoid LE) refractory to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, thalidomide and dapsone, and also, in some cases, to oral and intravenous corticosteroids, methotrexate, colchicine, acitretine, sulfasalazine, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous immunoglobulin. Treatment consisted of two 4-hour sessions fortnightly. Only antimalarials were continued during photopheresis. RESULTS: Photopheresis had a positive effect on all four patients. We noticed complete remission in two patients and interruption of progression followed by partial remission in the other two after a mean delay of two to three months of treatment. All treatments other than antimalarials were stopped. DISCUSSION: Photopheresis appears to be an effective treatment option in patients with cutaneous LE. Due to its high cost, it should nevertheless remain an exceptional therapeutic option restricted to patients with cutaneous LE resistant to standard therapy.",M3

19884217,"A clinical and epidemiological study of <e>lupus</e> erythematosus at a tertiary referral dermatology clinic in Korea.Dermatological examination is critical for the evaluation of lupus erythematosus. However, little is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the lupus erythematosus patients that visit dermatology clinics with the chief complaint of skin lesions, especially among Asian populations. We performed this study to determine the epidemiology of cutaneous lupus erythematosus for three subtypes: acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and for lupus erythematosus non-specific skin disease. Also, we sought to determine the relationship between each type of lupus erythematosus, by the skin manifestations and systemic lupus erythematosus. The medical records of lupus erythematosus patients that were diagnosed by their clinical manifestations, skin biopsy results, and laboratory findings from January 1998 through December 2007 were reviewed. A total of 117 patients were diagnosed with lupus erythematosus; 62 cases had chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, 11 had subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and 41 had acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The remaining three had systemic lupus erythematosus features with lupus erythematosus non-specific skin lesions such as Raynaud phenomenon, livedo reticularis/vasculitis, non-scarring alopecia, and periungual telangiectasia. The acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus subgroup showed extreme female predominance (9.2:1) whereas subacute and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus subgroups did not. Patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus tended to be older than other groups (peak incidence in the fifth decade). Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, including positive connective tissue markers such as antinuclear, double-strand DNA, and Ro/SS-A antibodies, were present in the order acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus almost always indicated systemic involvement of lupus erythematosus, whereas chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus did not predict the development or existence of systemic lupus erythematosus and had a benign clinical course. Careful consideration of lupus erythematosus non-specific skin lesions may help detect systemic lupus erythematosus regardless of the diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.",M3
19821298,"Drugs for discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.BACKGROUND: Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic form of cutaneous (skin) lupus which can cause permanent scarring if treatment is inadequate. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some of these are potentially very toxic. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus. SEARCH STRATEGY: In June 2009 we updated our searches of the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and online ongoing trials registers. The reference lists of relevant reviews were searched. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised trials of drugs to treat people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Drugs included in the search were azathioprine, chloroquine, clofazimine, corticosteroids, (oral and topical), dapsone, gold, interferon alpha-2a, methotrexate, phenytoin, retinoids, sulphasalazine, thalidomide, topical calcineurin blockers (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), and biological agents (etanercept, efalizimab, infliximab, and rituximab). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials involving 136 participants were included. No new trials were included in this update.In a cross-over study of 12 weeks duration, fluocinonide 0.05% cream (a potent topical corticosteroid), appeared to be better than hydrocortisone 1% cream (a mild corticosteroid) when the first arm of the trial involving 78 participants was analysed at 6 weeks. Clearing or excellent improvement was seen in 27% of people using fluocinonide and in 10% of those using hydrocortisone, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (95% CI 0.0 to 0.34, NNT (Number needed to treat) 6).In the second trial, acitretin (50mg/day) was compared with hydroxychloroquine (400mg/day) in 58 people in a parallel trial of 8 weeks duration. There was marked improvement or clearing in 46% of people using acitretin and in 50% of those on hydroxychloroquine but there was no significant difference between the 2 interventions. The adverse effects were more frequent and more severe in the acitretin group. In this trial clearing of erythema was measured and found to be better in the hydroxychloroquine group (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Fluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in treating people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy, although adverse effects are more frequent and more severe with acitretin. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus.",M3

19758313,"Tyrosine kinase 2 and interferon regulatory factor 5 polymorphisms are associated with discoid and subacute cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a heterogeneous disease ranging from skin-restricted manifestations to a progressive multisystem disease. The specific skin lesions include chronic cutaneous, subacute cutaneous and acute cutaneous LE. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the development of LE. However, reports on the genetic background of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) forms, namely discoid (DLE) and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), are sparse. We investigated whether the known systemic LE (SLE) susceptibility genes also predispose to CLE. Altogether, 219 Finnish patients with DLE or SCLE and 356 healthy controls were recruited. Single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging reported risk genes were genotyped. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) rs2304256 was associated with increased risk of DLE (P = 0.012, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.01-1.98). Expression of TYK2 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in macrophage-like cells and neutrophils and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) in macrophage- and fibroblast-like cells of DLE, SCLE and SLE skin. IRF5 rs10954213 showed association with DLE (P = 0.017, OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.06-1.86) and SCLE (P = 0.022, OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.09-3.21).

19758198,"Race differences in immunogenetic features and photosensitivity of cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus from the aspect of Japanese studies.Skin lesions of collagen diseases are influenced by environmental triggers, such as UV light, and are variable in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE), such as systemic LE (SLE), chronic discoid LE (CDLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), and LE tumidus (LET). Although there are a few conflicting reports on photosensitivity in collagen diseases, many Japanese dermatologists feel there are photosensitivity differences in LE between Asians and Caucasians with SCLE and LET. To address this issue, we have carried out genetic studies of Japanese SLE and CDLE patients and reviewed the race differences in photosensitivity of cutaneous LE from Japanese studies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) studies in Japanese patients revealed that HLA-DRB1*1501 association was with CDLE and SLE. The association between HLA-Cw6 and CDLE was first reported in a Japanese population, and a HLA-A33-B44-DRB1*1302 haplotype showed a positive association in CDLE. However, these results are not compatible with those from Caucasian subjects. There are no significant associations among HLA studies, photosensitivity, and anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies in Japanese CLE patients. Photosensitivity will be a key factor to dissolve multifactorial complexes of LE etiopathogenesis. An axis of photosensitivity, anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, and apoptosis via tumor necrosis factor-alpha is the best marker to verify the contribution of genetics in CLE patients. The incidence and degree of photosensitivity of SCLE and LET are much lower in Japanese than in Caucasians. This discrepancy may lead to investigations of CLE pathogenesis through global collaborations.",M3

Objectives To compare characteristic features of different subtypes of CLE and to analyse whether LET can be distinguished as a separate entity in the classification system of the disease. Methods The study involved 44 patients with CLE, including 24 patients with LET, 12 with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and eight with subacute CLE (SCLE), from two centres in Germany. A core set questionnaire and an SPSS database were designed to enable a consistent statistical analysis. Results Location of skin lesions did not differ significantly between the CLE subtypes; however, the activity score was significantly lower in LET than in DLE (P &lt; 0.01), and the damage score was significantly lower in LET than in SCLE (P &lt; 0.01) and DLE (P &lt; 0.01). Photosensitivity and antinuclear antibodies were confirmed to be different in LET compared with SCLE and DLE but without statistical significance. Moreover, histological analysis of skin biopsy specimens showed that abundant mucin deposition is significantly more present in LET compared with SCLE (P &lt; 0.01) and DLE (P &lt; 0.01) while prominent interface dermatitis and alteration of hair follicles were absent in LET. Conclusions Several significant differences were found between LET and other subtypes of CLE with regard to clinical, histological and laboratory parameters. These data strongly indicate that LET should be defined as a separate entity in the classification of CLE.",M3

19681863,"Cytokine imbalance with increased production of interferon-alpha in psoriasiform eruptions associated with antitumour necrosis factor-alpha treatments.BACKGROUND: Psoriasiform eruptions occur in association with antitumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatments in autoinflammatory diseases. The major reported clinical presentation is palmoplantar pustulosis, sometimes accompanied with plaque-like psoriasis. In some reports, histological findings suggest psoriasis whereas others favour a lichenoid drug reaction. We present a case series with a comprehensive clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical study. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism involved in psoriasiform eruptions in patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors. METHODS: Between July 2004 and May 2008, 13 patients with psoriasiform eruptions arising under anti-TNF-alpha treatment were enrolled in the study. Punch biopsy specimens of lesions were processed for standard and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD1a, KP1, CXCR3, CXCL9, Tia1 and MxA, which is specifically induced by type I interferons (IFNs). Additionally, we analysed biopsies from lesional skin of patients with cutaneous discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus, lichen planus and psoriasis. Control biopsies were taken from unaffected skin. RESULTS: All patients developed psoriasiform plaques on the body accompanied with palmoplantar keratoderma or pustulosis in three patients. Histological and immunohistochemical findings showed a psoriasiform pattern with focal lichenoid and spongiotic features. We detected strong production of the MxA protein in inflammatory cells, indicating involvement of type I IFNs, and the expression was higher than in control psoriasis samples. Expression of MxA was closely associated with the recruitment of CXCR3+ lymphocytes in the skin bearing markers of cytotoxic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that psoriasiform eruptions are a new model of drug reaction characterized by an increased expression of type I IFNs induced by anti-TNF-alpha.",M3

OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of R-salbutamol cream 0.5% vs. placebo on DLE lesions in a multicentre, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with at least one newly developed DLE lesion were randomized - 19 to the R-salbutamol cream 0.5% and 18 to placebo - and treated twice daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated through scores of erythema, scaling/hypertrophy and induration as well as pain and itching; general improvement scored by the investigator and global improvement scored by patients' assessment were also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean area under the curve of improvement for scaling/hypertrophy, pain, itching and global patient assessment was significantly better for the actively treated patients as compared with placebo (scaling/hypertrophy, P = 0.0262; pain, P = 0.0238; itching, P = 0.0135; global patient assessment, P = 0.045). Moreover, the percentage of patients without induration was significantly higher in the active group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.013), and a statistically significantly greater decrease in the size of the lesional area was also seen in the overall analysis of the R-salbutamol-treated patients (P = 0.0197). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Application of R-salbutamol cream 0.5% was safe and well tolerated. Statistically significant effects were seen on scaling/hypertrophy, induration, pain and itching as well as patient global assessment, suggesting that R-salbutamol could be a promising new topical therapy alternative for DLE.",M3

However, prolonged use of these agents, especially on sensitive areas such as the face, may result in side-effects (e.g. atrophy and telangiectases) by altering collagen synthesis. Therefore, alternative treatments are needed for these patients. AIM: To investigate and compare the efficacy of topical pimecrolimus 1% cream and topical betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream on facial lesions of DLE. METHODS: This was a randomized double-blind pilot study, performed in outpatient clinics of two major referral hospitals. Ten patients aged 20-53 years with moderate to severe DLE of the face were randomized into two groups for 8 weeks of treatment and 8 weeks of follow-up after treatment. In this double-blind study, one group applied pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily and the other group applied betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream twice daily to facial lesions. Efficacy end-points included a combined score based on evaluation of erythema, infiltration and presence of scale. RESULTS: Efficacy end-points showed significant improvement in both groups. A decrease of 86% and 73% in clinical severity scores was obtained for pimecrolimus and betamethasone, respectively (P = 0.043). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of efficacy (P = 0.1). No adverse effect was found at the end of the 8-week trial in any of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream is comparable with that of betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream in treating facial DLE.",M3

OBJECTIVE: We conducted an open prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of PDL for the treatment of recalcitrant CDLE, using a validated scoring method and a fixed treatment schedule. METHODS: Twelve patients with active CDLE lesions were treated with PDL (585 nm, fluence 5.5 J/cm(2), spot size 7 mm) 3 times with an interval of 6 weeks followed by a 6-week follow-up period. Treatment outcomes were evaluated by 3 observers using the validated Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI). Cosmetic results and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A significant decline in  active  CLASI was observed after 6 weeks, after 12 weeks, and at follow-up. Baseline active CLASI was 4.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SEM), reaching 1.3 +/- 0.3 after follow-up (P &lt; .0001). Individual scores for erythema and scaling/hypertrophy significantly declined 6 weeks after treatment.

It is refractory to standard therapies in a small population of patients. We investigated the use of lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, as a novel alternative therapy in 2 cases of refractory DLE and report our results. OBSERVATIONS: Two patients with chronic, severe DLE were treated with low-dose lenalidomide. Improvement was noted within 1 month at a dosage of 5 mg/d in one case and was maintained for 10 months before the dosage was doubled to 10 mg/d for 12 months because of a slight worsening of symptoms. Clinical improvement was demonstrated by a sustained reduction in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index activity score, with no change in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index damage score. Within 5 months, oral prednisone therapy (60 mg/d) was tapered and discontinued; it was restarted at a low dosage (5 mg/d), however, to manage the symptoms of systemic LE. Of note, the patient experienced mild neutropenia after taking 10 mg/d of lenalidomide, which carries a black box warning regarding neutropenia; therefore, the complete blood cell count should be monitored weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. The second case failed to show clinical improvement, and lenalidomide therapy was discontinued after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide therapy is a potential alternative or adjunctive treatment for patients with severe, chronic DLE that is refractory to standard therapies. A larger study is needed to clarify its role in the treatment of DLE and other forms of cutaneous LE.",M3

It has a prolonged course and can have a considerable effect on quality of life. Early recognition and treatment improves the prognosis. The diagnosis is usually made by clinical examination. In some cases histopathology may be required to confirm the diagnosis. The histology is that of an inflammatory interface dermatosis. There is insufficient evidence for which treatment is most effective. Because lesions are induced or exacerbated by ultraviolet exposure, photoprotective measures are important. Potent topical steroids and antimalarials are the mainstay of treatment. Some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus can be refractory to standard therapy; in these cases retinoids, thalidomide, and topical tacrolimus offer alternatives, as do immunosuppressives like azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate.",M3

Antimalarial drugs have beneficial therapeutic effects in DLE, partially resulting from their immunomodulating and photoprotective properties. The possible influence of these drugs on angiogenesis has not been previously evaluated. AIMS: To investigate the impact of chloroquine (CQ) treatment on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, a major regulator of angiogenesis) and CD34 (a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells and involved in tethering lymphocytes) in patients with DLE. METHODS: A 3-mm skin biopsy was taken from typical skin lesions in 10 people with DLE. Another biopsy was taken from the same area after 3 months of treatment with CQ (250 mg/day). Skin sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against VEGF and CD34. The intensity of epidermal VEGF expression, and the number and area of CD34-positive dermal blood vessels were assessed. RESULTS: CQ treatment induced a reduction in epidermal VEGF expression. It also resulted in a significant decrease in the median number of CD34+ dermal blood vessels (from 219 to 125 vessels per mm(2)). Furthermore the median vessel area was significantly lowered from 9.76 x 10(6) to 6.92 x 10(6) mm(2) per mm(2) of the dermis. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that one beneficial effect of CQ treatment in DLE may be due to its antiangiogenic properties.",M3

18728929,"Evaluation of the profile of the immune cell infiltrate in lichen planus, discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus, and chronic dermatitis.AIMS: The term 'interface dermatitis' refers to those dermatoses in which an inflammatory process involves the dermoepidermal junction, with injury and even necrosis of the basal cell keratinocytes. Interface dermatitis can be characterised further as being either vacuolar or lichenoid changes. Immune cell infiltrate is a constant feature in interface dermatitis. In this study, we hypothesised that 'the profile of the immune cell infiltrate varies between lichenoid and vacuolar interface dermatitis'. This investigation tries to test this hypothesis and to characterise immune cells in interface dermatitis. METHODS: Thirty-one interface dermatitis lesions (interface dermatitis group: 19 cases of lichen planus, LP; and 12 cases of discoid lupus erythematosus, DLE) and 20 specimens of normal skin (control group) were examined using immunoperoxidase staining methods. Antibodies targeting histiocytes/dendritic cells (CD68+), T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD20+), T cells with either cytotoxic potential (TIA-1+) or cytotoxic activity (Granzyme-B+) were used to decorate the immune cells. In addition, 16 cases of chronic dermatitis [lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), non-interface dermatitis group] were included to substantiate findings in the interface dermatitis group. The results were scored as mean values of positively stained immune cells. RESULTS: The numbers of immune cells were significantly high (p &lt; 0.05) in the lesional skin (LP, DLE and LSC) compared with normal skin. The most prevalent cell populations were CD3+ T lymphocytes followed by CD68+ cells. Most of the CD3+ cells were resting (TIA-1+, cytotoxic potential) rather than active T cells (Granzyme-B+, active cytotoxicity). Numeric variations were seen between interface and chronic dermatitis groups with significant increase of the density of immune cells in the interface dermatitis (p &lt; 0.05). We found some variations in the composition and distribution of immune cell infiltrate between LP (lichenoid change) and DLE (vacuolar changes). The mean counts of CD3+ cells were high in LP compared with DLE (p &lt; 0.05). Alternatively, the density of CD20+ cells was high in DLE compared with LP (p &lt; 0.05). High density of CD3+ (perivascular location and dermoepidermal junction, p &lt; 0.05) positively stained cells was found in LP compared with DLE. In contrast, high density of CD20+ (perivascular location and dermoepidermal junction, p &lt; 0.05), TIA-1+ and Granzyme-B+ (perivascular location and dermoepidermal junction, p &gt; 0.05) positively stained cells was observed in DLE compared with LP. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report some variations in the profile (density and positioning) of the immune cell infiltrate between LP and DLE. These variations include high density of CD68+ cells and CD3+ T lymphocytes in LP and DLE; and the numeric dominance of CD20+ B-lymphocytes in DLE compared with LP. Also, some differences in the density of TIA-1+ and Granzyme-B+ cytotoxic T cells between LP and DLE were observed. Our findings suggest a possible link between the type of these cells and the development of interface dermatitis lesions.

Approximately 2 months later, he developed multiple red scaly lesions on his scalp and face, which were diagnosed histopathologically as DLE. DLE is known to be exacerbated by a variety of factors, including sunlight, X-rays, tattoos, burns, and some forms of cutaneous trauma, including dermatitis. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have only been two reported cases of DLE exacerbated by contact dermatitis.",M3

The prevalence of PLE is significantly increased in patients with <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (LE) including subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which may reflect a common genetic background. Experimental evidence supports a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of PLE, and the family of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes exerts a critical physiological role in cellular protection against this oxidative damage. Our aim was to look for association between the functional GST gene polymorphisms and PLE, SCLE, and DLE in a case-control study. The carrier frequency of GSTP1 Val(105) in subjects with PLE was 40%, significantly lower than the carrier frequency in controls (54%, P=0.019), although significance was lost on correction for multiple testing. However, the carrier frequency of the GSTP1 Val(105) allele in combined cutaneous LE (SCLE and DLE) patients with PLE was 42%, significantly lower than in those without PLE (72%), which did survive correction (corrected P=0.043). We have identified evidence supporting a protective GSTP1 allele, the first genetic association to be reported for PLE. This supports a role for ROS in the pathogenesis of PLE and may provide a therapeutic target for future treatment of this common, often disabling, condition.",M3

METHODS: The following characteristics were recorded in a retrospective, multicenter analysis of patients with JLIS and LET: clinical features (number, size, type, and localization of lesions; photosensitivity; extracutaneous signs), histologic findings, phototesting, lupus serology, treatment, and outcome. Available histologic slides were reviewed blinded to the initial diagnosis using a pre-established grid. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of data from patients with JLIS (15 women, 17 men; mean age: 35 years) and LET (13 women, one man; mean age: 31 years) showed the following significant (P &lt; .05) differences: more frequent back involvement and annular lesions in JLIS, as opposed to female predominance, more frequent face involvement, and plaques in LET. Phototesting, especially ultraviolet B, induced lesions in 18 of 26 patients with JLIS and all 4 with LET. The blinded histologic review (33 samples) only found slight epidermal atrophy and focal thickened dermoepidermal junction more frequent and perivascular lymphocyte infiltrations less dense in LET. The two groups of patients reclassified according histopathologic features (18 LET and 11 JLIS) showed only slight clinical differences (more frequent nasal bridge lesions in LET and annular lesions in JLIS). LIMITATION: The retrospective nature of the study is a limitation. CONCLUSION: JLIS and LET in this population showed more similarities than differences, supporting a continuous spectrum covering these two entities.",M3

METHODS: Six female patients with SCLE were studied. Skin biopsies were obtained from lesional and healthy sunprotected skin. Frozen sections were stained immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies to CD4, CD40, and CD40L. As controls we used 5 patients with discoid LE (DLE), 5 with dermatomyositis (DM), 3 with lichen planus (LP), and 2 with erythema multiforme (EM), as well as the normal-appearing skin of 5 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The CD40 was intensely expressed in all SCLE, DLE, and DM lesions, and only focally in healthy sunprotected skin specimens. The number of CD40+ cells in SCLE dermis was lower than in DLE, similar to that in DM, LP and EM, and higher than in SCLE sunprotected skin. CD40L+ cells infiltrated the SCLE, DLE, DM, LP, and EM lesional dermis, and were more numerous in SCLE lesional skin than in SCLE healthy sunprotected skin. CONCLUSION: We showed that the CD40/CD40L system may represent an important pathway of induction of SCLE lesions. The expression of such costimulatory system in healthy sunprotected skin also may signify that its abnormal activation is constitutive in SCLE, as previously observed in systemic LE.",M3

This pathology rarely involves mucosa: oral cavity is interested in 20 percent of DLE patients. We describe a case of oral DLE in a 50-year-old woman with an anamnesis for autoimmune disorders. This study shows the helpful role of immunofluorescence in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. The first diagnostic step was the clinical observation of the oral mucosa: the lesion area was erythematous, atrophic and hyperkeratotic. The patient then underwent laboratory examination. We utilized human epithelial cells (Hep-2010) for Indirect Immuno-Fluorescence (IIF). Moreover, the biopsy site for Direct Immuno-Fluorescence (DIF) and histopathological analysis was the untreated oral lesion. IIF detected an increase of Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) and positivity for SSA-RO. By DIF, we observed IgG/IgA/fibrinogen along basal layer. Multiple biopsies reported signs of chronic basal damage. Steroid systemic therapy induced a considerable lesion regression. We suggest the use of immunofluorescence with the integration of further data to improve diagnosis of rare diseases and to establish a suitable therapy.",M3
17714558,"The expression pattern of interferon-inducible proteins reflects the characteristic histological distribution of infiltrating immune cells in different cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus subsets.BACKGROUND: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and type I interferons (IFNs) are supposed to play a central proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE). The IFN-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are involved in recruiting CXCR3+ effector lymphocytes from the peripheral blood into skin lesions of LE. We hypothesized that the expression pattern of IFN-inducible proteins reflects the characteristic distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate in different subsets of cutaneous LE. OBJECTIVES: To test this hypothesis in patients with LE. METHODS: Lesional skin biopsies taken from patients with different subsets of LE [chronic discoid LE (CDLE), n = 12; subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), n = 5; LE tumidus (LET), n = 4; LE profundus (LEP), n = 6] were investigated by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to the lymphocyte surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD68, the cytotoxic proteins Tia1 and granzyme B, the chemokine receptor CXCR3, the specifically type I IFN-inducible protein myxovirus protein A (MxA) and the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. RESULTS: The expression pattern of MxA followed the distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate typically seen in the investigated cutaneous LE subsets. In CDLE and SCLE, expression was focused in the epidermis and upper dermis, while in LET a perivascular and in LEP a subcutaneous pattern was found. Similar findings were obtained for CXCL9 and CXCL10. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a close morphological association between the expression pattern of IFN-inducible proteins and the distribution of CXCR3+ CD3+ lymphocytes in all investigated subsets of cutaneous LE. This supports the importance of an IFN-driven inflammation in this condition. Infiltrating lymphocytes carrying CXCL10 in their granules might amplify the lesional inflammation and be responsible for the chronic course of this disease.",M3

It can be seen typically in classic toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), but occasionally occurs in non-drug-induced entities called  TEN-like  diseases (e.g., lupus erythematosus (LE), acute graft versus host disease and pseudoporphyria). We would like to highlight the difficulties of establishing differential diagnoses between  TEN-like  LE and drug reactions, especially when LE has not been previously diagnosed. We report a patient with fulminate pattern of epidermal cell injury resulting in a clinical presentation having combined features of drug-induced TEN and acute cutaneous LE with laboratory findings of systemic LE (SLE) and without systemic symptoms or high-risk drug ingestion. Although most cases of ASAP in the setting of LE are drug-induced TEN, there are reported cases of  TEN-like  LE with subacute progression, absence of systemic involvement and lack of drug ingestion. Such cases usually have a previous history of SLE and positive serologic markers. Although some authors observed that these lesions could be related to systemic severity of SLE, this is the first patient reported who progresses to discoid LE and we think it could be a marker of good prognosis.",M3

17638731,"Efalizumab in the treatment of discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus.BACKGROUND: Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the pathogenesis and the role of cell-mediated immunity remains unclear. Currently, the most effective treatments for severe disease are thalidomide, methotrexate, and cyclosporin, although the evidence for this is limited. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD11a, the alpha-subunit of the leukocyte-functioning antigen 1, with a current license for use in psoriasis. Because discoid lupus erythematosus is known to be predominantly T-cell mediated, our aim was to use efalizumab as a T-cell modulator in patients with recalcitrant disease. OBSERVATIONS: Thirteen patients received efalizumab, with treatment responses varying from good to excellent in 12 of 13 patients. There was a significant reduction in the cutaneous lupus activity and severity score (CLASS) score after therapy with efalizumab (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: We have presented efalizumab as a novel alternative treatment for patients with difficult discoid lupus erythematosus. The response to treatment in 12 patients was very encouraging, with the mean time to response being 5.5 weeks. However, patient numbers were small, and many remain in the early stages of therapy. A prospective randomized study with a long-term follow-up is required, especially in light of recent findings to evaluate both the effectiveness and safety profile of this monoclonal antibody.",M3

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The goal of our study was to present the clinical and therapeutic features of a series of nine patients with discoid lupus erythematosus with eyelid involvement. RESULTS: Lesions of discoid lupus were more frequent in the lower eyelids (seven cases). The palpebral location was the only manifestation of the disease in a 34-year-old woman. In the other cases, cutaneous lesions of typical discoid lupus were noted. Seven patients responded to therapy with antimalarial drugs associated with local corticosteroids and photoprotection. DISCUSSION: Eyelid lesions of discoid lupus erythematosus are rare. Involvement of the lower eyelids is more common. It is important to diagnose discoid lupus of the eyelids because misdiagnosis (isolated form) can delay treatment and cause deformities. The treatment is systemic antimalarial drugs, which have an excellent clinical response.",M3

In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive, reproducible imaging technique already reported to be useful in the evaluation of several inflammatory skin conditions such as contact dermatitis, psoriasis and Darier disease. OBJECTIVES: The aims of our study were to define RCM features of DLE and to evaluate its feasibility in biopsy site selection. METHODS: Discoid lesions were selected for RCM evaluation from 10 patients with an established diagnosis of DLE. Subsequently, a 4-mm punch biopsy of the same areas evaluated with RCM was rendered for histopathological examination. RESULTS: A series of RCM features of DLE was identified and shown to correlate well with histopathological evaluation. Interface changes, as well as epidermal, dermal and adnexal inflammatory cell infiltration, were identified with RCM in a high percentage of the lesions. A limitation of RCM examination besides imaging depth was the inability to distinguish lymphocytes from other white blood cells. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of RCM as a diagnostic tool for DLE awaits further evaluation, although it appears to be promising for biopsy site selection.",M3

We aimed to visualize morphological changes in lesions of cutaneous LE using optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to correlate the OCT findings with histopathology. Six patients with CDLE and five patients with SCLE were investigated. Prior to skin biopsy, OCT assessment was performed on previously marked lesions. The images of OCT and corresponding histology were evaluated side-by-side on the PC screen. The thickening and disruption of the entrance signal in OCT images correlated with the hyperkeratosis which was observed in the histological sections. Atrophy of the epidermis, which was demonstrated by histology, could also be detected in the OCT pictures showing a thinned layer below the entrance signals. On OCT, a patchy reduction of reflectivity was observed in the upper dermis corresponding to dense patchy, partly lichenoid, lymphocytic infiltrates and oedema of the upper dermis. Furthermore, OCT images displayed increased signal-free cavities which histopathologically corresponded to dilated vessels in the upper dermis. All OCT parameters studied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with histopathological features as indicated by coefficients of correlation ranging from 0.55 to 0.94.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteinases that participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and may play an important role in basal membrane (BM) damage in LP. Fibronectin (FN) mediates a variety of cellular interactions with ECM and plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration, growth and differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To determine MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and FN expressions in LP and discuss the possible associations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin biopsy samples of 55 patients with LP and 11 normal skin were investigated. Five discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (DLE) and 5 chronic dermatitis (CD) samples were also examined for comparison. Immunochemical stainings were performed for MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and fibronectin.

FN expression was lost in epidermal basal layer and papillary dermis. CONCLUSION: Loss of MMP-2, MMP-3 and FN in LP can be explained with the destruction of the epidermal basal layer. Similar expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-3 both in LP and DLE implied that these MMPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of interface dermatitis.",M3

Clinical signs included erythema, depigmentation, severe alopecia, crusting, and ulceration. Histologically, the hallmarks of the changes were an interface dermatitis consisting of plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, hydropic degeneration of basal cells, few apoptotic cells in the basal layer, pigmentary incontinence, and a focal thickening of the basement membrane, which was characterized by linear deposition of IgG. Despite the unusual localization the lesion was diagnosed as DLE based on the characteristic histologic and immunohistologic features.

In search of clear criteria for diagnosis of KLC the entire literature pertinent to the subject was studied and findings clinical and histopathologic as they were telegraphed in them were compared with a patient of my own experience. Review of the literature reveals more than 60 patients in whom the diagnosis of KLC was made. Three categories emerge based on whether the findings presented in a particular article (1) do not permit any diagnosis to be rendered; (2) do allow a diagnosis specific to be made, such as of lichen simplex, lichen planus, or lupus erythematosus; or (3) do not correspond to any disease well defined, such as lichen simplex, lichen planus, lupus erythematosus, but seem to show attributes morphologic, clinically and histopathologically, that are repeatable. Patients diagnosed as having KLC obviously represent a potpourri of different diseases, the most common of them being lichen simplex chronicus, lichen planus, and lupus erythematosus. Fewer than 25 patients reported on, however, presented themselves with lesions very similar to one another clinically, namely, an eruption that involved the face in a manner reminiscent of seborrheic dermatitis and with tiny papules on the trunk and extremities, which assumed linear and reticulate shapes by way of confluence of lesions. Individual papules were infundibulocentric and acrosyringocentric. Findings histopathologic were those of a lichenoid interface dermatitis affiliated with numerous necrotic keratocytes and covered by parakeratosis housing neutrophils in staggered fashion. These patients seem to have an authentic and distinctive condition that is exceedingly rare. In conclusion, the diagnosis of KLC should be made only for patients who present themselves with features clinical and findings histopathologic that resemble closely those of what is summarized in this article under category 3.",M3
16761504,"Localized chronic cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus masquerading as pigmented lesions: a new clinical subset?Isolated, hyperpigmented lesions arising on the skin of the head and neck in the elderly rarely prompt consideration of connective tissue diseases. Histologic evaluation, however, may reveal changes compatible with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE). A retrospective review of cutaneous biopsies compatible with CCLE evaluated by the Vanderbilt University Division of Dermatopathology over a five-year period (1998-2002) was undertaken. Cases with isolated lesions arising on the head and neck in patients 40 years or older were selected and the histopathology was confirmed. Patients were interviewed by phone and their charts were reviewed. A total of 11 cases were found, including nine women and two men. These patients averaged 68 years of age and presented with single, hyperpigmented macular lesions. Photosensitivity was rare and no associated stigmata of lupus erythematosus were noted. Response to topical application of corticosteroid preparations was excellent.",M3
16716166,"Type I interferon-associated skin recruitment of CXCR3+ lymphocytes in dermatomyositis.BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin affecting skin and muscles. Infiltrating autoreactive T lymphocytes are thought to play an important pathogenetic role, but it is unclear which mechanisms are involved in the recruitment of these cells. Recent studies provided evidence that a type I interferon (IFN)-driven immune response, including the recruitment of T cells via IP10/CXCR3 interactions, might be important for the generation of skin lesions of cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus (CLE), an autoimmune disease that shares some clinical and histopathological features with DM. We hypothesized that a similar mechanism might also be involved in the pathogenesis of DM skin lesions. METHODS: Skin biopsies of 23 donors (11 DM, 5 healthy controls, 7 CLE controls) were analysed by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, CD123, the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligand IP10/CXCL10, and the myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA)-protein, which is a specific marker for type I IFNs. RESULTS: We detected strong expression of the MxA protein in all DM skin biopsies, indicating involvement of type I IFNs. Expression of MxA was closely associated with expression of the interferon-inducible protein IP10/CXCL10 and the recruitment of CXCR3+ lymphocytes. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells appear to be an important source of type I IFNs in DM. DISCUSSION: Our results support the hypothesis that lesional type I IFN signalling, induction of IP10 expression, and recruitment of potentially autoreactive T cells via IP10/CXCR3 interaction are involved in the pathogenesis of DM skin lesions.",M3
16716159,"Squamous cell carcinoma developing in two Chinese patients with chronic discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus: the need for continued surveillance.Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare late sequel of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE). We report two cases of SCC developing in Chinese patients with CDLE. The first patient had prior biopsies from the same site that showed viral warts and the second patient had multiple histologically confirmed viral warts around the vicinity of the previously excised SCC. In this paper, we emphasize the need to be suspicious of warty lesions on skin afflicted by CDLE, and repeat biopsies should be performed if there is failure to respond to conventional therapy.",M3
16714936,"Discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus presenting as unilateral blepharitis.A 39-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of unilateral blepharitis that did not respond to conventional treatment. Punch biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus. Unilateral blepharitis as the only presenting sign of discoid lupus erythematosus is uncommon but should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with asymmetric blepharitis.",M3
16700672,"A case of discoid <e>lupus</e> erythematosus of the eyelid.A 39-year-old man was first evaluated 12 years ago for erosive erythema of the left lower eyelid. The response to topical therapy was poor. The eyelid lesion was excised on the patient's demand 6 years ago and blepharoplasty was performed. However, recurrence of erythematous plaques at the same site prompted referral to our department. Examination clinically revealed atrophic erythematous plaques and several white papules on the left lower eyelid, in addition to an atrophic erythema of the upper back. The histopathological findings of both plaques and papules were typical of discoid lupus erythematosus. Immunoserological findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus were absent. The lesions improved with administration of low-dose corticosteroids. Discoid lupus erythematosus involving the eyelid is rare, and definitive diagnosis often takes considerable period of time. In patients with lesions of the eyelid such as erythema or papules that are refractory to treatment, skin biopsy and careful physical examination of the entire body for similar lesions are important.",M3
16683689,"Aggressive periodontitis in a patient with chronic cutaneous <e>lupus</e> erythematosus: a case report.Lupus erythematosus is considered to be a high risk factor for periodontitis. As an autoimmune disease of unknown origin, cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is subdivided into 3 categories: chronic (CCLE), subacute (SCLE), and acute (ACLE). While the ACLE has a high prevalence of conjunctive periodontal lesions, aggressive periodontitis in patients with CCLE has been rarely reported. This article describes the case of a patient diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis. Three months after the diagnosis of periodontitis, the patient experienced advancing hair loss (alopecia), pale fingers and toes, as well as edema in the legs and around the eyes. Skin biopsy showed follicular hyperkeratosis with perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate. Colliquation of the basal cells, thickening of the basal lamina, and vacuolar degeneration of basal keratinocytes were also found. A lupus band test was positive, and diagnosis of CCLE was established. Three months following the treatment of lupus with antimalarial agents, the periodontal condition became stable with no further exacerbation or progression of the existing periodontitis. An 11-month postsurgical follow-up revealed stable periodontal and general medical conditions. A patient's medical history should be re-evaluated in the event of recurrence of periodontal lesions refractory to periodontal treatment. The control of systemic conditions like lupus erythematosus is essential for a good prognosis in the treatment of periodontitis as well as for the general health of the patient.",M3
