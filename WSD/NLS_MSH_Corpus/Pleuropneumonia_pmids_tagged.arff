19901289,"Isolation rates, serovars, and toxin genotypes of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-independent Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae among pigs suffering from <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in Spain.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of swine pleuropneumonia, a major production-limiting disease in the pig industry. In the current study, 2,171 lung specimens obtained from pigs housed in 870 Spanish pig farms in regions of substantial pig production were examined. Conventional microbiology, coupled with species-specific polymerase chain reaction, identified 127 biovar 2 isolates, accounting for 25.3% of all A. pleuropneumoniae (n = 502) detected. Most isolates (79%) were recovered as pure primary cultures or as the predominant bacteria from lungs exhibiting lesions typical of acute swine pleuropneumonia. Coagglutination testing identified the isolates as belonging to serovars 2 (4.7%), 4 (4.7%), 7 (68.5%), and 11 (1.6%); however, 26 isolates were nontypeable. All biovar 2 isolates showed genes of the apxII operon alone, which encodes the corresponding ApxII exotoxin, leading to a different gene pattern for isolates in serovars 2, 4, and 11 compared with those of biovar 1. From this survey, it can be concluded that A. pleuropneumoniae biovar 2 infections are common in pigs in Spain, and they may be a common cause of respiratory disease in swine.",M1
19836811,"Pleuritis in slaughter pigs: relations between lung lesions and bacteriology in 10 herds with high pleuritis.Pleuritis in slaughter pigs has increased in recent years in the Netherlands. The aim of the present study was to determine what respiratory pathogens were involved in pleuritis. In total, lungs of 968 slaughter pigs from 10 herds with high prevalence of pleuritis were morphologically examined for size, location, and type of lesions. Moreover, histology and bacteriology were performed. Examination of gross lung lesions showed 45% pleuritis, 14% <e>pleuropneumonia</e> and 38% catarrhal pneumonia. Peribronchiolar cuffing was found in 61 of 142 samples. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was cultured from 22 lung samples from four herds. Pasteurella multocida was cultured from 55 lung samples in eight herds. No specific pattern with respect to the causal pathogens was found. In conclusion, no single infectious cause of pleuritis was found. A variety of infectious agents combined with environmental factors should be considered as a cause of pleuritis.",M1
19751522,"malT knockout mutation invokes a stringent type gene-expression profile in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in bronchoalveolar fluid.BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes contagious <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, an economically important disease of commercially reared pigs throughout the world. To cause this disease, A. pleuropneumoniae must rapidly overcome porcine pulmonary innate immune defenses. Since bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) contains many of the innate immune and other components found in the lungs, we examined the gene expression of a virulent serovar 1 strain of A. pleuropneumoniae after exposure to concentrated BALF for 30 min. RESULTS: In reverse transcription PCR differential display (RT-PCR DD) experiments, A. pleuropneumoniae CM5 exposed to BALF up-regulated, among other genes, a gene predicted to encode LamB, an outer-membrane transport protein of the maltose regulon. To determine the role of the lamB and other genes of the maltose regulon in the pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae, knockout mutations were created in the lamB and malT genes, the latter being the positive transcriptional regulator of the maltose regulon. Relative to the lamB mutant and the wild type, the malT mutant had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in growth rate and an increased sensitivity to fresh porcine serum and high concentrations (more than 0.5 M) of sodium chloride. In DNA microarray experiments, the BALF-exposed malT mutant exhibited a gene-expression profile resembling that of a stringent type gene-expression profile seen in bacteria facing amino acid or carbon starvation. Genes encoding proteins for protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and DNA replication were down-regulated, while genes involved in stringent response (e.g., relA), amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, biofilm formation, DNA transformation, and stress response were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MalT may be involved in protection against some stressors and in the transport of one or more essential nutrients in BALF. Moreover, if MalT is directly or indirectly linked to the stringent response, an important global mechanism of bacterial persistence and virulence in many bacterial pathogens, it might play a role in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis.",M1
19721364,"Prevalence of granulomatous <e>pleuropneumonia</e> associated with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 in slaughter pigs.A total of 14,818 slaughtered pigs were examined macroscopically. Of these, 25 pigs with porcine pleuropneumonia were collected and the relations among Actinobacillus spp. and granulomatous lesions in organs (lungs and tonsils) were evaluated. In the lungs, only Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 was isolated from 20 of the pigs. Histologically, granulomatous pneumonia with A. pleuropneumoniae antigen was detected in 8 of the pigs. The antigen was visible in the centers of the lesions along with asteroid bodies, epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells. In the tonsils, granulomatous lesions were not detected, although A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 (5 pigs), serotype 7 (1 pig), Actinobacillus porcitonsillarum (1 pig) and Actinobacillus minor (1 pig) were isolated. The present survey suggests that multifocal granulomatous pneumonia in slaughter pigs could be highly associated with A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 infection.",M1

18950701,"Identification of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae biovars 1 and 2 in pigs using a PCR assay.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes swine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> worldwide. Previously, we described a gene sequence of approximately 800bp in A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 that encodes a metalloprotease of 24kDa, (Genbank accession no. AY217757). We selected primers carrying the forward and reverse 5'-terminal sequences of this region of the gene for the development of a species-specific PCR assay. The primers amplified an 800bp sequence from isolated DNA and lysed bacteria of the 13 A. pleuropneumoniae biovar 1 serotypes, with the exception of subtype 1b. The primers also amplified the sequence in nasal secretion cultures from pigs with chronic and acute experimental pleuropneumonia. No PCR products were detected when A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes of biovar 2 were used. Internal primers from this gene sequence detected biovar 2 and subtype 1b, leading to the production of a 350bp PCR product. The primers did not amplify DNA from other related species from the Pasteurellaceae family. The 800bp PCR assay was sensitive in vitro, with a detection limit of 5.5pg of extracted DNA, and an average of 120CFU. The specificity and sensitivity of this PCR assay make it a useful method for the rapid identification and diagnosis of A. pleuropneumoniae.",M1
18524457,"Diagnosis of radio-occult pulmonary conditions by real-time chest ultrasonography in patients with pleuritic pain.The evaluation of pleuritic pain in the emergency department (ED) presents a considerable challenge for the attending physician. Chest radiography (CXR) is a basic test, but its sensitivity is low, and often more sophisticated imaging techniques are needed. Our aim is to assess the diagnostic value of bedside B-mode lung ultrasound (LUS) in the visualization of radio-occult pulmonary lesions. Forty-nine patients complaining of pleuritic pain with negative CXR were prospectively studied by LUS. Detection of at least one of the following sonographic signs in the painful thoracic area was considered diagnostic: (i) the absence of pleural sliding; (ii) the focal alveolar-interstitial syndrome (AIS), defined by multiple artifacts B-line; (iii) the peripheral alveolar consolidation (PAC), defined by hypoechoic subpleural images; and (iv) the pleural disruption with thickening and irregularity of the line, with or without localized effusion. The final diagnoses were confirmed by spiral CT scanning (n = 12) and follow-up (n = 37). Final diagnoses were chest wall pain (n = 30), <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (n = 14), pulmonary embolism (n = 4), lung metastasis (n = 1). In 18 patients of the group with pulmonary conditions, LUS showed signs of pleurisy. They were PAC (n = 12), AIS (n = 17), pleural disruption (n = 17). If any sign is considered, the sensitivity of LUS in the diagnosis of radio-occult lesions was 94.7%, specificity was 96.7%, positive and negative predictive values were 94.7% and 96.7%, respectively, and accuracy was 95.9%. In patients with pleuritic pain of unknown cause, real-time LUS enables the diagnosis of radio-occult lung and pleural lesions.",M1
18257211,"Destructive staphylococcal <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in a two-year-old boy with hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome.Hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome (HIES) is a rare immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by elevated serum concentration of IgE, eosinophilia and severe, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Poor regulation of immune system is evident, with decreased production of cytokines, especially interferon. Production of specific antibodies to capsular polysaccharide antigens is decreased Skeletal malformations have been reported in these patients. They can be caused by excessive production of interleukin-4, which may lead to pathologic bony tissue resorption. Due to immune system deficiency and malformations of skeletal and connective tissue, HIES is a multisystem disorder. We present a patient with recurrent bacterial infections since the early age. At the age of two years he presented with severe destructive staphylococcal pneumonia with pleural effusion, pneumatocela formation and pneumothorax. The patient also had a dysmorphic face and skeletal malformations that were most evident at the head. The diagnosis of HIES was made on the basis of elevated serum concentrations of IgE, hypereosinophily, and decreased leukocyte function in vivo and in vitro. Family history of our patient showed an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern of HIES.",M1
18065168,"ISApl1, a novel insertion element of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, prevents ApxIV-based serological detection of serotype 7 strain AP76.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a gram-negative rod of the Pasteurellaceae family, causes <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in pigs. Establishing A. pleuropneumoniae free herds is difficult due to the occurrence of persistently infected animals. The ApxIV toxin is expressed by A. pleuropneumoniae in vivo and an ELISA based on the toxin is used to detect infection and to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. In this study, we have identified a 1070bp insertion element of the IS30 family, designated ISApl1, in the A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 7 strain AP76. ISApl1 contains a 924bp ORF encoding a transposase, which is flanked by 27bp inverted repeats showing six mismatches. We investigated the occurrence of ISApl1 in other A. pleuropneumoniae strains, and its possible interference with virulence associated factors. Four insertion sites were identified in AP76: within the apxIVA toxin ORF, within a putative autotransporter adhesin ORF, upstream of a capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster, and downstream of a beta-lactamase gene. ISApl1 is also present in some serotype 7 field isolates, but not in reference or field strains of other serotypes. In A. pleuropneumoniae AP76, the transposase gene is transcribed in vitro. The insertion in the apxIVA toxin gene remains stable after animal passage. Since this insertion should disrupt toxin expression, we tested 7 pigs infected with AP76 at day 21 post-infection. All were negative in the ApxIV ELISA but four out of seven were positive in an ApxII toxin ELISA. These results show that insertion elements can affect the detection of A. pleuropneumoniae infected animals.",M1
17917383,"Isolation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 15-like strain from a field case of porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in Japan.An Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain isolated from a field case of porcine pleuropneumonia in Japan, was closely related to a reference strain of serovar 15, which is a newly proposed serovar according to an analysis of field isolates originating from Australia. The isolate had biological and biochemical properties consistent with A. pleuropneumoniae biovar 1, and reacted strongly to a rabbit antiserum raised against a reference strain of serovar 15 in an agar gel precipitation test. The nucleotide sequence of a hyper variable region in the 16S RNA gene of the isolate was identical to that of the reference strain of serovar 15. The isolate possessed A. pleuropneumoniae-RTX toxin (Apx) II, III, and IV genes, consistent with serovar 15. Its virulence in mice was lower than that of ApxI-bearing strains but higher than that of other ApxIII-bearing strains. This is the first report describing the isolation of A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 15-like strain from a country or region other than Australia.",M1
17027123,"Development of a DIVA subunit vaccine against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the causative agent of porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> which leads to high economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Vaccination against this pathogen is hampered by the occurrence of 15 serotypes, and commonly used whole cell bacterin vaccines are not sufficiently cross-serotype protective. In addition, for generating and maintaining specified pathogen-free herds it is desirable to use DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) vaccines. Based on a detergent wash extraction of outer membrane associated proteins and secreted proteins we developed a DIVA vaccine using the immunogenic ApxII toxin which is present in 13 of the 15 A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes as the DIVA antigen. The apxIIA gene was deleted in one strain each of serotypes 1, 2, and 5 using a single-step transconjugation system, and equal parts of detergent washes from these strains served as the vaccine antigen. After intramuscular immunisation all pigs developed a strong humoral immune response to the vaccine antigen and showed no reactivity in an ApxIIA ELISA. Upon challenge all pigs were completely protected from clinical symptoms in trials with a homologous (serotype 2) as well as with a heterologous strain (serotype 9); in addition, colonisation of the challenge strain was clearly reduced but not abolished completely. As a result of the highly efficient protection, however, immunised pigs did not develop antibodies to the DIVA-antigen at levels detectable by ELISA but only by a more sensitive Western blotting approach, thereby demonstrating the challenge in developing appropriate marker vaccines for the livestock industry.",M1
16930871,"Characterization and immunogenicity of an apxIA mutant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the aetiological agent of porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, a highly contagious and often fatal disease. A candidate live vaccine strain, potentially capable of cross-serovar protection, was constructed by deleting the section of the apxIA gene coding for the C-terminal segment of ApxI toxin of the A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 10 reference strain (D13039) and inserting a chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette. The mutant strain (termed D13039A(-)Chl(r)) produced an approximately 48kDa protein corresponding to the N-terminus of the ApxI toxin, and exhibited no haemolytic activity and lower virulence in mice compared with the parental strain. The mutant was evaluated in a vaccination-challenge trial in which pigs were given two intra-nasal doses of the mutant at 14 days intervals and then challenged 14 days after the last vaccination with either A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 1 (4074) or serovar 2 (S1536) or serovar 10 (D13039) reference strains. The haemolysin neutralisation titres of the pre-challenge sera were significantly higher in the vaccinated pigs than in the unvaccinated pigs. The mortalities, clinical signs and lung lesion scores in the vaccinated pigs were significantly lower than those in the unvaccinated pigs for the serovar 1 challenge. A significantly lower lung lesion score was also observed in the vaccinated pigs, compared with unvaccinated pigs, for serovar 2 challenge. Our work suggests that the mutant strain offers potential as a live attenuated pleuropneumonia vaccine that can provide cross-serovar protection.",M1

16629195,"<e>Pleuropneumonia</e> as a sequela of myelography and general anaesthesia in a Thoroughbred colt.A 3-year-old Thoroughbred colt was presented to the University Veterinary Centre Camden for evaluation of ataxia. The horse was anaesthetised to facilitate cervical radiography and myelographic examination of the spinal cord. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. Five days after general anaesthesia the horse re-presented with pleuropneumonia. It was euthanased 24 hours after presentation on humane grounds. Necropsy revealed severe tracheal erosion over the middle third of the ventral surface of the trachea, pleuropneumonia and narrowing of the cervical cord between C4 and C6. It is postulated that extension and flexion of the neck during myelography resulted in movement of the endotracheal tube cuff, causing the tracheal lesion and predisposing the colt to pleuropneumonia. Severe tracheal lesions and pleuropneumonia have not been reported as sequela of equine myelography, and should be considered as possible complications following repeated cervical manipulation during myelography in the horse.",M1

16354860,"Contrast-enhanced sonography for differential diagnosis of pleurisy and focal pleural lesions of unknown cause.BACKGROUND: Ultrasound enables the visualization of pleural-based lesions with a poor correlation to specific pathology. At this time, there are no data about the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced sonography (CES) in pleural lesions. METHODS: From August 2004 to January 2005, 25 consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of pleurisy and focal pleural lesions of unknown origin seen on B-mode ultrasonography were prospectively studied by CES. The lesions were diagnosed as <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (n = 12), pulmonary embolism/infarction (n = 7), malignant lymphoma (n = 2), pleural metastasis (n = 2), granuloma (n = 1), and unknown cause (n = 1). The diagnosis of the lesions was confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT scanning (n = 20), scintigraphy (n = 3), and follow-up (n = 2). Time to the enhancement of the contrast agent was determined. The CES patterns were evaluated during the arterial phase (ie, 2 to 30 s) and the parenchymal phase (ie, 1 to 5 min). The extent of the enhancement of pleural lesions was classified using normal liver tissue as an in vivo reference (absent, hypoechoic, isoechoic, hyperrechoic, or mixed echogenicity). RESULTS: In 20 patients, an enhancement of the pleural lesion was seen. All 12 patients with pleuropneumonia had a short time to enhancement (between 1 and 6 s), and a marked enhancement (isoechoic/hyperechoic) during the arterial and parenchymal phase. In the remaining 13 patients with other diagnoses than pleuropneumonia, 5 patients had no enhancement and 8 patients had a delayed time to enhancement (&gt; 6 s). The extent of the enhancement was reduced (hypoechoic/anechoic) in 12 of 13 patients during the arterial and parenchymal phases. CONCLUSION: In patients with pleurisy and pleural lesions of unknown cause that were found sonographically, CES enables the diagnosis or exclusion of pleuropneumonia.",M1
16337664,"Emulsifier content and side effects of oil-based adjuvant vaccine in swine.Side effects caused by the excessive emulsifier in oil-based adjuvant vaccine were examined practically in swine using one oil-in-water type adjuvant vaccine against swine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>. The vaccine was prepared from cell-free-antigen of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, liquid paraffin, and several polyoxyethylenesorbitan and sorbitan oleates. Based on findings about safety in mice and emulsion stability, 2 vaccines containing either 11.25% or 6.25% emulsifier content were injected intramuscularly twice in swine, as the highest and lowest limits, respectively, within the practical range. All pigs showed temporary fever and malaise with anorexia for several days after each injection. The fever of the higher emulsifier content group took significantly longer to recover than the lower. Malaise also showed a similar tendency. On the other hand, antibody response was sufficiently induced with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Lowering the emulsifier content is a very simple but effective solution for mitigation of side effects without the reduction of adjuvanticity. For safe and high-quality oil-based adjuvant vaccines, not only antigen and base-oil, but emulsifier content must be optimized.",M1

15730135,"Expression of mRNA encoding interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 in lungs from pigs experimentally infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.The expression of mRNA encoding interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 was studied, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridization with a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled cDNA probe, in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded lung tissue from pigs experimentally infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Forty-eight 7-week-old colostrum-deprived pigs were randomly allocated to infected (n = 24) or control (n = 24) groups. Three pigs from each group were euthanized at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post inoculation (hpi). IL-10 mRNA was detected in the lung at 3 hpi, numbers of cells positive for IL-10 increasing at 36 hpi. IL-12p35 mRNA was detected in the lung at 3 hpi, numbers of cells positive for IL-12p35 increasing at 36 and 48 hpi and rapidly decreasing thereafter whereas IL-12p40 mRNA was constitutively expressed at low levels during the experiment. Hybridization signals for IL-10, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 were always associated with inflammation, in particular with macrophages and neutrophils within alveolar spaces. Expression of these cytokines was minimal in non-lesional lung of A. pleuropneumoniae-infected pigs and in normal lung from control pigs. In situ hybridization of A. pleuropneumoniae and these cytokines in serial sections of lung tissues indicated close co-localization of A. pleuropneumoniae and these cytokines in <e>pleuropneumonia</e>.

15648941,"An evaluation of the role of antibodies to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 1 and 15 in the protection provided by sub-unit and live streptomycin-dependent <e>pleuropneumonia</e> vaccines.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the serological response of pigs receiving either the Porcilis APP vaccine or a modified live vaccine based on a streptomycin-dependent (SD) strain of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and then challenged with an Australian isolate of A. pleuropneumoniae of either serovar 1 or 15 as a means of understanding the protection provided by both vaccines against serovar 1 but not against serovar 15. DESIGN: The serological tests evaluated were serovar-specific polysaccharide ELISA tests (for serovar 1 and 15), ELISA tests for antibodies to three A. pleuropneumoniae toxins (ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII) as well as to a 42 kDa outer membrane protein (OMP), a haemolysin neutralisation (HN) assay and immunoblotting. The tests were used to detect antibodies in vaccinated pigs that had been shown to be protected against serovar 1 but not serovar 15. RESULTS: In the polysaccharide antigen ELISA assays, both vaccines resulted in a significant rise in the titre in the serovar 1 ELISA but not the serovar 15 ELISA. The Porcilis APP vaccinated pigs showed a significant response in the ApxI, ApxIII and 42 kDa OMP ELISA. In the ApxII ELISA, all pigs tested (the Porcilis APP vaccinates and the controls) were positive on entry to the trial. In the HN assay, the Porcilis APP vaccinated pigs showed a significant response after one dose while the SD vaccinated pigs required two doses of vaccine before a marked rise in titre was induced. Immunoblotting revealed that neither vaccine generated antibodies that recognised the ApxIII produced by serovar 15. CONCLUSIONS: The failure of these vaccines to provide protection against serovar 15 may be due to novel virulence factors possessed by serovar 15, significant differences between the ApxIII toxin of serovar 15 and those present in the Porcilis APP vaccine or failure by both vaccines to induce antibodies to the serovar 15 specific polysaccharide.",M1
15530740,"Risk assessment of transmission of capsule-deficient, recombinant Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of swine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>. Live, non-encapsulated vaccine strains have been shown to be efficacious in preventing acute disease in pigs. Recombinant DNA technology has the advantage of generating defined mutants that are safe, but maintain critical immunoprotective components. However, some recombinant strains have the disadvantage of containing antibiotic resistance genes that could be transferred to the animal's normal bacterial flora. Using DNA allelic exchange we have constructed attenuated, capsule-deficient mutants of A. pleuropneumoniae that contain a kanamycin resistance (Kn(R)) gene within the capsule locus of the genome. Following intranasal or intratracheal challenge of pigs the encapsulated parent strains colonized the challenge pigs, and were transmitted to contact pigs. In contrast, the capsule-deficient mutants were recovered only from the challenged pigs and not from contact pigs. Each kanamycin-resistant colony type recovered from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts of pigs challenged with the recombinant strain was screened with a probe specific for the Kn(R) gene. All probe-positive colonies were assayed for the specific Kn(R) gene by amplification of a 0.9 kb fragment of the antibiotic resistance gene by PCR. The 0.9 kb fragment was amplified from the recombinant A. pleuropneumoniae colonies, but not from any of the heterologous bacteria, indicating there was no evidence of transmission of the Kn(R) gene to resident bacteria. Following aerosol exposure of 276 pigs with recombinant, non-encapsulated A. pleuropneumoniae the recombinant bacteria were not recovered from any nasal swabs of 75 pigs tested or environmental samples 18 h after challenge. Statistical risk analysis, based on the number of kanamycin-resistant colonies screened, indicated that undetected transmission of the Kn(R) gene could still have occurred in at most 1.36% of kanamycin-resistant bacteria in contact with recombinant A. pleuropneumoniae. However, the overall risk of transmission to any resident bacteria was far lower. Our results indicate there was little risk of transmission of capsule-deficient, recombinant A. pleuropneumoniae or its Kn(R) gene to contact pigs or to the resident microflora.",M1

However, the PstI restriction endonuclease pattern produced by the goat adenovirus was distinct from that of OAdV-2. This is the first report of enteritis in goats with an adenovirus antigenically related to OAdV-2 and with a parvo-like dependovirus.",M1
15272463,"Comparison of the efficacy of a subunit and a live streptomycin-dependent porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> vaccine.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of two new-generation porcine pleuropneumonia vaccines when challenged with Australian isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae of serovars 1 and 15. DESIGN: The Porcilis APP vaccine and an experimental streptomycin-dependent strain of A pleuropneumoniae were evaluated in a standardised pen trial. Each vaccine/challenge group consisted of 10 pigs. RESULTS: With the serovar 1 challenge, the Porcilis APP vaccine and the live vaccine, compared with the control group, gave significant protection in terms of clinical signs, lung lesions, re-isolation scores and average daily gain (ADG) postchallenge. Only the Porcilis APP vaccine provided significant protection against mortality. In the serovar 15 challenged pigs, the only significant difference detected was that the Porcilis APP vaccinated pigs had a better postchallenge ADG than the controls. None of the Porcilis APP vaccinated pigs showed signs of depression postvaccination and none were euthanased after challenge with either serovar 1 or 15. The pigs vaccinated with the live vaccine showed obvious depression after each vaccination and a total of 3 pigs were euthanased after challenge (one with serovar 1 and two with serovar 15). CONCLUSIONS: Both of the vaccines provided significant protection against a severe challenge with serovar 1 A pleuropneumoniae. Neither vaccine was effective against a serovar 15 A pleuropneumoniae challenge. There was evidence that the Porcilis APP vaccine did provide some protection against the serovar 15 challenge because the ADG, after challenge of pigs given this vaccine, was greater than the control pigs.",M1
15135509,"Both ApxI and ApxII of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 are necessary for full virulence.Most serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae produce more than one toxin in vivo. To determine the value of the production of more than one toxin in the development of disease, we tested the pathogenicity of isogenic strains of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 that are mutated in the toxin genes apxIA and/or apxIIA or in the transport genes apxIBD. Bacteria mutated in both apxIA and apxIIA, or in apxIBD, were unable to induce pathological lesions, thereby confirming the conclusion that ApxI and ApxII are essential for the pathogenesis of <e>pleuropneumonia</e>. Infection with isogenic strains lacking either ApxI or ApxII did not consistently lead to pleuropneumonia unlike the parent strain S4074. ApxII seemed at least as important as ApxI for the development of clinical and pathological symptoms. Only one of the four pigs inoculated with a mutant strain unable to produce ApxII developed mild pneumonia whereas two out of the three pigs inoculated with a mutant strain unable to produce ApxI developed more severe lesions. The results indicate that both ApxI and ApxII of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 are necessary for full virulence.",M1

15066725,"Use of recombinant ApxIV in serodiagnosis of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections, development and prevalidation of the ApxIV ELISA.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, which causes worldwide severe losses in pig farming. The virulence of the 15 serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae is mainly determined by the three major RTX toxins ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII, which are secreted by the different serotypes in various combinations. A fourth RTX toxin, ApxIV, is produced by all 15 serotypes only during infection of pigs, but not under in vitro conditions. Pigs infected with A. pleuropneumoniae show specific antibodies directed against ApxIV. In contrast, antibodies against the other three toxins ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII are also found in pigs free of A. pleuropneumoniae. The antibodies to the three latter might result from other, less pathogenic Actinobacillus species such as A. rossii and A. suis. We used a recombinant protein based on the N'-terminal part of ApxIV to serologically detect A. pleuropneumoniae infections in pigs by immunoblot analysis. The analysis of sera of experimentally infected pigs revealed that ApxIV-immunoblots detected A. pleuropneumoniae infections in the second to third week post infection. We developed an indirect ELISA based on the purified recombinant N'-terminal moiety of ApxIV. The analysis of sera from pigs that were experimentally or naturally infected by A. pleuropneumoniae, and of sera of pigs that were free of A. pleuropneumoniae, revealed that the ELISA had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 93.8%. The pre-validation study of the ApxIV-ELISA revealed that the latter was able to detect A. pleuropneumoniae-positive herds, even when clinical and pathological signs of porcine pleuropneumonia were not evident. Pigs vaccinated with a subunit vaccine Porcilis App were serologically negative in the ApxIV-ELISA.",M1
15028889,"A hematogenic <e>pleuropneumonia</e> caused by postoperative septic thrombophlebitis in a Thoroughbred gelding.A 7-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was admitted to Equine Hospital, Korea Racing Association for evaluation and treatment of colic. Based on the size and duration of the large colonic and cecal impaction, a routine ventral midline celiotomy and large colon enterotomy were performed to relieve the impaction. Six days following surgery the gelding exhibited signs of lethargy, fever, inappetence and diarrhea. Eleven days following surgery, the jugular veins showed a marked thrombophlebitis. On the sixteenth day of hospitalization the gelding died suddenly. Upon physical examination, the horse was febrile, tachycardic and tachypnoeic. Thoracic excursion appeared to be increased; however, no abnormal lung sounds were detected. No cough or nasal discharge was present. Hematology revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis. Serum biochemistry was normal but plasma fibrinogen increased. In necropsy, fibrinopurulent fluid was present in the thoracic cavity. There were firm adhesions between visceral pleura and thoracic wall. White, mixed and red thrombi were formed in both jugular veins from the insertion point of IV catheter. Histopathological examination showed fibrinopurulent inflammation and vascular thrombosis in the lung. The pleura showed edematous thickening and severe congestion. The clinicopathological and pathological findings suggest that septic thrombi associated with septic thrombophlebitis metastasized into the pulmonary circulation and were entrapped in the pulmonary parenchyma and provoked pleuropneumonia.",M1

Although serum levels of endostatin have extensively been studied in patients with malignant diseases, endostatin in pleural effusion has not been fully evaluated. In order to determine whether endostatin is present in pleural effusion, and to determine whether endostatin levels vary in pleural effusion of different etiology, we measured levels of endostatin in 38 malignant pleural effusion due to lung cancer patients and 29 patients with non-malignant disease using an ELISA kit. Free form of endostatin was measurable (&gt; 11.2 pg/ml) in 26 of 38 malignant and 13 of 29 non-malignant pleural effusion. Endostatin levels in the 38 malignant pleural effusion were significantly higher than those in patients with the 29 patients with non-malignant diseases ( p = 0.0131). However, there was not statistically significant difference between the patients with <e>pleuropneumonia</e> and those with tuberculous pleurisy ( p = 0.2194). In malignant pleural effusion due to lung cancer, the pleural effusion endostatin levels did not differ when the histological types of lung cancer were considered ( p = 0.0674). Endostatin was present in both malignant and non-malignant pleural effusion, and elevated levels of endostatin were observed in malignant pleural effusion. Although the mechanisms are unclear, elevated levels of endostatin in pleural effusion may represent the local productions of endostatin in pleural space.",M1

To determine if inflammatory cytokines are associated with A. pleuropneumoniae-induced pneumonia, infected and noninfected animals were concomitantly administered saline or dexamethasone. METHODS: Twenty-four swine were treated with saline, A. pleuropneumoniae, dexamethasone, or A. pleuropneumoniae and dexamethasone (n = 6). The plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were examined through time of necropsy (72 h). Gross pathology and histopathology was performed on all animals. RESULTS: Dexamethasone had no effect on A. pleuropneumoniae-induced increases in lung/body weight ratios. Gross pathology of the infected pigs included fibrinous pleuropneumonia with necrosis and hemorrhage in a focal to a multifocal pattern. Histopathology of infected pig lungs revealed necrotizing extensive, fibrinopurulent pneumonia with edema and fibrinopurulent pleuritis. Plasma IL-6 levels were elevated in A. pleuropneumoniae-infected animals beginning 6 h after infection. Dexamethasone treatment did not alter A. pleuropneumoniae-induced plasma IL-6 levels. A. pleuropneumoniae infection did not elicit plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, or IL-10. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the pneumonia caused by A. pleuropneumoniae infection is not due to the release of systemic inflammatory cytokines.",M1

12626448,"Rapid detection of contagious bovine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> by a Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC capsular polysaccharide-specific antigen detection latex agglutination test.A latex agglutination test (LAT) has been developed for the diagnosis of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP). The latex microspheres were coated with MmmSC polyclonal immunoglobulin G antiserum and detected MmmSC antigen in the serum of cattle infected with CBPP and in growth medium containing MmmSC. The specific antigen recognized by this test appeared to be the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). The LAT recognized all 23 strains of MmmSC examined in this study, with a sensitivity level of 2 ng of CPS, or the equivalent of 5 x 10(3) CFU, in a reaction volume of 0.03 ml. Therefore, rapid identification of MmmSC cultures should be possible. Agglutination was also observed with the related goat pathogens and  Mycoplasma mycoides  cluster members Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides large colony biotype (four of six strains positive) and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (three of six strains positive), in agreement with the suggestion that these latter two mycoplasmas may in fact represent a single species (although collectively exhibiting two capsular serotypes). Comparisons in diagnosis with the complement fixation test (CFT) were made by using African field sera from CBPP-infected cattle. After 2 (or 3) min of incubation, the test detected 55% (or 61%) of CFT-positive sera and 29% (or 40%) of CFT-negative sera, with an overall correlation in diagnosis of 62% (or 61%). The rates for false-positive diagnoses made by using  known  CBPP-negative sera from the United Kingdom were 3 or 13% after 2 or 3 min of incubation, respectively. The data agree with previous findings that some CBPP CFT-negative misdiagnoses may occur due to  antibody eclipsing  by excess circulating antigen. The LAT combines low cost and high specificity with ease of application in the field, without the need for any specialist training or equipment.",M1

11856584,"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections in closed swine herds: infection patterns and serological profiles.Many farrow-to-finish herds are endemically infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In order to control the disease efficiently, a better knowledge of the ages at which pigs become infected is necessary. Furthermore, no information is available concerning the influence of maternally derived antibodies on the colonization of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, A. pleuropneumoniae infection patterns were studied in five farrow-to-finish pig herds (A-E) with a history of <e>pleuropneumonia</e>. A longitudinal study was carried out in herds A and B. In these herds, piglets from sows carrying A. pleuropneumoniae in their noses or tonsils were sampled. Nasal and tonsillar swabs as well as sera, were collected from these animals at the age of 4, 8, 12, 16 (herds A and B) and 23 weeks (herd B). At these ages other pigs from the same sows were euthanized. The lungs were macroscopically examined and samples from nose, tonsils and lungs were collected at necropsy. A cross-sectional study was performed in herds C-E. In these herds nasal and tonsillar swabs, as well as sera, were taken from 10 animals of 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Lung, nasal and tonsillar samples were tested for the presence of A. pleuropneumoniae by routine bacteriology and PCR with mixed bacterial cultures. The sera were examined for the presence of Apx toxin neutralizing antibodies. In herd A, A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 and 10 strains were isolated, whereas serotype 2, 3, 5b and 8 strains were demonstrated in herd B. In most herds, A. pleuropneumoniae was detected in mixed bacterial cultures of tonsillar and/or nasal samples by PCR from the age of 4 weeks onwards. Colonization of the lungs and development of lung lesions was observed in 12- and 16-week-old animals of herd A and 23-week-old animals of herd B. In most herds, high antibody titres were detected in 4-week-old piglets. These titres decreased during the first 12 weeks of age, but thereafter, increased. It was concluded that PCR with mixed bacterial cultures from tonsillar swabs is a valuable tool for the detection of infected animals. It was also concluded that colonization of tonsils and nasal mucosae can occur in the presence of maternally derived antibodies. Infection of the upper respiratory tract without lung involvement did not result in development of Apx toxin neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, such serological assays cannot be used for the detection of subclinically infected animals.",M1
11731178,"Attenuation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by inactivation of aroQ.Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the aetiological agent of porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, a disease resulting in morbidity and mortality of pigs and accordingly economic losses within the swine industry. In order to construct a potential vaccine strain of A. pleuropneumoniae for control of this disease, the aroQ gene, required for the aromatic biosynthetic pathway, was targeted for inactivation. The resulting strain was tested for virulence within pigs. The aroQ gene and an adjacent gene, dapD, were cloned. A recombination cassette, for inactivation of aroQ, was constructed from these cloned genes by inserting an ampicillin resistance gene and this was transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae. Integration of this construct into the chromosomal location of aroQ and disruption of the aroQ/dapD gene arrangement was confirmed through PCR and Southern analysis. The resulting HS25 aroQ mutants were unable to grow in a chemically defined medium and following intratracheal delivery to pigs were only able to induce lung lesions when given at a level 10,000 times greater than that of the parent strain. Complementation with an in trans, functional, aroQ gene restored the ability of the mutant strain to grow in a chemically defined medium and virulence, when tested in pigs, confirming attenuation results from inactivation of aroQ. In conclusion, this work has constructed a defined mutant of A. pleuropneumoniae that is attenuated and may be safely delivered live to pigs.",M1

In pigs infected with either serotype 2 or 6, a hybridization signal for apxIICA, apxIIICA, apxIBD, and apxIIIBD was detected, and in pigs infected with serotype 5, a hybridization signal for apxICA, apxIICA, and apxIBD was detected in the pneumonic lesions. A hybridization signal for apxIICA and apxIBD was detected in pigs infected with serotype 7. A strong hybridization signal for apx genes was seen in streaming degenerate alveolar leukocytes bordering zones of coagulative necrosis. Simultaneous detection of hybridization signals for the apxCA and apxBD genes provided scientific evidence that the expression of the apx genes could be potential indicators of the production of corresponding Apx toxins.

10904819,"Towards an understanding of equine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>: factors relevant for control.OBJECTIVE: To review relevant literature on factors associated with the development of equine pleuropneumonia. DESIGN: A review of the literature using a range of databases including Current Contents, Medline, ChemAbstracts, Biological Abstracts and CAB and a comprehensive search strategy which involved use of keywords, author and subject category searches. Additional sources included review of articles cited by key accumulated references. RESULTS: Since the early years of this century, many of the  gaps  in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease have been filled. We now know that equine pleuropneumonia results from contamination of the lower respiratory tract with bacteria similar to the normal oropharyngeal microbiota of the horse and that transportation of any mode, especially over long distances (and consequently with no or short rest periods), is the single most important predisposing factor for this disease. This is associated with restraint of horses such that they are unable to lower their heads, which leads to increased opportunity for lower respiratory tract contamination and a reduced opportunity for clearance. Strenuous exercise also results in lower respiratory tract contamination and exercise subsequent to transportation exerts additive detrimental effects on the defenses of the lower respiratory tract. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: While modern veterinary medicine and surgery have significantly reduced the death rate from pleuropneumonia, horses that develop the disease have a high probability of not returning to their prior use. This underscores the importance of developing the most effective strategies for its prevention.",M1

10899882,"Interleukin-10 gene therapy-mediated amelioration of bacterial pneumonia.Respiratory infection by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes a highly pathogenic necrotizing <e>pleuropneumonia</e> with severe edema, hemorrhage and fever. Acute infection is characterized by expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and IL-8. To determine if high level production of inflammatory cytokines contributed to disease pathogenesis, we investigated if inhibiting macrophage activation with adenovirus type 5-expressed IL-10 (Ad-5/IL-10) reduced the severity of acute disease. Porcine tracheal epithelial cells infected with Ad-5/IL-10 produced bioactive human IL-10. When pigs were intratracheally infected with A. pleuropneumoniae, pigs pretreated with Ad-5/IL-10 showed a significant reduction in the amount of lung damage when compared to adenovirus type 5-expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-5/beta-Gal)-treated and untreated pigs. In addition, serum zinc levels were unchanged, the lung weight/body weight ratio (an indicator of vascular leakage) was significantly reduced, and lung pathology scores were reduced. Myeloperoxidase activity in lung lavage fluid samples, an indicator of neutrophil invasion, was decreased to levels similar to that seen in pigs not infected with A. pleuropneumoniae. Reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels in lung lavage fluid samples correlated with the clinical observations in that pigs pretreated with Ad-5/IL-10 showed a corresponding reduction of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) compared with untreated and Ad-5/beta-Gal-treated pigs. IL-6 levels were unaffected by pretreatment with Ad-5/IL-10, consistent with observations that IL-6 was not derived from alveolar macrophages. Since inflammatory cytokines are expressed at high levels in acute bacterial pleuropneumonia, these results indicate that macrophage activation, involving overproduction of IL-1 and TNF, is a prime factor in infection-related cases of massive lung injury.",M1
10863596,"Pneumothorax in horses: 40 cases (1980-1997).OBJECTIVE: To characterize pneumothorax in horses and to describe clinical signs, diagnostic testing, and clinical outcome of horses with pneumothorax. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 40 horses. PROCEDURE: Medical records of horses with pneumothorax were reviewed to obtain information on signalment, history, clinical signs, diagnostic testing, treatment, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Horses developed pneumothorax secondary to <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (17 horses), open wounds of the thorax (9), closed trauma to the thorax (7), surgery on the upper portion of the respiratory tract (3), and surgery involving the thoracic cavity (1); 3 horses had pneumothorax of unknown cause. Clinical signs included tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, lack of lung sounds on auscultation of the dorsal aspect of the thorax, fever, tachycardia, signs of depression or anxiousness, and cough. Radiography and ultrasonography were useful to definitively diagnose pneumothorax. Pneumothorax was bilateral in 47.5% (19/40) and unilateral in 42.5% (17/40) of horses; designation of unilateral versus bilateral was not recorded in the remaining 4 horses. Horses with pneumothorax secondary to pleuropneumonia more commonly had unilateral pneumothorax (64.7% for unilateral vs 29.4% for bilateral; not specified for 1 horse). Horses with pneumothorax secondary to pleuropneumonia were less likely to survive than horses with pneumothorax secondary to other causes (35.3 vs 69.6% survived, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pleuropneumonia is an important cause of pneumothorax in horses. Classic clinical signs of pneumothorax may not be evident. Radiography, ultrasonography, or both may be required for diagnosis. Prognosis for survival is better for horses with pneumothorax not associated with pleuropneumonia.",M1
10850846,"Pathophysiologic correlates of acute porcine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>.OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate an in vivo model to study early events in the pathogenesis of acute porcine pleuropneumonia. ANIMALS: Thirty-six 6- to 8-week-old pigs. PROCEDURE: Pigs were inoculated intranasally or endotracheally with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae; inoculation routes were compared by evaluation of clinical signs, gross and microscopic lung lesions, hematologic changes, serum zinc, iron, and haptoglobin concentrations, and inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: The 2 inoculation routes resulted in similar findings, although intranasal inoculation caused unilateral gross lung lesions, whereas endotracheal inoculation caused bilateral gross lesions. Clinical signs of disease were observed &lt; 2 hours after endotracheal inoculation and 6 to 8 hours after intranasal inoculation. Total WBC counts did not differ significantly after inoculation by either inoculation route, although band neutrophils increased significantly. The earliest findings associated with A pleuropneumoniae inoculation, irrespective of route, were decreased serum zinc and iron concentrations. Serum haptoglobin concentrations were significantly increased after inoculation. Inoculation induced rapid influx of macrophages into the lung and local induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from lung tissue indicated that inoculated pigs had increased concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1alpha, and IL-8; tumor necrosis factor messenger RNA concentration was not increased. CONCLUSIONS: Endotracheal inoculation with A pleuropneumoniae rapidly and consistently induced diffuse bilateral pneumonia; thus, this method may be useful for the study of acute pathophysiologic changes associated with bacterial pneumonia and may provide an experimental model for testing modalities for prevention and treatment of this and other respiratory tract diseases of pigs.",M1

Nine RAPD types and 14 PFGE patterns were identified. No common RAPD or PFGE patterns were found between strains of serotype 1 and those of serotype 5. The RAPD analysis indicated that the 15 serotype 1 strains isolated from diseased pigs were assigned to 4 RAPD types, with 66% of strains characterized by the same RAPD type. By contrast, the 5 strains of serotype 1 isolated from healthy carriers were dispersed in 4 RAPD types. These data suggest that the diversity of strains isolated from healthy pigs could be higher than that of strains recovered from diseased pigs. In addition, all serotype 5 strains exhibited a unique RAPD type. Unlike RAPD, PFGE analysis allowed discrimination among isolates of serotype 1 and among those of serotype 5. All but 3 isolates showed the same apx genotype as their respective serotype reference strain. These data indicate that RAPD analysis is a valuable rapid tool for routine subtyping of strains of serotype 1.

The indications for thoracoscopy was diagnostic in 19 cases, therapeutic in 11 cases and both diagnostic and therapeutic in 2 cases. Twenty-six thoracoscopies were done standing whereas 6 were performed under general anaesthesia. The specific procedures performed during thoracoscopy were exploratory only (7), biopsy of the lung and lymph nodes (10), drain placement into pleural effusions (2) and abscesses (5), exploration prior to thoracotomy (2), transection of pleural adhesions and decortication (1) and window pericardectomy (2). Diaphragmatic hernia repair (2) and partial pneumonectomy (1) were initiated thoracoscopically but conversion to thoracotomy was necessary for completion. Standing thoracoscopy was well tolerated in most horses. Transient exacerbation of pulmonary compromise evidenced by tachypnoea was readily alleviated by reinflation of the lung. Standing thoracoscopy provided good visualisation of the dorsal and lateral structures of the thorax.

Ultrasonographic examination revealed an accumulation of anechogenic to hypoechogenic fluid in the pleural space in the ventral thorax of all the animals. In one animal, echogenic bands of fibrin were observed between the thoracic wall and pulmonary surface. In another, parts of the right lung were not inflated because of severe bronchopneumonia. Radiographic examination revealed a pleural effusion, apparent as a horizontal fluid line, in three animals. In addition, the increased radiopacity in parts of the dorsal lung fields and increased bronchial and peribronchial markings suggested bronchopneumonia. In three animals, the radiographs revealed linear foreign bodies in the reticulum, suggesting that the pleuropneumonia was caused by the penetration of the foreign body into the thoracic cavity.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 21 horses. RESULTS: 19 of the 21 horses were Thoroughbred racehorses in training. Eighteen horses had had strenuous exercise immediately prior to onset of illness. Fifteen horses had a serosanguineous nasal discharge during hospitalization. Seventeen horses had radiographic evidence of pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Nine of 14 horses had ultrasonographic evidence of large pulmonary parenchymal defects consistent with consolidation. Pleurocentesis yielded a suppurative, serosanguineous effusion in the 14 horses in which it was performed. Bacteria were isolated from all transtracheal aspirates (14) and from 6 of 12 pleural fluid samples. Actinobacillus suis-like organisms and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus were most commonly isolated. Nineteen horses were hospitalized and treated. Mean duration of treatment was 5 days, and most horses were euthanatized because of secondary complications, continued costs of medical treatment, or poor prognosis for future performance. Pathologic lesions included well-demarcated regions of hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction with necrosis and a serosanguineous pleural effusion. Thrombosis of pulmonary vessels was found in 11 horses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An acute or peracute onset of severe respiratory distress, with serosanguineous nasal discharge, ultrasonographic and radiographic evidence of severe pulmonary consolidation, and serosanguineous suppurative pleural effusion, is strongly suggestive of pulmonary infarction in horses.

The controls developed fever and severe <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, whereas previously exposed pigs had less fever and less extensive gross pulmonary lesions. After the first aerosol exposure pulmonary IgM, and IgG antibodies reactive with A. pleuropneumoniae increased significantly in both aerosol exposed groups. IgA in BALF and serum concentrations of each Ig class were significantly increased in the group exposed to viable bacteria when compared to the non-exposed controls. After aerosol challenge a pronounced increase of systemic and pulmonary IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies was detected in both exposure groups. Aerosol application of whole-cell A. pleuropneumoniae bacterins induced similar protective effects against aerosol challenge infection as administration of an identical dose of viable bacteria. Inhalation of A. pleuropneumoniae may lead to asymptomatic carriers in some pigs that could spread the disease under field conditions.",M1
8519914,"Serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from piglets with <e>pleuropneumonia</e>.Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 20 antimicrobial agents were determined for 67 field strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from the lungs of piglets with pleuropneumonia during the period 1992 to 1994, in Japan. Of these 67 strains, all 29 strains that were identified as serotypes 1 and 7 were resistant to chloramphenicol and tiamphenicol, whereas all of those identified as serotypes 2, 5 and 8 were susceptible to these antibiotics. Furthermore, 20 of 23 streptomycin-resistant strains were serotype 1, while, only 3 strains were serotype 2. These results suggest that the different serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae vary in terms of antimicrobial-resistance.",M1

Factors considered included age, breed, sex, occupation, transport farther than 500 miles within the previous week, racing within the previous 48 hours, viral respiratory tract infection or exposure to horses with viral respiratory tract disease within the previous 2 weeks, and vaccination against influenza or rhinopneumonitis within the previous 6 months. Results indicated that Thoroughbreds were at a greater risk of developing pleuropneumonia than were other horses, and Standardbreds were at a reduced risk. Transport farther than 500 miles and viral respiratory tract disease or exposure to horses with respiratory tract disease were determined to be risk factors for the development of pleuropneumonia.",M1

Serotype 4 (42.2 per cent), serotype 7 (22.5 per cent) and serotype 2 (12.8 per cent) were predominant, whereas serotypes 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12 and untypable isolates were present only in small numbers. Serotypes 1, 2, 4 and 7 originated mainly from cases of acute pleuropneumonia, whereas serotypes 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12 were associated with chronically infected herds. The susceptibility of the isolates to 20 antimicrobial agents was determined by agar disc diffusion. Most were susceptible to cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefazolin, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, oxolinic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, thiamphenicol, colistin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Marked resistance was found with amoxicillin, ticarcillin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and metronidazole.

7640954,"Equine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>.Pleuropneumonia is a clinically important equine disease, predisposed by a number of identifiable factors. Successful management is largely dependent on early identification and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies. Rapid resolution of the disease process is associated with appropriate treatment commenced within 48 h of the causative insult. Lower airway contamination by oropharyngeal organisms and subsequent extension into the pulmonary parenchyma results in respiratory dysfunction and systemic toxaemia. Acute disease is associated with the isolation of facultatively anaerobic organisms, especially beta-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. and Pasteurellaceae. Delayed or inappropriate treatment is likely to result in chronic disease characterized by the involvement of anaerobic bacteria and a poor response to therapy. The primary mode of treatment for anaerobic infection of the human thorax is surgical drainage and resection of necrotic tissue but whilst such techniques have been described for the management of equine pleuropneumonia, the size of the equine thoracic cavity hinders accurate diagnostic evaluation and successful completion of such intervention. The chronic nature and cost of ongoing treatment and limitations on choice of antimicrobial agents warrant a poor prognosis for survival and a poorer prognosis for return to athletic endeavour.",M1

7556049,"Variations in urinary gamma glutamyl transferase/urinary creatinine ratio in horses with or without <e>pleuropneumonia</e> treated with gentamicin.The urinary GGT/urinary creatinine (uGGT/uCR) ratio was measured on Days 1, 3 and 10 in 4 adult, healthy horses; in 6 adult, healthy horses treated with gentamicin at recommended dosages and 9 adult horses treated for pleuropneumonia with gentamicin at recommended dosages. Plasma creatinine and gentamicin trough concentrations were measured on the same days. The uGGT/uCr ratio was higher in the normal horses (mean +/- s.d. 22.85 +/- 13.69) than previously reported normal values (10.5 +/- 6.8) (Adams and McClure 1985). Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to compare the ratio in the 3 groups while controlling for the effect of time. Sick horses had a significantly higher uGGT/uCr ratio than either of the 2 groups of normal horses. Both groups of horses that were treated with gentamicin had similar percentage increases in uGGT/uCr ratio over the treatment period with the most marked increases found between treatment Days 1 and 3. The increase in uGGT/Cr ratio was predominantly a result of an increase in uGGT activity rather than a decrease in uCr concentration. The increase in uGGT activity and uGGT/uCr ratio occurred without abnormalities in serum creatinine or gentamicin trough concentrations. These findings demonstrate that urine GGT activity and uGGT/uCr ratio should be expected to increase in response to gentamicin therapy at recommended dosages without measurable changes in serum creatinine. This suggests that an elevation of the uGGT/uCr ratio in horses being treated with gentamicin would not necessarily require changes in, or withdrawal of, the gentamicin treatment as long as increases in the plasma creatinine do not exceed 0.3 g/l and gentamicin trough concentrations are &lt; 2 micrograms/l.",M1
7565014,"Molecular investigation of the role of ApxI and ApxII in the virulence of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5.The extracellular hemolytic toxins (ApxI and ApxII) of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae are thought to be important factors in this microorganism's virulence and the pathogenesis of swine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>. Using the polymerase chain reaction, the apxI locus of a non-hemolytic, avirulent mutant of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 (mIT4-H) generated by chemical mutagenesis (Inzana T. J., Todd J., Veit H. P. Microb Pathog 1991; 10: 281-96) was found to contain deletions that affected major parts of the entire apxICABD operon, thus inactivating each gene in the operon. The apxII locus was not affected. Monoclonal antibodies to ApxI and ApxII were used to confirm that ApxI was not synthesized, and that ApxII was synthesized but not secreted from the cell. The apxICABD genes and apxIBD genes were cloned into a broad host range vector to obtain plasmids pJFF800 and pJFF801, respectively. Each recombinant plasmid was electroporated into strain mIT4-H to obtain strain mIT4-H/pJFF800 and strain mIT4-H/pJFF801, respectively. Strain mIT4-H/pJFF800 exported ApxI and ApxII, and produced hemolytic activity comparable to or exceeding that of wild type strain J45. Strain mIT4-H/pJFF801 exported only ApxII and produced weak hemolytic activity. Strain mIT4-H/pJFF800 was virulent in mice, and had an LD50 of about 2 x 10(6) colony forming units. In contrast, mIT4-H/pJFF801 and mIT4-H were essentially avirulent in mice, and LD50s for these strains could not be calculated. Strain mIT4-H/pJFF800 was virulent in pigs and caused lethal pleuropneumonia, whereas parent strain mIT4-H was avirulent. Strain mIT4-H/pJFF801 was also able to induce pleuropneumonia in pigs, although a higher dose was required to induce lesions similar to those caused by mIT4-H/pJFF800. Thus, A. pleuropneumoniae strains that produce ApxI and ApxII require ApxI for full virulence and toxic activity in pigs. However, other factors including ApxII contribute to the virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae in pigs.",M1

Prior to admission, the ram had been unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and levamisole. Clinical examination revealed that the general behaviour and condition of the ram were severely disturbed. The rectal temperature and respiratory rate were increased. Auscultation of the lungs revealed increased vesicular sounds. Based on clinical findings, a tentative diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was made. To confirm the diagnosis, blood was taken for serological testing for Maedi-Visna, and endoscopic examination of the respiratory tract and ultrasonographic and radiographic examination of the thorax were performed. Cytologic and bacteriologic examination of tracheal secretions revealed large numbers of neutrophils and Actinomyces pyogenes organisms. A pocket of gas, surrounded by a capsule of soft tissue density, overlying the base of the heart, and a horizontal fluid line were observed on radiographs. Ultrasonographic examination revealed an effusion between the pleura and the lung on the left side of the thorax; an encapsulated abscess was seen on the right side of the thorax. Centesis and aspiration of this accumulation of fluid yielded foul-smelling pus. Post mortem examination confirmed the clinical, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings.

Acute pleuropneumonia was diagnosed in 36 horses, the majority of which were Thoroughbreds (89%). Of 22 (61%) horses that were in race training at the onset of illness, 11 (31%) had been recently transported a long distance and 4 (11%) had evidence of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Physical examination findings and hematologic data were nonspecific. The most consistent abnormality was hyperfibrino-genemia. Affected horses were treated with antibiotics, thoracic drainage, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and supportive care. Twenty-two (61%) horses were discharged from the hospital, with the mean duration of hospitalization for those discharged being 23 days. Nine (25%) horses were euthanatized and 5 (14%) died. Bacterial culturing of thoracic fluid resulted in growth in 30 of the 36 (83%) horses. The finding of anaerobic bacteria in thoracic fluid was not associated with a lower survival rate (62%) than the overall survival rate (61%). Four horses with chronic pleuropneumonia had a history of lethargy and inappetence for &gt; 2 weeks. Actinobacillus equuli was isolated, either alone or in combination with other bacteria, from thoracic fluid of these 4 horses. Each horse was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and made a rapid recovery. Three horses with acute pleuritis secondary to penetrating thoracic wounds also had nonspecific clinical signs, apart from the wound and a large volume of pleural effusion. Bacteriologic isolates from these horses differed slightly from those of horses with acute pleuropneumonia.",M1
19443045,"Analysis of the immunoproteome of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type reveals immunogenic homologues to other known virulence traits in related Mycoplasma species.Contagious bovine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (CBPP) caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (MmmSC) has been eradicated in the developed world, but it is still present in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa. After initially successful control measures in the 1960s it has been spreading due to a lack of money, fragmentation of veterinary services, uncontrolled cattle movement, insufficient vaccine efficacy and sensitivity of current diagnostic tests. In this study we used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot with sera from MmmSC-infected animals and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry to identify novel immunogenic proteins as candidate molecules for improved diagnostics and vaccines. We identified 24 immunogens recognized by pooled sera from experimentally infected cattle. Furthermore, a serum from an animal with acute clinical disease as well as severe pathomorphological lesions recognized 13 additional immunogens indicating variation in the antibody responses to CBPP amongst cattle. Most immunogens showed compelling similarity to protein/gene sequences in the two ruminant pathogens M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides large colony type both belonging to the mycoides cluster. Three of these proteins, namely glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, adenylosuccinate synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, had no compelling homologue in the other distantly related bovine pathogen M. agalactiae. In addition, translation elongation factor Tu, heat shock protein 70, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which have been found to mediate adhesion to host tissue in other mycoplasmas were shown to be expressed and recognized by sera. These proteins have potential for the development of improved diagnostic tests and possibly vaccines.",M2
19111314,"Vaccines for Mycoplasma diseases in animals and man.Vaccines for important mycoplasma diseases, including contagious bovine and caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, have been used for centuries, consisting mainly of infected tissue or fluids which are inoculated into sites at which the risk of severe infection is slight, such as the tail and bridge of the nose. Surprisingly, little progress has been made in developing safe, defined and protective alternatives, the vaccines today still consisting of mildly attenuated strains serially passaged in eggs or in culture. Ill-defined temperature-sensitive mutants are widely used for mycoplasmoses in poultry despite uncertainty about their mode of protection. Inactivated vaccines for enzootic pneumonia appear to have improved pig health worldwide, but disease reduction has been generally modest. Ironically, attempts to develop subunit preparations have often led to exacerbation of disease, particularly in human atypical pneumonia. Promising results have been seen in DNA vaccine technology, which has been applied to the development of mycoplasma vaccines for porcine enzootic pneumonia, but field trials still seem a long way off. No commercial vaccines exist for Mycoplasma bovis, despite evidence that this is a major cause of calf pneumonia, mastitis and arthritis.",M2
18234866,"Suppression-subtractive hybridization as a strategy to identify taxon-specific sequences within the Mycoplasma mycoides Cluster: design and validation of an M. capricolum subsp. capricolum-specific PCR assay.The phylogenetically related Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides biotype Large Colony are two small-ruminant pathogens involved in contagious agalactia. Their respective contributions to clinical outbreaks are not well documented, because they are difficult to differentiate with the current diagnostic techniques. In order to identify DNA sequences specific to one taxon or the other, a suppression-subtractive hybridization approach was developed. DNA fragments resulting from the reciprocal subtraction of the type strains were used as probes on a panel of M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides biotype Large Colony strains to assess their intrataxon specificity. Due to a high intrataxon polymorphism and important cross-reactions between taxa, a single DNA fragment was shown to be specific for M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and to be present in all M. capricolum subsp. capricolum field isolates tested in this study. A PCR assay targeting the corresponding gene (simpA51) was designed that resulted in a 560-bp amplification only in M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and in M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (the etiological agent of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>). simpA51 was further improved to generate a multiplex PCR (multA51) that allows the differentiation of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae from M. capricolum subsp. capricolum. Both the simpA51 and multA51 assays accurately identify M. capricolum subsp. capricolum among other mycoplasmas, including all members of the M. mycoides cluster. simpA51 and multA51 PCRs are proposed as sensitive and robust tools for the specific identification of M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae.",M2
16549656,"Biofilm formation by mycoplasma species and its role in environmental persistence and survival.Although mycoplasmas possess a very limited genome, little is known about their virulence mechanisms and methods of persistence in the host. Examination of a wide range of mycoplasma species found considerable variation in their ability to form a biofilm. Mycoplasma putrefaciens, M. cottewii, M. yeatsii, M. agalactiae and M. bovis produced prolific biofilms. Conversely, the highly pathogenic mycoplasma and causative agent of contagious bovine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, was unable to produce a biofilm. Biofilms were found to be considerably more resistant to stress, including heat and desiccation, than planktonic cells. A link between the biofilm phenotype and genotype as determined by molecular typing was found for M. bovis. Analysis of biofilms using fluorescent staining combined with confocal microscopy demonstrated that mycoplasma biofilms formed a highly differentiated structure with stacks and channels. Biofilm formation may indicate that mycoplasmas are capable of surviving in the environment.",M2

Mycoplasmas are considered to act as cofactors in patients with AIDS. A preliminary study was conducted to isolate mycoplasmas from sputum specimens of AIDS patients and non-HIV patients with underlying pulmonary symptoms and signs. METHODS: A total of 130 sputum samples (100 from AIDS patients and 30 from non-HIV) were cultured on standard <e>pleuropneumonia</e>-like organisms (PPLO) glucose agar up to 3 wk. The plates were examined for the presence of fried-egg colonies characteristic of Mycoplasma. Subsequently the plates were stained using Diene's stain. Sputum specimens from the AIDS patients were also screened for other bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Mycoplasmas were detected from 36 (36%) of the AIDS patients and only 5 (16.6%) of the non HIV control individuals with underlying pulmonary symptoms. Data on the detection rates of other microorganisms from the AIDS cases were also analysed. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: This preliminary study provided supportive evidence that mycoplasma colonized in upper respiratory tract of individuals with AIDS to a larger extent than that of the non HIV subjects with pulmonary symptoms.

Three rhebok developed inappetence, weight loss, lethargy, signs related to pulmonary or arthral dysfunction, and sepsis. All three rhebok died or were euthanized. Primary postmortem findings were erosive tracheitis, <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, regional cellulitis, and necrotizing lymphadenitis. Mycoplasmas were detected in numerous tissues by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and PCR. The three deceased rhebok were coinfected with ovine herpesvirus-2, and two animals additionally had a novel gammaherpesvirus. However, no lesions indicative of herpesvirus were seen microscopically in any animal. The rheboks' mycoplasmas were characterized at the level of the 16S rRNA gene, the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, and the fructose biphosphate aldolase gene. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was carried out to address the possibility of infection with multiple strains. Two of the deceased rhebok were infected with a single strain of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum, and the third animal had a single, unique strain most closely related to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides large-colony. A PCR survey of DNA samples from 46 other ruminant species demonstrated the presence of several species of mycoplasmas in the mycoides cluster, including a strain of M. capricolum subsp. capricolum identical to that found in two of the rhebok. These findings demonstrate the pervasiveness of mycoplasmas in the mycoides cluster in small ruminants and the potential for interspecies transmission and disease when different animal taxa come in contact.",M2

12379056,"Investigations of outbreaks of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in Eritrea.Mycoplasmas were isolated from freeze-dried lung samples from goats from the western lowlands of Eritea suspected of being affected by contagious caprine pleuropneumonia. The goats belonged to two herds in which mortality and morbidity rates were high. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae was identified in most samples by the polymerase chain reaction and by conventional serological tests. The latex agglutination test detected more positive serum samples in both herds than did the complement fixation test. Following cloning, the isolates of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae were analysed biochemically and shown to be metabolically similar. They oxidized glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, pyruvate and L-lactate with high affinity and mannose, glucosamine and 2-oxobutyrate with low affinity; they were unable to utilize maltose, trehalose, fructose or ethanol. Major improvements were seen in the growth yield of the Eritrean strains with the addition of pyruvate to the medium. Thus, it may be that organic acids are important energy sources for these strains and may be used in addition to or in place of glucose. In contrast to most other strains of the M. mycoides cluster, the Eritrean strains produced large amounts of hydrogen peroxide during the oxidation of NADH by lysed cells. This characteristic had previously been reported for strain M. F38, the type strain of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, although strain F38 did not metabolize sugars.

11844618,"Genetic evolution of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae strains and molecular epidemiology of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> by sequencing of locus H2.Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a major threat to goat farming in developing countries. Its exact distribution is not well known, despite the fact that new diagnostic tools such as PCR and competitive ELISA are now available. The authors developed a study of the molecular epidemiology of the disease, based on the amplification of a 2400 bp long fragment containing two duplicated gene coding for a putative membrane protein. The sequence of this fragment, obtained on 19 Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (Mccp) strains from various geographical locations, gave 11 polymorphic positions. The three mutations found on gene H2prim were silent and did not appear to induce any amino acid modifications in the putative translated protein. The second gene may be a pseudogene not translated in vivo, as it bore a deletion of the ATG codon found in the other members of the  Mycoplasma mycoides cluster  and as the six mutations evidenced in the Mccp strains would induce modifications in the translated amino acids. In addition, an Mccp strain isolated in the United Arab Emirates showed a deletion of the whole pseudogene, a further indication that this gene is not compulsory for mycoplasma growth. Four lineages were defined, based on the nucleotide sequence. These correlated relatively well with the geographical origin of the strains: North, Central or East Africa. The strain of Turkish origin had a sequence similar to that found in North African strains, while strains isolated in Oman had sequences similar to those of North or East African strains. The latter is possibly due to the regular import of goats of various origins. Similar molecular epidemiology tools have been developed by sequencing the two operons of the 16S rRNA gene or by AFLP. All these various techniques give complementary results. One (16S rRNA) offers the likelihood of a finer identification of strains circulating in a region, another (H2) of determining the geographical origin of the strains. These tools can make a very useful contribution to understanding the epidemiology of CCPP.",M2

The animals were monitored over an 8-week period post-infection (p.i.). Elevated temperatures were observed 2-7 days p.i., reaching a maximum of 41.5 degrees C in one animal (1884). By 8 weeks p.i. the infection was successfully cleared, with no Mccp being recovered from the lungs, serum or nasal passages. Mccp was not isolated from serum throughout the experiment, either directly by culture or indirectly via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Humoral immune responses against Mccp capsular polysaccharide (CPS) were generally poor when measured by ELISA. CPS antigen was present in the serum of all infected animals early in the infection (day 14 p.i.), although in one animal (1855) CPS antigen persisted throughout. This was the only animal to exhibit a serious cough (day 5-19 p.i.). Successful diagnosis of CCPP was achieved using two different types of latex agglutination test (CPS antibody and CPS antigen detection test), immunoblotting and a blocking ELISA, although the latter lacked sensitivity until later in the infection (35-40 days p.i.). Only a single animal (1855) was detected positive using the current complement fixation test (CFT). Strong immune responses to protein antigens were detected by IgG and IgM immunoblotting from the first time point at day 14 p.i. IgM immunodominant bands of 220, 85, 62 and 40kDa were observed in the 3 infected animals and from CFT-positive CCPP field sera. Band intensity gradually diminished throughout the experiment. IgG immunodominant bands of 108, 70, 62, 44, 40 and 23kDa were shared between experimentally-infected and field sera, with band intensity either remaining unchanged or increasing from day 14 p.i. These bands were not present using pre-infection sera. Of the diagnostic tests used, only the CPS antibody detection latex agglutination test and IgG immunoblotting gave positive diagnoses throughout the entire period post-infection (days 14-53 p.i.).",M2

Analysis was only performed on lesions which had a prevalence &gt;20% in at least five of the herds (mycoplasma-like catharral pneumonia, ventro-cranial and dorso-caudal pleuritis). Only a few consistent statistical associations were revealed across herds. Pigs seroconverting to M. hyopneumoniae close to slaughter expressed the largest extent of mycoplasma-like catharral pneumonia, and early seroconversion to M. hyopneumoniae was related to large ventro-cranial pleuritic lesions.

Preabsorption of CPS-specific antibodies prior to coating of the beads removed agglutinating activity in the presence of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, strongly suggesting that CPS is the likely soluble antigen recognized by the test. In addition, the specificity of the LAT exactly mirrored that of an M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae CPS-specific monoclonal antibody (WM25): of the 8 other mycoplasma species tested, agglutination was observed only with bovine serogroup 7. The LAT detected all 11 strains of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae examined in this study, with a sensitivity level of 2 ng of CPS, or the equivalent of 1.7 x 10(4) CFU, in a reaction volume of 0.03 ml of serum. With field sera from goats with CCPP, the results of the LAT exhibited a 67% correlation with the results of the currently used complement fixation test (CFT), with the main discrepancy in diagnosis resulting from the increased sensitivity of the LAT compared to that of CFT. This antigen-detection LAT should prove particularly useful in identifying animals in the earliest stages of CCPP and combines sensitivity and low cost with ease of application in the field, without the need for any specialist training or equipment.",M2
11126580,"Demonstration of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. Capripneumoniae and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, small colony type in outbreaks of caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> in eastern Tanzania.An outbreak of caprine pleuropneumonia involving about 1200 goats in the Coast and Morogoro regions of eastern Tanzania is reported. The major clinical findings were severe respiratory distress, fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge and high mortality involving all age groups and both sexes of goats. The morbidity and mortality rates were 45%-90% and 14%-50%, respectively. The principal pathological lesions were confined to the thoracic cavity and comprised hydrothorax and serofibrinous pleuropneumonia. The histopathological features consisted of a necrotizing fibrinous pleuropneumonia characterized by different degrees of vasculitis, and fibrinocellular exudation into the alveolar septae and lumina, and into interlobular septae and pleura. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, Small Colony type Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and Mycoplasma arginini were isolated from some of the examined goats including a case with a sequestrum which yielded Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, Small Colony type.

Influence of piglet production systems and influence on production parameters.Two hundred and sixty-four feeder pigs from an age-segregated herd (A-pigs) and 264 feeder pigs from a continuous production system (C-pigs) were transferred into identical but separate rooms in a fattening herd employing all-in all-out production. On arrival, none of the A-pigs and 39% of the C-pigs were seropositive to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo). At slaughter 30% of the A-pigs and 99% of the C-pigs were seropositive to M. hyo. Pigs with acute swine enzootic pneumonia (SEP) at slaughter and pigs that seroconverted to M. hyo late in the rearing period showed a lower growth rate compared with pigs with chronic SEP or pigs that seroconverted to M. hyo early or not at all. No A-pigs and 12% of the C-pigs were seropositive to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 2 (A. pp 2) at arrival to the fattening herd. At slaughter, 10% of the A-pigs and 13% of the C-pigs were seropositive to A. pp 2. On arrival, the prevalence of pigs seropositive to A. pp 3 was lower among A-pigs than C-pigs. During the fattening period the situation was reversed. The prevalence of pleuritis at slaughter was low (2.7-4.2%) and there were no associations between pleuritis at slaughter and developments of antibodies to A. pp 2 or 3. However, pigs with pleuritis developed antibodies to M. hyo to a greater extent than pigs without pleuritis. Pigs with <e>pleuropneumonia</e> at slaughter and pigs that seroconverted to A. pp 2 or 3 had, during certain periods of the rearing, higher growth rates compared with pigs without pleuropneumonia or pigs that did not seroconvert to A. pp 2 or 3.",M2

9234402,"Assessing infections at multiple levels of aggregation.The patterns of sero-prevalence of antibodies to four infectious diseases, representing a broad range of pathogens (bacteria: brucellosis; mycoplasma: contagious bovine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>; viruses: infectious bovine rhinotracheitis; protozoa: trypanosomosis) were investigated at three levels of organization (farm, area and district). Three contrasting districts in Kenya were compared: an arid and pastoral area (Samburu); a tropical highland area (Kiambu), and a tropical coastal area (Kilifi). Cattle in three districts were selected by two-stage cluster sampling between August 1991 and 1992. Schall's algorithm, a generalized linear mixed model suitable for multi-level analysis, was compared to ordinary logistic regression (OLR), which ignores clustering of responses; generalized estimating equations (GEE) or Jacknife, to account for clustering at the farm level; SAS VARCOMP, which provides normal-theory random-effects models. Schall's algorithm provided similar estimates to GEE (regression effects) and Jackknife (standard errors) for farm-level clustered data. Extending Schall's procedure for additional district and area-within-district random effects usually provided additional information. In general, models that included only a farm-level random effect consistently provided larger estimates of farms' variance components than did models with additional district and area random effects. The four type diseases exhibited various amounts of clustering. Brucellosis had moderate farm clustering plus some area and district clustering. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia had only a small amount of clustering, mostly by area. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis exhibited a large amount of clustering, primarily at the farm level. Trypanosomiasis antibody prevalence varied by district, area and farm. We believe that patterns of disease clustering identified by multi-level analysis can be used to better target high-risk units for disease control and guide research to understand disease transmission factors.",M2
9190021,"Diagnosis and control of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>.The diagnosis of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) has often been considered difficult. This is because of the confusion that can arise with other mycoplasmoses of small ruminants. Symptoms and lesions can be similar and the isolation of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (MccF38) requires skilled technicians. Once MccF38 strains are isolated, their identification should not be difficult. New techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, now offer the possibility of identifying MccF38 directly from dried samples. However, the isolation of MccF38 strains is always required for an official declaration of infection. Until now, the official serological test has been the complement fixation test; the main drawbacks being lack of sensitivity and specificity and also the short persistence of antibodies detected by this technique. The specific competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has now been developed and should enable wide serological enquiries to determine the real prevalence of the disease. Antibiotic treatments are effective but may not prevent persistence in latent carriers. An inactivated vaccine with saponin as an adjuvant has been produced in Kenya, which protects goats for approximately one year.",M2

CCPP is infectious, contagious and fulfils the classic Koch postulates that characterise such types of disease. The distribution of the disease is not exactly known, but reports of mycoplasma isolation and official declarations to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) enable a probable distribution map to be obtained. There are many other mycoplasmas that can infect goat and sheep lungs and induce pleuropneumonia. However, pleuropneumonia is often restricted to young animals and the prominent symptom is mastitis in lactating does. Other symptoms may also occur, contributing to a syndrome that has been tentatively described in this paper as 'MAKePS syndrome' for mastitis, arthritis, keratitis, pneumonia and septicaemia.",M2
8971688,"Differential and strain-specific triggering of bovine alveolar macrophage effector functions by mycoplasmas.Mycoplasma strains being considered as pathogenic or non-pathogenic for cattle were tested on their capacity to activate bovine alveolar macrophages in vitro. Of particular interest was the behaviour of Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides small colony type (M.m.m. SC), the causative agent of contagious bovine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (CBPP). Increases in procoagulant activity (PCA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha- (TNF-alpha) and nitrogen monoxide (NO) generation were tested. To minimize an influence of macrophage activation by mycoplasma growth media, mycoplasmas were cultured on embryonic calf nose epithelial cells. The three macrophage functions tested were not correlated, but were differentially induced in strain-specific manner. Four out of seven strains induced PCA, regardless of pathogenicity, and all strains promoted moderate NO generation at high concentrations. All tested M.m.m. SC strains (Afadé, L2 and PG1), and the pathogenic M. bovis, induced TNF-alpha production at low concentrations (10(6) colony forming units per ml). M.sp. serogroup 7 and the non-pathogenic M. bovirhinis and Acholeplasma laidlawii did not induce TNF-alpha up to 10(8) cfu/ml. Thus, strain-specific differences are reflected in differential macrophage activation patterns. The findings are consistent with an important role for TNF-alpha in pathogenesis of CBPP.",M2

7975145,"The use of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e> (CCPP).Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia is a severe disease affecting goats in Eastern Africa and the Middle East, caused by Mycoplasma sp. type F38. Its exact geographical distribution is however not exactly known due to the lack of specificity of the available serological tests and the difficulty in cultivating M. sp. F38. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was produced, using crude or membrane proteins antigens from type F38 strains to immunize mice. The reactivity of the mAbs was tested by an immunobinding assay with crude mycoplasma antigens spotted on nitrocellulose filters. One hundred and twelve antigens, standardized at 0.5 mg protein/ml, were used. Mycoplasma strains were chosen among closely related species of the  mycoides cluster , M. capricolum, Group 7 of Leach, M. mycoides mycoides LC, M. mycoides mycoides SC, M. mycoides capri, as well as among species that are isolated from goat lungs, M. arginini, M. ovipneumoniae, M. putrefaciens, M. agalactiae. Out of 60 mAbs, 4 were chosen to build an identification test for mycoplasmas of the  mycoides cluster . Controls showed that accurate identification could be hampered by antigenic heterogeneity within the M. capricolum species. One mAb was used for the direct detection of M. sp. F38 antigen in pleural fluid from goats suspected of CCPP. The sensitivity of the test can be estimated at 0.5 micrograms protein/ml. Comparison with isolation results show a 74% agreement between the two methods. The same mAb was used to build a blocking ELISA. This serological test was strictly specific for CCPP. It detects antibodies in sera of naturally infected or artificially immunized animals while it remained negative with hyperimmune sera to related strains such as PG 50. Direct antigen detection and blocking ELISA are tools that may enable a better assessment of CCPP distribution.",M2

The methods used were the conventional disc-growth inhibition and colony-immunofluorescence techniques. The same strains were also tested against polyclonal rabbit antisera for each mycoplasmal group. With the polyclonal antisera, many cross reactions occurred between members of the different groups. The two F38-polyclonals gave cross reactions only against various M capricolum subspecies capricolum and bovine group 7 strains, apart from one of M mycoides SC in the immunofluorescence test only. The F38 monoclonal antibody gave more specific results, in that only the F38-type strains (M capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae) and three of the four bovine group 7 strains reacted positively in growth inhibition tests; the only heterologous reaction by colony immunofluorescence was with one M capricolum subspecies capricolum strain. The F38 monoclonal antibody, WM25, may therefore be useful for the specific serological identification of caprine F38-type isolates by the disc-growth inhibition method, which will exclude M agalactiae, M capricolum subspecies capricolum and the other members of the 'M mycoides cluster' associated with goats, but not bovine group 7 (which is not found in goats), which can be excluded by colony immunofluorescence tests.",M2

(strain F38) is the causative agent of contagious caprine <e>pleuropneumonia</e>, which is a goat disease of great global concern. Strain F38 belongs to the so-called  Mycoplasma mycoides cluster,  and the members of this cluster have many biochemical and serological properties in common, which makes it difficult to differentiate between them by conventional methods. Their phylogenetic interrelationship are thus uncertain. The 16S rRNA gene of the rrnB operon from strain F38 was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was compared with the 16S rRNA sequences of related mycoplasmas, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by parsimony analysis. A three-way ambiguity among strain F38, Mycoplasma capricolum, and Mycoplasma sp. strain PG50 was observed in the trees. This observation is in agreement with a recent proposal to reclassify strain F38 and M. capricolum. A primer set was designed for in vitro amplification by PCR of a fragment of the 16S rRNA genes from the M. mycoides cluster. The amplimers of strain F38 could be distinguished easily from the corresponding amplimers from other members of the M. mycoides cluster by restriction enzyme analysis with PstI. This observation was utilized to design an identification system for strain F38. Part of the 16S rRNA gene of the rrnA operon from strain F38 was also cloned, and several sequence differences between the two rRNA operons were discovered, revealing microheterogeneity between the two 16S rRNA genes of this organism.",M2

The taxonomic status of the F38 group has been uncertain, principally because of the serological, genomic, and other properties which it shares with M. capricolum. Tritium-labeled DNAs from the M. capricolum type strain (California kid) and from prototype strain F38 were hybridized with unlabeled DNAs from these two strains and from four other isolates belonging to each group. The results showed consistent DNA relatedness values of about 70% between the F38 and M. capricolum groups, compared with levels of relatedness of about 90 and 85%, respectively, for the strains within each group. In addition, the results of comparisons of these 10 strains in which growth inhibition and immunofluorescence tests were used confirmed the previously reported serological relationships between the two groups and reinforced other observations concerning their shared genomic and cell membrane characteristics, indicating that there is a close taxonomic relationship. However, as the 70% DNA relatedness values between the M. capricolum and F38 groups also indicate a degree of genomic difference inconsistent with a relationship at the species level, we conclude that our findings support previous proposals for classification of the F38 group as a subspecies of M. capricolum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

The organisms investigated were Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (PG1), M. mycoides subsp. mycoides (Y-goat), M. mycoides subsp. capri (PG3), M. capricolum (California kid), the unclassified bovine serogroup 7 of Leach (PG50) and the F38-like group (F38). The results suggested a close relationship between M. capricolum and F38 and a similarly close relationship between the different M. mycoides subspecies, whereas the two M. mycoides subspecies appeared to be quite distant from M. capricolum and F38. The representative strain of the bovine serogroup 7 of Leach was equally distant from F38, M. capricolum and the three strains of M. mycoides. Strikingly, all six mycoplasma strains apparently shared six proteins in the two-dimensional gels.

Three months after immunisation, five goats from each group were challenged by the in-contact method. The goats immunised with the antigen incorporated in IFA were all solidly immune to the challenge whereas only two of five of the goats in the other two groups were protected. When the remaining 10 animals from each group were challenged six months after immunisation, those immunised with the antigen in IFA were still solidly immune while only two goats from each of the other two groups were protected.

M. capri causes a similar disease in goats which is geographically more widespread. Enzootic pneumonia of pigs, seen in various parts of the world, is due primarily to M. suipneumoniae. Although some strains of M. hyorhinis also seem capable of causing disease. Not all strains of a mycoplasma species are equally pathogenic; only some strains of M. pulmonis produce severe respiratory disease in mice and rats. Further, concomitant infection with other agents may result in more severe disease; this is particularly seen in M. gallisepticum infections of poultry. Of those mycoplasmas which infect man, only M. pneumoniae is known to cause respiratory disease, mainly involving the younger age groups. Mycoplasmas spread by close contact so that disease is seen in family groups or where there is crowding or herding. Factors in resistance to respiratory disease caused by mycoplasmas have been poorly understood but the importance of local immunity is becoming more clear.",M2

Animals that survive are immune to further local infections or to the natural disease. The most successful vaccines at present consist of live attenuated strains of M. mycoides which produce a slight local reaction at the site of inoculation.

Rabbits produce better precipitating antibody against the anodic migrating protein mycoplasma antigens than cattle and pigs as seen in IEP. However, rabbit anti-M. mycoides serum did not show precipitating antibody against the heat-stable carbohydrate antigen. As judged by IEP, the major carbohydrate antigen extracted from the media, or boiled whole organism, is similar to that present in the sera-infected cattle and knee joints of calves. This carbohydrate antigen has a cathodic migration in IEP at pH 8.6. Periodate oxidation, classically used to destroy carbohydrate, also destroys most of the protein antigens. Heating the antigens to 56 C for 10 min destroys many of the noncarbohydrate antigens and 100 C eliminates all but the carbohydrate antigen.

This organism exhibited an absolute growth requirement for the nucleosides uridine and thymidine, a partial requirement for guanosine and deoxyguanosine, but no requirement for adenosine, deoxyadenosine, cytosine, and deoxycytosine. Cytosine and deoxycytosine partially satisfied the requirement for uridine. Loss in viability resulted from thymidine deprivation, but not from a deficiency in other growth requirements. This phenomenon of thymineless death in a mycoplasma is similar in many respects to that reported in other bacterial systems. Chloramphenicol specifically inhibited protein synthesis and allowed deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis to proceed to only about 40% of that normally produced per generation period, while causing less inhibition of ribonucleic acid synthesis. Protein synthesis inhibition permitted thymineless death to a survival level of less than 0.5%, but ribonucleic acid synthesis inhibition resulted in a higher (10%) survival level. These results are consistent with previously noted aspects of thymineless death in Escherichia coli strains, which suggest that thymineless death is coupled to ribonucleic acid synthesis.",M2
