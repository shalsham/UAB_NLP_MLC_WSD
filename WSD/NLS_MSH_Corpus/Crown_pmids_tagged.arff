20483017,"Taurodontism in children with hypodontia and supernumerary teeth: a case control study.PURPOSE: The aim of the present investigation was to compare the prevalence of taurodontism in the permanent mandibular first molars of nonsyndromic children with hypodontia and supernumerary teeth with age- and gender-matched controls. METHODS: The <e>crown</e>-body root ratios of the permanent first molars were determined from orthopantomograms of 83 children with hypodontia (&gt; or =1 missing teeth) and 37 children with supernumerary teeth (&gt; or =1 extra teeth) compared with normal case controls. RESULTS: In children with hypodontia, only girls showed a significantly higher tendency for taurodontism compared to case controls (P=.003), while boys with hypodontia showed a similar prevalence of taurodontism as controls (P=.83). Children with multiple missing teeth were significantly more susceptible to taurodontism than children with a single missing tooth (P=.004). By contrast, the prevalence of taurodontism in children with supernumerary teeth was not significantly different from that of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to normal case controls, children with nonsyndromic hypodontia are more likely to show taurodontism of the permanent first molar teeth whereas children with nonsyndromic supernumerary teeth are not.",M1
20451784,"Effective en-masse retraction design with orthodontic mini-implant anchorage: a finite element analysis.INTRODUCTION: The strategic design of an appliance for correcting a bialveolar protrusion by using orthodontic mini-implant anchorage and sliding mechanics must take into account the position and height of the mini-implant, the height of the anterior retraction hook and compensating curve, and midline vertical traction. In this study, we used finite element analysis to examine effective en-masse retraction with orthodontic mini-implant anchorage and sought to identify a better combination of the above factors. METHODS: Base models were constructed from a dental study model. Models with labially and lingually inclined incisors were also constructed. The center of resistance for the 6 anterior teeth in the base model was 9 mm superiorly and 13.5 mm posteriorly from the midpoint of the labial splinting wire. The working archwires were assumed to be 0.019 x 0.025-in or 0.016 x 0.022-in stainless steel. The amount of tooth displacement after finite element analysis was magnified 400 times and compared with central and lateral incisor and canine axis graphs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The tooth displacement tendencies were similar in all 3 models. The height of the anterior retraction hook and the placement of the compensating curve had limited effects on the labial <e>crown</e> torque of the central incisors for en-masse retraction. The 0.016 x 0.022-in stainless steel archwire showed more tipping of teeth compared with the 0.019 x 0.025-in archwire. For high mini-implant traction and 8-mm anterior retraction hook condition, the retraction force vector was applied above the center of resistance for the 6 anterior teeth, but no bodily retraction of the 6 anterior teeth occurred. For high mini-implant traction, 2-mm anterior retraction hook, and 100-g midline vertical traction condition, the 6 anterior teeth were intruded and tipped slightly labially.",M1
20416523,"A holistic approach to management of fractured teeth fragments: a case report.Fracture of anterior teeth is a relatively common outcome of trauma to the teeth. If the fractured teeth fragments are recovered by the patient and brought to the dental office within reasonable time, the fragments may be reattached to the tooth structure. This article presents a case of a 20-year-old man with fractured maxillary central incisors and left maxillary lateral incisor. The fracture involved two-thirds of the <e>crown</e>, compromising the pulp. The procedure used was reattachment of the fractured fragment with bonding system and dual-cure composite resin cement. The techniques described in this case report for reattachment of the fractured fragments are reasonably simple, while restoring providing long-lasting esthetics, improved function, positive psychologic response with a very conservative approach.",M1

20362910,"Prediction of the mesiodistal width of unerupted permanent canines and premolars: a statistical approach.INTRODUCTION: Prediction of the mesiodistal width of unerupted permanent canines and premolars is of major interest for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. METHODS: To improve the accuracy of the prediction, we looked for the best combination of independent variables with multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The most accurate prediction was obtained for the combination of the mandibular right first molar and lateral incisor, and the maxillary left central incisor. Adding to the regression equation 1 erupted canine or premolar improved the accuracy of the prediction considerably. Because of the variable character of the eruption sequence during the second transitional period, a separate regression model for every canine or premolar was necessary. The precision of our new method and other methods from the literature was tested in a separate study group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that our prediction method of the mesiodistal <e>crown</e> diameters of unerupted canines and premolars during the dental transition is accurate. A computer program was developed for user-friendly clinical application.",M1
20359429,"Coronal pulp dimensions in noncarious and restored deciduous second molars: a radiovisiographic study.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the coronal pulp dimensions in primary maxillary and mandibular second molars and to evaluate the influence on restorative procedures on them. METHODS: Included in this study were 80 4-7 year-old male and female patients with occlusal or proximal restorations on primary maxillary or mandibular second molars and with noncarious antimeres. Radiovisiographic images were captured utilizing standard bitewing radiographs via the parallel cone technique. Morphometric analysis was performed using Dexis and AutoCAD 2000 software, and data was analyzed using student's t test (unpaired). RESULTS: A significant difference was found in <e>crown</e> and coronal pulp dimensions in noncarious (sound) primary maxillary and mandibular second molars, even though no significant reductions were found in restored primary second molars. CONCLUSIONS: Crown and coronal pulp dimensions were significantly greater in noncarious primary mandibular second molars than in maxillary second molars. The mesiodistal crown width of maxillary molars was greater in males than in females. Nonsignificant reductions were observed in amalgam restored primary maxillary and mandibular second molars over a period of six months. No significant difference in pulpal dimensions was observed when Class I restorations were compared with Class II restorations in either arch.",M1

20197165,"Evaluation of distances between the mandibular teeth and the alveolar process in Brazilians with normal occlusion.INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to evaluate the distances between the mandibular permanent teeth and the alveolar process in Brazilians with normal occlusion and to compare them with normal American values. METHODS: We used 59 mandibular casts from untreated subjects who had permanent dentition and the 6 keys to normal occlusion. A computer program was used to calculate the distances between the dental reference points and the alveolar process for each tooth. The mean values were then compared to the normal values by applying the Student t test at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The results showed a progressive increase of these distances from the anterior region (incisors) to the posterior region (molars), from 0.00 to 2.49 mm. All measurements had statistically significant differences from the American sample, except for the values for canines and first premolars. CONCLUSIONS: Brazilians with normal occlusion have more lingual <e>crown</e> positions for the incisors, second premolars, and molars compared with Americans with normal occlusion. Although these findings were statistically significant, they are unlikely to be clinically significant.",M1
20189701,"Morphologic and bony structural changes in the mandible after a unilateral injection of botulinum neurotoxin in adult rats.PURPOSE: Previous animal experiments showed how reduced masticatory function plays an important role in the craniofacial and mandibular regions in the growing period. However, articles focusing on the effects of reduced masticatory function in adult animals are quite scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of reduced masticatory muscle activity on the jaw bones of adult rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BTX-A) was injected into the left masseter muscle to reduce masticatory muscle function, and sequential changes in the jaw bones were investigated. Ten male 60-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats with a mean body weight of about 300 g were used. The following procedures were performed on each sample: 25 U/mL (0.3 mL) of BTX-A was injected into the left masseter muscle, whereas the right masseter muscle received an equal amount of sterilized saline solution. Ninety days after the procedure, the rats were sacrificed, and the weights of the masseter muscles were recorded. Meanwhile, direct anthropometric measurements were taken, and the cortical thickness, trabecular thickness, and bone mineral content of the skull and mandible were measured. All measurements were evaluated with statistical software. RESULTS: There were significant differences in all measurements on the BTX-A side compared with those on the control side. The differences included a decreased ramus height, increased gonial angle, and increased <e>crown</e> height of the posterior teeth on the injection side. Significant decreases in the muscle weight, bone mineral content, cortical thickness, and trabecular thickness were also seen on the paralyzed side compared with the non-injection side. CONCLUSIONS: We found that reduced masticatory function in adult rats affected the weight of the masseter muscle and the bony structure and dentition.",M1
20156664,"A novel surgical approach to impacted mandibular third molars to reduce the risk of paresthesia: a case series.PURPOSE: Extraction of impacted mandibular third molars (M3s) may cause temporary or permanent neurosensorial disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Although the incidence of this complication is low, a great range of variability has been reported in the literature. Several methods to reduce or eliminate this complication have been proposed, such as orthodontic-assisted extraction, extraction of the second molar, or intentional odontoectomy. The purpose of this series of cases is to present a novel approach for a riskless extraction of impacted mandibular M3s in contact with the IAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine consecutive patients (4 male and 5 female; mean age 24.9 years, range 18-43 years) required the extraction of 10 horizontally or mesioangular impacted mandibular M3s. In all cases the M3 was in contact with the IAN with a high risk of nerve injury. A staged approached was proposed and accepted by the patients. This approach consisted in the surgical removal of the mesial portion of the anatomic <e>crown</e> to create adequate space for mesial M3 migration. After the migration of the M3 had taken place, the extraction could then be accomplished in a second surgical session minimizing neurological risks. RESULTS: All M3s moved mesially within 6 months (mean 174.1 days, range 92-354 days) and could be successfully removed without any neurological consequences. CONCLUSION: This technique may be considered as an alternative approach to the extraction of horizontally or mesioangular impacted M3s in proximity to the IAN.",M1

20089068,"Multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of an oblique <e>crown</e>-root fracture.This case report describes the management of an oblique crown-root fracture of the buccal cusp of the upper right first premolar. After removal of the fractured cusp, a provisional restorative build-up in this area was carried out, in order to carry out an endodontic treatment in a sterile environment. A glass fibre post and core were then constructed and over a 90-day period the tooth was extruded orthodontically by 4 mm. The periodontal fibres associated with this tooth were cut with a tiny surgical blade to help to prevent reintrusion of the tooth and achieve fine contouring of the gingival margins. The new tooth position was maintained with a retainer for a further 60 days and after a period with a provisional acrylic crown, a porcelain bonded crown was fitted. This case report demonstrates that such a multidisciplinary treatment approach to an oblique subgingival fracture is a reliable and predictable manner in which to save a tooth that would have otherwise been difficult, if not impossible, to restore with a resultant good long-term prognosis.",M1
20089057,"Fracture resistance of tooth fragment reattachment: effects of different preparation techniques and adhesive materials.The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the bond strengths of experimentally fractured human tooth fragments reattached with different adhesive materials and retentive techniques in vitro. Uncomplicated <e>crown</e> fractures were obtained on intact human mandibular permanent incisors by applying perpendicular load to the buccal aspect of tooth crowns. Fractured teeth were randomly assigned into one of three reattachment protocols: (i) Simple reattachment, (ii) Overcontour preparation, and (iii) Internal dentin groove. The first and second groups were divided into 10 subgroups, and the third group into five subgroups (n = 10 per group) with respect to five different adhesive systems (Prime&amp;Bond NT, Adper Single Bond II, Adper Prompt L-Pop, Clearfil S(3) Bond, G Bond) used with or without a hybrid resin composite (Z250). Restored teeth were subjected to thermal cycling, and subsequently to the same loading protocol used for fracturing intact teeth. Fracture strength after reattachment procedures was recorded as a percentage of the original fracture strength. Both type of adhesive material and placement of an intermediate layer of resin composite affected the fracture resistance (P &lt; 0.05). The highest fracture strength recovery was obtained using the internal dentin groove technique (54 +/- 0.58%, P &lt; 0.05), followed by the overcontour and simple reattachment protocols (49 +/- 0.58% and 32 +/- 0.82%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Ultramorphological evaluation of bonded specimens revealed voids and microcracks along the adhesive interface, which might contribute to postadhesive failure.",M1
20073541,"Standards for mesiodistal and buccolingual <e>crown</e> size and height of primary molars in a sample of Spanish children.AIM: The aim of this study was to obtain mesiodistal, buccolingual and height sizes of dental crowns of first and second primary molars in a sample of Spanish children given, not only their anthropological and forensic significance, but also their clinical interest for the future analysis of restorative and orthodontic treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements of mesiodistal, buccolingual size and height of the crowns of primary molars were studied. A transversally descriptive design was carried out and the interrelationship between these three dimensions was established. A sample of 703 first and second primary molars was selected from healthy Spanish boys and girls from 4 to 9 years old. Molars presenting anomalies of the crowns, caries or restorations were excluded. Measurements were made on dental plaster models, using a vernier caliper. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient was obtained and Wilcoxon's non- parametric test was applied for comparison of the mean, analysis of sexual dimorphism and comparison of antimeric teeth. RESULTS: Average sizes of each group of molars were obtained. Sexual dimorphism was studied utilizing the Wilcoxon test. A variability of relationship between the measurements was found in each molar studied. Primary second molars had less variability than first molars in the three measurements obtained. The measurement with the least variability was height, followed by mesiodistal size. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of primary molars showed that average sizes of boys' molars were significantly larger than those of girls. Relationship between the three measurements studied was variable but second molars showed less variability than first molars. The relationship between height and width was found significant in most of the molars. i.",M1

20043542,"Validity, reliability and reproducibility of three methods used to measure tooth widths for bolton analyses.BACKGROUND: Vernier calipers have traditionally been used as the 'gold-standard' for tooth width measurements. New digital methods may prove to be as valid, reliable and reproducible as caliper measurements. AIMS: To determine the validity, reliability and reproducibility of mesiodistal <e>crown</e> measurements made with calipers, using the DigiModel method and on digital photographs, and to determine the validity, reliability and reproducibility when the measurements are employed in Bolton tooth size analyses. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive study models were used. The maximum mesiodistal crown widths of 12 teeth in each arch (first molar to first molar) were measured with digital calipers, using the DigiModel software (OrthoProof, Caulfield South, Victoria, Australia) and on standardised digital photographs of the models by eight examiners. One examiner measured all models three times using the three measurement methods, two examiners measured all models once using the three measurement methods and five examiners measured all models once using the calipers only. Validity for the widths of individual teeth, the mean tooth width and the Bolton ratios were assessed using a general linear model two-way analysis of variance and pair-wise comparisons between the two digital methods and the calipers. Reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and reproducibility with the intra-class correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the tooth widths measured with DigiModel and the calipers (p &lt; 0.001) and with the calipers and digital photographs (p &lt; 0.001). However these discrepancies were judged not to be clinically significant. The Cronbach's alpha scores for all methods were classified as 'excellent'. The intra-class correlation coefficient values exceeded 0.75 for the digital calipers, 0.79 for DigiModel and 0.54 for the digital photographs. CONCLUSIONS: The validities of DigiModel and digital photographs for tooth width measurements and Bolton analyses are clinically acceptable. The reliability of both methods is also excellent. However, DigiModel software provided more accurate Bolton's ratios and demonstrated greater reproducibility than the digital photographs.",M1
20042740,"Formation of the tooth-bone interface.Not only are teeth essential for mastication, but also missing teeth are considered a social handicap due to speech and aesthetic problems, with a resulting high impact on emotional well-being. Several treatment procedures are currently available for tooth replacement with mostly inert prosthetic materials and implants. Natural tooth substitution based on copying the developmental process of tooth formation is particularly challenging and creates a rapidly developing area of molecular dentistry. In any approach, functional interactions among the tooth, the surrounding bone, and the periodontium must be established. Therefore, recent research in craniofacial genetics searches for mechanisms responsible for correct cell and tissue interactions, not only within a specific structure, but also in the context of supporting structures. A tooth <e>crown</e> that is not functionally anchored to roots and bone is useless. This review aims to summarize the developmental and tissue homeostatic aspects of the tooth-bone interface, from the initial patterning toward tooth eruption and lifelong interactions between the tooth and its surrounding alveolar bone.",M1
20032612,"Age-related changes in <e>crown</e> and root length in Sri Lankan Sinhalese.Exploration of the relationship between tooth dimensions, body size, and age is important in paleontology, forensic odontology and aesthetic dentistry. It is reasonable to speculate that tooth length is associated with stature since teeth contribute to facial height. This study aimed to determine whether there was an association between tooth length and stature and age in a sample of Sri Lankan Sinhalese. Extracted teeth of adults, whose age, sex and standing height were known, were used for measurements. The total tooth length (TTL), crown length (CL) and root length (RL) of permanent maxillary central (68) and lateral (67) incisors were measured using a caliper. Statistical analyses were performed with the software MINITAB version 14.0 (Minitab Inc, USA). Mean age and standing height were 47.81 yr and 152.15 cm, respectively. There was no significant correlation between stature and tooth lengths of incisors. However, age was found to have a significant correlation with RL, (r = 0.26, P &lt; 0.05) and CL (r = -0.28, P &lt; 0.05). Absence of an association between tooth length and stature indicated that the genetic linkage between tooth size and stature was weak, suggesting that determination of stature from tooth lengths is unwarranted. The association between tooth length and age indicates the importance of root length in age determination.",M1
20002535,"The use of likelihood ratio methodology to find predictors of treatment outcome in patients with dental injury diagnoses.The purpose of this prospective, cohort study of patients with dental injuries was to develop prediction rules to predict treatment response related to the management of dental injuries. The study comprised of 130 patients with a single permanent incisor affected by a dental displacement (n = 100) or fracture injury (n = 30). Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements of pulpal blood flow (PBF) were taken 6 and 18 weeks after dental injury Treatment response (success or failure) was categorized based on findings of clinical and radiographical evaluation after 9 months. Forty-four (34%) subjects were categorized as treatment success (absence of loss of sensitivity, periapical radiolucency and grey discolouration of <e>crown</e>), 43 (33%) as treatment failures (loss of sensitivity, and periapical radiolucency and/or grey discolouration of crown) and 43 (33%) as acceptable outcome (loss of sensitivity). After using univariate analysis to determine the association between potential clinical and LDF predictor variables and treatment response status, preliminary prediction rules were developed for prediction of success [positive likelihood ratio (LR), 29.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-496.4] and failure (negative LR, 0.55; CI, 0.4-0.7). The most important variables were subluxation, root fracture, baseline PBF level and change in PBF level at 3-month follow-up. Outcome following the management of dental injuries may be predicted from variables collected from LDF and physical examination. Predictive modelling may provide clinicians with the opportunity to identify 'at-risk' patients early and initiate specific treatment approaches.",M1
19969480,"Management of <e>crown</e>-root fracture tooth by intra-alveolar transplantation with 180-degree rotation and suture fixation.Teeth with traumatic crown-root fractures extending subgingivally and involving the entire width of the tooth may have problems in endodontic isolation, periodontal maintenance, and restoration. A number of techniques, such as crown lengthening, and orthodontic or surgical extrusion, have been described for treatment of crown-root fractures. However, all of these techniques have limitations in terms of the extended time required for treatment, cost, and esthetic considerations. Intra-alveolar transplantation is an alternative treatment option in the management of complicated crown-root fractures. We describe a case of intra-alveolar transplantation with 180( degrees ) rotation and suture fixation. At 1-year follow-up, the replanted tooth has normal function and no obvious inflammatory root resorption on radiographic examination.",M1
19962602,"Influence of tooth <e>crown</e> size on malocclusion.INTRODUCTION: Malocclusion is an increasingly common, multifactorial problem. The most prevalent malocclusion results from excess tooth size compared with the size of the supporting bone; this creates a tooth-size arch-size discrepancy. Although the causes of malocclusion are obscure in most instances, a contributing factor appears to be tooth size. The goal of this study was to test whether the dimensions of the crowns of the permanent teeth differ in young men with naturally good occlusions compared with those who required orthodontic treatment. METHODS: Tooth crown dimensions (mesiodistal and buccolingual) were measured in 2 samples of American white men. One group (n = 42) had naturally good occlusion; the other group (n = 90) required orthodontic treatment to correct tooth-size arch-size discrepancy. RESULTS: The means of 23 of the 24 tooth crown dimensions-involving the 14 tooth types (central incisor through first molar) in both arches-were significantly larger in subjects with malocclusions than in those with good occlusions. Multivariable analysis showed that mesiodistal size of the maxillary lateral incisor was the most significant difference between the 2 samples, but this might reflect the composition of the sample (maxillary lateral incisor size is notoriously variable in white men). CONCLUSIONS: Tooth size is not necessarily the foremost cause of malocclusion in a patient, but it should be evaluated.",M1

This study explores the potential of a new three-dimensional technique for the reconstruction of dental growth profiles, using teeth from a medieval child from Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The crowns of three anterior teeth were imaged and analyzed using the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope. Individual perikyma grooves can be unambiguously identified on a profile of the reconstructed enamel surface and direct distances between successive pairs of perikyma grooves can be calculated from coordinate data. This quantitative approach constitutes a more objective way to record perikymata spacing than current methods.",M1
19936534,"Microbiological and microscopic analysis of the pulp of non-vital traumatized teeth with intact <e>crowns</e>.OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the presence of microorganisms and analyzed microscopically the pulp of 20 traumatized human teeth with intact crowns and clinical diagnosis of pulp necrosis, based on the association of at least three of the clinical criteria: crown discoloration, negative response to thermal and electric pulp vitality tests, positive response to vertical and horizontal percussion, pain on palpation or mobility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Microbiological collection was performed from the root canals to evaluate the presence of microorganisms. The pulp samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) for histological evaluation of possible morphological alterations. RESULTS: Analysis of results was performed by statistical tests (linear regression test and diagnostic analysis) and subjective analysis of the sections stained with H.E. and revealed that only 15% of the sample did not exhibit microbial development. The time elapsed between dental trauma and onset of endodontic intervention ranged from 15 days to 31 months; the percussion test presented high sensitivity (80%) for detection of microorganisms in the root canal of traumatized teeth; 3 teeth (15%) did not present pulp tissue, being characterized as complete autolysis; analysis of pulp samples was performed on the other 17 cases, among which 3 (15%) exhibited partial necrosis without possibility of repair and 14 presented complete necrosis; none of the clinical criteria employed for the diagnosis of pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth was pathognomonic. CONCLUSIONS: The present results allowed the following conclusions: with regard to microbiological findings, 85% of teeth presented microorganisms in the root canal, despite the presence of an intact crown. Concerning the microscopic findings, 100% of traumatized teeth presented pulp necrosis; the pulp vitality tests based on pulp response to heat, cold and vertical percussion were the most reliable to diagnose pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth.",M1
19891719,"Effect of restorations on pulpal blood flow in molars measured by laser Doppler flowmetry.AIM: To: (i) compare laser Doppler pulpal blood flow (PBF) signals from restored and unrestored first molar teeth, (ii) investigate PBF in teeth with large and small restorations, and (iii) to relate PBF to pulp chamber dimensions on radiographs. METHODOLOGY: Bitewing radiographs of young adults with restored first molars were obtained and pulp chamber dimensions measured. Subjects were divided into 2 groups: group A with a restored tooth and an unrestored contralateral (43 subjects) and group B, those with a molar with a small (usually occlusal) restoration whilst the contralateral tooth had an extensive occlusal restoration (or restorations) or restored proximal surface(s) and/or cuspal overlay (31 subjects). The 148 teeth responded to electric pulp testing, and their PBF was recorded using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Data were analysed using Student's t-test. RESULTS: In group A the PBF in the restored teeth was significantly lower than in unrestored contralaterals (P = 0.028) and the total pulp chamber area and that in the clinical <e>crown</e> were smaller (P = 0.039 and 0.021 respectively). The group B molars with large restorations had significantly lower PBF than contralaterals with small restorations (P = 0.001), and their total pulp chamber area and pulp chamber width at cervix were reduced significantly (P = 0.003 and 0.032 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In molars the size of the pulp chamber was influenced by the presence of restorations and the PBF was reduced when restorations were present. Size and extent of restorations had a significant effect on PBF.",M1
19879641,"3D variations in human <e>crown</e> dentin tubule orientation: a phase-contrast microtomography study.OBJECTIVES: Tubules dominate the microstructure of dentin, and in crowns of human teeth they are surrounded by thick mineralized peritubular cuffs of high stiffness. Here we examine the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of tubules in relation to enamel on the buccal and lingual aspects of intact premolars and molars. Specifically we investigate the angular orientation of tubules relative to the plane of the junction of dentin with enamel (DEJ) by means of wet, non-destructive and high-resolution phase-contrast (coherent) tomography. METHODS: Enamel capped dentin samples (n=16), cut from the buccal and lingual surfaces of upper and lower premolar and molar teeth, were imaged in water by high-resolution synchrotron-based phase-contrast X-ray radiography. Reconstructed 3D virtual images were co-aligned with respect to the DEJ plane. The average tubule orientation was determined at increasing distances from the DEJ, based on integrated projections onto orthogonal virtual planes. The angle and curl of the tubules were determined every 100 microm to a depth of 1.4mm beneath the DEJ. RESULTS: Most tubules do not extend at right angles from the DEJ. Even when they do, tubules always change their orientations substantially within the first half-millimeter zone beneath the DEJ, both on the buccal and lingual aspects of premolar and molar teeth. Tubules also tend to curl and twist within this zone. Student t-tests indicate that lower teeth seem to have greater tilts in the tubule orientations relative to the DEJ normal with an average angle of 42 degrees (+/-2.0 degrees), whereas upper teeth exhibit a smaller change of orientation, with an average of 32 degrees (+/-2.1 degrees). SIGNIFICANCE: Tubules are a central characteristic of dentin, with important implications on how it is arranged and what the properties are. Knowing about the path that tubules follow is important for various reasons, ranging form improving control over restorative procedures to understanding or simulating the mechanical properties of teeth. At increasing depths of dentin beneath enamel, tubules are significantly tilted relative to the DEJ norm, which may be important to understand clinical challenges such as sensitivity, effectiveness of bonding techniques or prediction of possible paths for bacterial invasion. Our data show dissimilar average tubule angles of upper versus lower teeth with respect to the DEJ which presumably contributes to different shear responses of the tissue under function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D finite element method (FEM) was used to simulate en masse anterior teeth retraction in sliding mechanics. The degree of labiolingual tipping of the maxillary central incisor was calculated when the retraction force was applied to different heights of a power arm set mesial or distal to the canine. RESULTS: When the power arm was placed mesial to the canine, at the level of 0 mm (bracket slot level), uncontrolled lingual <e>crown</e> tipping of the incisor was observed and the anterior segment of the archwire was deformed downward. At a power arm height of 5.5 mm, bodily movement was produced and the archwire was less deformed. When the power arm height exceeded 5.5 mm, the anterior segment of the archwire was raised upward and lingual root tipping occurred. When the power arm was placed distal to the canine, lingual crown tipping was observed up to a level of 11.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of the power arm of an archwire between the lateral incisor and canine enables orthodontists to maintain better control of the anterior teeth in sliding mechanics. Both the biomechanical principles associated with the tooth's center of resistance and the deformation of the archwire should be taken into consideration for predicting and planning orthodontic tooth movement.",M1
19843133,"Rationale for esthetic tissue preservation of a fresh extraction socket by an implant treatment concept simulating a tooth replantation.In cases of an immediate insertion and loading of implants after a traumatic loss of the patient's own dentition or due to an inevitable extraction of an anterior tooth, it is essential to provide the patient with an adequate provisional <e>crown</e>. A soft-tissue recession must be avoided, whether it is due to a compression of the peri-implant soft-tissue caused by an over-dimensioned restoration in the cervical collar of the provisional crown or to a too small dimensioned sulcus former. A simulation of the exact dimension of the lost tooth - especially on the cervical part of the new provisional restoration - is expected to preserve all relevant information and allows the design of a naturally looking emergence profile. Based on theoretical considerations and a case report, the authors intend to demonstrate that a near-naturally dimensioned sealing of the dento-gingival soft-tissue collar may initiate a tissue-maintaining healing process, similar to a tooth replantation. The natural dental crown, connected to an implant instead of the root, is applied for a tight sealing of the wound. If due to traumatic impact the tooth is no longer available, a naturally dimensioned crown restoration will serve as an alternative wound sealant.",M1
19843130,"Knowledge of the management of paediatric dental traumas by non-dental professionals in emergency rooms in South Araucanía, Temuco, Chile.AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes regarding first aid for dental trauma in children (TDI) by non-dental professionals and paramedical technicians of hospital emergency rooms in the South Araucanía Health Service, Chile, which was attained through application of a survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from people with occupations in the respective emergency rooms. The participants were 82 people that were interviewed using a questionnaire regarding management of dental trauma. Paramedic technicians, general and specialist doctors, and nurses were included in this survey. The appraisal covered diverse aspects: birth date, age, sex, years of experience in the emergency room, and questions regarding specific dental trauma topics, which focused on <e>crown</e> fractures, luxation injuries in permanent dentition, avulsion in primary and permanent teeth, and the respective emergency treatments. RESULTS: Of the participants, 78.1% reported to have been presented with a TDI patient. The majority (90.2%) had not received formal training on TDI. These results revealed a wide distribution of responses. The overall dental trauma knowledge among the participants was relatively poor. For crown fractures management 54.9% indicated that they would ask the affected child about the crown remnants. In regard to transport and storage medium of avulsed permanent teeth, only 9.8% of the participants answered correctly and 43.9% of respondents stated that they would not replant an avulsed permanent tooth, since that procedure is considered the responsibility of a dentist. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the respondents were not knowledgeable regarding TDI or the management and benefits of timely care, particularly in cases of avulsed permanent teeth. Therefore, formal education and training on the topic is suggested during undergraduate studies.",M1
19828986,"Synetic superimposition of dental 3D data: application in twin studies.BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional measurement of dental morphology is providing new variables and shape information not available previously, and the reliability of these data has proved to be substantial. Accurate superimposition of 2D and 3D data-sets has several applications in dental research when making comparisons of similar structures. For example, two data-sets of the same object can be superimposed to highlight differences apparent in limited region(s) of the tooth <e>crown</e>. When significant regions represented by the two data-sets are identical, registration of the images can be achieved by standard superimposition methods. However, for comparisons of crown morphologies between monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins, the data sets are similar but not identical so a new approach to superimposition has been developed. AIM: To develop a non 'best fit' (Synetic) method for the 3D superimposition of non-similar objects that forms one comparable interface providing enhanced methodology for the analysis of differences within the dentition of twins. METHOD: A minimised least-squares registration approach is followed by diffusion based registration to provide global minimisation between points that is not based on a best fit algorithm. This process is linear and therefore the method ensures uniqueness of the superimposition. RESULTS: Initial results indicate a reliable method producing only one output as opposed to best fit approaches that may generate a different output each time. CONCLUSION: Diffusion-based registration offers a more reliable approach to superimposing non-identical objects, such as the tooth crowns of monozygotic co-twins, than conventional best-fit methods.",M1
19828964,"How many landmarks? Assessing the classification accuracy of Pan lower molars using a geometric morphometric analysis of the occlusal basin as seen at the enamel-dentine junction.Previous research has demonstrated that species and subspecies of extant chimpanzees and bonobos can be distinguished on the basis of the shape of enamel-dentine junction of lower molar <e>crowns</e>. Thus, there is potential for fossil taxa, particularly fossil hominins, to be distinguished at similar taxonomic levels using lower molar crown morphology. New imaging techniques allow for the collection of large amounts of shape data, but it is not clear whether taxonomic distinctiveness increases with the inclusion of more and more finely detailed aspects of crown shape. We examine whether increasing the amount of shape data collected will lead to an increase in the accuracy with which enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) shape classifies Pan lower first and second molars at the species and subspecies level. Micro-computed tomography was employed to non-destructively image the EDJ and geometric morphometric analytical methods were used to compare EDJ shape among samples of Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytestroglodytes, and Pan troglodytes verus. The results of discriminant analyses using three landmark sets (number of landmarks=8, 112, and 534 landmarks and semi-landmarks, respectively) indicate a high degree of classification accuracy for each landmark set, with small increases in accuracy as the numbers of landmarks are increased. The morphological differences in EDJ shape among the taxa are subtle, but consistent, and relate to the relative height and position of the dentine horns. Thus, EDJ shape can contribute to taxonomic analyses and the more information that can be included the better.",M1
19828963,"Molar <e>crown</e> and root size relationship in anthropoid primates.Mandibular corpus form is thought to reflect masticatory function and the size of the dentition, but there is no universal association between crown dimensions and corpus size across anthropoids. Previous research was based on the assumption that crown size is an appropriate proxy for overall tooth size, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. This study assesses the relationship between the volume and surface area of molar crowns and roots by examining two main hypotheses: (1) crown size correlates significantly with root size, and (2) the proportion of root-to-crown surface area is related to dietary proclivity. Permanent M2s (n=58) representing 19 anthropoid species were CT scanned and the volume and surface area of the crown and root were measured. Interspecific correlation and regression analyses reveal significant isometric relationships between crown and root volume and a positive allometric relationship between root and crown surface area (i.e. as crown surface area increases, root surface area becomes disproportionately greater). Intraspecifically, crown and root surface area correlate significantly in some species where such analyses were possible. In general, hard object feeders exhibit relatively larger root surface area per unit crown surface area compared to soft and tough object feeders. The results also show that despite differences in food specialization closely related species have similar root-to-crown surface area proportions, thus indicating a strong phylogenetic influence. Since it is possible that, at least in some species, crown and root size vary independently, future studies should elucidate the relationship between tooth root size and mandible form.",M1
19828961,"Phylogeny, life history and the timing of molar <e>crown</e> formation in two archaic ungulates, Meniscotherium and Phenacodus (Mammalia, 'Condylarthra').The condylarths, or archaic ungulates, are a paraphyletic mammalian group including a number of fossil taxa whose relationships are unresolved. Included are two genera from the Paleocene and Eocene of North America, Meniscotherium and Phenacodus. Some workers place both genera in the family Phenacodontidae, while others exclude the highly dentally derived Meniscotherium. In this study, we use growth increments in histological thin sections to examine the timing of crown formation in five molars of Meniscotherium and one each of Phenacodusintermedius and Phenacodus trilobatus. We also use perikymata counts on an additional six molars of Meniscotherium. Although estimated body mass and molar dimensions in Meniscotherium are smaller than in either species of Phenacodus, molar formation times are longer, ranging from 0.71 to 1.44 years. Both Phenacodus molars take less than a year to form. Crown extension rates, the rate at which the crown grows in height, are as low as 3-15 microm per day in Meniscotherium, but range from 13 to 54 microm per day in Phenacodus. Although striae periodicities and daily enamel secretion rate are similar in both genera, the differences in the crown extension rate and overall timing of crown formation suggest differences in life histories and raise questions about the phylogenetic relationship of the two genera.",M1
19782342,"Regional distribution of interglobular dentine in human teeth.Interglobular dentine (IGD) is an area of poorly mineralized dentine matrix. It has been reported that there is an association between the retraction of odontoblast processes (OP) and the formation of IGD. A variation of the extent of OP has been described depending on the region of the tooth and age. This study aimed to find out the regional distribution of IGD in human teeth to observe any association between the extent of OP and the pattern of distribution of IGD. Ground sections were prepared from 52 extracted permanent teeth and the presence of IGD was observed in different regions of the <e>crown</e> and the root. The highest occurrence of IGD was found in the cervical and middle thirds followed by intercuspal, and coronal third in the crown. Statistical analysis of data depicted that the occurrence of IGD differed according to the region of the tooth. In roots, the highest occurrence of IGD was seen in the cervical third followed by the middle third. Previous reports have shown that OP extend up to the dentine-enamel junction in the coronal region and to the inner one-third of the cervical region. The varied pattern of distribution of IGD in the crown and root observed in our results corresponds to the above findings. Therefore, it is reasonable to surmise that there is an association between the distribution of IGD and the extent of OP. This allows us to confer that IGD tends to form in areas where OP do not extend to the dentine-enamel junction.",M1
19778746,"Distortional effect of beam-hardening artefacts on microCT: a simulation study based on an in vitro caries model.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess quantitatively the degrading effect of artefacts caused by beam hardening on the microscopic computerized tomography (microCT) measurements of an in vitro caries model. STUDY DESIGN: A simulation-based method was described, with which the degrading effect of microCT artefacts on certain parameters of the observed structure could be determined. Simulations were carried out with polychromatic and monochromatic X-ray source, and a linearization method with a second-order polynomial fit algorithm was used in specific cases to correct the beam hardening artefact. The virtual test object was a half-<e>crown</e> of a tooth with an artificial caries lesion. RESULTS: For simulation with monochromatic X-ray source, the relative error of lesion depth and thickness measurements of the remineralized layer was found to be 1%-2%. For polychromatic X-ray source, and omitting beam hardening correction, the relative error exceeded 6%. After appropriate beam-hardening correction, the relative error of the measurement could be reduced to 1%-2%. CONCLUSION: With the adjustment simulated in this study, microCT having polychromatic X-ray source resulted in the same level of error as with monochromatic source if the linearization method to correct the beam hardening was used. The presented simulation-based method is a useful way to determine artefact-caused distortions for other studies testing objects with different material and geometry.",M1

In this paper two different cases of early loss of primary incisors resulting from luxations are described. Removable esthetic space maintainers were placed using the natural crown of the traumatized teeth and the children were evaluated over a 12 month period.

19705936,"Computational formulation of orthodontic tooth-extraction decisions. Part I: to extract or not to extract.OBJECTIVE: To develop a mathematical model that simulates whether or not to extract teeth in optimizing orthodontic treatment outcome and to formulate the morphologic traits sensitive to optimizing the tooth-extraction/nonextraction decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 188 conventional orthodontic records of patients with good treatment outcomes were collected, and dentofacial morphologic traits, along with their degrees of influence in the optimized model, were determined. RESULTS: The rate of coincidence between the recommendations given by the optimized model and the actual treatments performed was found to be 90.4%. The major morphologic traits and their corresponding influences in improving the simulation accuracy of the model were the incisor overjet (3.0) and the size of the basal arch relative to the sum of the mesiodistal <e>crown</e> diameters of the upper dentition (2.4) and the lower dentition (2.0). The remaining 22 morphologic-trait variables were also found to be indispensable in achieving robust simulation readings. CONCLUSION: A mathematical model that simulates whether or not to extract teeth in optimizing orthodontic treatment outcomes with a success rate of 90.4% at its prediction performance was developed. This model has 25 morphologic traits with four major categories (sagittal dentoskeletal and soft tissue relationship, vertical dentoskeletal relationship, transverse dental relationship, and intra-arch conditions) that affected the accuracy in determining optimal tooth extractions/nonextractions.",M1

19702075,"Premature birth--Studies on orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology and function.A series of studies have been initiated implying a unique opportunity to evaluate and compare malocclusion traits, orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology, mandibular function, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and headache between extremely preterm (EPT; born before the 29th week of gestation) and very preterm (VPT; born between 29 and 32 weeks of gestation) and full-term born children. THIS THESIS WAS BASED ON FOUR STUDIES: Paper I. A systematic literature review was undertaken to answer the following questions: Does prematurity result in alterations of palatal morphology, dental occlusion, tooth-<e>crown</e> dimensions, tooth maturation and eruption? What role does neonatal oral intubation play in the appearance of the alterations? Are the alterations in morphology permanent or transient? The literature search spanned from January 1966 to November 2002 and was later extended to September 2008. Furthermore, a quality analysis of the methodological soundness of the studies in the review was performed. Paper II-IV. The aims were to compare EPT and VPT 8- to 10-year-old children with matched full-term controls considering: Prevalence of malocclusion traits and orthodontic treatment need (Paper II). Craniofacial morphology (Paper III). Mandibular function, signs and symptoms of TMD and headache (Paper IV). KEY FINDINGS IN PAPER I AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY SEARCH: Moderate scientific evidence existed for more malocclusion traits among premature children. Limited evidence was found for no delay in dental eruption, if corrected age was considered for the premature children. Insufficientwas considered for the premature children. Insufficient evidence was found for altered tooth-crown dimensions and permanent alteration of palatal morphology among prematurely children. Thus, further well-designed controlled studies which should also consider orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology, TMD and headache are needed. KEY FINDINGS IN PAPER II-IV: A higher prevalence of malocclusion traits and the assessed need of orthodontic treatment were higher among the preterm children compared with full-term born children (Paper II). Several craniofacial parameters differed significantly between preterm and full-term born children (Paper III). Preterm children did not differ from full-term born children when considering diagnoses according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD), signs and symptoms of TMD or headache (Paper IV). KEY CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The increased survival rate of very preterm and especially the extremely preterm children contribute to a new group of children in society. The dental clinician should, therefore, be aware of the potential for a higher number of malocclusion traits, more malocclusion traits per individual, greater orthodontic treatment need and altered craniofacial morphology in prematurely born children compared with full-term born children. In spite of this, the prematurely born children had not more TMD or headache than full-term born children at the age of 8-10 years.",M1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 20 teeth with crown-root fractures in 18 periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated. After open-flap access, crown-root fragments were adhesively reattached to the root stub. In all cases, the vertical difference between the alveolar bone crest and the fracture line was &lt;or=1 mm, i.e. violating the biological width. Subsequently, clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP) and gingival index (GI) scores were recorded at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively for the restored teeth as well as plaque index (PlI) and periodontal screening index (PSI) values for the whole dentition. RESULTS: Two years after therapy, recorded CAL, PPD, BoP, GI, PlI and PSI scores revealed healthy periodontal conditions in 18 out of 20 treated teeth. Two teeth had suffered again from fragment fracture due to new traumata. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesive fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth affected by crown-root fractures had no detrimental impact on periodontal health over a time course of 2 years.",M1

The patient underwent no treatment for 8 years and then presented with the complaint of recurrent pain and swelling. Intraoral examination showed crown fractures in the maxillary right central and left lateral incisors, while radiographic examination revealed large radiolucent lesions related to the periapical area of these teeth and a horizontal root fracture in the middle third of the maxillary left central incisor. Endodontic therapy and periapical surgery were performed for the persistent periapical periodontitis associated with the crown-fractured teeth.

19634463,"The accuracy of a 3-D laser scanner for <e>crown</e> width measurements.BACKGROUND: Virtual dental casts have been recently introduced to orthodontics. The problem of capturing the shapes of teeth on study casts may be complicated by the presence of undercut areas and deep grooves. AIMS: This study aimed to develop a 3-D laser scanner and associated software, and to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of mesiodistal crown width measurements based on slice distinction. METHODS: To evaluate reproducibility: a cube was scanned with readily available equipment and the digital measurements compared to caliper measurements of the cube; and the mesiodistal widths of artificial upper teeth were measured, set-up in a dental model, scanned, measured on the virtual study models and compared with the reference measurements. Custom software was used to capture and process the resulting images. To determine validity artificial teeth were measured with calipers, set-up in 20 different malocclusions, duplicated and scanned. The caliper measurements of groups of teeth (incisors, canines, premolars, molars) were compared with digital measurements of the same teeth. In the second method to determine validity, 10 dental casts were scanned and measured by two examiners and the mesio-distal widths compared with the reference values, and with each other. RESULTS: The digital measurements of the cube fell within 0.1 mm of the reference value. The absolute error in repeated measures of the dental model was 0.32 +/- 0.25 mm. The overall correlation between 3-D images of the teeth and the reference values, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was 0.84. The most and least valid results for groups of teeth were the premolars and canines, respectively. The inter-observer ICC was 0.60, and each examiner's ICC versus the reference values were 0.833 and 0.855. CONCLUSIONS: The mesiodistal widths of teeth and groups of teeth can be reliably and validly measured on virtual study models using the scanner and software developed for this purpose. Inaccuracy in the canine region may be overcome by using a smaller rotational angle during scanning.",M1

19615582,"Dental injuries in association with facial fractures.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between dental injuries and facial fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 273 patients examined at a level 1 trauma center in Switzerland from September 2005 until August 2006 who had facial fractures. Medical history and clinical and radiologic examination findings were recorded to evaluate demographics, etiology, presentation, and type of facial fracture, as well as its relationship to dental injury site and type. RESULTS: In 273 patients with dentition, we recorded 339 different facial fractures. Of these patients, 130 (47.5%) sustained a fracture in the non-tooth-bearing region, 44 (16%) had a fractured maxilla, and 65 (24%) had a fractured mandible. Among 224 patients with dentition who had a facial fracture in only 1 compartment, 140 injured teeth were found in 50 patients. Of 122 patients with an injury limited to the non-tooth-bearing facial skeleton, 12 sustained dental trauma (10%). In patients with fractures limited to the maxilla (n = 41), 6 patients had dental injuries (14.5%). In patients with fractures to the mandible (n = 61), 24 sustained dental injuries (39%). When we compared the type of tooth lesion and the location, simple <e>crown</e> fractures prevailed in both jaws. Patients with a fracture of the mandible were most likely to have a dental injury (39.3%). The highest incidence of dental lesions was found in the maxilla in combination with fractures of the lower jaw (39%). This incidence was even higher than the incidence of dental lesions in the lower jaw in combination with fractures of the mandible (24%). CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the association of dental injuries and maxillofacial fractures is a basic tool for their prevention. Our study showed that in cases of trauma with mandibular fracture, the teeth in the upper jaw might be at higher risk than the teeth in the lower jaw. Further larger-scale studies on this topic could clarify this finding and may provide suggestions for the amelioration of safety devices (such as modified bicycle helmets).",M1
19591330,"Coronectomy to prevent damage to the inferior alveolar nerve.Conventional wisdom advises that when a tooth needs to be extracted, the whole tooth should be removed, usually with as little surrounding bone as possible. However, the evidence to support this is not compelling, and every dentist has experienced cases where the apices of teeth are not removed for a variety of reasons and, in most cases, the patient seems to suffer no ill effects. If one extrapolates from this, it is evident that there might be instances where it is actually preferable to leave the apical part of the root rather than remove it, and this can be carried out deliberately. The usual time that one would consider this is when the inferior alveolar nerve is intimately related to the roots of the lower molar teeth, and this occurs most often in relation to the third molar. This concept of deliberately removing only the <e>crown</e> and part of the root of the tooth is known variously as coronectomy, partial root removal, deliberate vital root retention, or partial odontectomy.",M1

Various treatment modalities are available depending upon the clinical, physiological and radiographic status of the involved tooth. The aim of this article was to discuss techniques for the management of complicated crown fractures. SUMMARY: Management of complicated crown fractures depends upon several factors with the result that various clinical modalities have been suggested. Seven case reports of complicated crown fractures are presented and risks/benefits of the treatment plans are discussed. KEY LEARNING POINTS: Proper diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up care are important factors in the prognosis of complicated crown fractures. Thorough understanding of the available treatment modalities and their specific indications is critical.

19524821,"An engineering analysis of dental occlusion principles.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical model of contacting teeth, based on principles of basic engineering statics. The model would be used to demonstrate the interactions between occlusal contacts and tooth loading (forces and moments) and to critique occlusion-related dogma. METHODS: Free-body diagrams were drawn to depict 2 teeth in occlusal contact. In combination with the concept of the center of resistance, the governing equilibrium equations were derived and used to solve for the forces and moments on the teeth and to investigate the influences of tripod and cusp-fossa occlusal schemes. RESULTS: With a specific load on a tooth, it was demonstrated that the load on the opposing tooth and the concomitant occlusal scheme dictated <e>crown</e>-crown contact forces that can be computed. CONCLUSIONS: This engineering analysis suggests flaws in widely held notions about the mechanics of occlusion. Loading that is generally considered clinically desirable is certain to produce undesirable loading on the opposing tooth. The complex relationships between the loads on teeth and crown-crown occlusal contacts make it virtually impossible to control tooth loading with occlusal equilibration.

This paper describes apexification using calcium hydroxide medicaments of an immature permanent central incisor in which spontaneous re-eruption as well as severe inflammatory external root resorption was observed following traumatic intrusion. A 10-year-old boy was referred to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry 3 days after having fallen at school. Intraoral examination revealed intrusive luxation and an enamel-dentin <e>crown</e> fracture of the maxillary left central incisor (Tooth 21). The tooth was not sensitive to percussion and responded positively to electric pulp test. Radiographic examination indicated that the tooth had an open apex and had been intruded approximately 3-4 mm relative to the cemento-enamel junction of the adjacent right central incisor. The tooth was left for possible spontaneous re-eruption. The crown fracture was temporarily restored using glass ionomer cement, and the patient was scheduled for recall in 2 weeks, at which time intraoral examination revealed spontaneous re-eruption of the tooth. However, radiographic examination also showed inflammatory external root resorption. The root canal was accessed and filled with a calcium hydroxide paste; however, follow-up examination indicated continuing resorption after 1 month. Calcium hydroxide plus points (CHPP) was chosen as an alternative treatment. At the end of 6 months of CHPP treatment, examination showed no further progression of external resorption and complete apexification of the tooth. After a 24-month follow-up period, no signs of pathosis were observed.",M1
19506742,"Morpho-dimensional analysis of the maxillary central incisor clinical <e>crown</e> in cases of congenitally missing upper lateral incisors.AIM: the purpose of this study was to analyse the crown morphology of maxillary central incisors in cases of agenesis of the upper lateral incisors, in order to establish patterns of associations between reduced mesio-distal dimensions of anterior teeth and tooth abnormalities in number. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the sample consisted of 31 patients with unilateral and bilateral absence of maxillary lateral incisors. Ninety six subjects without any agenesis were included in the control group. Mesio-distal widths of each central incisor crown were measured by means of 2 parameters; at the apical third of the crown and at the contact point. A Student's t test was used to compare the results of each measurement within both group. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in mesio-distal diameters at the contact points but not in the mesio-distal diameter at the apical third of the crown. CONCLUSIONS: It could be suggested that in case of cases of agenesis of the lateral incisors the central incisors show a rectangular shape of the crown instead of the trapezoid shape in subjects without agenesis. These remarks should be considered before the orthodontic-prosthetic treatment is planned.",M1
19496799,"Traumatic dental injuries in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and distribution of traumatic injuries in 247 children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were 7-16 years old and attended the Ondokuz Mayis University Medical Faculty (Department of Child Psychiatry, Samsun, Turkey). Each psychiatric diagnosis was based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Traumatic dental injuries were recorded using the classification of the World Health Organization, which was slightly modified by Andreasen and Andreasen (Textbook and color atlas of traumatic injuries, 3rd edn. Copenhagen, Denmark: Munksgaard; 1994. p. 151). Thirty-two percent (78/247) of the ADHD children presented 103 traumatized teeth. The frequency of dental injuries peaked in children who were 10-12 years of age, and showed no significant difference between subtypes of ADHD or gender. The maxillary central incisors were the most vulnerable to injury, and there were no differences between the right and the left sides in terms of susceptibility. Uncomplicated <e>crown</e> fracture (52.4%) and complicated crown fracture (16.6%) were the most commonly encountered types of injury. The main causes of dental injury were falls, collisions with objects, violence, and traffic accidents, and there was no difference in the frequencies of these causes between subtypes of ADHD, age, or gender. Only 5.1% (4/78) of the ADHD children sought treatment within the first 24 h of the injury. In conclusion, children with ADHD experience dental injuries more frequently than was previously described.",M1
19467052,"The influence of coronal tooth tissue in the diagnosis of apical pathosis.AIM: To assess the influence of the status of the <e>crown</e> of the tooth on the observers' periapical radiological assessment. METHODOLOGY: Seven clinical tutors, eight postgraduate students and seven undergraduate students were recruited. Each evaluated 24 periapical radiographs comprising 12 radiographs with teeth restored with small to medium coronal restorations and 12 radiographs displaying teeth which were either heavily restored or exhibited gross caries. Two viewing sessions, separated by several weeks, were undertaken using ideal viewing conditions. In the first viewing teeth were examined in their entirety and in the second the coronal aspects of the teeth were obscured. RESULTS: An analysis of variance found no significant differences between the groups of observers during the first viewing. When the crowns were masked, undergraduate students had a significantly lower sensitivity (P = 0.008) compared with postgraduates and clinical tutors. Paired t-tests found a significant increase in the sensitivity of the postgraduate students between the first and second viewing (P = 0.037). Mean sensitivity and specificity for the undergraduates decreased from 0.67 to 0.63 and 0.64 to 0.60 for the first and second viewing, respectively, whilst mean sensitivity for postgraduates and clinical tutors increased from 0.59 to 0.79 and 0.69 to 0.80, respectively. Specificity increased from 0.72 to 0.78 for the postgraduates between viewings, whilst the tutors recorded 0.80 for each viewing. CONCLUSION: The status of coronal tooth tissue had a major impact on the diagnostic accuracy of the observers with limited radiological experience supporting the need for earlier radiological training within the undergraduate curriculum.",M1
19466248,"Effect of an additional hydrophilic versus hydrophobic coat on the quality of dentinal sealing provided by two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the quality of the dentinal sealing provided by two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives cannot be altered by the addition of an extra layer of the respective adhesive or the application of a more hydrophobic, non-solvated resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: full-<e>crown</e> preparations were acid-etched with phosphoric acid for 15 s and bonded with Adper Single Bond (3M ESPE), Excite DSC (Ivoclar/Vivadent) or Prime &amp; Bond NT (Dentsply). The adhesives were used according to the manufacturers' instructions (control groups) or after application to dentin they were a) covered with an extra coat of each respective system or b) coated with a non-solvated bonding agent (Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Adhesive, 3M ESPE). Fluid flow rate was measured before and after dentin surfaces were acid-etched and bonded with adhesives. RESULTS: None of the adhesives or experimental treatments was capable to block completely the fluid transudation across the treated dentin. Application of an extra coat of the adhesive did not reduce the fluid flow rate of adhesive-bonded dentin (p&gt;0.05). Conversely, the application of a more hydrophobic non-solvated resin resulted in significant reductions in the fluid flow rate (p&lt;0.05) for all tested adhesives. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the dentinal sealing provided by etch-and-rinse adhesives can be significantly improved by the application of a more hydrophobic, non-solvated bonding agent.",M1
19455930,"Decoronation as an approach to treat ankylosis in growing children.There is no greater treatment challenge for the dental practitioner than the scenario resulting when an immature permanent anterior tooth in a young and growing child becomes ankylosed following traumatic injury. In such cases the clinician has few good treatment options because there is no known therapy to reverse ankylosis. At the some time, without treatment the ankylosed tooth poses both developmental and esthetic problems because it will not erupt further nor will it allow the alveolar bone to grow and develop and follow the eruption of adjacent teeth. This review article will present the most commonly recommended treatment options for this clinical challenge. Of the possible options, a decoronation procedure offers one of the best and most predictable clinical outcomes. This procedure involves the removal of the <e>crown</e> of on ankylosed tooth, leaving the root in its alveolar socket in situ. It has been shown that performing this procedure at the appropriate time allows for the facio-palatal width of the alveolus to be maintained for years, while allowing additional vertical growth of the alveolus. The long-term goal of this procedure is allow for the placement of an implant after growth completion in such a manner that the esthetic outcome is maximized, while allowing for an implant placement procedure that is both easier and more predictable.",M1

19455928,"Essentials of rebonding tooth fragments for the best functional and esthetic outcomes.<e>Crown</e> and crown-root fractures of anterior teeth of children are common. Bonding of the crown fragment is a logical restorative treatment option when the trauma results in no or minimal violation of the biological width and when the crown fragment: (1) is retrieved following the trauma; (2) is relatively intact; and (3) adopts well to the remaining tooth. Reattachment of crown tooth fragments can provide favorable and long-lasting esthetics because the tooth's original anatomic form, color, and surface texture are maintained. Reattachment also restores function, provides a positive psychological response, and is a relatively simple procedure. The clinician, however, should clearly inform the patient about the limitations and prognosis of this treatment option. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge about crown fragment reattachment and present recommendations for the best functional and esthetic outcomes. The rebonding technique is illustrated in detail with a clinical case report.",M1

Several variables can affect the longevity of this type of restoration including: the overall prognosis of the injured tooth, whether the pulp is exposed, the extent of the crown fracture, the restoration's size, the patient's age and occlusion, and future reinjury of the restored tooth. Contemporary adhesives and composites allow clinicians to restore fractured permanent incisors with good predictability, restoring both the esthetics and function of the affected tooth. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current state of the restoration of permanent incisors with crown fractures using composite resins.",M1
19447839,"Systematic evaluation of the features influencing the accuracy of third order measurements.The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship of third order measurements on dental casts with those on lateral radiographs, and to identify those incisor features on radiographs which can best explain third order measurements on dental casts. Lateral cephalograms and corresponding dental casts were obtained from 39 untreated Caucasians (12 males, 27 females; mean age 19.5 years; standard deviation 3.7 years) with occlusal relationships considered to be 'normal'. The upper (U1) and lower (L1) incisors were assessed with reference to the occlusal plane perpendicular which was established on the lateral radiographs, including third order angles (U1TR, L1TR) which were also derived from direct dental cast measurements (U1TA, L1TA). Both single regression and multiple linear regression analysis with stepwise variable selection were performed using third order measurements on casts as the dependent variable and <e>crown</e> axis (U1C, L1C), root axis (U1R, L1R), tip-apex connecting line (U1E, L1E), and radiographic third order measurements as independent variables. Single regression analysis indicated an overall difference of 0.02 degrees between radiographic third order inclination and cast assessment in the maxilla (mandible: -2.83 degrees). A change of 1 degree in radiographic third order inclination would produce a change of 0.65 degrees for U1TA and 0.86 degrees for L1TA assessments. Third order measurements on dental casts can best be explained by a linear combination of U1TR and U1E (maxilla) and of L1TR and L1C (mandible) measurements. This study demonstrates the functional enmeshment between two different third order assessments and the most common incisor features on lateral radiographs. Both methods of third order evaluation show sufficient reliability and are appropriate for routine orthodontic practice.",M1
19446209,"A preferable technique for protecting the inferior alveolar nerve: coronectomy.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of coronectomy for teeth whose root apices are very close to the inferior alveolar canal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 43 patients of this study needed removal of their lower third molar, whose root apices were very close to the inferior alveolar canal. These patients underwent 47 coronectomies. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 9.3 months (range, 1 to 48 months). The mean total amount of root movement was 3.4 mm at 6 months, 3.8 mm at 12 months, and 4.0 mm at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of coronectomy is defined as removing the <e>crown</e> of a tooth but leaving the roots untouched, so that the possibility of nerve damage is reduced. Coronectomy is a preferable technique for patients who run a risk of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve during third molar surgery.",M1
19442488,"Anterior segmental distraction of the hypoplastic maxilla by a tooth borne device: a study on the movement of the segment.The aim of this study is to determine the relative movement of the teeth and bone after premaxillary distraction with a tooth-borne device constructed in the authors' centre. To evaluate the effects of this device on the anterior segment and teeth, the space formed between the anterior and posterior segments of the maxilla was measured on computerized tomography images from 10 patients. The average differences were 3.5mm at the apex level, 5.5 mm at alveolar ridge level and 7.4 mm at <e>crown</e> level on the right side. On the left side, the average differences were 3.2, 5.2 and 7.1 mm, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between all these measurements (p&lt;0.05), but the difference between right and left sides was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). The ratio between the movements at apex and crown levels was 46%. These results showed that the tooth-borne distractor was able to distract the anterior segment of the maxilla but it also caused anchorage loss of the maxillary incisors.",M1
19438761,"Evolution of M1 <e>crown</e> size and cusp proportions in the genus Homo.Previous research into tooth crown dimensions and cusp proportions has proved to be a useful way to identify taxonomic differences in Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil hominins. The present study has identified changes in both M(1) crown size and cusp proportions within the genus Homo, with M(1) overall crown size reduction apparently occurring in two main stages. The first stage (a reduction of ca. 17%) is associated with the emergence of Homo ergaster and Homo erectus sensu stricto. The second stage (a reduction of ca. 10%) occurs in Homo sapiens, but the reduced modern human M(1) tooth crown size was only attained in Upper Paleolithic times. The absolute sizes of the individual cusps are highly positively correlated with overall crown size and dental reduction produces a reduction in the absolute size of each of the cusps. Most of the individual cusps scale isometrically with crown size, but the paracone shows a negative allometric relationship, indicating that the reduction in paracone size is less than in the other M(1) cusps. Thus, the phylogenetically oldest cusp in the upper molars also seems to be the most stable cusp (at least in the M(1)). The most striking change in M(1) cusp proportions is a change in the relative size of the areas of the paracone and metacone. The combination of a small relative paracone and a large relative metacone generally characterizes specimens attributed to early Homo, and the presence of this character state in Australopithecus and Paranthropus suggests it may represent the primitive condition for the later part of the hominin clade. In contrast, nearly all later Homo taxa, with the exception of Homo antecessor, show the opposite condition (i.e. a relatively large paracone and a relatively small metacone). This change in the relationship between the relative sizes of the paracone and metacone is related to an isometric reduction of the absolute size of the metacone. This metacone reduction occurs in the context of relative stability in the paracone as crown size decreases. Among later Homo taxa, both Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis show a further reduction of the metacone and an enlargement of the hypocone. Fossil and contemporary H. sapiens samples show a trend toward increasing the relative size of the protocone and decreasing the relative size of the hypocone. In Europe, modern human M(1) cusp proportions are essentially reached during the Upper Paleolithic. Although some variation was documented among the fossil taxa, we suggest that the relative size of the M(1) paracone and metacone areas may be useful for differentiating the earliest members of our genus from subsequent Homo species.",M1

19425091,"Technical note: Occlusal fingerprint analysis: quantification of tooth wear pattern.Information about food ingestion and mastication behavior during the lifespan of an individual is encoded in the dental occlusal wear pattern. To decode this information, we describe a new method called occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA). Structural parameters of wear facets on the occlusal surface of teeth are quantified from digitized casts for the interpretation of occlusal aspects. The OFA provides an individual three-dimensional dental occlusal compass that indicates the major pathways of interaction between antagonists, revealing information about development, spatial position, and enlargement of wear facets. Humans develop a very similar overall pattern of <e>crown</e> contacts, although specific characteristics of wear facets reflect an individual's occlusal relationships and masticatory behavior. We hypothesize that the wear pattern is a unique character and therefore valuable for individual identification. Furthermore we suggest that OFA, when further developed, may be useful for identification of behavioral, biological, and chemical factors affecting crown morphology.",M1
19419451,"Conventional wisdom and the surgical exposure of impacted teeth.OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence against the notion that direct contact between the <e>crown</e> of an impacted tooth and alveolar bone is an impediment to orthodontically assisted eruption of teeth. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The Department of Orthodontics at the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, in Jerusalem, Israel, and the private practices of the authors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients reported were those affected by impacted teeth, including individuals who were normal healthy patients, with and without resorption of the adjacent incisor roots, as well as individuals suffering from Cleidocranial dysplasia and increased bone density, and individuals with autogenous and synthetic bone grafts. A closed eruption surgical technique was used in which only a small window was opened into the dental follicle of the impacted tooth, leaving a maximum amount of bone covering much of the crown surface. Orthodontic extrusion forces were then applied. RESULTS: For all teeth, enamel-to-bone contact did not prevent a rapid response to the extrusive forces. CONCLUSION: Radical removal of bone during the exposure of an impacted tooth is unnecessary and potentially may be harmful in terms of the periodontal prognosis of an otherwise successfully treated outcome.",M1
19419444,"The gingival biotype revisited: transparency of the periodontal probe through the gingival margin as a method to discriminate thin from thick gingiva.AIM: To detect groups of subjects in a sample of 100 periodontally healthy volunteers with different combinations of morphometric data related to central maxillary incisors and surrounding soft tissues. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four clinical parameters were included in a cluster analysis: <e>crown</e> width/crown length ratio (CW/CL), gingival width (GW), papilla height (PH) and gingival thickness (GT). The latter was based on the transparency of the periodontal probe through the gingival margin while probing the buccal sulcus. Every first volunteer out of 10 was re-examined to evaluate intra-examiner repeatability for all variables. RESULTS: High agreement between duplicate recordings was found for all parameters, in particular for GT, pointing to 85% (kappa=0.70; p=0.002). The partitioning method identified three clusters with specific features. Cluster A1 (nine males, 28 females) displayed a slender tooth form (CW/CL=0.79), a GW of 4.92 mm, a PH of 4.29 mm and a thin gingiva (probe visible on one or both incisors in 100% of the subjects). Cluster A2 (29 males, five females) presented similar features (CW/CL=0.77; GW=5.2 mm; PH=4.54 mm), except for GT. These subjects showed a clear thick gingiva (probe concealed on both incisors in 97% of the subjects). The third group (cluster B: 12 males, 17 females) differed substantially from the other clusters in many parameters. These subjects showed a more quadratic tooth form (CW/CL=0.88), a broad zone of keratinized tissue (GW=5.84 mm), low papillae (PH=2.84 mm) and a thick gingiva (probe concealed on both incisors in 83% of the subjects). CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis, using a simple and reproducible method for GT assessment, confirmed the existence of gingival biotypes. A clear thin gingiva was found in about one-third of the sample in mainly female subjects with slender teeth, a narrow zone of keratinized tissue and a highly scalloped gingival margin corresponding to the features of the previously introduced  thin-scalloped biotype  (cluster A1). A clear thick gingiva was found in about two-thirds of the sample in mainly male subjects. About half of them showed quadratic teeth, a broad zone of keratinized tissue and a flat gingival margin corresponding to the features of the previously introduced  thick-flat biotype  (cluster B). The other half could not be classified as such. These subjects showed a clear thick gingiva with slender teeth, a narrow zone of keratinized tissue and a high gingival scallop (cluster A2).",M1
19413390,"Influence of radiographic position of ectopic canines on the duration of orthodontic treatment.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of radiographic position of palatally impacted canines on the length of treatment for orthodontic alignment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment records of 45 consecutive successfully treated patients (36 unilateral, 9 bilateral) with ectopic palatal canines treated with surgical exposure and orthodontic traction were analyzed. The sample was based on orthodontic referrals over a 3-year period in Kent and Canterbury Hospital, UK. The duration of treatment was related to radiographic parameters including the height of the impacted canine, angulation of the long axis to the upper midline, mesiodistal position of the canine tip relative to the midline and adjacent incisors, and the anteroposterior position of the canine root apex. RESULTS: Using multiple stepwise regression analysis, the horizontal position of the canine <e>crown</e> relative to adjacent teeth and maxillary dental midline showed a statistically significant correlation with the duration of treatment (P =.042), explaining 7.7% of the overall variance. However, treatment duration was found to be independent of the initial canine angulation (P = .915), vertical height (P =.065), and position of the canine apex (P = .937). CONCLUSIONS: Accurate prediction of treatment duration for orthodontic alignment of palatally impacted maxillary canines is difficult. However, the mesiodistal position of the canine may be a useful predictor of treatment duration.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised n(total) = 130 whites with either Angle Class II division 2 (n(1) = 62; group A) or neutral (n(2) = 68; control group B) occlusal relationships. Upper central incisor inclination (U1) was assessed with reference to the cephalometric lines NA and palatal plane (U1NA/deg, U1PP/deg). Craniofacial sagittal and vertical relations were classified using angles SNA, SNB, ANB, and NSL-PP. Third-order angles were derived from corresponding dental cast pairs using an incisor inclination gauge. Welch's two-sample t-tests (alpha-level: .05) were used to test the null hypothesis. Single linear regression was applied to determine third-order angle values as a function of axial inclination values (U1NA, U1PP) or sagittal craniofacial structures (ANB angle), separately for group A and B. RESULTS: The discrepancy between axial inclination (U1NA, U1PP) and third-order angles is significantly different (P &lt; .001) between groups A and B. Regression analysis revealed a simply moderate correlation between third-order measurements and axial inclinations or sagittal craniofacial structures. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis is rejected. The results of this study warn against the use of identical third-order angles irrespective of diminished CRAs typical for Angle Class II division 2 subjects. Routine CRA assessment may be considered in orthodontic treatment planning of Angle Class II division 2 cases.",M1
19410083,"Determination of matrix metalloproteinases in human radicular dentin.Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are present in sound coronal dentin and may play a role in collagen network degradation in bonded restorations. We investigated whether these enzymes can also be detected in root dentin. <e>Crown</e> and root sections of human teeth were powderized, and dentin proteins were extracted by using guanidine-HCl and EDTA. Extracts were analyzed by zymography and Western blotting for matrix metalloproteinases detection. Zymography revealed gelatinolytic activities in both crown and root dentin samples, corresponding to MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMP-2 was more evident in demineralized root dentin matrix, whereas MMP-9 was mostly extracted from the mineralized compartment of dentin and presented overall lower levels. Western blot analysis detected MMP-8 equally distributed in crown and root dentin. Because MMPs are also present in radicular dentin, their contribution to the degradation of resin-dentin bonds should be addressed in the development of restorative strategies for the root substrate.",M1
19410081,"Isolation and characterization of human dental pulp stem/stromal cells from nonextracted <e>crown</e>-fractured teeth requiring root canal therapy.INTRODUCTION: Human dental pulp stem/stromal cells (hDPSCs) in adults are primarily derived from the pulp tissues of permanent third molar teeth in existing literatures, whereas no reports exist, to our knowledge, on deriving hDPSCs from a tooth without the need for surgical procedure. The aim of this study was to raise a novel idea to source hDPSCs from complicated crown-fractured teeth requiring root canal therapy. METHODS: hDPSCs were harvested from the pulp tissues for two complicated crown-fractured teeth requiring root canal therapy, retaining the teeth for subsequent prosthodontic rehabilitation, in a 41-year-old woman who had suffered a motorcycle accident. Pulp tissue from the left lower deciduous canine of a healthy 10-year-old boy (the positive control) was also removed because of high mobility and cultured for hDPSCs. RESULTS: The hDPSCs derived from the two complicated crown-fractured teeth and the deciduous tooth were able to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages and also expressed stem cells markers and differentiation markers, which indicated their stem cell origin and differentiation capability. In addition, hDPSCs from both the complicated crown-fractured teeth and the deciduous tooth showed high expression for bone marrow stem cell markers including CD29, CD90, and CD105 and exhibited very low expression of markers specific for hematopoietic cells such as CD14, CD34, and CD45. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the successful isolation and characterization of hDPSCs from the pulp tissue of complicated crown-fractured teeth without tooth extraction. Therefore, pulp exposed in complicated crown-fractured teeth might represent a valuable source of personal hDPSCs.",M1
19368601,"Gingival zenith positions and levels of the maxillary anterior dentition.PURPOSE: The location of the gingival zenith in a medial-lateral position relative to the vertical tooth axis of the maxillary anterior teeth remains to be clearly defined. In addition, the apex of the free gingival margin of the lateral incisor teeth relative to the gingival zeniths of the adjacent proximal teeth remains undetermined. Therefore, this investigation evaluated two clinical parameters: (1) the gingival zenith position (GZP) from the vertical bisected midline (VBM) along the long axis of each individual maxillary anterior tooth; and (2) the gingival zenith level (GZL) of the lateral incisors in an apical-coronal direction relative to the gingival line joining the tangents of the GZP of the adjacent central incisor and canine teeth under healthy conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 240 sites in 20 healthy patients (13 females, 7 males) with an average age of 27.7 years were evaluated. The inclusion patient criteria were absence of periodontal disease, gingival recession, or gingival hypertrophy as well as teeth without loss of interdental papillae, spacing, crowding, existing restorations, and incisal attrition. GZP dimensions were measured with calibrated digital calipers for each individual tooth and within each tooth group in a medial-lateral direction from the VBM. GZLs were measured in an apical-coronal direction from a tangent line drawn on the diagnostic casts from the GZPs of the adjacent teeth. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that all central incisors displayed a distal GZP from the VBM, with a mean average of 1 mm. Lateral incisors showed a deviation of the gingival zenith by a mean of 0.4 mm. In 97.5% of the canine population, the GZP was centralized along the long axis of the canine. The mean distance of the contour of the gingival margin in an apical-coronal direction of the lateral incisors (GZL) relative to gingival line joining the tangent of the adjacent central and canine GZPs was approximately 1 mm. CONCLUSION: This investigation revealed a GZP mean value of 1 mm distal from the VBM for the central incisor tooth group. The lateral incisors showed a mean average of 0.4 mm. The canine tooth group demonstrated almost no deviations of the GZP from the VBM. The GZL of the lateral incisors relative to the adjacent central incisor and canine teeth were more coronal by approximately 1 mm. These data could be used as reference points during esthetic anterior oral rehabilitation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The information presented in this article can be clinically applied to reestablish the proper intratooth GZPs of the maxillary anterior teeth during periodontal <e>crown</e> lengthening or root coverage procedures. In addition, the intra-arch gingival level of the lateral incisor gingival zenith relative to the adjacent central and canine teeth can be appropriately established.",M1
19368599,"The apparent contact dimension and covariates among orthodontically treated and nontreated subjects.The apparent contact dimension (ACD), a determinant of dental esthetics, has been purported to exhibit an esthetic relationship termed the  50:40:30  rule, implying that in an esthetic smile, the ACD between the central incisors, central and lateral incisors, and lateral incisor and canine would be 50, 40, and 30% of the height of a central incisor, respectively. This study assessed the existence of this proportion using casts of orthodontically treated (N = 40) and nontreated (N = 27) subjects deemed to possess excellent occlusion. Covariates studied included tooth size, tooth shape, tip, and torque. The average ACD proportions in this study, relative to the height of an ipsilateral central incisor, were found to be 49, 38, and 27% between the central incisors, central and lateral incisors, and the lateral incisor and canine, respectively. The ACD exhibited a positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05) with the height of the clinical <e>crown</e> and a negative correlation (p &lt; 0.05) with the width/height ratios of the corresponding teeth. No statistically significant correlations were evident between the ACD with the shape of the clinical crown, tip, and torque. However, the tip and torque did exhibit a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation with the height of the clinical crown. This study is the first to validate the existence and proportions of the ACD. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study validates the existence of the ACD and quantifies the relationship of the ACD with tooth size, tooth shape, mesiodistal crown angulation (tip), and labiolingual crown inclination (torque) among subjects deemed to possess excellent occlusion and alignment. This quantifiable  ideal  and its correlation with the other determinants of dental esthetics may be used in conjunction with various evidence-based paradigms in the esthetic appraisal of the maxillary anterior teeth.",M1
19356322,"Hypoplasia of a permanent incisor produced by primary incisor intrusion: a case report.Orofacial trauma is a serious orodental and general health problem that may have medical, esthetic and psychological consequences for children and their parents. When the root of the primary tooth is close to the unerupted permanent tooth, primary tooth trauma may result in developmental disturbances and pulpal reaction in that permanent tooth. We report an unusual case in which injury to the primary dentition resulted in developmental disturbances in the <e>crown</e> and the calcified structures in the pulp chamber of the permanent tooth. Localized malformation of the crown and enamel hypoplasia were treated with a light-cured composite resin restoration. We also discuss the formation of pulp calcification and the need for endodontic treatment.",M1
19350641,"Sex differences in anthropoid mandibular canine lateral enamel formation.Previous research has demonstrated that great ape and macaque males achieve large canine <e>crown</e> sizes primarily through extended canine growth periods. Recent work has suggested, however, that platyrrhine males may achieve larger canine sizes by accelerating rather than prolonging growth. This study tested the hypothesis that the ontogenetic pathway leading to canine sexual dimorphism in catarrhines differs from that of platyrrhines. To test this hypothesis, males and females of several catarrhine genera (Hylobates, Papio, Macaca, Cercopithecus, and Cercocebus) and three platyrrhine genera (Cebus, Ateles, and Callicebus) were compared in the number and spacing of perikymata (enamel growth increments) on their canine crowns. In addition, perikymata periodicities (the number of days of growth perikymata represent) were determined for five genera (Hylobates, Papio, Macaca, Cebus, and Ateles) using previously published as well as original data gathered for this study. The central findings are as follows: 1) males have more perikymata than females for seven of eight genera (in five of the seven, the differences are statistically significant); 2) in general, the greater the degree of sexual dimorphism, the greater the sex difference in male and female perikymata numbers; 3) there is no evidence of a systematic sex difference in primate periodicities; and 4) there is some evidence that sex differences in enamel formation rates may make a minor contribution to canine sexual dimorphism in Papio and Cercopithecus. These findings strongly suggest that in both catarrhines and platyrrhines prolongation of male canine growth is the primary mechanism by which canine crown sexual dimorphism is achieved.",M1
19336856,"Evaluation of Moyers mixed dentition analysis in school children.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to test the reliability of Moyers mixed dentition analysis in school children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was conducted on a sample of 150 school children within the age group of 13 to 16 years old who had all permanent teeth that were fully erupted. Dental impressions were taken with alginate impression material and immediately poured with dental stone. Mesiodistal dimensions of permanent mandibular incisors, maxillary and mandibular canines, and premolars were measured using a digital caliper with a resolution of 0.01 mm. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The coefficient of correlation (r) was calculated to find the correlation between the sums of the canine, premolars in both arches, and mandibular incisors. A Student's unpaired t test was calculated to compare the tooth dimension between male and female subjects. The actual measurements were compared with the predicted values obtained with the Moyers prediction tables at the 35 th , 50 th , and 75 th percentile confidence levels. A Student's t test was calculated to compare the actual and predicted values. Using this data, linear regression equations were formulated for tooth size prediction. The coefficient of determination [r2] was calculated to find the accuracy of the formulated prediction equations. The standard error of estimate (SEE) was calculated to determine the validity of the proposed equations. RESULTS: Moyers prediction tables are not an accurate method to estimate tooth dimension in our samples. The mesiodistal <e>crown</e> dimension in the buccal segment of the mandibular arch was larger in males (p=0.04) than in females. CONCLUSION: The differences noted between predicted values from the Moyers tables and that of the present investigation is the result of racial and ethnic diversity. The accuracy of the prediction equation should be tested in a larger sample.",M1
19320719,"The location and characteristics of two populations of dental pulp cells affect tooth development.This study investigated the characteristics of two dental pulp cell populations during the early stages of <e>crown</e> formation in porcine teeth. A transplantation method was developed to reproduce epithelial cell-mesenchymal cell interactions during odontogenesis (tooth development). The technique allowed two types of cells/tissue to be combined in vivo. Populations of cells localized in the cervical loop epithelium region, dental pulp horn, and dental pulp core chambers were isolated and dissociated into single cells. Each population was examined for its gene-expression pattern using both semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, and for its tissue-formation capability by combining the cervical loop epithelial cells with either pulp horn cells or pulp core cells on biodegradable collagen scaffolds that were subsequently examined using histology and immunohistology. Gene-expression patterns showed that pulp horn cells were more mature than pulp core cells. Cervical loop epithelial cells combined with pulp horn cells mainly reconstituted dentin-cementum structures. By contrast, cervical loop epithelial cells combined with pulp core cells reconstituted enamel-dentin structures. These results suggest that mesenchymal cells residing in a specific location of the pulp possess a specific tissue-formation potential when combined with epithelial cells.",M1
19305246,"<e>Crown</e> morphologic abnormalities in the permanent dentition of patients with cleft lip and palate.The purpose of this study was to investigate crown morphologic abnormalities in the permanent dentition of subjects with clefts and unaffected controls. This is a prospective study of 100 patients and 60 control subjects. The study was carried out at the Cleft Lip and Palate Center at the King Abdullah University Hospital and at the Maxillofacial Unit at Jordan University of Science and Technology during the period November 2003 to September 2005. Eleven kinds of crown morphology abnormalities commonly described in the permanent dentition were recorded using the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System. There were 1525 teeth examined in 100 subjects with clefts, and 203 crown morphologic abnormalities were recorded, resulting in a mean of 2 abnormalities per individual. No significant difference between the unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate groups was found; however, the difference between the cleft group and the control group was highly significant. Crown morphologic abnormalities were more frequent in the maxillary cleft teeth than in the mandibular teeth and in the anterior teeth than in posterior teeth, with a statistically significant difference. The most frequently found abnormalities in subjects with clefts were peg-shaped maxillary incisors and missing hypocone, followed by excess mammelons. In conclusion, there was a significant increase in the frequency of crown morphologic abnormalities in individuals with clefts when compared with subjects without clefts. Crown morphologic abnormalities occurred throughout the entire dentition and did not follow any predictable pattern.",M1
19290894,"Effects on permanent teeth after luxation injuries to the primary predecessors: a study in children assisted at an emergency service.AIM: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the developmental disturbances in permanent teeth as a result of luxation injuries in the primary teeth predecessors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 5330 records, corresponding to 10 years attendance at the Emergency Center of Baby Clinic, Londrina State University, Brazil, were analyzed. Three hundred and eighty nine children were involved in this study, totaling 620 traumatized primary teeth. Clinical and radiographic examinations were carried out in the permanent successor teeth. RESULTS: In total, 623 permanent teeth were examined and developmental disturbances were detected in 126 teeth (20.2%). The white or yellow-brown discoloration of enamel was the clinical disturbance most observed (78.0%) and the <e>crown</e> alteration most detected through radiographic analysis was hypoplasia (86.0%). Root alterations were rare; root dilaceration was observed in only one case. The age of the children when their primary teeth received damage varied between 6 and 36 months (P = 0.000325). Intrusive luxation and avulsion were related with most of the cases of sequelae in the successor permanent teeth (P = 0.000001). CONCLUSION: The results of the present investigation emphasize the special attention required for children who suffered dental trauma at an early age, especially in cases of intrusive luxation and avulsion.",M1
19268829,"Torque control of the maxillary incisors in lingual and labial orthodontics: a 3-dimensional finite element analysis.INTRODUCTION: Lingual orthodontics has developed rapidly in recent years; however, research on torque control variance of the maxillary incisors in both lingual and labial orthodontics is still limited, especially studies with 3-dimensional finite element methods. Thorough understanding of the biomechanical differences of incisor torque control during lingual and labial orthodontic treatment is critical for the best results. METHODS: A 3-dimensional finite element model of the maxilla and the maxillary incisors was made with 98,106 nodes, 71,944 10-node solid elements, and 5236 triangle shell units. Horizontal retraction force, vertical intrusive force, and lingual root torque were applied to simulate labial and lingual orthodontic treatment. Then the distribution of the stress-strain (maximum and minimum principal stresses; maximum and minimum principal strains) in the periodontal ligament, the total displacement, and the vector graph of displacement of the nodes of the maxillary central incisor were analyzed and compared between labial and lingual orthodontics. RESULTS: Loads of the same magnitude produced translation of the maxillary incisor in labial orthodontics but lingual <e>crown</e> tipping of the same tooth in lingual orthodontics. This suggests that loss of torque control of the maxillary incisors during retraction in extraction patients is more likely in lingual orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lingual orthodontics should not simply follow the clinical experience of the labial techniques but should increase lingual root torque, increase vertical intrusive force, and decrease horizontal retraction force properly to achieve the best orthodontic results.",M1
19251244,"Spacing in deciduous dentition of Polish children in relation to tooth size and dental arch dimensions.AIM: To assess the prevalence of primary and secondary spacing in the deciduous dentition and its correlation to tooth widths and dental arch dimensions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Dental casts of 50 preschool children free from malocclusion, were analysed. The width of each space was measured as the smallest distance between the proximal surfaces of the neighbouring teeth, parallel to the occlusal plane. <e>Crown</e> width was measured as the greatest distance between the mesial and distal surfaces of the crown, parallel to the occlusal plane. Intercanine widths were measured between cusp tips of upper and lower canines. Intermolar widths were measured between the central fossae of the second molars. Arch lengths were measured from the midpoint between the central incisors to the midpoint between the distal surfaces of the deciduous second molars. RESULTS: The primary spaces were present in the upper dental arch in 90% children, on the average 2.09 mm in maxilla and 1.25 mm in mandible. Their widths were dependent on upper intercanine width. Secondary spacing was present in 92% children in the upper dental arch (mean 2.86 mm) and 90% in the lower (mean 3.08 mm). Lower secondary spacing was correlated to lower intercanine width and lower arch length. Total absence of interdental spacing was found in 4% children. CONCLUSIONS: Interdental spacing of the deciduous dentition is present in 96% of Polish children. Children with wider intercanine widths have wider primary spaces in maxilla and wider secondary spaces in mandible.",M1
19239482,"Double 'pink tooth' associated with extensive internal root resorption after orthodontic treatment: a case report.Advanced internal resorption affecting the <e>crown</e> of teeth may result in the appearance of a 'pink tooth', which, when located in the root canal, can perforate the external root surface. Therapeutically, this condition represents a clinical challenge and normally requires a combined endodontic and surgical focus. Presented herein are cases of double 'pink tooth' which appeared at different times after orthodontic treatment. In the most severe case, upon radiographic examination and computed tomography, the maxillary right central incisor presented an internal resorption, extending from the pulp chamber to the root middle third. After pulp removal, the debridement of the defect was performed using a 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution, a #80 Kerr file, and an ultrasonic tip ST-17, aided by a surgical microscope. During the cleaning process, various sites of periodontal communication were identified. Upon controlling the hemorrhaging, the root canal was completely filled with White mineral trioxide aggregate. Within the 3-month follow-up treatment, a pink spot appeared on the maxillary left central incisor, which received conventional root canal therapy. Clinically and radiographically, over 18 months of follow up, both cases responded favorably to the proposed treatments. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient due to the fact that pulp and periodontal sequelae can develop at varied moments after orthodontic treatment. Furthermore, with the current technology and biomaterials, it is possible to resolve cases with extensive internal perforating resorption through endodontic treatment.",M1
19208014,"Dental injuries resulting from tracheal intubation--a retrospective study.Even though it is known that dental injuries may occur in connection with tracheal intubation, the topic has hardly been evaluated in literature so far. Thus, this retrospective study was conducted including the data of 115-151 patients. All patients involved had been exposed to general anesthesia between 1995 and 2005. The resulting tooth injuries were assessed according to the following parameters: age, kind of hospital conducting treatment, intubation difficulties, pre-existing tooth damage, type and localization of tooth, type of tooth damage, and the number of teeth injured. At least 170 teeth were injured in 130 patients, while patients 50 years of age and older were especially affected. In contrast to older patients where in the majority of cases the periodontium (lateral dislocation) was injured, in younger patients dental hard tissue (<e>crown</e> fracture) was more likely to be affected. It was calculated that patients from the cardiothoracic surgery clinic were showing the highest risk of tooth damage. In more than three-fourth of all cases the anterior teeth of the maxilla, especially the maxillary central incisors, were affected. Pre-existing dental pathology like caries, marginal periodontitis and tooth restorations were often distinguishable prior to operation. Mouthguards in connection with tracheal intubation are not generally recommended as preventive device, due to the already limited amount of space available. Instead, pre-existing risk factors should be thoroughly explored before the induction of intubation narcosis.",M1

19201557,"Age estimation based on three-dimensional measurement of mandibular central incisors in Japanese.The purpose of this study was to investigate an age estimation method that considers gender as well as three-dimensional measurement of the components, specifically enamel and dentin. A total of 155 mandibular central incisors aged 12-79 years old which was chosen from the collection stored at the Department of Anatomy in Tokyo Dental College and had no opened apex, caries or restorative treatment, were examined. Samples were scanned using micro-CT HMX225 ACTIS4. Based on the sliced image data, three-dimensional structures were obtained and the volumes of enamel, dentin, and pulp cavity were measured. Regression equations for age estimation were then determined. The accuracy of age estimation equations for each region, volume ratio, and sex was assessed using the determination coefficient R(2) as well as the standard errors of estimated values. The root region alone had a comparable accuracy to that of the whole tooth and the <e>crown</e> region had a relatively lower accuracy. In the whole tooth and the crown region, slightly higher correlations were observed for pulp/tooth volume ratios in which enamel was excluded. Females tended to have higher accuracy compared to males. The estimated age was higher in males compared to females for the same volume ratio of the pulp cavity. The highest correlation in both genders with age was observed for the volume ratio of the pulp cavity to the whole tooth excluding the enamel (males, R(2)=0.67; females, R(2)=0.76). The 95% confidence intervals for the population regression showed different distributions for each sex. In the 95% prediction intervals for age estimation, females tended to have narrower intervals and higher accuracy compared to males. Therefore, the use of gender-specific equations is recommended for age estimation.",M1

However, data on the long-term impact of these bonding procedures on the periodontium are scarce. A case report of a young female patient presenting with an isogingivally- and horizontally-fractured lower incisor with a two-year follow-up is presented. METHODS: The tooth fragment was reattached to the remaining root using an adhesive technique after flap elevation and endodontic therapy. No attempt was made to splint the coronal fragment to the neighboring teeth. RESULTS: Despite the subgingival location of the bonding surface, uneventful periodontal healing was clinically monitored during the observation period. The coronal fragment was retained successfully for a period of more than two years.

19172314,"Dimensional changes of periodontal soft tissues after intrasulcular incision.In maxillofacial surgery, intrasulcular incisions are often used. This prospective case series was established to evaluate the detrimental effects of intrasulcular incisions on periodontal structures. In 35 patients, measurements of probing depth and <e>crown</e> length before and 10 months postoperatively were performed to calculate changes of attachment level and gingival recession. In a subgroup, surgically treated sites were compared with untreated control sites. A nonparametric test was applied for longitudinal and split-mouth comparisons. Overall, intrasulcular incisions did not induce significant attachment loss. The frequency of sites losing &gt; or = 2 mm of attachment was 5.0%, 2.6%, and 4.7% at mesial, buccal, and distal sites, respectively. Intrasulcular incisions caused only a slight increase in gingival recession by 0.4 +/- 0.5, 0.2 +/- 0.3, and 0.3 +/- 0.4 mm at mesial, buccal, and distal sites, respectively. Within the limitations of the study design, it can be concluded that intrasulcular incisions without additional vertical incisions do not impose a serious risk for attachment loss and/or gingival recession.",M1

19144325,"Variability and patterning in permanent tooth size of four human ethnic groups.AIMS: Dental dimensions vary between different ethnic groups, providing insights into the factors controlling human dental development. This paper compares permanent mesiodistal <e>crown</e> diameters between four ethnic groups highlighting patterns of tooth size between these groups and considers the findings in relation to genetic and environmental influences. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mesiodistal crown dimensions were recorded using standardised manual measurements on dental casts derived from four different human populations: Southern Chinese, North Americans of European ancestry, Modern British of European ancestry and Romano-British. Analyses based on double determinations showed that measurements in all study samples were reliable to an accuracy of 0.1mm. The Southern Chinese sample was found to have the largest teeth overall, whereas the Romano-British sample generally displayed the smallest mesiodistal crown dimensions (p&lt;0.001). However, the Modern British sample had the largest maxillary central incisors, mandibular central and lateral incisors, and mandibular canines, while the North American sample had the largest maxillary first and second molars. Comparisons of coefficients of variation for teeth within each class showed that the later-forming teeth displayed greater variation in mesiodistal size than the earlier-forming teeth. CONCLUSION: The different patterns of tooth size observed between the study samples are thought to reflect differences in the relative contributions of genetic, and environmental influences to dental development between the four populations. For example, it is proposed that major environmental insults during the early life of Romano-Britons, including recurrent illnesses, poor nutrition and excessive lead ingestion, contributed to the reduction in size and greater variability of their later-forming teeth. Using a standardised methodology, significant differences in mesiodistal crown diameters have been demonstrated between four human ethnic groups. There were also distinct differences in the patterns of crown size between the groups, with the later-forming teeth in each type generally showing greater size variation.",M1
19138637,"Uncomplicated <e>crown</e> fracture, complicated crown-root fracture, and horizontal root fracture simultaneously treated in a patient during emergency visit: a case report.Complicated crown fractures are not uncommon in cases of severe trauma or sports related injury. Such patients report with pain because of exposed pulp and need emergency care. Because of impaired function, esthetics, and phonetics, such patients are quite apprehensive during their emergency visit. Successful pain management with immediate restoration of function, esthetics, and phonetics should be the prime objective when handling such cases. This article describes immediate treatment of oblique crown root fracture of maxillary left central incisor, horizontal root fracture of maxillary left lateral incisor, and uncomplicated crown fracture of maxillary right central incisor. Maxillary left central incisor was treated with reattachment procedure using light-transmitting fiber post (D.T. Light Post; Bisco, Schaumburg, IL, USA); maxillary left lateral incisor subsequently healed after splinting for 7 weeks, and direct composite build-up was done on maxillary right central incisor. After 2 years, the reattached fragment had satisfying esthetics and excellent function and pulp was still vital in maxillary left lateral incisor and maxillary right central incisor. Various treatment modalities for traumatically injured incisors are shown in this article.",M1
19132735,"<e>Crown</e> formation during tooth development and tissue engineering.Considering tooth crown engineering, three main parameters have to be taken into account: (1) the relationship between crown morphology and tooth functionality, (2) the growth of the organ, which is hardly compatible with the use of preformed scaffolds, and (3) the need for easily available nondental competent cell sources. In vitro reassociation experiments using either dental tissues or bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) have been designed to get information about the mechanisms to be preserved in order to allow crown engineering. As the primary enamel knot (PEK) is involved in signaling crown morphogenesis, the formation and fate of this structure was investigated (1) in heterotopic reassociations between embryonic day 14 (ED14) incisor and molar enamel organs and mesenchymes, and (2) in reassociations between ED14 molar enamel organs and BMDC. A PEK formed in cultured heterotopic dental tissue reassociations. The mesenchyme controls the fate of the EK cells, incisor or molar-specific using apoptosis as criterion, and functionality to drive single/multiple cusps tooth development. Although previous investigations showed that they might differentiate as odontoblast- or ameloblast-like cells, BMDC reassociated to an enamel organ could not support the development of multicusp teeth. These cells apparently could neither maintain nor stimulate the formation of a PEK.",M1
19121957,"Traumatic intrusion of primary teeth and its effects on the permanent successors: a clinical follow-up study.OBJECTIVE: Owing to the anatomic proximity between the root of the primary tooth and its permanent successor, trauma to primary dentition may cause developmental disturbances in unerupted permanent teeth. STUDY DESIGN: This report presents the findings of a prospective 7-year study examining developmental disturbances of permanent teeth attributed to intrusive injury of their primary predecessors based on initial patient records and clinical observation. Intrusive injuries were diagnosed and grouped according to World Health Organization classifications, as modified by Andreasen et al. RESULTS: A total of 78 children (aged 12-48 months) presenting with intrusive trauma to 138 primary incisors were available for follow-up examinations. The most frequently intruded primary teeth were maxillary incisors (93.47%), with the right central primary incisor representing 41.3% of all intruded teeth. In 23 patients, 36 teeth were scheduled for extraction during the first visit. During the course of follow-up, 41 of the remaining teeth exhibited post-traumatic consequences, including pulp necrosis (78.0%), internal and/or external root resorption (14.6%), ankylosis (4.9%), and obliteration of the pulp canal (2.5%). In 74 permanent successors (53.6%), &gt;or=1 of the following developmental disturbances were observed: enamel hypoplasia (28.3%), <e>crown</e> and/or root deformation (16.7%), and ectopic eruption (16.7%).

19121498,"Experimental determination of optimal force system required for control of anterior tooth movement in sliding mechanics.INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to determine the optimum vertical height of the retraction force on the power arm that is required for efficient anterior tooth retraction during space closure with sliding mechanics. METHODS: Three adults (1 man, 2 women) with Angle Class II Division 1 malocclusions were selected for this study. In each subject, the maxillary right central incisor was the target tooth. Initial tooth displacements of that tooth with sliding mechanics with various heights of retraction forces were measured in vivo by a 2-point 3-dimensional displacement magnetic sensor device. The tooth's motion trajectories on the midsagittal plane were studied. RESULTS: The location of the center of rotation of the target tooth varied according to the different heights of the retraction forces. Controlled anterior tooth movement (ie, lingual-<e>crown</e> tipping, lingual-root movement) can be predicted, simulated, or even manipulated by different heights of retraction forces on the power arm in the sliding mechanics force system. A power arm length of 3 to 5 mm is estimated to produce controlled lingual-crown tipping (with the apex as the center of rotation) for efficient anterior tooth retraction during sliding space closure in adults with Angle Class II Division 1 malocclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing and applying the correct height of retraction force on the power arm is the key to efficient anterior tooth retraction.",M1
19121497,"How well does Invisalign work? A prospective clinical study evaluating the efficacy of tooth movement with Invisalign.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of tooth movement with removable polyurethane aligners (Invisalign, Align Technology, Santa Clara, Calif). METHODS: The study sample included 37 patients treated with Anterior Invisalign. Four hundred one anterior teeth (198 maxillary and 203 mandibular) were measured on the virtual Treat models. The virtual model of the predicted tooth position was superimposed over the virtual model of the achieved tooth position, created from the posttreatment impression, and the 2 models were superimposed over their stationary posterior teeth by using ToothMeasure, Invisalign's proprietary superimposition software. The amount of tooth movement predicted was compared with the amount achieved after treatment. The types of movements studied were expansion, constriction, intrusion, extrusion, mesiodistal tip, labiolingual tip, and rotation. RESULTS: The mean accuracy of tooth movement with Invisalign was 41%. The most accurate movement was lingual constriction (47.1%), and the least accurate movement was extrusion (29.6%)- specifically, extrusion of the maxillary (18.3%) and mandibular (24.5%) central incisors, followed by mesiodistal tipping of the mandibular canines (26.9%). The accuracy of canine rotation was significantly lower than that of all other teeth, with the exception of the maxillary lateral incisors. At rotational movements greater than 15 degrees, the accuracy of rotation for the maxillary canines fell significantly. Lingual <e>crown</e> tip was significantly more accurate than labial crown tip, particularly for the maxillary incisors. There was no statistical difference in accuracy between maxillary and mandibular teeth of the same tooth type for any movements studied. CONCLUSIONS: We still have much to learn regarding the biomechanics and efficacy of the Invisalign system. A better understanding of Invisalign's ability to move teeth might help the clinician select suitable patients for treatment, guide the proper sequencing of movement, and reduce the need for case refinement.",M1
20589260,"Development, in vitro testing, and clinical use of a 3.5 mm-diameter zirconia abutment.The use of small-diameter implants is indicated when small missing teeth have to be replaced, especially in esthetic zones. Nevertheless, the small diameter can pose a limiting factor with respect to what materials can be used for the final <e>crown</e>. In most cases, full-ceramic crowns in combination with a ceramic abutment are usually the material of choice for final reconstructions. To date, based on mechanical considerations, a 3.5 mm implant diameter has been a contraindication for using ceramic abutments. The authors describe here the development, in vitro testing, and clinical use of a zirconium abutment with a 3.5 mm diameter. The advantages of this small-diameter zirconia abutment include a minimum platform height that offers optimal prosthetic flexibility, and an accurate transfer of the implant position on to the master model. Furthermore, a precise rotational orientation for single-tooth restorations, optimal mechanical stability, and optimal fatigue resistance can be achieved. The microgap is minimized and protection against overload is afforded. In the reported case, high patient satisfaction was achieved due also to an esthetically pleasing final result.",M2

A 10-year clinical and radiographic retrospective study.SOURCE OF SUPPORT: The study was partially supported by Nobel Biocare, Denmark. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None. AIM: To evaluate the treatment outcome of implant-supported single-tooth replacements performed by dental students as part of their undergraduate dental curriculum after a mean follow-up period of 10 years (range: 7.5 to 12 years). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 patients were consecutively treated by dental students with 55 implants supporting single <e>crowns</e>. The treatment was performed under supervision of dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons, all with special knowledge about oral implantology. Survival of implant crown, survival of implant, probing depth, bleeding on probing and peri-implant marginal bone level change were evaluated at the end of the follow-up period. In addition, biological and technical complications during the entire follow-up period were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with 49 implants were available at the end of the study. The survival of the implant crowns as well as the implants was 94%. The mean probing depth at patient level was 4.8 mm. The probing depth varied between 2 and 10 mm at the individual site. The mean bleeding on probing score was 0.57 at patient level and absence of bleeding around all sites of the implants was rarely observed. The mean bone level change was -0.14 mm (range: 1.2 to -1.1 mm) during the first year of loading and 0.16 mm (range: 1.4 to -1.8) after 10 years at patient level. Five episodes of peri-implant inflammation due to excess cement were registered in five patients. Moreover, a fistula was observed at two implants in two patients. Finally, five technical complications occurred in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Implant-supported single-tooth replacements performed by dental students as part of their undergraduate dental curriculum were characterised by high survival rates as well as few biological and technical complications. It seems acceptable to include implant therapy in the clinical undergraduate dental curriculum, provided a focus remains on straightforward cases with substantial supervision by trained dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons.",M2
20441044,"Ridge expansion and immediate implant placement in the esthetic zone.Implant placement and tooth restoration in the maxillary esthetic zone is challenging. In the case reported here, the treatment site was tooth # 8, which had been extracted one year previously. Available bone in three dimensions was evaluated by computerized tomography. The bucco-lingual bone width at the crest was 3 mm to 4 mm wide, an inadequate width for implant placement. Ridge expansion was accomplished with hand osteotomes, followed by tapered drills. A 4.3 x 13 mm Nobel Biocare implant was placed. Following osseointegration, a PFM <e>crown</e>, supported by an esthetic abutment, was placed. A very pleasing esthetic result was achieved.",M2
20437729,"The occlusal precision of laboratory versus CAD/CAM processed all-ceramic <e>crowns</e>.PURPOSE: The null hypothesis was tested: There is no difference between two all-ceramic crown systems, the Cerec method (CHAIR) and the IPS Empress method (LAB), with respect to occlusal precision and time expenditure for the dentist. METHODS: 20 casts representing clinical situations were mounted in semi-adjustable articulators to serve as simulation models. The left lower first molars were prepared to receive feldspathic ceramic crowns. The minimum number of three (Min3) occlusal contacts and their desired location was defined on each crown before preparation. Two crowns were produced on each die: (CHAIR) was applied in order to simulate a chair-side treatment and [LAB] was applied to simulate the laboratory/clinical mode of production. Additionally the time required to perform the occlusal adjustment was measured. For occlusal analysis, the (Min3) were divided by the contacts that were  actually achieved  (ACT). Mean quotients for (LAB) and (CHAIR) were calculated (n = 20 each). The Wilcoxon signed rank test at P &lt; or = 0.05 was applied to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: The mean quotients MEAN QU (Min3)/(ACT) of 0.87 for (CHAIR) and 0.94 for (LAB) and the time expenditure for simulating intraoral occlusal adjustment of 3.44 minutes for (CHAIR) and 3.79 minutes for (LAB) did not differ significantly.",M2

20416410,"The influence of incisal veneering porcelain thickness of two metal ceramic <e>crown</e> systems on failure resistance after cyclic loading.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: In some clinical situations, the length of either a prepared tooth or an implant abutment is shorter than ideal, and the occlusal clearance to be restored by a porcelain crown is large. Incisal thickness of the coping and the veneering porcelain should be considered to prevent mechanical failure of the crown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of incisal veneering porcelain thickness of metal ceramic systems on failure resistance after cyclic loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With a standardized technique, 60 metal ceramic anterior crowns with 2 different incisal thicknesses of porcelain veneer (2.0 and 4.0 mm) and 2 different metal alloys (Pisces Plus (B), base metal, and Leo (N), high noble metal) were fabricated to fit a custom abutment and divided into 4 groups (B20, B40, N20, N40) (n=15). The crowns were then cemented using resin cement (PANAVIA 21) and thermal cycled and mechanically cycle loaded (49-N load) for 2,000,000 cycles. The specimens were evaluated for cracks and/or bulk fracture with an optical stereomicroscope (x10) and assigned a score of success, survival, or failure. The specimens without bulk fracture after cyclic loading were loaded along the long axis of the tooth, on the incisal edge, in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.5 mm/min until fracture. The fracture strength value (N) was recorded. The exact logistic regression and Fisher's exact test were used to study the effect of different alloys and porcelain incisal thicknesses on the success and survival rates after cycle loading. The forces at failure (fracture) of different groups were compared using the rank transform-based nonparametric 2-way ANOVA (alpha=.05). RESULTS: According to exact logistic regression, crowns of the high noble alloy group showed significantly higher success rates (P=.002) than those of the base metal group after cyclic loading. The success rate of the crowns with 2 mm of incisal veneering porcelain was significantly higher (P&lt;.001) than that of the crowns with 4 mm of incisal veneering porcelain. For crowns with a 4-mm incisal thickness, N40 showed a significantly higher success rate than B40 (P=.04, Fisher's exact test). As for survival rate, the exact logistic regression indicated that neither metal type (P=.11) nor thickness (P=.60) had a significant effect. The 2-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of thickness (P=.001) and no significant effect of metal type (P=.08) on the failure load. CONCLUSIONS: The high noble metal ceramic crowns demonstrated a significantly higher success rate after cyclic loading than the base metal ceramic crowns. Crowns with a porcelain incisal thickness of 2 mm showed, for both metal ceramic systems, a greater success rate than those with a 4-mm incisal thickness.",M2

20415253,"[Photoelastic stress analysis of root dentin with different composite resin post and core systems and <e>crowns</e>]Much research has been reported about post and core systems with composite resin, but the influence of the different types of prefabricated posts on the distribution of stress in the root has not yet been elucidated. It is necessary to clarify the influence of the relationship between core and crown materials to obtain combined restorations. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the combination of various post and core systems and different kinds of crown material on the stress distribution in the root. Six 2-dimensional photoelastic premolar models were designed. Three types of post and core systems (composite resin post and core, composite resin core with the fiber post, and composite resin core with a prefabricated stainless steel post) and two kinds of crown materials (metal and hybrid-type hard composite resin) were fabricated and cemented to each model. In these models, we applied a load of 200 N at an angle of 45 degrees to the tooth axis and analyzed the fringe order using a transmission polariscope. As a result, it has been clarified that the combination of the post and core and the crown plays an important role in preventing stress concentration within root Stress concentration can be prevented using a crown fabricated with a high-elastic modulus for the post and core with a high-elastic modulus, and a crown fabricated with a low-elastic modulus for the post and core with a low-elastic modulus.",M2
20369101,"Prospective clinical evaluation of 307 single-tooth morse taper-connection implants: a multicenter study.PURPOSE: This prospective clinical study evaluated the incidence of abutment loosening of Morse taper-connection implants used for single-tooth replacement. In addition, the cumulative survival rate and the implant/<e>crown</e> success were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Implants were evaluated 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after insertion. The incidence of abutment loosening, modified Plaque Index, modified Sulcus Bleeding Index, probing depth, distance from the implant-crown margin to the coronal border of the peri-implant mucosa, width of keratinized mucosa, and the distance between implant shoulder and first bone-implant contact (DIB) were assessed. The cumulative survival rates were calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Implant/crown success criteria included absence of abutment loosening, absence of suppuration and mobility, probing depth &lt; 5.0 mm, and DIB &lt; 1.5 mm after 12 months and not exceeding 0.2 mm for each following year. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period (2003-2007; mean follow-up per implant: 30.79 months), 307 implants (162 maxillary, 145 mandibular) were inserted in 295 patients (125 men and 170 women aged between 24 and 79 years) at six different clinical centers. The sites included anterior (n = 115) and posterior (n = 192) teeth. At the end of the study, a very low percentage of implant-abutment loosening (0.66%) was found, with only two loosened abutments. The cumulative implant survival rate was 98.4%. Mean DIB was 1.14 mm (48 months). Only four surviving implants did not meet the criteria for success, and the implant/crown success rate was 97.07%. CONCLUSION: Based upon this study of 307 implants observed during a 4-year period, Morse taper-connection implants represent a good solution for single-tooth restorations, with a very low incidence of abutment loosening (0.66%).",M2
20369094,"Immediate implant placement and restoration in the esthetic zone: a prospective study with 18 months of follow-up.PURPOSE: This clinical study aimed to assess the dimensional stability of peri-implant soft tissues around immediately placed and restored implants in the maxillary esthetic zone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve systemically healthy patients presenting with a hopeless maxillary central incisor were selected. Provisional restorations were delivered immediately after tooth extraction and implant placement. Periimplant soft tissue dimensions were measured either by direct clinical examination or evaluation of study casts. Measurements were performed before extraction; immediately after implant and restoration placement; and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months postoperatively. The distances assessed were: tip of the mesial papilla to the mesioincisal edge of the adjacent central incisor, tip of the distal papilla to the mesioincisal edge of the adjacent lateral incisor, and the length of the clinical <e>crown</e> of the definitive restoration. RESULTS: All patients completed the study, and no implants failed within the 18-month follow-up period (100% survival rate). No statistical differences were observed in the distances between the incisal edge of the adjacent teeth and the mesial and distal papilla tips (P = .303 and .099, respectively) at any follow-up appointment. Likewise, there were no alterations in the definitive clinical crown dimensions during the follow-up period (P = .406). CONCLUSION: The findings of this 18-month prospective study indicate that, within the selection criteria and technique presented in this study, immediate implants with immediate restorations can be a predictable option for the replacement of teeth in the esthetic zone, providing stability to the peri-implant soft tissue.",M2
20369087,"Biomechanical effect of platform switching in implant dentistry: a three-dimensional finite element analysis.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the implant-bone interface stresses in anisotropic three-dimensional finite element models of an osseointegrated implant with platform switching and a conventional matching-diameter implant platform and abutment in the posterior maxilla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional finite element models were created of a first molar section of the maxilla and embedded with a single endosseous implant (4.1 3 10 mm). One model simulated a 4.1-mm-diameter abutment connection and the other was a narrower 3.4-mm-diameter abutment connection, ie, simulating a platform-switching configuration. A gold alloy <e>crown</e> with 2-mm occlusal thickness was applied over the titanium abutment. Material properties of compact and cancellous bone were modeled as fully orthotropic and transversely isotropic, respectively. Oblique (200-N vertical and 40-N horizontal) occlusal loads were applied and perfect bonding was assumed at all interfaces. RESULTS: Maximum von Mises, compressive, and tensile stresses in compact bone were lower in the platform-switching model than in the conventional model. However, the maximum von Mises stress in cancellous bone was higher in the platform-switching model than in the conventional model. CONCLUSION: The platform-switching technique reduced the stress concentration in the area of compact bone and shifted it to the area of cancellous bone during oblique loading.",M2
20362766,"Accuracy of the newly formulated vinyl siloxanether elastomeric impression material.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A newly formulated vinyl siloxanether elastomeric impression material is available, but there is little knowledge of its accuracy in relation to existing materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the accuracy of disinfected vinyl siloxanether impressions and compare the accuracy to a common vinyl polysiloxane and a polyether impression system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Impressions were made from a modified dentoform master model containing a simulated <e>crown</e> preparation. Dimensional changes (mm) between the master model and working casts (type IV gypsum) were assessed. The following were evaluated: vinyl polysiloxane in a 1-step, dual-viscosity technique (VPS Dual), polyether as monophase material (PE Mono), and vinyl siloxanether in a 1-step, dual-viscosity (VSE Dual), and monophase technique (VSE Mono). Measurements of the master model and working casts, including anteroposterior (AP) and cross-arch (XA) dimensions, were made with a measuring microscope. The simulated crown preparation was measured in mesiodistal (MDG, MDO), buccolingual (BLG, BLO), and occlusogingival dimensions (OGL, OGB). Disinfection involved immersion for 10 minutes in potassium peroxomonosulfate, sodium benzoate, tartaric acid solution, or no disinfection (control) (n=8). A multivariate GLM statistical approach (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data (alpha=.05). Pearson's correlation test was used for related dimensions. RESULTS: The AP and XA dimensions of working casts were larger than the master for the disinfected condition and control. Whether disinfected or not, the working dies were shorter in height (OGB, OGL), larger in the buccolingual dimension (BLO, BLG), somewhat larger in the MDO dimension, and somewhat smaller in the MDG dimension compared to the prepared tooth of the master model, resulting in an irregular or oval profile. There were significant differences among the impression systems for each dimension except AP. Differences between the disinfected and nondisinfected conditions were significant (P=.03) with respect to dimensions of the gypsum working cast, but not for dimensions of the working die (P=.97). In general, differences relative to the master were small and of minor clinical significance considering marginal gaps of crowns smaller than 150-100 mum are considered clinically acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: VSE monophase impressions and VSE dual-viscosity impressions demonstrated acceptable accuracy for clinical use with immersion disinfection, since the results for VSE were comparable to the results for PE and VPS materials, and the differences as compared to the master model were small.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The database SCOPUS was searched for clinical studies involving full-coverage crowns made of IPS Empress. To assess the fracture rate of the crowns in relation to the type of restored tooth and study, Poisson regression analysis was used. RESULTS: Seven clinical studies were identified involving 1,487 adhesively luted crowns (mean observation time: 4.5+/-1.7 years) and 81 crowns cemented with zinc-phosphate cement (mean observation time: 1.6+/-0.8 years). Fifty-seven of the adhesively luted crowns fractured (3.8%). The majority of fractures (62%) occurred between the third and sixth year after placement. There was no significant influence regarding the test center on fracture rate, but the restored tooth type played a significant role. The hazard rate (per year) for crowns was estimated to be 5 in every 1,000 crowns for incisors, 7 in every 1,000 crowns for premolars, 12 in every 1,000 crowns for canines, and 16 in every 1,000 crowns for molars. One molar crown in the zinc-phosphate group fractured after 1.2 years. CONCLUSION: Adhesively luted IPS Empress crowns showed a low fracture rate for incisors and premolars and a somewhat higher rate for molars and canines. The sample size of the conventionally luted crowns was too small and the observation period too short to draw meaningful conclusions.",M2
20234889,"The correlation between <e>crown</e>-implant ratios and marginal bone resorption: a preliminary clinical study.Purpose: The crown-implant ratio is defined as the physical relationship between each individual restoration's parts located both inside and outside the bone. This relationship represents the physical concept of a type I lever, which may be of biomechanical importance in implant treatment outcomes. Materials and Methods: Specific patient data related to fixed implant prostheses were retrieved and studied in an effort to clinically and radiographically correlate crown-implant ratios. Results: Recorded marginal bone resorption around implants (2.11 +/- 1.30 mm) at the end of a defined observation period did not correlate with the measured crown-implant ratio, which yielded values between 0.43 and 1.5 mm (P &gt; .05). Conclusion: The mechanical determinants of implant success or failure are still not defined. It has been postulated that an increase in both crown-tooth, and comparably crown-implant, ratios would lead to a resultant increase in the magnitude of nonaxial forces transmitted to the tooth or implant. This could then lead to an increased vulnerability of either tooth or implant abutments to supporting bone loss. However, additional factors appear to impact long-term bone maintenance behavior around either type of abutment. Within the limited scope of this study, crown-implant ratios were not associated with recorded peri-implant bone loss. Int J Prosthodont 2010;23:33-37.",M2
20228989,"Porcelain fused to metal <e>crown</e> as an abutment of a metal-ceramic resin-bonded fixed partial denture: a clinical report.AIM: This clinical report describes a conventional resin-based fixed partial denture for a 42-year-old woman to close an edentulous space in the region of the second maxillary premolar. While the first maxillary molar had been crowned with porcelain fused to metal (PFM) system 10 years ago and the first premolar was intact and sound except for a small carious lesion in the distal aspect. The essential clinical and laboratory procedures are illustrated. BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical studies document excellent long-term success of resin-bonded fixed partial dentures. In the 1970s, the Rochette resin-bonded fixed partial denture (RBFPD) was introduced. Next, to enhance retention and resistance form of posterior RBFPD preparation of parallel guide surfaces on the interproximal aspects of the adjacent teeth along with rests on the occlusal aspects to counteract dislodging forces was recommended. REPORT: A 42-year-old woman presented with an extracted left maxillary second premolar. The first maxillary molar had been crowned 10 years ago and the first premolar had a small carious lesion in the mid distal of proximal aspect. To eliminate unnecessary cutting of the PFM of the first molar and crown preparation of the first maxillary premolar, the use of RBFPD was suggested and accepted by the patient. SUMMARY: This clinical report described the indication, the selection of a PFM-crowned abutment, and clinical procedures involved in the fabrication of RBFPD that provided a conservative solution for replacement of one posterior tooth. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: RBFPDs can be used successfully in both the anterior and the posterior regions of the mouth to replace one or two missing teeth. However, the survival rate of RBFPDs is still considerably less than that of conventional fixed partial dentures. The principal reason for failure is debonding of the framework from the abutment tooth. The selection of nonmobile abutment teeth, the preparation design that enhances retention and resistance form, and the tooth bonding technique are critical for success.",M2

20213020,"Simplified technique for rebuilding a post and core foundation with a preexisting <e>crown</e>: a case report.A 58-year-old patient presented with a dislodged crown and post and core on the maxillary right first premolar. After endodontic retreatment, two tapered glass-fiber posts were adhesively cemented. The core foundation was completed by retrofitting the existing crown with a self-curing composite core material. The intaglio surface was lubricated with petroleum jelly, which allowed for easy removal of the crown. Adequate cement thickness was ensured by the finishing procedures of the core buildup that respected the existing tooth margins. The glass-fiber posts and composite buildup provided adequate stability and retention to the original casting. The technique described in this short clinical report enables clinicians to rebuild a post-and-core foundation using the existing crown without the original die or its replica in a simple and time-saving way.",M2
20209197,"Sensory discrimination of teeth and implant-supported restorations.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine patient responses to load application on natural teeth and implants using a visual analog scale (VAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects were selected from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey patient pool who had a single implant-supported <e>crown</e> restoration adjacent to a natural tooth. Vibrational loads of 0.2 N, 0.4 N, and 0.6 N were applied to the tooth and implant-supported crown. The VAS was used to measure the magnitude of sensation. Patient responses were recorded in sets of five alternating paired trials and analyzed for differences in the responses to teeth and implant-supported crowns. RESULTS: Patients were able to discriminate between loads to implants and natural teeth 100% of the time (P = or &lt; .01). The responses to loading of the implant were less strong than those to loading of the natural tooth 100% of the time (P = or &lt; .01). However, the VAS score ratios between implant and natural tooth consistently increased with an increase in load. CONCLUSION: Although periodontal ligament receptors are lacking in the peri-implant area, patients appear to have some proprioceptive awareness of implant loading. This awareness becomes more similar to that of natural teeth as the vibrational load is increased.",M2

The study was performed on 38 <e>crown</e> and bridge abutments in 17 patients. Preparation parameters were recorded, as well as working-times, setting-times, and other handling characteristics. Baseline data were also recorded for gingival inflammation (GI) and pre-cementation sensitivity. Post-cementation parameters included sensitivity, gingival tissue reactions, marginal integrity and discolorations. All patients were seen for recall examinations at 30 days, and 6 months. For sixteen patients one-year recall data were collected on retention and subjective sensitivity. Fifteen subjects were available for one year clinical examinations. Three independent examiners found the working and setting time of the cement to be well within expected limits and that cement removal was easy. Four patients reported low-grades of immediate post-cementation sensitivity, however, this disappeared after an occlusal adjustment or without intervention within one month. At 12 months no retentive failures were recorded and no subjective sensitivity reported. All crowns were rated in the  Excellent  quality category for marginal integrity. Both GI-scores and scores for tooth sensitivity decreased during the course of the study. One year recall data yielded no incidence of secondary caries and no visible marginal discoloration.

20158529,"Tooth survival following non-surgical root canal treatment: a systematic review of the literature.AIMS: To investigate (i) the effect of study characteristics on reported tooth survival after root canal treatment (RCTx) and (ii) the effect of clinical factors on the proportion of root filled teeth surviving after RCTx. METHODOLOGY: Longitudinal human clinical studies investigating tooth survival after RCTx which were published up to the end of 2007 were identified electronically (MEDLINE and Cochrane database 1966-2007 December, week 4). In addition, four journals (Dental Traumatology, International Endodontic Journal, Journal of Endodontics, Oral Surgery Oral Medicine Oral Pathology Oral Radiology &amp; Endodontics), bibliographies of all relevant articles and review articles were hand searched. Two reviewers (Y-LN, KG) assessed and selected the studies based on specified inclusion criteria and extracted the data onto a pre-designed proforma, independently. The criteria were as follows: (i) clinical study on RCTx; (ii) stratified analysis of primary and secondary RCTx available; (iii) sample size given and larger than 10; (iv) at least 6-month postoperative review; (v) success based on survival of tooth; and (vi) proportion of teeth surviving after treatment given or could be calculated from the raw data. Three strands of evidence or analyses were used to triangulate a consensus view. The reported findings from individual studies, including those excluded for quantitative analysis, were utilized for the intuitive synthesis, which constituted the first strand of evidence. Secondly, the pooled weighted proportion of teeth surviving and thirdly the combined effects of potential prognostic factors were estimated using the fixed and random effects meta-analyses on studies fulfilling all the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 31 articles identified, 14 studies published between 1993 and 2007 were included. The majority of studies were retrospective (n = 10) and only four prospective. The pooled percentages of reported tooth survival over 2-3, 4-5 and 8-10 years following RCTx were 86% (95% CI: 75%, 98%), 93% (95% CI: 92%, 94%) and 87% (95% CI: 82%, 92%), respectively. Substantial differences in study characteristics were found to hinder effective direct comparison of findings. Evidence for the effect of prognostic factors on tooth survival was weak. Based on the data available for meta-analyses, four conditions were found to significantly improve tooth survival. In descending order of influence, the conditions increasing observed proportion of survival were as follows: (i) a <e>crown</e> restoration after RCTx; (ii) tooth having both mesial and distal proximal contacts; (iii) tooth not functioning as an abutment for removable or fixed prosthesis; and (iv) tooth type or specifically non-molar teeth. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in some cases but its source could not be investigated because of insufficient available information. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled proportion of teeth surviving over 2-10 years following RCTx ranged between 86% and 93%. Four factors (listed above) were identified as significant prognostic factors with concurrence between all three strands of evidence.",M2

20156270,"Finite element and Weibull analyses to estimate failure risks in the ceramic endocrown and classical <e>crown</e> for endodontically treated maxillary premolar.The present study evaluated the failure risks of an endodontically treated premolar with severely damaged coronal hard tissue and restored with either a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic endocrown or a classical crown configuration. Two, three-dimensional finite element maxillary premolar models were designed with endodontic treatment and restored with either a chairside economic reconstruction of esthetic ceramic (CEREC) ceramic endocrown or a classical crown. The Weibull function was incorporated with finite element analysis to calculate the long-term failure probability relative to different load conditions. Additionally, an in vitro fatigue-load fracture experiment was performed to validate the numerical simulation results. The results indicated that the stress values on the dentin and luting cement for the endocrown restoration were lower than those for the crown configuration. Weibull analysis revealed that the individual failure probability in the endocrown dentin and luting cement diminished more than those for the crown restoration. While the overall failure probabilities for the endocrown and the classical crown were similar, fatigue fracture testing revealed that the endocrown restoration had higher fracture resistance than the classical crown configuration (1,446 vs. 1,163 MPa). This investigation implies that the endocrown can be considered as a conservative, aesthetic, and clinically feasible restorative approach for endodontically treated maxillary premolars.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy intact, extracted human maxillary central incisors were randomized and assigned to 7 groups (n = 10). The teeth in group 1 remained intact (control). The teeth in groups 2 to 6 were prepared and IPS Empress restorations were conditioned and bonded using an adhesive luting cement, Variolink II/Syntac (group 2: labial veneer with incisal overlap, group 3: 3/4 veneer with margin in enamel, group 4: 3/4 veneer with margin in dentin, group 5: crown with margin in enamel, group 6: crown with margin in dentin group 7: veneer on worn tooth. After finishing and polishing, specimens were stored in water and thermocycled for 2000 cycles between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C. The maximal fracture load of the specimens (40-degree inclination) was determined using the universal testing machine (Zwick) at a constant crosshead speed (0.5 mm/min). The statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction (p &lt; 0.05). Fracture surfaces were qualitatively analyzed by SEM. RESULTS: All restored teeth with cervical preparation margins in enamel showed a fracture load not significantly different from the intact teeth (control). Restored teeth with cervical preparation margins in dentin showed a significantly lower fracture load. All restorations showed a fracture load far above 400 N, serving as functional reference for anterior teeth. The failures were predominantly cohesive. CONCLUSION: For the restoration of tooth strength, defining the finishing lines of veneers and crowns in enamel is recommended. Restorations with finishing lines in dentin resulted in significant loss of strength. Three-quarter veneers with finishing lines in enamel are functionally equal to crowns with the advantage of conserving tooth structure.",M2
20147820,"Success rate of immediate implants placed and restored by novice operators.AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the 1-year crestal bone loss and success rate of an immediately placed single-stage implant placed and restored by novice operators. A secondary aim was to determine the patient's assessment of the appearance of the final restoration. METHODS: Fifty-one patients received a tooth extraction and placement of at least 1 immediate implant by a Graduate Periodontics resident. Clinical and radiographic measurements were taken at the surgical, 4-month, and 1-year follow-up visits. After at least 3 months healing, dental students restored the implants with either a <e>crown</e> or an overdenture. Patient satisfaction was assessed using 5 categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. RESULTS: Sixty-two immediate implants were placed. The success rate was 100% at the 12-month visit and was subclassified as grade 3 because of the mean first year bone loss of 1.3 +/- 1.0 mm. Using the 2008 classification of Misch et al, 42 implants were classified as success optimum health, 19 as survival satisfactory health, and 1 as survival compromised health. Radiographic bone loss was stratified by implant platform position relative to the alveolar crest and changed from time 0 to time 12 by -1.0 +/- 1.2 mm for the supracrestal group (n = 25, P &lt; 0.05), -1.5 +/- 0.9 mm for the crestal group (n = 31, P &lt; 0.05), and -1.3 +/- 1.2 mm for the subcrestal group (n = 6, P &lt; 0.05). The supracrestal group had significantly less bone loss than either the crestal or the subcrestal group (P &lt; 0.05). The appearance of the final restoration at 1 year was rated excellent by 82% of patients, very good by 16%, and good by 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate implant placement by novice operators using routine dental school procedures was a highly predictable procedure as indicated by the 100% success rate at 12 months. Most patients rated the restoration appearance as excellent.",M2
20141812,"Three-year clinical evaluation of two ceramic <e>crown</e> systems: a preliminary study.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The clinical performance and failure mechanisms of recently introduced ceramic crown systems used to restore posterior teeth have not been adequately examined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate and compare the clinical performance of 2 new ceramic crown systems with that of metal ceramic crowns using modified United States Public Health Services (USPHS) criteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety posterior teeth requiring crown restorations in 48 patients were randomized into 3 equal groups (n=30) for which different crown systems were used: an experimental hot-pressed glass ceramic based on a modified lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press), an alumina-coping-based ceramic (Procera AllCeram), and a metal ceramic (Simidur S 2 veneered with IPS Classic Porcelain). The crowns were assessed over 3 years using the modified USPHS criteria. Crowns that developed visible cracks were sectioned and removed, and the surfaces were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric statistical test, followed by the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (alpha=.05). RESULTS: USPHS evaluation showed that the IPS e.max Press and metal ceramic crowns experienced fewer clinical changes than Procera AllCeram. Visible roughness, wear, and deformity were noticed in occlusal contact areas of Procera AllCeram crowns. SEM images showed well defined wear facets in both ceramic crown systems. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed a significant difference (P&lt;.05) in Alpha scores among the 3 crown systems. Mann-Whitney tests showed significant differences among groups. CONCLUSIONS: IPS e.max Press crowns demonstrated clinical behavior comparable to Procera AllCeram and metal ceramic crowns, but the wear resistance of this crown type was superior to the Procera AllCeram crowns, according to modified USPHS criteria.",M2
20141811,"Survey of United States dental schools on cementation protocols for implant <e>crown</e> restorations.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: With conflicting results in the literature and various manufacturer recommendations, it is not known what cementation protocols are currently being used for implant restorations in US dental schools. PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey was to determine what dental cementation protocols are taught and recommended by 62 US dental schools and postgraduate programs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From February to September 2008, 96 questionnaires consisting of 8 questions were sent to the chairperson or director of restorative departments, advanced prosthodontics programs, and implant programs. The questionnaire asked recipients which implant manufacturers provided the products used at their dental schools. Additionally, recipients were queried as to the choice of material and techniques for abutment and restoration preparations prior to definitive cementation. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 68 (71%) surveys were returned, and 52 (84%) of the 62 predoctoral and postgraduate programs were represented. After deleting duplicate responses, 31 surveys were returned from restorative department chairpersons, 29 from advanced prosthodontic program directors, and 2 from implant program directors. Frequency of responses to each question was tabulated, and results are presented in 3 sections. For all 3 types of programs, Nobel Biocare was reported to be the most widely used implant system, followed by Biomet 3i, Straumann, Astra Tech, and Zimmer Dental systems. The most commonly used technique prior to definitive cementation is to airborne-particle abrade the intaglio surface of the restoration. Resin-modified glass ionomer is the most frequently used luting agent for cementing implant restorations. The 5 most commonly used materials to fill screw access openings are cotton pellets, composite resin, rubber-based material, gutta-percha, and light-polymerized provisional composite resin. Most predoctoral and postgraduate programs teach students to fill the screw access opening completely to the occlusal surface. CONCLUSIONS: There are a wide range of implant cementation protocols and materials used; however, some common trends were identified among predoctoral and postgraduate programs.",M2
20137372,"Influence of galvano-ceramic and metal-ceramic <e>crowns</e> on magnetic resonance imaging.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is prone to be deformed by artifacts caused by the presence of metallic materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the artifacts from galvano-ceramic and metal-ceramic crowns in MRI, in order to analyze their influences on diagnostic interpretation of MRI. METHODS: Galvano-ceramic and metal-ceramic crowns (Bio98, Wiron99, SP-78, BioKC97) were fabricated with the same model. All materials were imaged by means of 1.5T MRI apparatus with three different sequences, T1-weighted spin-echo (T1-weighted SE), T2-weighted spin-echo (T2-weighted SE) and Gradient echo (GE). Mean and standard deviation of distilled water signal intensity (SI) around the sample in the region of interest (500 mm2) enclosing the whole artifacts were determined, and compared for evaluation of the homogeneity of signal intensity. Images around the sample were acquired and evaluated. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the values of signal intensity between acrylic resin control and BioKC97, Wiron99 in the three sequences (P&lt;0.001). The mean values of signal intensity for Bio98, SP-78 were significantly different from that of acrylic resin control (RE) in GE sequence (P&lt;0.001). No difference was showed between acrylic resin control and galvano-ceramic crown (P&gt;0.05). Images showed that the greatest artifact was a 25 mm ring with distortion in Wiron99 in GE sequence. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro study suggested that galvano-ceramic crown had no influence on the MRI, while metal-ceramic crowns caused moderate artifacts in the MRI. Therefore, galvano-ceramic restoration is a valuable alternative in dentistry.",M2
20128321,"Clinical performance of a bioactive dental luting cement--a prospective clinical pilot study.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot study determining the clinical efficacy ofa new bioactive dental cement (Ceramir <e>Crown</e> &amp; Bridge) for permanent cementation in fixed prosthodontics. The composition is a hybrid comprised of a calcium aluminate and a glass ionomer. METHODS: This study examined the performance of Ceramir Crown &amp; Bridge after cementation of high-gold alloy and porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) single crowns and bridges. A total of 38 crowns and bridge abutments were cemented in 17 patients; 31 were on vital, seven on non-vital teeth. Six were bridges with 14 abutment teeth (12 vital/two non-vital). One fixed splint comprising two abutment teeth was also included in the study. Preparation parameters were recorded, as well as working time, setting time, seating characteristics, and ease of cement removal. Baseline data were collected on dispensing, mixing, and handling of the cement; gingival inflammation index (GI), and a visual analog scale (VAS) and categorical assessment measured pre-cementation sensitivity. Post-cementation parameters were post-cementation sensitivity, categorical and VAS, gingival tissue reaction, marginal integrity, and discoloration. A one-week post-op telephone call recorded subjectively the patients' comfort level. RESULTS: Working time (two minutes) and setting time (four minutes) were well within normal limits. Cement removal was determined to be very easy. Thirteen of 17 patients reported no post-cementation sensitivity after seven days; four reported a low-grade sensitivity. All 17 patients were seen for recall examinations at 30 days and six months. Of the four sensitivity cases, three were related to hyperocclusion, which disappeared spontaneously after adjustment. One case was due to post-cementation pressure from a three-unit bridge, which disappeared without intervention. After six months, no retentive failures were recorded, no sensitivity was subjectively reported, marginal integrity scored 38 alphas, one tooth had a 1 and two teeth a 0.5 GI score. Average VAS score for tooth sensitivity decreased from 7.63 mm at baseline to 0.44 mm at the six-month recall. Average GI score for gingival inflammation decreased from 0.56 at baseline to 0.11 at the six-month recall. CONCLUSION: After six months, Ceramir Crown &amp; Bridge performed favorably as a luting agent for permanent cementation.",M2
20121939,"Four-year clinical results of fixed dental prostheses with zirconia substructures (Cercon): end abutments vs. cantilever design.The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of three- to four-unit posterior all-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made of yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia-polycrystal ceramic frameworks (CerconBase; Degudent). Fifty-eight restorations were placed in 48 patients. Twenty-four FDPs had an end abutment design (EAD) replacing 3 premolars and 21 molars. Thirty-four FDPs had a cantilever design (CD) replacing 11 premolars and 23 molars. The frameworks had a minimum proximal connector dimension of 3 x 3 mm. The fixed dental prostheses were cemented with glass-ionomer cement after air-abrading the inner <e>crown</e> surfaces. Three FDPs were defined as drop-outs. The mean observation period was 48 +/- 7 months for the EAD (21 patients/24 FDPs) and 50 +/- 14 months for the CD (25 patients/31 FDPs). The 4-yr survival rate, according to the Kaplan-Meier analyses, was 96% for the EAD and 92% for the CD. The technical complication rate was 13% for the EAD and 12% for the CD, and the biological complication rate was 21% for the EAD and 15% for the CD. For none of the analyses were significant differences found between both groups. After 4 yr the clinical outcome of three- to four-unit posterior FDPs with EAD and CD was promising.",M2
20095198,"Clinical performance of cements as luting agents for telescopic double <e>crown</e>-retained removable partial and complete overdentures.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the survival rates and technical failures of removable prostheses (RPs) supported by telescopic double crown (TDC)-retained abutment teeth luted with zinc-phosphate or glass-ionomer cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of 577 patients (288 women, 289 men) who received 577 TDC-retained RPs supported by 1,807 abutments at the Department of Prosthodontics of the University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, between 1984 and 2007 were analyzed. The 577 prostheses included 200 attached to telescopic crowns with friction fit (FFs), 62 to conical crowns (CCs), and 315 to parallel-sided telescopic crowns with clearance fit (CFs). Survival probabilities were evaluated for the RPs, loss of cementation of the inner copings, secondary caries, and abutment teeth that required endodontic treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression analysis determined the impact of covariates such as sex, denture location (maxilla/mandible), Eichner classification, number of abutment teeth, and the type of double crown system used. RESULTS: The 10-year survival probability was 98.8% +/- 0.09% for FFs, 92.9% +/- 0.41% for CCs, and 86.6% +/- 0.05% for CFs. During the observation period, loss of cementation was frequently observed (FFs: 32%, CCs: 53.2%, CFs: 21.3%). After 15 years, more than 75% of patients had experienced at least one  loss of cementation  event. In this respect, zinc-oxide phosphate and glass-ionomer cements did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSION: The long-term successful outcome of the RP experience was not compromised, although numerous clinical visits were required for maintenance. The predominant maintenance procedure was the need for recementation of the inner copings.",M2
20074465,"Microbiological and biochemical effectiveness of an antiseptic gel on the bacterial contamination of the inner space of dental implants: a 3-month human longitudinal study.Microbial penetration inside the implants internal cavity produces a bacterial reservoir that is associated with an area of inflamed connective tissue facing the fixture-abutment junction. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 1 percent chlorhexidine gel on the internal bacterial contamination of implants with screw-retained abutments and on the level of AST secreted in peri-implant crevicular fluid. Twenty-five patients (aged 29 to 58 years) each received one implant. Three months after the end of the restorative treatment, and immediately after a clinical and radiographic examination and the abutment removal, microbiological samples were obtained from the internal part of each fixture and biochemical samples were collected by peri-implant sulci. The patients were then divided into two groups: the control (CG; n=10) and test (TG; n=15) groups. The CG had the abutment screwed into place and the <e>crown</e> cemented without any further intervention. In contrast, before the abutment placement and screw tightening, the TG had the internal part of the fixture filled with a 1 percent chlorhexidine gel. Three months later, the same clinical, microbiological and biochemical procedures were repeated in both groups. Total bacterial count, specific pathogens and AST activity were detected. The clinical parameters remained stable throughout the study. From baseline to the 3-month examination, the total bacterial counts underwent a significant reduction only in the TG. In contrast, the AST activity showed a significant increase in the CG. The administration of a 1% chlorhexidine gel appears to be an effective method for the reduction of bacterial colonization of the implant cavity and for safeguarding the health status of peri-implant tissue over a 3-month administration period.",M2
20070750,"Tooth extraction decision model in periodontitis patients.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to build, around several types of input data, a decision analysis model for dental extraction strategy in periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The decision analysis was based on the following scenario: a fictitious adult chronic periodontitis patient with no chief complaint, being referred to make a decision of extraction on one single tooth presenting a periodontal defect that may affect the decision-making process. A decision tree was used to identify the treatment options within the next 5 years. Scientific evidences were based on probabilities given by a literature analysis using a systematic approach. Clinical expertize was based on subjective utilities (SUs) assigned by an experts' panel. Expected utilities (EUs) were used to rank the following options: no treatment (EU(1)) or periodontal treatment (EU(2)); extraction followed by a tooth-supported fixed partial denture - FPD - (EU(3)) or an implant-supported single <e>crown</e> - ISC - (EU(4)). RESULTS: The robustness analysis calculation indicates that the probability of tooth survival needed to be equal to 0.78 in order that the passive option becomes optimal. However, EU(1) was impossible to calculate due to the lack of available probabilities. The EU intervals were 79-96, 86-89 and 94-95 for EU(2), EU(3) and EU(4), respectively. Consequently, the FPD option is dominated by the ISC option, and it is not possible to conclude to a difference between the periodontal and the ISC therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of this model, tooth extraction followed by FPD is the worst strategy compared with ISC or periodontal therapies.",M2
20059415,"Esthetic index for anterior maxillary implant-supported restorations.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to develop and validate a complex esthetic index (CEI) designed for rating the esthetics of anterior maxillary implant-supported restorations with respect to the surrounding soft and hard tissues. METHODS: Fifty patients (31 males and 19 females; age: 18 to 50 years; mean age +/- SD: 32.4 +/- 9.1 years) previously treated with dental implants were evaluated regarding the esthetic results of their restorations using the proposed CEI. Two calibrated oral surgeons did the evaluation and recording. The evaluation was carried out twice by each of the examiners 2 weeks apart. The weighted Cohen's kappa was used to calculate the intra- and interobserver agreement. RESULTS: An analysis of CEI for 50 anterior maxillary implant-supported restorations showed good intra- and interobserver agreement for the soft tissue index (S) and implant-supported restoration index (R). Only the interobserver agreement for the overall R was rated as moderate (0.54 and 0.52). The single-parameter analysis showed that the lowest (moderate) intra- and interobserver agreement was with the subjective parameters of S (soft tissue color and texture variations) and R (<e>crown</e> surface roughness and ridges and color and translucency). An adequate CEI of S100, P100, and R100 was scored by both examiners in 10% and 12% of cases for evaluations I and II, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents evidence that this newly developed CEI, which incorporates the implant restoration and adjacent soft and hard tissue parameters, is a reproducible tool for scoring anterior implant esthetic predictably. However, prospective clinical trials involving examiners with different training backgrounds are needed to further validate the long-term stability of this index.",M2
19968764,"Masticatory jaw movement optimization after introduction of occlusal interference.How 'control' characteristics of masticatory jaw movement, such as skilfulness of the movement, change after alteration in occlusion remains uncertain. For each of 10 healthy adults with good occlusion, an occlusal interference with artificial 'tooth-cusp' was introduced to the <e>crown</e> of the upper molar tooth on the non-working side of unilateral chewing. Mandibular incisor-point movements were then recorded by a 3D tracking device. The introduction of the occlusal interference induced a remarkable increase in the normalized jerk-cost (NJC), prolonged duration of the decelerative phase and lowered peak velocity for jaw closing movement during chewing. Overall, the NJC and velocity profile showed significant recoveries during the course of about 90 repetitive chewing cycles performed under the altered occlusal condition. These findings suggest that acute adaptive changes of jaw motion after introduction of occlusal interference might be characterized as the recovery process of movement skilfulness in terms of movement smoothness and velocity profile.",M2
19961993,"Influence of tooth preparation taper and cement type on recementation strength of complete metal <e>crowns</e>.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Clinical studies have shown that lack of retention is one of the major causes of fixed dental prosthesis failure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the convergence angle of a complete metal crown tooth preparation and the recementation strength for restorations cemented with conventional and adhesive cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred twenty artificial crowns were cast for standardized complete metal crown tooth preparations accomplished with the use of a milling machine on extracted human teeth. Three different tapers, 5, 12, and 25 degrees, were used (n=40). The crowns in each group were subdivided into 4 subgroups (n=10) according to the luting cement: zinc phosphate cement (Fleck's), glass ionomer cement (Ketac-Cem), and adhesive resin cements (Panavia 21 and C&amp;B-Metabond). Retention was evaluated by measuring the tensile force required to dislodge the crowns from the tooth preparations in a universal testing machine. Subsequently, the tooth preparations were scraped clean and polished with prophylaxis paste, and the intaglio surfaces of the artificial crowns were ultrasonically cleaned and airborne-particle abraded with 50-mum aluminum oxide powder prior to recementation. The data were analyzed with 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Analysis of measurements disclosed a significant difference for taper and luting cement (P&lt;.001); however, their interaction was not significant. Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the retention of the first cementation and the second cementation (P&lt;.001). However, the interaction was not significant with taper or cement. Regardless of the taper used, Panavia 21 cement exhibited the highest mean initial retention, but the difference was not significantly different from the recementation retentive strength. CONCLUSIONS: Tooth preparation taper and type of luting cement had a direct effect on the recementation strength of complete metal crowns.",M2

19961390,"Zirconium dioxide implant abutments for posterior single-tooth replacement: first results.BACKGROUND: Prefabricated implant abutments made of zirconium dioxide (yttria-stabilized polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia; Y-TZP) have proved to be useful in the esthetically demanding anterior region and may also be useful for premolar and molar replacement because of their obvious positive impact on the health of peri-implant soft tissues. METHODS: Forty screw implants were inserted in the posterior region of 24 patients and provided with prefabricated all-ceramic abutments made of zirconium dioxide Y-TZP. Zirconia-based <e>crowns</e> were used as superstructures. The following parameters were used to document the state of soft tissue: the modified plaque index (mPI), sulcus fluid flow rate (SFFR), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), and probing depth (PD). Additionally, implant stability was measured using an electronic mobility testing device. RESULTS: All implants (N = 40) followed up after 6 months in function were osseointegrated and showed good stability. In the presence of good oral hygiene (mPI: 0.3), the parameters SFFR (16) and mSBI (0.7) were indicative of stable and healthy soft tissue. The mean PD was highest at the distal points of measurement (2.4 mm) and was generally at a low level. Neither implant loss nor crown fractures occurred. Chipping of parts of the veneering ceramic was registered in three cases (7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months in function, no mechanical failure was registered in any of the all-ceramic abutments. On clinical investigation, the peri-implant soft tissues were largely healthy and devoid of inflammation.",M2
19948940,"Deformation of a dental ceramic following adhesive cementation.Stress-induced changes imparted in a 'dentin-bonded-<e>crown</e>' material during sintering, annealing, pre-cementation surface modification, and resin coating have been visualized by profilometry. The hypothesis tested was that operative techniques modify the stressing pattern throughout the material thickness. We polished the upper surfaces of 10 ceramic discs to remove surface imperfections before using a contact profilometer (40-nm resolution) to measure the 'flatness'. Discs were re-profiled after annealing and after alumina particle air-abrasion and resin-coating of the 'fit' surface. Polished surfaces were convex, with a mean deflection of 8.4 + or - 1.5 microm. Mean deflection was significantly reduced (P = 0.029) following alumina particle air-abrasion and increased (P &lt; 0.001) on resin-coating. Polishing induced a tensile stress state, resulting in surface convexity. Alumina particle air-abrasion reduced the relative tensile stress state of the contralateral polished surface. Resin-polymerization generated compression within the resin-ceramic 'hybrid layer' and tension in the polished surface and is likely to contribute to the strengthening of ceramics by resin-based cements.",M2
19931901,"<e>Crown</e> pull-off test (crown retention test) to evaluate the bonding effectiveness of luting agents.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to assess the influencing factors which affect laboratory tests that evaluate the effectiveness of luting agents on the retention of crowns in prepared dentin and - based on the results of the review - to propose a reasonable experimental setup. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The database MEDLINE was systematically searched for laboratory methods that evaluated the effectiveness of luting agents by pulling off crowns from prepared extracted teeth. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included into the systematic review. The studies varied largely with regard to tooth type (molars, premolars), number of specimens (9-25), stump height (3-6mm), convergence angle (4.8-33 degrees ), standardization and measurement of preparation surface, seating force (25-200N), artificial ageing, crosshead speed for tensile force and statistical analysis. The coefficient of variation of the test results varied from 3% to 100%. The most important influencing factors for the crown dislodgement were stump height and convergence angle as well as the luting agent. Panavia and RelyX Unicem generally produced the highest values followed by glass ionomer and zinc phosphate cements. When pooling and normalizing the data, the mean difference between glass ionomer and resin-based materials as well as between glass ionomer and zinc phosphate cements was statistically significant (Wilcoxon, p&lt;0.05). Seating force, roughness, type of cutting bur and use of a desensitizing agent had all a negligible effect on the test results. Artificial ageing like thermocycling had no influence with glass ionomer cements whereas for resin-based cements thermocycling and prolonged water storage generated similar a failures stress than thermocycling alone. The comparison with clinical results did not reveal conclusive evidence that the results of the laboratory methods completely reflect the results of prospective clinical trials in conjunction with single crowns and fixed dental prostheses. A reasonable experimental setup includes: at least 20 specimens per group, stump height 3mm, convergence angle 20 degrees , thermocycling of specimens (5000x), avoidance of shearing forces during dislodgement and failure probability statistics (Weibull). CONCLUSIONS: The results of pull-off tests with crowns that are cemented with luting agents varied largely and reflect only partially the results from clinical trials. The most influencing factors (standardized tooth preparation, avoidance of shearing stress during dislodgement of crown) had to be controlled to get meaningful results.",M2
19927457,"Use of a novel resin composite <e>crown</e> as a long-term provisional.Crowns may be indicated to restore teeth where there is substantial tooth substance loss from caries or trauma, but it is not always appropriate to place the substantive restoration without reviewing the prognosis of the tooth under treatment for a time. In such cases, the placement of a long-term provisional restoration may be indicated.This paper describes the use of a recently-introduced, novel, resin-composite crown in such situations. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A crown which is able to be used as a long-term provisional may be a useful clinical technique for situations where the prognosis of a tooth is uncertain, and/or when the personal circumstances of the patient preclude a conventional indirect restoration.",M2

19884709,"Fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored by different FRC posts: an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: Posts and cores are often required for restoration of pulpless teeth and to provide retention and resistance for a complete <e>crown</e>, but conventional posts may increase the root fracture. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to compare the root fracture resistance of extracted teeth treated with different fibers reinforced with composite posts and treated teeth with conventional post and core systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal therapy was performed for 50 mandibular first premolars. The coronal portion of each tooth was amputated, and five post and core systems (cast, polyethylene woven, glass, carbon, and quartz fiber posts) were compared. Acrylic resin blocks were used for mounting, using a layer of elastomeric impression material covering the roots. The load was applied axially and measured with a universal testing machine. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Significantly, cast posts and cores had a higher failure threshold including teeth fracture; whereas, fiber posts failure was due to core fracture, with or without fractures in coronal portion of posts. Difference in FRC posts did not provide any significant difference in the load failure and the mode of fracture.",M2
19857888,"Design features of a three-dimensional molar <e>crown</e> and related maximum principal stress. A finite element model study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of clinically relevant variables on the maximum principal stress (MPS) in the veneer layer of an anatomically correct veneer-core-cement-tooth model. METHODS: The average dimensions of a mandibular first molar crown were imported into CAD software; a tooth preparation was modeled by reducing the proximal walls by 1.5 mm and the occlusal surface by 2.0 mm. 'Crown systems' were composed by varying characteristics of a cement layer, structural core, and veneer solid, all designed to fit the tooth preparation. The main and interacting effects of proximal wall height reduction, core material, core thickness, cement modulus, cement thickness, and load position on the maximum stress distribution were derived from a series of finite element models and analyzed in a factorial analysis of variance. RESULTS: The average MPS in the veneer layer over the 64 models was 488 MPa (range = 248-840 MPa). MPS increased significantly with the addition of horizontal load components and with increasing cement thickness. In addition, MPS levels varied as a function of interactions between: proximal wall height reduction and load position; load position and cement thickness; core thickness and cement thickness; cement thickness and proximal wall height reduction; and core thickness, cement thickness and proximal wall height reduction. CONCLUSION: Rational design of veneered structural ceramics must consider the complex geometry of the crown-tooth system and integrate the influence of both the main effects and interactions among design parameters.",M2
19845708,"Functional aspects of treatment with implant-supported single <e>crowns</e>: a quality control study in subjects with tooth agenesis.BACKGROUND: No comprehensive patient-centered and clinical evaluations of the functional effect of treatment with implant-supported single crowns (ISSC) have been reported previously. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether and how treatment with ISSC affects masticatory function and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) in subjects with tooth agenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In nine females and nine males (32 + or - 10 years) with agenesis treated with one to four ISSC (68% in the premolar region), the treatment effect and masticatory function were assessed. The evaluation was performed first after implant placement shortly before crown cementation, and again 1 month after cementation. It consisted of questionnaires [including Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49)] and functional examination with plastic strips, the Dental Prescale Film and the Occluzer system, Xylitol color-changeable gum and slices of Granny Smith apple. RESULTS: The patients' satisfaction with treatment was high and they experienced a significant overall improvement in their OHRQoL (on average 13% reduction in the total OHIP scores). The cementation of the crowns was associated with a significant increase in the number of near occlusal tooth contacts, contact area, bite force, and masticatory ability and performance. Correspondingly, there was a significant, positive correlation between the number of tooth contacts and (1) occlusal contact area, (2) bite force, and (3) masticatory performance. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ISSCs in subjects with tooth agenesis significantly increased masticatory function subjectively and clinically as well as OHRQoL. However, as the functional parameters before replacement of the teeth corresponded to values in subjects with complete dentitions, the functional importance of the increase may be questioned.",M2
19845242,"Finite element analysis of bone around a dental implant supporting a <e>crown</e> with a premature contact.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of a premature contact caused by an implant-retained crown (IRC) on stress and strain distributions in bone surrounding the implant using the finite element method. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 3D finite element (FE) model of a section of a mandible with a single tooth dental implant, an IRC, and two adjacent teeth was created. Three rigid plates were used to represent the antagonist teeth. Modeling the antagonist teeth using the rigid plates removed the necessity to create FE models for the antagonist teeth, their periodontal ligament, and the maxilla. Moreover, this new approach also allowed the premature contact height to be easily varied by changing the positions of the rigid plates. In the present study, premature contact heights of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 microm were considered. The FE contact analysis was employed. All materials were assumed to be linear elastic and isotropic. RESULTS: The magnitudes of von Mises stresses in the bone change drastically when there was a premature contact. For example, the von Mises stress increased from 9.68 MPa in the case with no premature contact to 49.92 MPa in the case with the premature contact height of 50 microm. In addition, the magnitude of the major principal strain in the marginal bone reached the pathologic overload of 4000 microepsilon when the premature contact height was 100 microm or higher. CONCLUSION: The influence ofpremature contacts is very high and the premature contact height of an IRC over 100 microm should be avoided as much as possible to provide longevity of dental implants.",M2
19841763,"Effect of high frequency ultrasonic agitation on the bond strength of self-etching adhesives.PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of high frequency ultrasonic agitation on the microtensile bond strengths of different self-etching adhesives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six human molars were wet ground occlusally until dentin was exposed. The one-step self-etching adhesives Clearfil S3 Bond, G-Bond, and Futurabond NR were tested in this study. In the control groups, bonding procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. In the experimental groups, bonding materials were applied with a 1 MHz therapeutic ultrasonic device on the dentin surfaces. The composite <e>crown</e> was built up incrementally to a height of 5 mm. Each tooth was serially sectioned into rectangular beams, and the specimens were subjected to microtensile testing. Failure modes were observed under a stereomicroscope and classified. Randomly selected specimens from each group were observed with SEM. RESULTS: Two-factor ANOVA indicated that both the adhesive system and the ultrasonic agitation effect influenced bond strength (p &lt; 0.05). The bond strength of G-Bond adhesive to dentin was higher after ultrasonic agitation (p &lt; 0.05), whereas ultrasonic agitation of Futurabond and S3 Bond did not affect bond strength values (p &gt; 0.05). Failure after the test was commonly due to adhesive failure in the dentin. CONCLUSION: High-frequency ultrasonic agitation of self-etching adhesives during their application may enhance their bonding performance.",M2
19801237,"Estimation of the risk of failure for an endodontically treated maxillary premolar with MODP preparation and CAD/CAM ceramic restorations.INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the risk of failure for an endodontically treated premolar with mesio occlusodistal palatal (MODP) preparation and 3 different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic restoration configurations. METHODS: Three 3-dimensional finite element (FE) models designed with CAD/CAM ceramic onlay, endocrown, and conventional <e>crown</e> restorations were constructed to perform simulations. The Weibull function was incorporated with FE analysis to calculate the long-term failure probability relative to different load conditions. RESULTS: The results indicated that the stress values on the enamel, dentin, and luting cement for endocrown restoration were the lowest values relative to the other 2 restorations. Weibull analysis revealed that the individual failure probability in the endocrown enamel, dentin, and luting cement obviously diminished more than those for onlay and conventional crown restorations. The overall failure probabilities were 27.5%, 1%, and 1% for onlay, endocrown, and conventional crown restorations, respectively, in normal occlusal condition. CONCLUSIONS: This numeric investigation suggests that endocrown and conventional crown restorations for endodontically treated premolars with MODP preparation present similar longevity.",M2
19796295,"Esthetic rehabilitation of maxillary incisors in conjunction with flapless surgical techniques, an implant zirconia <e>crown</e>, and porcelain veneers.ABSTRACT Esthetic replacement of a maxillary central incisor using a dental implant can be a challenging task. The hard and soft tissues must be managed in a way that minimizes the risk of tissue loss, while preserving and/or regenerating full interdental papillae. In order to achieve this, flapless surgical techniques have been developed. Advances in dental materials have led to the introduction of zirconia abutments and crowns that can be synergistically combined with other ceramic materials. This article describes a case in which a hopeless maxillary central incisor is replaced with an implant using flapless techniques, and restored with a customized zirconia abutment and crown. In addition, the remaining maxillary incisors were restored with feldspathic porcelain veneers to yield a highly esthetic result. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This case demonstrates how a conservative multidisciplinary approach facilitates excellent results in an esthetically demanding area. Atraumatic surgical techniques can maintain the natural soft tissue architecture, while a detailed approach to provisional and final restorations allows for a highly esthetic smile.

19782828,"Internal fit evaluation of <e>crowns</e> prepared using a new dental crown fabrication technique: laser-sintered Co-Cr crowns.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Difficulties encountered during casting of base metal dental alloys limit their use. Application of these alloys might be enhanced if new techniques are used. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the internal fit of laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy crowns with base metal restorations prepared from another Co-Cr alloy and a Ni-Cr alloy using conventional casting techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Internal fit of laser-sintered Co-Cr crowns was compared with the fit of conventionally cast Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloy crowns. Twelve crown-shaped specimens were prepared on a stainless steel die representing a prepared maxillary right central incisor for each group. Fit of crowns was evaluated using 2 different techniques: (1) weighing the light-body addition silicone that simulated a cement material, and (2) measuring the internal gap width on a die for longitudinally sectioned specimens. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Significantly higher mean (SD) light-body silicone weights (P&lt;.001) were observed in the laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy group (14.34 (1.67) mg) compared to the conventionally cast Ni-Cr alloy group (9.36 (1.97) mg) and Co-Cr alloy group (7.85 (1.19) mg). Mean internal gap widths (SDs) were 58.21 (19.92) microm, 50.55 (25.1) microm, and 62.57 (21.62) microm, respectively, for the cast Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloy groups and the laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy group. No significant difference was observed between the 3 groups for internal gap widths (P=.42). CONCLUSIONS: Weighing the light-body addition silicone is a convenient method for evaluating the 3-dimensional internal fit of dental crowns. However, no significant difference was found among the 3 alloy groups evaluated for the internal gap width of sectioned crown specimens.",M2
19782825,"Load fatigue of teeth with different ferrule lengths, restored with fiber posts, composite resin cores, and all-ceramic <e>crowns</e>.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: There is no evidence to suggest that the ferrule length needed for an all-ceramic crown is different from that needed for a cast metal or metal ceramic crown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to relate different ferrule lengths with the number of fatigue cycles needed for failure of the crown cement for an all-ceramic crown cemented with a resin cement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen maxillary central incisors were divided into 3 groups (n=5), with ferrules of 0.0 mm (no-ferrule group), 0.5 mm (0.5-mm ferrule group), and 1.0 mm (1.0-mm ferrule group), respectively. Each tooth was restored with a 0.050-inch glass-filled composite post (ParaPost FiberWhite) and a composite resin core (ParaCore). The posts were cemented with resin cement (ParaPost Cement), and the composite resin cores were bonded to dentin using a dentin bonding agent (ParaPost Cement, Conditioner A &amp; B). Each specimen was prepared with a 7-mm total preparation height, a 1.5-mm lingual axial wall, and a 1.0-mm shoulder around the tooth. The crowns for all specimens were pressed with a pressable ceramic material (IPS Empress 2) and cemented with resin cement (Variolink II). A 6-kg cyclic test load was applied to each specimen at 135 degrees to the long axis of the tooth. The independent variable measured was the number of load fatigue cycles required for failure of the crown cement. The data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test to detect overall significance and the Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction (alpha=.017). RESULTS: The mean (SD) number of cycles to failure for each group was: no-ferrule group, 213 (317); 0.5-mm ferrule group, 155,137 (68,991); and 1.0-mm ferrule group, 262,872 (21,432). None of the specimens in the 1.0-mm ferrule group failed. Significant differences were found between the no-ferrule group and the 0.5-mm ferrule group, and the no-ferrule group and the 1.0-mm ferrule group (P&lt;.017), but not between the 0.5-mm ferrule group and the 1.0-mm ferrule group (P&gt;.017). CONCLUSIONS: Specimens with a 0.0-mm ferrule survived few fatigue cycles despite the fact that both the post and crown were bonded with resin cement. Teeth with a 0.5-mm ferrule showed a significant increase in the number of fatigue cycles over the 0.0-mm group, whereas teeth with the 1.0-mm ferrule exhibited a significantly higher fatigue cycle count over the 0.0-mm but not the 0.5-mm group.",M2

During the provisional phase, an optimal emergence profile was created by adjusting the provisional restoration. An impression was made with an individually fabricated impression post for an accurate reproduction of the established emergence profile and, finally, a screw-retained all-ceramic crown was placed.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: The analysis were made in two models with internal butt joint, and with gold and titanium screw, respectively. The load was 382N with 90 masculine to the occlusal surface and 15 masculine to the implant axis at 4 and 6 mm from the implant center. RESULTS: In both models, a large amount of stress was located around the implant neck and little stress was concentrated along the abutment screw. CONCLUSION: The simulations made suggest that the internal connection protects the abutment screw from the accumulated stresses; however, it exposes the implant walls to these stresses.",M2
19751289,"Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of root canal treatment using conventional approaches versus replacement with an implant.AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of root canal treatment for a maxillary incisor tooth with a pulp infection, in comparison with extraction and replacement with a bridge, denture or implant supported restoration. METHODOLOGY: A Markov model was built to simulate the lifetime path of restorations placed on the maxillary incisor following the initial treatment decision. It was assumed that the goal of treatment was the preservation of a fixed platform support for a <e>crown</e> without involving the adjacent teeth. Consequently, the model estimates the lifetime costs and the total longevity of tooth and implant supported crowns at the maxillary incisor site. The model considers the initial treatment decisions, and the various subsequent treatment decisions that might be taken if initial restorations fail. RESULTS: Root canal treatment extended the life of the tooth at an additional cost of pound5-8 per year of tooth life. Provision of orthograde re-treatment, if the root canal treatment fails returns further extension of the expected life of the tooth at a cost of pound12-15 per year. Surgical re-treatment is not cost-effective; it is cheaper, per year, to extend the life of the crown by replacement with a single implant restoration if orthograde endodontic treatment fails. CONCLUSION: Modelling the available clinical and cost data indicates that, root canal treatment is highly cost-effective as a first line intervention. Orthograde re-treatment is also cost-effective, if a root treatment subsequently fails, but surgical re-treatment is not. Implants may have a role as a third line intervention if re-treatment fails.",M2
19723946,"Retention of metal-ceramic <e>crowns</e> with contemporary dental cements.BACKGROUND: New types of crown and bridge cement are in use by practitioners, and independent studies are needed to assess their effectiveness. The authors conducted a study in three parts (study A, study B, and study C) and to determine how well these new cements retain metal-ceramic crowns. METHODS: The authors prepared teeth with a 20-degree taper and a 4-millimeter length. They cast high-noble metal-ceramic copings, then fitted and cemented them with a force of 196 newtons. The types of cements they used were zinc phosphate, resin-modified glass ionomer, conventional resin and self-adhesive modified resin. They thermally cycled the cemented copings, then removed them. They recorded the removal force and calculated the stress of dislodgment by using the surface area of each preparation. They used a single-factor analysis of variance to analyze the data (alpha = .05). RESULTS: The mean stresses necessary to remove crowns, in megapascals, were 8.0 for RelyX Luting (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn.), 7.3 for RelyX Unicem (3M ESPE), 5.7 for Panavia F (Kuraray America, New York) and 4.0 for Fuji Plus (GC America, Alsip, Ill.) in study A; 8.1 for RelyX Luting, 2.6 for RelyX Luting Plus (3M ESPE) and 2.8 for Fuji CEM (GC America) in study B; and 4.9 for Maxcem (Kerr, Orange, Calif.), 4.0 for BisCem (Bisco, Schaumburg, Ill.), 3.7 for RelyX Unicem Clicker (3M ESPE), 2.9 for iCEM (Heraeus Kulzer, Armonk, N.Y.) and 2.3 for Fleck's Zinc Cement (Keystone Industries, Cherry Hill, N.J.) in study C. CONCLUSIONS: Powder-liquid versions of new cements were significantly more retentive than were paste-paste versions of the same cements. The mean value of crown removal stress for the new self-adhesive modified-resin cements varied appreciably among the four cements tested. All cements retained castings as well as or better than did zinc phosphate cement. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Powder-liquid versions of cements, although less convenient to mix, may be a better clinical choice when crown retention is an issue. All cements tested will retain castings adequately on ideal preparations because the corresponding removal stresses are comparable with or higher than those associated with zinc phosphate. Powder-liquid resin-modified glass ionomer cement, selected self-adhesive modified-resin cements and conventional resin cements provide additional retention when desired.",M2
19722788,"Immediate versus one-stage restoration of small-diameter implants for a single missing maxillary lateral incisor: a 3-year randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the bone loss pattern and soft tissue healing of immediately versus one-stage loaded 3.0-mm-diameter implants in cases involving a single missing lateral maxillary incisor. METHODS: Sixty patients with a missing lateral incisor in the maxilla were randomized to one of the treatments: 30 patients in the immediate-restoration group and 30 patients in the one-stage group. All implants were placed in healed sites and had to be inserted with a torque &gt;25 Ncm. The implants in the immediate-restoration group were fitted with a non-occluding temporary <e>crown</e> on the day of surgery. Both groups received a full occluding final crown 6 months after surgery. Mean marginal bone loss, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were assessed at 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up examinations by a masked examiner. RESULTS: Sixty 3.0-mm-diameter implants were placed between July 2003 and February 2006; 27 (45.0%) were in men, and 33 (55.0%) were in women. All implants osseointegrated and were clinically stable at the 6-month follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed for bleeding or plaque index. No implant fractures occurred. At the 36-month follow-up, the accumulated mean marginal bone loss and probing depth were 0.85 +/- 0.71 mm and 1.91 +/- 0.59 mm, respectively, for the immediate-loading group (n = 30) and 0.75 +/- 0.63 mm and 2.27 +/- 0.81 mm, respectively, for the one-stage group (n = 30). There was no statistically significant difference (P &gt;0.05) for the tested outcome measures between the two procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In the rehabilitation of a single missing lateral maxillary incisor, no statistically significant difference was assessed between immediately and one-stage restored small-diameter implants with regard to implant survival, mean marginal bone loss, and probing depth. Three-millimeter-diameter implants proved to be a predictable treatment option in our test and control groups if a strict clinical protocol was followed.",M2
19715151,"A comparison of the fabrication times of all-ceramic partial <e>crowns</e>: Cerec 3D vs IPS Empress.Apart from precision, the time factor plays a decisive role in the fabrication of all-ceramic dental restorations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare two all-ceramic systems with regard to the time required for the fabrication of partial crowns [MODB]. The null hypothesis tested was that the fabrication times of CAD/CAM generated partial crowns are shorter than the fabrication times of partial crowns manufactured in the laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In sixteen model pairs mounted in the articulator, which corresponded to different clinical situations, tooth 36 was prepared for an all-ceramic partial crown [MODB]. With the Cerec3D method [CHAIR], the fabrication of the restoration was simulated directly on the  phantom patient . The IPS Empress system [LAB] was used forthe indirectfabrication method via an impression of the phantom patient. Both methods were used for each preparation. The adhesive luting procedure was not simulated and, therefore, not measured. RESULTS: The mean processing times [hh:mm:ss] were 00:35:05 (SD +/- 03:27 min) for the Cerec method and 04:17:54 (SD +/- 26:01 min) for the Empress method. The mean time on the phantom patient for process-induced activities was 11:47 minutes (SD +/- 02:08 min) for the Cerec method and 03:58 minutes (SD +/- 02:50 min) for the Empress method. DISCUSSION: Time expenditure for fabrication is only one aspect in order to assess the suitability of a restoration system. Both methods enable the dentist to provide high quality all ceramic restorations. Although the Empress method showed a time advantage of 65% during the fitting phase and occlusal grinding-in on the phantom patient in comparison to the Cerec method, the time spent during the laboratory phase has to be considered as well.",M2

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare vinyl polysiloxane (VPS) impression materials using the 1-step impression technique for single and 2-unit <e>crowns</e>. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty subjects provided informed consent, and two 1-step double-phase master impressions (1 of each material combination) were made of 25 crown preparations. A relatively new VPS material with heavy-body (HB) and light-body (LB) viscosities, which was defined as the experimental group (Imprint 3), was compared to a standard VPS with medium-body (MB) and light-body (LB) viscosities, which was defined as the control group (Aquasil Ultra). Stock trays were used to make a total of 40 master impressions. The order of impression making was randomized as related to the different groups. Impressions were rated visually by 2 evaluators (a clinician and a dental technician). The rating resulted in ordinally structured data for the outcome variables (alpha: excellent, no defects; bravo: acceptable, small defects; charlie: defects require impression to be remade; delta: unacceptable, defects at finish line). Definitive casts made of impressions rated as alpha or bravo were further rated by a dental technician, and that which was rated best was used for making the definitive crown. RESULTS: Twenty-three (92%) of the experimental and 24 (96%) of the control impressions were rated as alpha or bravo by the evaluator (P=.57; McNemar's test for clustered paired proportions using GEE). All 25 dies in the definitive casts of both groups were rated as alpha or bravo by the dental technician. Fifteen dies were selected from the control group and 10 from the experimental group for the fabrication of the definitive crowns (P=.41; 1-sample binomial test for clustered data using GEE). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this clinical study, there was no statistical difference in the clinical performance of the experimental and control VPS impression materials.

METHODS: Identically shaped methacrylate molars were prepared according to the ceramic restoration directives resulting in a 1-mm deep circular shoulder preparation. They were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate resin after covering their roots with a polyether layer to simulate periodontal mobility. The crown cores were made of yttria-stabilized zirconia veneered with a corresponding veneering ceramic. The crowns were divided into 5 groups (n=8) which differed in core design and cement gap thickness: #1: simple core, 40 microm cement; #2: core with minimal occlusal support, 40 microm cement; #3: core with optimized cusp support, 40 microm cement; #4: core with optimized cusp support, 30 microm cement; #5: core with optimized cusp support, 10 microm cement. All crowns were cemented with zinc oxide phosphate cement and thermo mechanically loaded (1.2 x 10(6) x 50N; 6000x5 degrees C/55 degrees C) with identical metal ceramic restorations as antagonists. Crown failures were monitored and described. Area and direction of the chipping failures of the veneering ceramic were documented by means of scanning electron micrographs.

19683378,"A preliminary evaluation of the structural integrity and fracture mode of minimally prepared resin bonded CAD/CAM <e>crowns</e>.PURPOSE: This study was a preliminary evaluation of two minimal preparation designs proposed for ceramic and composite resin bonded CAD/CAM crowns. It compared the structural integrity and fracture mode of teeth restored with traditionally and minimally prepared resin bonded CAD/CAM crowns fabricated from the same material hypothesizing that teeth restored with minimal resin bonded crowns would demonstrate the same fracture strength to teeth restored with traditional resin bonded crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty intact maxillary molar teeth were used and divided in four groups. Two groups were prepared according to a traditional crown preparation design and two groups were prepared according to minimal preparation designs. A resin composite (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) and a leucite glass-ceramic (ProCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were used for the fabrication of the crowns using CEREC Scan. Crowns of ceramic were cemented using Variolink II (Ivoclar Vivadent) and crowns of composite with Rely X Unicem Aplicap (3M ESPE) and loaded until fracture. Load data was analysed using ANOVA comparing crowns of the same restorative material. The mode of fracture was also recorded and analysed (Kruskal-Wallis). RESULTS: For the composite system the mean fracture load and SD was 1682N (+/-315) for the traditional and 1751N (+/-338) for the minimal crowns. For the ceramic system the mean fracture load and SD was 1512N (+/-373) for the traditional and 1837 (+/-356) for the minimal crowns. No statistically significant difference was found between the two designs for each system. Nonparametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) of the fracture mode showed no statistical significant difference between designs for either material (p&gt;.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this experimental design, it was found that minimally prepared resin bonded CEREC crowns demonstrated equal fracture resistance and mode of fracture to that of crowns bonded to traditionally prepared teeth.",M2
19682214,"Fracture loads of all-ceramic <e>crowns</e> under wet and dry fatigue conditions.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that fracture loads of fatigued dental ceramic crowns are affected by testing environment and luting cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty crowns were prepared from bovine teeth using a lathe. Ceramic crowns were prepared from three types of ceramic systems: an alumina-infiltrated ceramic, a lithia-disilicate-based glass ceramic, and a leucite-reinforced ceramic. For each ceramic system, 30 crowns were cemented with a composite resin cement, and the remaining 30 with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement. For each ceramic system and cement, ten specimens were loaded to fracture without fatiguing. A second group (n = 10) was subjected to cyclic fatigue and fracture tested in a dry environment, and a third group (n = 10) was fatigued and fractured in distilled water. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. RESULTS: The fracture loads of ceramic crowns decreased significantly after cyclic fatigue loading (p&lt;or= 0.05); furthermore, fracture loads of crowns fatigued in a wet environment were statistically lower than those in a dry environment (p &lt; 0.05). Crowns luted with a composite resin cement showed statistically greater fracture loads than those luted with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (p&lt;or= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Fracture load of the three ceramic systems was found to be influenced by ceramic composition. Moreover, cement and fatigue condition influenced the fracture loads of the crown specimens evaluated in this study.",M2
19681934,"Implant-supported electrostimulating device to treat xerostomia: a preliminary study.BACKGROUND: The full accomplishment of salivary function depends on proper salivary flow rate and composition. Salivary secretion is highly essential in the maintenance of health and integrity of oral hard and soft tissue. Xerostomia is a common symptom affecting between one-fifth and one-third of the adult population, more commonly women than men. Induction of salivary secretion exists in several pharmacological formulations per os. Electrostimulation to enhance salivary secretion has been used frequently as a research tool but only in limited extent as a clinical method to treat patients with xerostomia.

The following clinical parameters were analyzed: crown length (CL) and width (CW), recession height and width, probing depth, clinical attachment level, width and thickness of the keratinized tissue and percentage of root coverage achieved. These measurements were recorded at baseline and 6 months after the surgical procedure. The CW/CL ratio was calculated for each tooth and the median obtained (0.83). Patients were then ranked into two groups, according to the shape of the tooth with gingival recession: Group A - square crown shape (CW/CL values above 0.83) and Group B - long and narrow crown shape (CW/CL values below 0.83). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were found between groups in any of the clinical parameters at baseline. After 6 months, both groups presented improved clinical outcomes for all parameters analyzed compared to baseline (p&gt;0.05). The mean percentages and standard deviations of root coverage achieved in Group A and Group B was 91.37 (16.75) and 85.49 (23.55), respectively (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Crown shape did not influence the root coverage obtained with the subepithelial connective tissue graft technique.",M2
19665354,"Immediate, non-submerged, root-analogue zirconia implants placed into single-rooted extraction sockets: 2-year follow-up of a clinical study.This study evaluated non-submerged, root-analogue zirconia implants with two different surfaces for immediate single-rooted tooth replacement in 18 patients. After tooth extraction the root was laser scanned and one-piece root analogue zirconia dental implants with one of two different surfaces were manufactured. In group A (n=6) the implant surface was roughened by sandblasting only, in group B (n=12) additional macroretentions limited to the interdental space, to avoid fracture of the thin buccal cortex, were designed prior to laser scanning. Implants were placed in the socket 1-8 days after extraction by tapping and restored with a composite <e>crown</e> 3-5 months later. Implant survival, level of marginal bone and adverse soft tissue changes were recorded. No complications occurred during the healing period. In group A, all implants were lost within 2 months, with an unaltered extraction socket. In group B, overall survival rate was 92% for implants that were functional for 1-33 months. Excellent aesthetic and functional results were achieved with the composite crown with minimal bone resorption and soft tissue recession. Significant modifications, such as macroretentions seem to indicate that primary stability and excellent osseointegration of immediate root-analogue zirconia implants can be achieved, while preventing unaesthetic bone resorption.",M2
19663952,"To what extent does the <e>crown</e>-implant ratio affect the survival and complications of implant-supported reconstructions? A systematic review.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of biological and technical complications with respect to the crown-implant (C/I) ratio of implant-supported reconstructions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic (MEDLINE) and hand searches were conducted for longitudinal prospective studies with a follow-up period of at least 4 years. One reviewer performed screening and data abstraction. The following complications were evaluated: implant survival, peri-implant crestal bone loss, implant fracture, and technical complications related to implant components and suprastructure. RESULTS: The search provided 41 articles and abstracts, seven of which were selected for full-text analysis. Only two articles were finally included. A qualitative data analysis revealed that the survival rate of implant-supported reconstructions with a C/I ratio of more than 2 was 94.1%. In addition, peri-implant crestal bone loss seemed not to be influenced by the C/I ratio of the implant rehabilitation, except in one study, which noted greater crestal bone loss with lower (&lt;1) compared with higher (&gt;2) C/I ratios. Technical complications related to implant components and suprastructure according to different C/I ratios were not found in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the diversity among studies with respect to data collection and study design, the current literature shows that the C/I ratios of implant-supported reconstructions do not influence peri-implant crestal bone loss.",M2
19660518,"The optical effect of composite luting cement on all ceramic <e>crowns</e>.PURPOSE: To investigate the optical properties of resin-based composite cements and assess their effects on the color of all ceramic crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Optical properties of three cements (Variolink II, Esthetic, Nexus II) were analyzed using disk samples (100 microm and 1.0 mm diameter) based on CIELAB color coordinates L*a*b*C* and opacity index. Empress (Ivoclar) and Katana (Noritake) crowns were filled with four different shades of die material (IPS die material ST3, ST5, ST9 and Tetric Evo Ceram Bleach XL). The shade of the crowns was measured with each of three shades of composite cement (Chroma, Bleach and Opaque, Esthetic cement). ST3 and glycerin served as the control. Color differences were calculated in incisal, body and cervical regions. RESULTS: In the cervical and body regions, the color change caused by the bleach abutment could not be altered by using different colored cements for the Empress and Katana crowns. In the cervical region, the color changes effected by the dark brown abutment could be reversed with the bleach luting cement; in the body region this was true only for the Empress crown. Neither different abutment colors nor different luting cement shades resulted in perceptible color changes in the incisal regions. Mean DeltaE* values in the three areas (incisal, body, cervical) were significantly different (p-value&lt;0.01); in the cervical and body regions Empress mean DeltaE* was significantly larger (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: The composite cements evaluated in this study created perceptible color differences with particular combinations of die material, cement and ceramic crown.",M2

19641157,"Direct inkjet printing of dental prostheses made of zirconia.CAD/CAM milling systems provide a rapid and individual method for the manufacturing of zirconia dental restorations. However, the disadvantages of these systems include limited accuracy, possible introduction of microscopic cracks, and a waste of material due to the principle of the 'subtractive process'. The hypothesis of this study was that these issues can be overcome by a novel generative manufacturing technique, direct inkjet printing. A tailored zirconia-based ceramic suspension with 27 vol% solid content was synthesized. The suspension was printed on a conventional, but modified, drop-on-demand inkjet printer. A cleaning unit and a drying device allowed for the build-up of dense components of the size of a posterior <e>crown</e>. A characteristic strength of 763 MPa and a mean fracture toughness of 6.7 MPam(0.5) were determined on 3D-printed and subsequently sintered specimens. The novel technique has great potential to produce, cost-efficiently, all-ceramic dental restorations at high accuracy and with a minimum of materials consumption.",M2
19639090,"Fracture performance of computer-aided manufactured zirconia and alloy <e>crowns</e>.OBJECTIVE: To compare the fracture resistance and fracture performance of CAD/CAM zirconia and alloy crowns. METHOD AND MATERIALS: One electrophoretic deposition alumina ceramic (Wolceram, Wolceram) and 4 zirconia-based systems (ce.novation, ce.novation; Cercon, DeguDent; Digizon, Amann Girrbach; and Lava, 3M ESPE) were investigated. A porcelain-fused-to-metal method (Academy, Bego Medical) was used in either conventional casting technique or laser sintering. Sixteen crowns of each material were fabricated and veneered with glass-ceramic as recommended by the manufacturers. Crown and root dimensions were measured, and 8 crowns of each system were adhesively bonded or conventionally cemented. After the crowns were artificially aged in a simulated oral environment (1,200,000 mechanical loads with 50 N; 3,000 thermal cycles with distilled water between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C; 2 minutes per cycle), fracture resistance and fracture patterns were determined and defect sizes investigated. RESULTS: The fracture force varied between 1,111 N and 2,038 N for conventional cementation and between 1,181 N and 2,295 N for adhesive bonding. No significant differences were found between adhesive and conventional cementations. Fracture patterns presented mostly as a chipping of the veneering, in single cases as a fracture of the core, and in 1 case as a fracture of the tooth. CONCLUSIONS: Crown material and cementation do not have any significant influence on the fracture force and fracture performance of all-ceramic and metal-based crowns. Therefore, it may be concluded that adhesive bonding is not necessary for the application of high-strength ceramics.",M2
19639070,"Retention of gold alloy <e>crowns</e> cemented with traditional and resin cements.The aim of this study was to measure in vitro retention of cast gold crowns cemented with traditional and resin cements. Forty-eight human molars were prepared on a lathe to produce complete crown preparations with a consistent taper and split into six groups, eight crowns in each group. Crowns were cast in a high-gold alloy and then cemented. After 24 hours, the retention force (N) was recorded and mean values were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher post-hoc least significant difference (PLSD) multiple comparisons test (a = .05). Failure sites were examined under 3100 magnification and recorded. Mean values (SD) for each group in increasing order of retention force were: Harvard Cement: 43 N (27), TempoCem: 59 N (16), PermaCem Dual: 130 N (42), RelyX Luting Cement: 279 N (26), Contax and PermaCem Dual: 286 N (38), and TempoCem with Contax and PermaCem Dual: 340 N (14). The Fisher PLSD interval (P = .05) for comparing cements was 29 N. Zinc-phosphate cement and provisional resin cements had the lowest retention forces.

Molars were prepared for an all-ceramic crown and were divided into two groups: non-coated (control) and resin-coated with Clearfil Tri-S Bond. Crowns were fabricated using CEREC 3 and cemented using Clearfil Esthetic Cement. After 24 h of storage in water, the restored teeth in each group were divided into two subgroups: unloaded, or loaded while stored in water. Mechanical loading was achieved with an axial force of 80 N at 2.5 cycles s(-1) for 250,000 cycles. After immersion in Rhodamine B, the specimens were sectioned and processed for microleakage evaluation by confocal microscopy, which was followed by further sectioning for microtensile bond testing. Loading had no significant effect on microleakage in either the resin-coated or non-resin-coated groups. Resin coating did not reduce the microleakage at the dentine interface but increased the microleakage at the enamel interface. All the beams fractured during slicing when non-coated and loaded. The bond strengths of non-coated and unloaded, resin-coated and unloaded, and resin-coated and loaded groups were 15.82 +/- 4.22, 15.17 +/- 5.24, and 12.97 +/- 5.82 MPa, respectively. Resin coating with Clearfil Tri-S Bond improved the bonding of resin cement to dentine for loaded specimens. However, it was not effective in reducing the microleakage, regardless of whether it was loaded or unloaded.",M2

The effect of triclosan on root caries and on the survival of dental crowns (fixed dental prosthetic treatment) has not been evaluated. In order to examine these important variables, a randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted comparing Colgate Total toothpaste with triclosan, and an identical fluoride toothpaste without triclosan. METHODS: Adult subjects were randomly assigned to a test group using Colgate Total plus Whitening toothpaste with triclosan, and a control group using Colgate sodium fluoride toothpaste without triclosan. By the end of the study, following three years of product use, an evaluation was performed to compare baseline data to the three-year data for root caries and dental crown survival. Clinical root caries was evaluated by the Katz RCI- Root Caries Index. Within-treatment analysis for each dentifrice was conducted using a paired t-test. Between-treatment analysis was performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). For fixed dental prosthetic treatment evaluation, dental crowns were dichotomized for success and failure at the end of the study. Within-treatment analysis for each dentifrice was conducted using a paired t-test. Between-treatment analysis was performed using the Bonferroni test. RESULTS: One-thousand, three-hundred, and fifty-seven subjects (1,357) completed the study. Regarding root caries, at termination of the study the Colgate Total group presented a mean score of 1.14 +/- 1.75 and a +5.6% change from baseline, while the sodium fluoride toothpaste presented a mean of 1.25 +/- 1.88 and a +43.2% change from baseline (p &lt; 0.001). The adjusted mean root caries increment was 0.07 +/- 0.03 for the Colgate Total group, and 0.38 +/- 0.03 for the sodium fluoride toothpaste group (p &lt; 0.001). Regarding crowns, at termination of the study the Colgate Total group presented a mean score of 5.38 +/- 3.70 and a +1.1% change from baseline, while the sodium fluoride toothpaste without triclosan presented a mean of 5.75 +/- 3.86 and a +3.8% change from baseline (p &lt; 0.001). The mean (adjusted for multiple comparisons) dental crowns failure increment was 0.09 +/- 0.03 for the Colgate Total group, and 0.31 +/- 0.02 for the sodium fluoride toothpaste group (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: A comparison between the two study groups revealed a statistically significant difference for root caries and dental crown failure scores, both favoring the triclosan toothpaste (Colgate Total). The significantly lower root caries and observed dental crown failure scores among the Colgate Total toothpaste users indicate an effect of the triclosan and the copolymer system. These results are important and could provide a strong and valuable public health measure.",M2

The aim was therefore to present the 3-year outcome of zirconia (NobelProcera) single crowns. METHODS: All patients treated with porcelain-veneered zirconia single crowns in a private practice during the period October 2004 to November 2005 were included. The patient records were scrutinized for data on the restorations and the supporting teeth. Information was available for 161 patients and 204 crowns. At the 3-year recall appointments, a sample of 18 patients with 25 crowns was clinically examined and interviewed regarding patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Most crowns (78%) were placed on premolars and molars. The clinical outcome of the crowns was favourable. No zirconia core fractured and no caries was observed on the abutment teeth. Some types of complication were recorded for 32 (16%) crowns or abutment teeth. The most severe complications, in total 12 restorations (6%), were recorded as failures: abutment tooth was extracted (5), remake of crown due to lost retention (4), veneer fracture (2) and persistent pain (1). The CDA criteria for 25 crowns were rated favourably, and patient satisfaction with the zirconia crowns was in general high. CONCLUSIONS: The porcelain-veneered zirconia crowns (NobelProcera) showed good clinical results, were well accepted by the patients, and only few complications were reported over the 3-year follow-up period.",M2

A metallic maxillary central incisor and first premolar were prepared according to the Procera guidelines and incorporated into a U-shaped definitive cast. From this definitive cast, 20 primary casts were made in polyurethane resin. Two sets of impressions (10 with type IV stone and 10 with polyurethane resin) were made and poured onto these casts. Forty pure aluminum oxide substructures for Procera crowns were made for these groups, with 10 incisors and 10 premolars in each group. Each substructure was cemented on the respective primary die and sectioned. Using an optical microscope and special software, sections were measured and compared for marginal adaptation. Based on the findings, both materials were equally adequate for producing a Procera crown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four PCMs were tested: Integrity, Jet, Protemp, and Snap. Forty cylindrical specimens of 10 mm diameter x 5 mm were prepared for each PCM. Ten specimens from each group were bonded to one of the two brackets, Clarity or Victory, using one of the two adhesives, Fuji Ortho LC or Ortho Bracket Adhesive. The brackets were debonded in shear at a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min, and the shear bond strength (SBS) was calculated. The type of failure was visually determined. The numeric data were analyzed using three-way analysis of variance and Tukey multiple range test at alpha = .05. RESULTS: The mean SBSs ranged from 2.81 MPa to 9.65 MPa. There was a significant difference between Snap and the other three materials (P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference between the two brackets or the two adhesives (P &gt; .05). The bond failure for all the specimens was of the adhesive type between the PCM and the adhesive resin. CONCLUSIONS: The PCM Snap yielded a significantly lower mean SBS value compared to the other three materials. No significant differences were found between the brackets or the adhesives.

Previous studies have shown the effects of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on the dentin surface at restoration margins, but there are few reports about the significance of the irradiation on the hybrid layer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The flattened coronal and root dentin samples of 24 bovine teeth were randomly divided into 8 groups, according to the adhesive system used -- Scotchbond Multi Purpose (SBMP) or Clearfil SE Bond (CSEB) -- and were either irradiated with Nd:YAG or not, with different parameters: 0.8 W/10 Hz, 0.8 W/20 Hz, 1.2 W/10 Hz, 1.2 W/20 Hz. The left sides of specimens were the control groups, and right sides were irradiated. A composite <e>crown</e> was built over bonded surfaces and stored in water (24 h at 37 degrees C). Specimens were sectioned vertically into slabs that were subjected to microTBS testing and observed by SEM. RESULTS: Control groups (27.81 +/- 1.38) showed statistically higher values than lased groups (21.37 +/- 0.99), and CSEB control group values (31.26 +/- 15.71) were statistically higher than those of SBMP (24.3 +/- 10.66). There were no significant differences between CSEB (20.34 +/- 10.01) and SBMP (22.43 +/- 9.82) lased groups. Among parameters tested, 0.8 W/10 Hz showed the highest value (25.54 +/- 11.74). Nd:YAG laser irradiation caused dentin to melt under the adhesive layer of both adhesive systems tested. CONCLUSION: With the parameters used in this study, Nd:YAG laser irradiation of the hybrid layer promoted morphological changes in dentin and negatively influenced the bond strength of both adhesive systems.",M2

19473767,"Experimental occlusal interference induces long-term masticatory muscle hyperalgesia in rats.Temporomandibular joint or related masticatory muscle pain represents the most common chronic orofacial pain condition. Patients frequently report this kind of pain after dental alterations in occlusion. However, lack of understanding of the mechanisms of occlusion-related temporomandibular joint and muscle pain prevents treating this problem successfully. To explore the relationship between improper occlusion (occlusal interference) and masticatory muscle pain, we created an occlusal interference animal model by directly bonding a <e>crown</e> to a maxillary molar to raise the masticating surface of the tooth in rats. We raised the occlusal surface to three different heights (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6mm), and for one month we quantitatively measured mechanical nociceptive thresholds of the temporal and masseter muscles on both sides. Results showed a stimulus-response relationship between the height of occlusal interference and muscle hyperalgesia. Removal of the crown 6 days after occlusal interference showed that the removal at this time could not terminate the 1 month duration of mechanical hyperalgesia in the masticatory muscles. Lastly, we systemically administered NMDA antagonist MK801 (0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/kg) to the treated rats and found that MK801 dose dependently attenuated the occlusal interference-induced hyperalgesia. These findings suggest that occlusal interference is directly related to masticatory muscle pain, and that central sensitization mechanisms are involved in the maintenance of the occlusal interference-induced mechanical hyperalgesia.",M2
19463666,"Retrospective analysis of porcelain failures of metal ceramic <e>crowns</e> and fixed partial dentures supported by 729 implants in 152 patients: patient-specific and implant-specific predictors of ceramic failure.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Porcelain fracture associated with an implant-supported, metal ceramic crown or fixed partial denture occurs at a higher rate than in tooth-supported restorations, according to the literature. Implant-specific and patient-specific causes of ceramic failure have not been fully evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the potential statistical predictors for porcelain fracture of implant-supported, metal ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a 6-month period, a consecutive series of patients having previously received implant-supported, metal ceramic fixed restorations were examined during periodic recall appointments. The number of supporting implants, number of dental units, type of restoration, date of prosthesis insertion, location in the dental arch, opposing dentition, type of occlusion, presence of parafunctional habits, use of an occlusal protective device, presence or absence of ceramic fractures, gender, and age were recorded for each patient. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was used for the intrasubject correlated measurements analysis of categorical outcomes (presence or absence of ceramic fractures) to determine which patient- and implant-specific factors would predict porcelain fracture (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Data were collected from 152 patients representing 998 dental units (390 single crowns and 94 fixed partial dentures) supported by 729 implants. Porcelain fractures of 94 dental units occurred in 35 patients. The fractures were significantly (P&lt;.05) associated with opposing implant-supported metal ceramic restorations, bruxism, and not wearing a protective occlusal device. Metal ceramic prostheses (single crown or fixed partial dentures) had approximately 7 times higher odds of porcelain fracture (odds ratio (OR)=7.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.57 to 19.37) and 13 times greater odds of a fracture requiring either repair or replacement (OR=13.95; 95% CI: 2.25 to 86.41) when in occlusion with another implant-supported restoration, as compared to opposing a natural tooth. In addition, patients exhibiting bruxism or not wearing an occlusal device had approximately 7 times higher odds (OR=7.23; 95% CI: 3.86 to 13.54), and 2 times higher odds (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.67) of porcelain fracture when compared to patients without bruxism and patients not wearing an occlusal device. CONCLUSIONS: Implant-supported metal ceramic single crowns and fixed partial dentures were found to have a significantly higher risk of porcelain fracture in patients with bruxism habits, when a protective occlusal device was not used, and when the restoration opposed another implant-supported metal ceramic restoration.",M2
19438966,"Early loading of nonsubmerged titanium implants with a chemically modified sand-blasted and acid-etched surface: 6-month results of a prospective case series study in the posterior mandible focusing on peri-implant crestal bone changes and implant stability quotient (ISQ) values.PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective case series study was to evaluate the short-term success rates of titanium screw-type implants with a chemically modified sand-blasted and acid-etched (mod SLA) surface after 3 weeks of healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 56 implants were inserted in the posterior mandible of 40 partially edentulous patients exhibiting bone densities of class I to III. After a healing period of 3 weeks, all implants were functionally loaded with a screw-retained <e>crown</e> or fixed dental prosthesis. The patients were recalled at weeks 4, 7, 12, and 26 for monitoring and assessment of clinical and radiological parameters, including implant stability quotient (ISQ) measurements. RESULTS: None of the implants failed to integrate. However, two implants were considered  spinners  at day 21 and left unloaded for an extended period. Therefore, 96.4% of the inserted implants were loaded according to the protocol tested. All 56 implants including the  spinners  showed favorable clinical and radiographic findings at the 6-month follow-up examination. The ISQ values increased steadily throughout the follow-up period. At the time of implant placement, the range of ISQ values exhibited a mean of 74.33, and by week 26, a mean value of 83.82 was recorded. Based on strict criteria, all 56 implants were considered successfully integrated, resulting in a 6-month survival and success rate of 100.0%. CONCLUSION: This prospective study using an early-loading protocol after 3 weeks of healing demonstrated that titanium implants with the modified SLA surface can achieve and maintain successful tissue integration over a period of at least 6 months. The ISQ method seems feasible to monitor implant stability during the initial wound-healing period.",M2
19432763,"Effect of two self-adhesive cements on marginal adaptation and strength of esthetic ceramic CAD/CAM molar <e>crowns</e>.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effects of adhesive cements on marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of ceramic molar crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five extracted maxillary molars were selected. The occlusal morphology of 15 molars (control) was scanned and transferred to the crowns in the test groups by CAD/CAM. Sixty molars received full-coverage crown preparations with 6-degree axial taper, 1.0-mm shoulder, and 2.0-mm occlusal reduction. They were assigned to four groups, and pulpal pressure was simulated. The 15 crowns in each test group were seated with resin-based self-adhesive cements, Rely-X (RX) and Multilink (MS), one multistep bonded adhesive luting composite resin, Variolink (VL), and glass-ionomer cement, Ketac Cem (KC). Test and control molars were subjected to thermal and mechanical fatigue stress (TMS: 12,000 x 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C; 2.4 million x 49 N) for 18 days in a masticator. Marginal adaptation [ continuous margin%  (CM%)] of the crowns was determined by scanning electron microscopy (200x). Finally, molars were occlusally loaded until fracture in a testing machine, and fracture load (N) was recorded. Marginal adaptation and strength data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: TMS significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced CM% in all groups. After TMS, CM% at the cement-dentin interface was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher for RX than for all other cements. At the crown-cement interface both self-adhesive cements MS and RX had significantly better CM% than VL (p &lt; 0.05) and KC (p &lt; 0.001). Fracture resistance of natural untreated molars was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher than that of experimental crowns. Fracture resistance of RX cemented crowns was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than that of other crowns. Occlusal morphology significantly influenced fracture resistance (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Self-adhesive cement RX offers a valid alternative to multistep resin-based luting composite with respect to marginal adaptation to dentin and fracture resistance. The latter is also influenced by occlusal morphology, necessitating careful monitoring of occlusal contacts.",M2
19481326,"Process and outcome measures of expert/novice performance on a haptic virtual reality system.OBJECTIVES: The goal of dental education is to guide students' development through different stages from novice to competent, eventually resulting in an expert clinician. In this study we sought to identify process and outcome measures of clinical skill performance by comparing novices and experts using a virtual reality (VR) simulation system developed by our group. METHODS: Ten novices (fourth-year dental students), and ten experts in prosthodontics performed a <e>crown</e> preparation task with a haptic VR that provided force feedback to the operating tool while interacting with the virtual tissue/organ. For each step of the crown preparation, the system automatically recorded data associated with performance process including time to task completion (T), force used (F), and angulations (A) of the bur. The preparation outcome (O) scores were graded by an expert in the field. An independent t-test was conducted on all dependent variables (F in x-, y-, z-axes; A in zy, zx, xy planes; T and O) between experts and novices. RESULTS: Experts performed significantly better than novices (p&lt;0.05) as shown by greater O. Expert T was significantly less than that of novices (p&lt;0.05). Instrument A as well as F used were significantly different in almost all preparation steps in both groups (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrated the ability of outcome and process measures to distinguish between novice and expert performance in crown preparation using a haptic VR system.",M2
19480107,"Principles of <e>crown</e> lengthening surgery.Crown lengthening is an invaluable tool for the restorative dentist in the management of short clinical crown heights. This procedure, as an adjunct to a holistic restorative treatment plan, can produce predictable results, whilst ensuring good aesthetics and maintaining periodontal health. Crown lengthening procedures are invaluable where toothwear or lack of supragingival tooth substance would render full coverage restoration difficult. Gaining access to subgingival caries for strategic abutments can also be achieved in this way. In certain instances, excessive gingival show or inharmonious gingival margin levels can be aesthetically managed with crown lengthening procedures. Clinical Relevance: Knowledge of crown lengthening techniques, and where these might be prescribed, may be a useful addition to practitioners' treatment planning options, or to decide when referral may be more appropriate.",M2
