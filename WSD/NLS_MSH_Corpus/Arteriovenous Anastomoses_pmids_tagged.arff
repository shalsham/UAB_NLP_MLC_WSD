19340793,"Amplatzer vascular plug for arteriovenous hemodialysis access occlusion: initial experience.PURPOSE: The Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AVP; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN) is a recently developed self-expanding metallic device indicated for peripheral vascular embolizations. Herein, we describe use of this device in the treatment of vascular complications related to arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas and grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA compliant retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with informed consent waived. Six patients with problematic arteriovenous access underwent access occlusion using the AVP. Procedure indications included vascular steal syndrome in five patients, and enlarging vascular aneurysms in one patient. Contraindications for surgical correction were determined by the referring surgeon. AVP embolizations were performed using devices oversized by 50% introduced through vascular sheaths positioned within vein segments just beyond the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. Noninvasive evaluation of the involved extremity was performed pre- and post-embolization in addition to clinical follow-up examinations. Measured outcomes included success of angiographic occlusion, improvement in distal arterial flow, AVP number, AVP diameter, time to access occlusion, and clinical symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Technical success was 100%, with complete arteriovenous access occlusion accomplished in all cases, with an average of 1.5 AVPs used per patient. Mean time to access occlusion was 19.3 minutes. Angiographic improvement in distal arterial flow was immediately evident and resolution of clinical symptoms occurred in all patients, with mean long-term follow-up of 16 months. No procedure-related complications were encountered. CONCLUSION: The Amplatzer Vascular Plug provides a minimally invasive and efficacious method for embolization of problematic arteriovenous hemodialysis access.",M1
17585214,"Effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia on arteriovenous shunt flow in the lower limb of diabetic patients without autonomic neuropathy.BACKGROUND: Failure of sympathetic nerve control caused by diabetic neuropathy results in vasodilation of arteriovenous shunts. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the function of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> was disordered in mild diabetic patients without apparent neuropathy, and that volatile anesthetics opened arteriovenous shunts more greatly in nondiabetic patients than diabetic patients. METHODS: Autonomic system function was assessed by cardiovascular reflex tests. Arterial-venous oxygen content difference (A-VDeltaO2) and partial oxygen pressure index (Pvo2/Pao2, the ratio of oxygen tension in femoral vein blood to that in femoral artery blood) were measured before and during isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia in 16 diabetic and 22 nondiabetic patients. Skin temperatures of the foot and leg were measured in 14 diabetic and 15 nondiabetic patients using thermography before and during anesthesia. RESULTS: Pvo2/Pao2 before anesthesia was significantly higher in diabetic patients. In nondiabetics, venous oxygen content significantly increased and A-VDeltaO2 markedly decreased during anesthesia, but these parameters were unchanged in diabetics. Foot temperatures were higher in diabetics before anesthesia, and increased gradually and significantly in both groups during anesthesia, but with a greater increase in nondiabetic patients. Induction of anesthesia caused a larger decrease in leg temperature in diabetics than in nondiabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients have a higher Pvo2/Pao2 and a small core-to-peripheral temperature gradient before anesthesia, suggesting latent dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, even in the absence of autonomic neuropathy. Volatile anesthesia opens the arteriovenous shunt in nondiabetics to a greater extent than in diabetic patients.",M1
17128380,"[Does interventional therapy prolong the patency of hemodialysis fistulas and grafts?]PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate procedural success and patency after endovascular treatment of acute dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas and grafts in a non-preselected patient cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 185 angiographies of hemodialysis fistulas and grafts on the upper extremities were analyzed for 120 patients (53 male, 67 female; mean-age 63.1 +/- 11.4, range 24 - 91). 70 % (n = 130) were native arteriovenous fistulas, 17 % (n = 31) were prosthetic grafts, and 13 % (n = 24) were non-specific. In total, 278 lesions requiring endovascular treatment were detected. 13 % (n = 35) of the lesions were located in the arterial inflow, 18 % (n = 49) in native <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>, 7 % (n = 19) in prosthetic grafts and 62 % (n = 171) in the venous outflow. The primary, secondary and cumulative patency after endovascular treatment was calculated. RESULTS: In 51 % (n = 94) of the cases endovascular treatment could be performed, in 8 % (n = 14) no lesion requiring treatment was detected, and in 42 % (n = 77) intervention was not considered possible. In 45 % (n = 124) of the detected lesions endovascular treatment was successful, in 18 % (n = 51) the intervention failed, and in 37 % (n = 103) intervention was not considered possible. The complication rate was 5 % (n = 10). The primary, secondary, and cumulative patency rates for 50 % of the hemodialysis fistulas and grafts after endovascular treatment were 65, 191, and 370 days, respectively. The results differed significantly from each other with p &lt; 0.05 in the log rank test and log rank trend test. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of acute dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas and grafts is effective in restoring the patency for hemodialysis.",M1
16716612,"A modified technique of delayed basilic transposition - initial results.The radiocephalic wrist fistula remains the  gold standard  for primary vascular access placement according to NKF -DOQI guidelines. However, liberal inclusion criteria for dialysis therapy, as well as increasing longevity and prevalence of diabetes, have led to an increased number of patients with distal vessels unsuitable for vascular access creation. Another available location, and one used with increasing frequency, is the anterior cubital fossa. <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in this location leads to the development of two possible vascular accesses: cephalic and basilic. The basilic vein needs to be transposed to the anterior aspect of the arm. However, this procedure is technically difficult and carries a high risk of complications, often associated with axial torsion or kinking of the transposed vein during placement in the subcutaneous tunnel. The authors propose a simple technical modification which minimizes the risk of these complications. The main advantage is the prevention of axial torsion and kinking, as well as avoiding venous stenosis by transecting the vein at its widest point.",M1
12566978,"Perivascular endothelial implants inhibit intimal hyperplasia in a model of arteriovenous fistulae: a safety and efficacy study in the pig.Vascular access complications are a major problem in hemodialysis patients. Native arteriovenous fistulae, historically the preferred mode of access, have a patency rate of only 60% at 1 year. The most common mode of failure is due to progressive stenosis at the anastomotic site. We have previously demonstrated that perivascular endothelial cell implants inhibit intimal thickening following acute balloon injury in pigs and now seek to determine if these implants provide a similar benefit in the chronic and more complex injury model of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. Side-to-side femoral artery-femoral vein anastomoses were created in 24 domestic swine and the toxicological, biological and immunological responses to allogeneic endothelial cell implants were investigated 3 days and 1 and 2 months postoperatively. The anastomoses were wrapped with polymer matrices containing confluent porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE; n = 14) or control matrices without cells (n = 10). PAE implants significantly reduced intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic sites compared to controls by 68% (p &lt; 0.05) at 2 months. The beneficial effects of the PAE implants were not due to differences in the rates of reendothelialization between the groups. No significant immunological response to the allogeneic endothelial cells that impacted on efficacy was detected in any of the pigs. No apparent toxicity was observed in any of the animals treated with endothelial implants. These data suggest that perivascular endothelial cell implants are safe and reduce early intimal hyperplasia in a porcine model of arteriovenous anastomoses.",M1
12185224,"Elbow fistulas using autogeneous vein: patency rates and results of revision.BACKGROUND: The provision and maintenance of vascular access remains a major cost to end stage renal failure programmes. There are few reports regarding the surgical revision of the failing native elbow arteriovenous fistula (AVF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed on all patients identified from the hospital vascular access database as having undergone construction of an autogeneous vein elbow AVF. Over a seven year period 282 autogeneous vein AVFs were fashioned in 232 patients using the brachial artery as the in-flow conduit. Of these 208 were brachiocephalic fistulas, or a variant thereof, and 74 were fashioned using the transposed autologous basilic vein (136 male: 96 female; median age 60 years, range 14-94 years). RESULTS: Of 282 elbow fistulas 197 were successfully used for dialysis (70%). Cumulative primary patency of elbow fistulas using autogeneous vein in this series was 68%, 54%, and 44% at one, two, and three years respectively. A further 34 revision procedures were performed on 28 fistulas to maintain fistula function, and cumulative secondary patency after surgical revision was 75%, 60%, and 46% at one, two, and three years. Overall 21 out of 34 procedures (62%) successfully restored fistula function and cumulative primary patency of the revised fistulas was 56% at one year. Eighteen AVFs (brachiocephalic, n=12; autologous basilar vein, n=6) required revision for access dysfunction secondary to a short stenoses within 4 cm of the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. Of these 18 AVFs eight were revised by excision of the stenosed segment and either primary anastomoses of the two cut ends of arterialised vein or reanastomoses of the proximal venous limb proximally on the brachial artery. In another nine fistulas the excised segment was replaced with a short interposition graft (polytetrafluoroethylene, n=7; native basilic vein, n=1; bovine carotid artery, n=1). One fistula with postanastomotic stenoses and a more proximal needle site stenoses was revised using two vein patches. Overall 100% were patent at 24 hours, 13 provided successful dialysis (72%), and cumulative primary patency was 67% and 50% at six months and one year respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Successful surgical revision of failing native elbow fistulas can restore patency and improve cumulative secondary patency with potential benefits in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. These results compare favourably to published patency rates after fistula salvage using interventional radiological techniques.",M1
12022036,"Different types of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> between femoral artery and vein distal to the island groin flap.An experimental study was done in rats in which the animals were randomly divided into four groups. Each group included bilateral standard island groin flaps. The right side flap was used as control. On the left side, after elevation of the flap, different types of arteriovenous connections were constructed distal to the pedicle between the femoral artery and vein. The connection type was a type-C (end-to-end) anastomosis in Group 1; a type-X (side-to-side) anastomosis in Group 2; a type-T a (artery-end-to-vein-side) anastomosis in Group 3; and a type-Tv (vein-end-to-artery-side) anastomosis in Group 4. Flow values in the flaps were measured externally and repeatedly using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Extremity changes, signs of congestive heart failure, flap weights (measured at the end of the study), thrombosis at the anastomosis or distal to it, edema in the flaps, subcutaneous venous stasis, and aneurysm formation in the anastomoses were observed. Histopathologic evaluations were also done. Only the side-to-side anastomosis group showed any aneurysm formation in the distal vein, as well as extremity changes and signs of congestive heart failure in some of the animals. Only the artery-end-to-vein-side group showed distal thromboembolism in some animals. All flaps survived, but there was prominent edema in the flaps of Group 2 and Group 4 animals in decreasing order. All the study flaps demonstrated subcutaneous venous stasis and capsule formation. The authors concluded that although any arteriovenous communication located distal to the pedicle of an island skin flap that connects the arterial to the venous system, bypassing microcirculation, may have some beneficial effects, it is not devoid of some possibly hazardous developments, including edema formation and venous stasis.",M1
10081319,"[Aneurysm as a complication of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> for hemodialysis]Angioaccess procedures for hemodialysis over a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the frequency of aneurysm complications. A total of 571 angioaccess procedures were performed including 88 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. 1.24% autogenous fistulae and 5.7% ePTFE grafts had uncomplicated aneurysm. Complicated (thrombosis, bleeding, infection) aneurysm occurred in 5.2% autogenous fistulae and in 5.7% PTFE grafts. The authors recommend a surgical repair of all angioaccess-associated aneurysms in the time of uncomplicated occurrence. If the aneurysm is complicated, the risk of the function lose of the av shunt by surgical therapy increase.",M1
9461110,"Surgical salvage of failed radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae: techniques and results in 29 patients.From August 1987 through February 1995 we performed 42 surgical procedures in 29 patients with occluded or stenotic radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae. Operations were designed to preserve native veins for cannulation (Group I) or to preserve access in the same forearm, bypassing the failed fistula (Group II). For 27 procedures in 22 Group I patients, cumulative primary patency was 70%, 57%, and 47% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. A subgroup of patients was identified, however, in whom excellent results could be reliably predicted. Among 19 hemodynamically stable patients with mature fistulae amendable to more proximal <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>, cumulative primary patency was 100%, 81%, and 67% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Secondary patency for 17 such patients was 100%, 89% and 89% for these same intervals. In Group II only two of ten patients required use of other access sites (9 1/2, 18 1/2 months). We believe that all occluded or stenotic radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae should be considered for surgical salvage. Excellent results can be predicted for (1) hemodynamically stable patients with (2) mature fistulae that (3) fail near the arterial anastomosis and are (4) amendable to new more proximal arteriovenous anastomoses.",M1

If it is possible from the anatomical and functional aspect, they connect the superficial venous vessels to the arterial ones by means of a perforating vein. If the blood vessels of the forearm are of poor quality, they use this procedure as the primary approach. After two years the group of 38 established fistulas comprises 87% which can be completely used and none of them had to be modified.",M1

The method is suitable for case when the autologous circulation is exhausted and calls for perfect peroperative evaluation of the vascular system of the patient with subsequent careful monitoring of the function of the anastomosis.",M1
8183045,"Nd:YAG laser-welded canine <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.This preliminary report describes formation of femoral arterio-venous fistulas (n = 10) in six dogs using a 1.32-microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser welding technique. Stay sutures (6-0 polypropylene) were placed at 5-7 mm intervals along the anastomoses for vessel apposition. Delivery of laser energy through a 400-microns diameter fiber optic was controlled by a new computer-based software system. At 3 mm distance above the anastomosis, energy fluences of 110-260 J/mm2/cm length of anastomosis were used for laser welding. One or two additional hemostatic sutures were required in seven of the ten anastomoses. Flow was maintained for 1-2 hours prior to tissue harvesting. No thrombosis or delayed anastomotic failures were observed after initial welding and repair. Histologic examination revealed good apposition and adherence between wall layers and a fibrinous coagulum at the intimal junctions. Mild thermal injury of the wall was present at some anastomoses. This early investigation suggests that a 1.32 microns Nd:YAG laser welding technique can successfully create large vessel arteriovenous fistulas in the canine.",M1
2076752,"Constriction of porcine <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> by indorenate is unrelated to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C or 5-HT1D receptor subtypes.The study concerns the effects of indorenate, a tryptamine derivative with antihypertensive properties as well as high affinity for the 5-HT1A binding site, on carotid haemodynamics in anaesthetized pigs. Intracarotid infusions of indorenate (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 10 min each) caused dose-related decreases in total common carotid artery blood flow due almost exclusively to a reduction in arteriovenous anastomotic flow. These effects of indorenate were not appreciably modified after treatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.a.), but were markedly reduced after treatment with methiothepin (1.0 mg.kg-1 i.a.), which antagonizes not only 5-HT2 receptors, but also the putative 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D subtypes of 5-HT1-like receptors. Nonetheless, metergoline (1 mg.kg-1 i.a.), a drug with higher affinity than methiothepin for the above 5-HT1 receptor subtypes, failed to significantly modify the responses to indorenate. It is therefore concluded that, like 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), indorenate reduces both total common carotid and cephalic arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow in the pig by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors; these receptors, however, do not seem to correspond to either 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C or 5-HT1D binding sites.",M1
2095105,"[Arteriovenous anastomosis in nasal cavities using microcorrosion technique]In the present study the morphology of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the nasal area are analyzed using the microcorrosion technique. This technique calls for perfusion of the vascular system, passing through the left ventricle, with Batson's of the vessels. For the first time in the microcorrosion study of the nasal vascular network human fetuses (from the 12th to 24th week of intrauterine life) obtained from spontaneous abortions were used as well as rats weighing from 250 to 300 gr. The animals were anesthetized with sodium thiopental prior to administration of the resin. A specimen containing the facial muscles, the nasal pyramid, the maxillary bone and the palatine bones was excised. Then, from this specimen the nasal septum and the two lateral portions of the nose were obtained. The bony and soft perivascular tissues were removed by placing the casts in an aqueous 20% KOH solution. Finally the corrosion cases were observed under a scanning electron microscope (EM). Within the nasal cavities the microcorrosion technique makes it possible to identify three different vascular layers: superficial, intermediate and deep. In the latter it proved possible to visualize the two types of arteriovenous anastomoses: i.e. simple and complex. On the basis of both vascular course and the impressions left by the endothelial cell nuclei it proved possible to differentiate between the arterial and venous portions of the anastomoses.",M1
2353378,"Cavernous vein arterialization for vasculogenic impotence. An animal model.We designed acute and chronic animal models to evaluate a new procedure of arterialization of the cavernous vein. In the acute study, arteriogenic impotence was induced in 6 dogs by bilateral ligation of the penile arteries just proximal to the crus of the penis. The cavernous vein and penile artery were anastomosed proximal to the site of ligation, and the pudendal vein was ligated proximally to prevent the diversion of arterial blood away from the penis. Erection was induced either by electrostimulation of the cavernous nerves or by intracavernous injection of papaverine, and the erectile response was studied before and after cavernous vein arterialization. Four dogs were followed up for two months to evaluate the long-term effects of the procedure. Shortly after arterialization of the cavernous vein, the basal flow rate in the internal pudendal artery increased dramatically to almost six times the control rate, and the erectile response to neurostimulation was approximately 85 percent of control. Selective pudendal arteriography at two months confirmed the patency of all <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. However, scanning electron microscopy and histologic examination revealed sinusoidal damage most probably consequent to the chronically elevated arterial flow.",M1

3312648,"Argon laser-welded <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.This study compared the healing of laser-welded and sutured canine femoral arteriovenous anastomoses. Arteriovenous fistulas 2 cm in length were created bilaterally in the femoral vessels of 10 dogs and were studied at 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 3), and 8 (n = 3) weeks. In each animal, one anastomosis (control) was closed with running 6-0 polypropylene sutures, and the contralateral anastomosis (experimental) was sealed with an argon laser (0.5 watt, 4 minutes of exposure, 1830 J/cm2/1 cm length of anastomosis). At removal all experimental anastomoses were patent without hematomas, aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination at 4 weeks revealed that laser-welded anastomoses had less inflammatory response and almost normal collagen and elastin reorientation. At 8 weeks sutured anastomoses had significant intimal hyperplasia whereas laser repairs had normal luminal architecture. Tensile strength and collagen production, measured by the synthesis of hydroxyproline and the steady-state levels of type I and type III procollagen messenger ribonucleic acids, at the anastomoses and in adjacent vein and artery specimens were similar in sutured and laser-welded repairs at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. We conclude that argon laser welding of anastomoses is an acceptable alternative to suture techniques, with the advantage of improved healing without foreign body response and possible diminished intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic line.",M1

18423447,"Neurovascular pharmacology of migraine.Migraine is a paroxysmal neurovascular disorder, which affects a significant proportion of the population. Since dilation of cranial blood vessels is likely to be responsible for the headache experienced in migraine, many experimental models for the study of migraine have focussed on this feature. The current review discusses a model that is based on the constriction of carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in anaesthetized pigs, which has during the last decades proven of great value in identifying potential antimigraine drugs acting via a vascular mechanism. Further, the use of human isolated blood vessels in migraine research is discussed. Thirdly, we describe an integrated neurovascular model, where dural vasodilatation in response to trigeminal perivascular nerve stimulation can be studied. Such a model not only allows an in-depth characterization of directly vascularly acting drugs, but also of drugs that are supposed to act via inhibition of vasodilator responses to endogenous neuropeptides, or of drugs that inhibit the release of these neuropeptides. We discuss the use of this model in a study on the influence of female sex hormones on migraine. Finally, the implementation of this model in mice is considered. Such a murine model allows the use of genetically modified animals, which will lead to a better understanding of the ion channel mutations that are found in migraine patients.",M2
18060944,"Placental sharing, birthweight discordance, and vascular anastomoses in monochorionic diamniotic twin placentas.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between placental territory and birthweight discordance and vascular anastomoses in monochorionic diamniotic twin placentas from pregnancies that were not complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome with 2 liveborn twins. STUDY DESIGN: Placentas originated from a prospective follow-up study of monochorionic diamniotic twins included in the first trimester. After injection with dyed barium sulphate, a digital x-ray angiography and high-resolution digital photograph were taken. The 2 venous territories were delineated on the angiogram. The diameter of each arterioarterial anastomosis and of each vein that participated in an arteriovenous anastomosis was measured on the digital photograph. Net transfusion over the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> was calculated as the difference between the total venous diameters of the 2 placental parts. RESULTS: One hundred placentas were analyzed. Birthweight discordance increased with placental territory discordance (P &lt; .0001). Arterioarterial diameter (P &lt; .01), net arteriovenous transfusion (P &lt; .001), and total anastomotic diameter (P &lt; .01) increased with placental territory discordance. On the other hand, birthweight discordance for a given placental territory discordance decreased with increasing arterioarterial diameter (P &lt; .01), net arteriovenous transfusion (P &lt; .001), and total anastomotic diameter (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: In unequally shared placentas, the 2 fetal circulations are more tightly linked than in equally shared placentas, which may reduce the birthweight discordance for a given placental territory discordance.",M2
17920601,"Antenatal detection of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in monochorionic twin pregnancy.OBJECTIVES: To revalidate the detection technique for arteriovenous anastomoses in an unselected group of monochorionic twins, and to make recommendations about its applicability for more widespread use. METHODS: Women with monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins were recruited and underwent placental mapping by color Doppler ultrasound. Images of placental maps showing the location and type of anastomoses were saved as digital video clips. After delivery, dye injection study of all the placentas was performed to delineate the site and type of anastomoses. A digital photograph of each injection study was taken and saved. The antenatal ultrasound images and postnatal dye injection studies were compared. RESULTS: 18 sets MCDA twins were evaluated. In 3 cases there was evidence of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Dye injection of 18 placentas revealed 21 arterio-arterial anastomoses (AAA), 21 arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) and 4 veno-venous anastomoses (VVA). Of these, 10 (48%) AAAs and 5 (24%) AVAs were detected antenatally by color Doppler. In all cases, where an AVA was detected, the placenta was located anteriorly. CONCLUSION: Antenatal detection of AVA was feasible when the placenta was located anteriorly, but proved difficult in posteriorly situated placentas.",M2
17763279,"Sequential selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels in twin-twin transfusion syndrome.OBJECTIVE: We have previously described the selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV) technique for the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Because TTTS is thought to result from a net transfer of blood from the donor twin to the recipient twin, we hypothesized that lasering the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> from the donor to the recipient (AVDRs) first (sequential SLPCV or SQLPCV) would result in an improved hemodynamic status and decreased likelihood of intrauterine fetal demise of the donor twin (IUFD-D). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of TTTS was made by ultrasound showing the combined presence of a maximum vertical pocket &gt; or = 8 cm in one sac and &lt; or =2 cm in the other in a monochorionic/diamniotic twin pregnancy. Triplet pregnancies and monoamniotic pregnancies were excluded. Severity of TTTS was assessed using the Quintero staging system. All vascular anastomoses were endoscopically identified and classified as AVDR (AV from donor to recipient), AVRD (AV from recipient to donor), arterio-arterial (AA), or veno-venous (VV). The surgical procedure was coded as SQLPCV if all AVDRs were lasered first. Outcome measures included intrauterine fetal demise and perinatal survival. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three TTTS patients (137 SQLPCV, 56 SLPCV) underwent surgery from May 2003 to August 2005. Gestational age at surgery or at delivery, Stage, patent anastomoses, or persistent/reverse TTTS were not different between the groups. IUFD-D was significantly lower in the SQLPCV than in the SLPCV group (7.3% vs 21.4%, respectively, p = 0.005). Dual perinatal survival was significantly higher in the SQLPCV than in the SLPCV group (73.7% vs 57.1%, respectively, p = 0.02), although the incidence of at least one survivor was not different between the groups (90.5% vs 87.5%, respectively). Logistic regression showed SQLPCV, but not placental location, operating time or number of anastomoses to be significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of IUFD-D (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: SQLPCV is associated with a decreased likelihood of IUFD-D and an increased rate of dual survivors compared to SLPCV. SQLPCV represents both an anatomical and functional surgical approach to the laser treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome.",M2
17478619,"Exercise-induced arteriovenous intrapulmonary shunting in dogs.RATIONALE: We have previously shown, using contrast echocardiography, that intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways are inducible in healthy humans during exercise; however, this technique does not allow for determination of arteriovenous vessel size or shunt magnitude. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether large-diameter (more than 25 microm) intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways are present in the dog, and whether exercise recruits these conduits. METHODS: Through the right forelimb, 10.8 million 25-microm stable isotope-labeled microspheres (BioPAL, Inc., Worcester, MA) were injected either at rest (n = 8) or during high-intensity exercise (6- 8 mph, 10-15% grade, n = 6). Systemic arterial blood was continuously sampled during and for 3 minutes after injection. After euthanasia, tissue samples were obtained from the heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. In addition, 25- and 50-microm microspheres were infused into four isolated dog lungs that were ventilated and perfused at constant pressures similar to exercise. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood and tissue samples were commercially analyzed for the presence of microspheres. No microspheres were detected in the arterial blood or tissue samples from resting dogs. In contrast, five of six exercising dogs showed evidence of exercise-induced intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting, as microspheres were detected in arterial blood and/or tissue. Furthermore, shunt magnitude was calculated to be 1.4 +/- 0.8% of cardiac output (n = 3). Evidence of intrapulmonary <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> was also found in three of four isolated lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous human findings, these data demonstrate that intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways are functional in the dog and are recruited with exercise.",M2
17142338,"Direct demonstration of 25- and 50-microm arteriovenous pathways in healthy human and baboon lungs.Postmortem microsphere studies in adult human lungs have demonstrated the existence of intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways using nonphysiological conditions. The aim of the current study was to determine whether large diameter (&gt;25 and 50 microm) intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways are functional in human and baboon lungs under physiological perfusion and ventilation pressures. We used fresh healthy human donor lungs obtained for transplantation and fresh lungs from baboons (Papio c. anubis). Lungs were ventilated with room air by using a peak inflation pressure of 15 cm H(2)O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H(2)O. Lungs were perfused between 10 and 20 cm H(2)O by using a phosphate-buffered saline solution with 5% albumin. We infused a mixture of 25- and 50-microm microspheres (0.5 and 1 million total for baboons and human studies, respectively) into the pulmonary artery and collected the entire pulmonary venous outflow. Under these conditions, evidence of intrapulmonary <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> was found in baboon (n = 3/4) and human (n = 4/6) lungs. In those lungs showing evidence of arteriovenous pathways, 50-microm microspheres were always able to traverse the pulmonary circulation, and the fraction of transpulmonary passage ranged from 0.0003 to 0.42%. These data show that intrapulmonary arteriovenous pathways &gt;50 microm in diameter are functional under physiological ventilation and perfusion pressures in the isolated lung. These pathways provide an alternative conduit for pulmonary blood flow that likely bypasses the areas of gas exchange at the capillary-alveolar interface that could compromise both gas exchange and the ability of the lung to filter out microemboli.",M2
17081605,"Longitudinal blood flow in shared (<e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>) and non-shared cotyledons in monochorionic placentae.OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to quantitate monochorionic twin placental blood flow in vivo through arterio-venous anastomoses (AVA) and corresponding vessels within normal cotyledons. METHODS: The topography of chorionic plate vasculature was mapped using colour Doppler in ten monochorionic diamniotic twin (MCDA) pregnancies. Cotyledonary flow was derived by insonation of chorionic veins draining normal (n=10) and paired control shared cotyledons (n=10). Venous volume flow was calculated from five determinations of vessel diameter and three of time average mean velocity (TAMV). Measurements were repeated every 2-4 weeks from 18 until 32 weeks' gestation. RESULTS: Blood flow through non-shared and shared cotyledons increased with gestation (p&lt;0.0001). Median flow at 28 weeks through shared cotyledons was 16 ml/min (15-21) (median, interquartile range), lower than in shared cotyledons (31, 25-35) (p&lt;0.001), as was median volume flow across gestation calculated as area under the curve (shared cotyledons 126 (122-167), control cotyledons 269 (214-274), p=0.01). However, velocity was similar, with the difference due to smaller vein diameters draining shared compared to normal cotyledons (mean 3.6mm (SD 0.8) vs. 4.5mm (0.8), p=0.004). Ex vivo quantitation of insonated cotyledons and of all cotyledons confirmed the difference in vein diameter in the placentae studied. CONCLUSIONS: Blood flow through shared cotyledons was lower across gestation than through paired normal cotyledons in the placenta studied due to the smaller diameter of the AVA vessels. The size of AVAs rather than simply their presence and direction may contribute to determining transfusional imbalance in monochorionic twins.",M2
16878079,"Smokers have severely disturbed peripheral micro-circulation.AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of smoking a single cigarette on the blood flow rates in capillaries and <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) in light and heavy smokers in: a) the skin fold between the first and second fingers, and b) the pulp of the thumb. METHODS: Five light (10-12 cigarettes/day) and 5 heavy (&gt;20 cigarettes/day) chronic smokers participated (4 men and 6 women, median age 40.5 years). The blood flow rates were measured by the (133)Xenon local washout method (capillaries, skin fold) and the heat washout method (AVAs, thumb pulp), respectively, before, during, and after smoking of a single Prince cigarette (0.9 mg nicotine). RESULTS: The blood flow rate (f) in mL(100 g(min)(-1) [standard error, SE] in skin capillaries of light smokers was 24.4 [9], 8.9 [1.8], and 10.4 [3.3] before, during, and after smoking of one cigarette; in heavy smokers, f was 23.6 [10.9], 16.1 [5.3], and 7.1 [2.9]; f in pulp AVAs of light smokers was 130.6 [14.9], 49.2 [24.8], and 119.7 [20.9] before, during, and after smoking; in heavy smokers, the corresponding results were 134.4 [19.1], 136.2 [13.5], and 143 [15.3]. Thus, the blood flow rate in capillaries of both light and heavy smokers was higher before smoking the test cigarette than previously observed in non-smokers. In light smokers blood flow rate in AVAs decreased during smoking with a factor of 2.6, and it returned to the pre-smoking level immediately after the end of smoking the cigarette. In heavy smokers, f remained unchanged before, during, and after smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have severely disturbed peripheral microcirculation.",M2
16020264,"Angioarchitecture and innervation of the primate anterior episclera.PURPOSE: To investigate the primate episcleral vasculature and its innervation with respect to morphological specializations. METHODS: Serial sections of the anterior episclera of 8 monkey eyes and 20 human eyes were investigated enzyme- and immunohistochemically using antibodies against smooth-muscle alpha-actin (SMA), neurofilament, synaptophysin, substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACHT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter II (VMAT II), as well as the NADPH-diaphorase reaction. <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVA) were quantified. RESULTS: All episcleral vessels including veins showed intense staining for SMA. Capillary loops were only seen in the limbal arcades, not in the episclera itself. Instead, AVA connected the episcleral arteries with the veins, which formed an interlacing vascular network. In the monkey episclera, 4-6/mm2 AVA were found; in the human episclera, 0.5-1/mm2. Numerous nerve endings staining for NADPHd (NADPHdiaphorase) and TH surrounded all episcleral vessels including anastomoses and veins. NPY, VIP, and VACHT-immunoreactive (IR) nerve terminals were less numerous. CGRP and SP-IR terminals were seen both at the vessels and in the intervascular connective tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The episcleral vasculature shows a specialized morphology with absence of capillaries, numerous arteriovenous anastomoses, a muscle-rich venous network, and intense innervation by vasodilative and vasoconstrictive nerves. This might allow regulation of blood flow and volume in the episcleral vessels and Voigt's capillaries for thermoregulation and modulation of episcleral venous pressure and thereby outflow facility.",M2

15376286,"Arteriovenous glomeruli of the human spinal cord and their possible functional implications.A previous investigation of the radiculomedullary vascular distribution of the human spinal cord showed an immediate filling of the peripheral spinal veins during arterial injections. Because the perfused medium, a mixture of latex and India ink, had a sufficient viscosity to preclude capillary passage, an extensive system of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVA) was indicated. The injection of five additional anatomic cadaver spinal cords was undertaken to specifically determine the intraparenchymal position and structure of these AVA. It was found that only cleared and transilluminated longitudinal parasagittal sections adequately showed that the AVA were formed by an extensive array of intricately coiled arteriovenous glomeruli (AVG) that could pass substantial amounts of blood from third order arterial branches to equivalently sized veins, bypassing the capillary bed. The epithelioid structure of these AVG channel walls, coupled with their highly innervated adventitial tissue indicated a possible functional relationship to similar structures found in the ends (digital pads) of mammalian extremities. Stained serial sections of injected cords showed the vascular relations with nerve fibers derived from the intraspinal parenchyma as well as a possible extraparenchymal autonomic fiber source. The numbers and extent of these AVG complexes suggested they might be involved in the remarkable autoregulation of spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) that is impervious to middle range changes in systemic blood pressure. Future research may more accurately determine the functional role of these previously unreported human spinal AVG, particularly in their possible relation to SCBF autoregulation in normal and injured spines.",M2
15291293,"The anatomic variability of the coronary vasculature of the human heart--part II: some anatomical peculiarities of arteriovenous relations.The arteriovenous relations in human heart are, in some instances, different from arteriovenous relations in other parts of the body. The specific relations between cardiac arteries and veins may enable diffusible substances carried through the system of juxta-arterial cardiac veins to influence the regulation of the lumen of the coronary arteries. <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (6% of our 150 cases) permit direct communication between the arteries and veins bypassing the capillary circulation; it is assumed that these anastomoses prevent coagulation of blood in small veins. In cases of arterial occlusion, the myocardium is supplied by veins that allow retrograde vascularization of the myocardium. In 33% of our cases the posterior atrial branches (0.5-1.0 mm in diameter) of the coronary arteries ran through the wall of the coronary venous sinus on their way from the parent vessel, which lay in the coronary sulcus, to the left atrium. In 11% of the cases, the arterial branch that ran through the distal portion of the wall of the coronary sinus was the interatrial branch. The blood flow through the parietal arteries of the venous coronary sinus probably depends on the condition of the muscular layer of the sinus during the phases of cardiac action, and this might be important in the course of certain cardiosurgical procedures.",M2
14738171,"In vivo endoscopic assessment of arterioarterial anastomoses: insight into their hemodynamic function.OBJECTIVE: To assess endoscopically the hemodynamic function of arterioarterial (AA) anastomoses in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and monochorionic selective intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The videotapes of TTTS and IUGR patients undergoing laser surgery between July 1997 and December 2001 were reviewed for the presence of AA anastomoses. The hemodynamic equator was defined as the site within the AA anastomosis with color flashing. AA anastomoses were classified as having unidirectional flow, having bi-directional flow, or being non-functional, depending on whether the hemodynamic equator reached a returning vein to one, both, or neither twin, respectively. TTTS was classified in stages as previously described. RESULTS: AA anastomoses were present in 35/183 (19.1%) of TTTS and in 12/24 (50%) IUGR patients. Of these, the hemodynamic equator was visible in 8/35 (22.8%) TTTS patients (all in stage III, and mostly in atypical stage III) and in 6/12 (50%) IUGR patients (overall 14/47, 29.8%). Of the 14 patients with a visible hemodynamic equator, 13 (92.8%) AA anastomoses showed unidirectional (9/13, 69.2% from the smaller to the larger twin) flow, and only 1/14 (7.1%) showed bi-directional flow. CONCLUSION: The hemodynamic equator is visible in approximately 30% of patients with AA anastomoses. Within this group, most AA anastomoses behave as functional <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>, and the direction of flow can be from the smaller to the larger twin or vice versa. The data suggest a correlation between sonographic findings and placental vascular design, also implying possible interfetal oxygenation differences. Further assessment of the functional behavior of AA anastomoses is warranted to understand the pathophysiology of TTTS and selective IUGR.",M2
14634563,"Monoamniotic-versus diamniotic-monochorionic twin placentas: anastomoses and twin-twin transfusion syndrome.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare monoamniotic-monochorionic and diamniotic-monochorionic twin placentas and to estimate the incidence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome in monoamniotic-monochorionic twin pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the angioarchitecture and cord insertion distance in 24 monoamniotic-monochorionic and 200 diamniotic-monochorionic placentas. RESULTS: Compared with diamniotic-monochorionic placentas, monoamniotic-monochorionic placentas had significantly more arterioarterial anastomoses (20/20 vs 159/200, respectively; P=.013), significantly less opposite <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (10/20 vs 165/200, respectively; P=.002), similar venovenous anastomoses (6/20 vs 46/200, respectively; P=.323), and arteriovenous anastomoses (20/20 vs 187/200 respectively; P=.279) and significantly shorter umbilical cord distances (median [+/-SD], 5.0+/-6.9 cm vs 17.5+/-6.8 cm; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSION: Monoamniotic-monochorionic and diamniotic-monochorionic placentas have different anastomotic patterns. The (virtually) 100% incidence of arterioarterial anastomoses in monoamniotic-monochorionic placentas explains the reason that twin-twin transfusion syndrome rarely occurs in monoamniotic-monochorionic twin pregnancies and predicts that twin-twin transfusion syndrome manifestations are approximately 5 times less often recognized in monoamniotic-monochorionic pregnancies than in diamniotic-monochorionic pregnancies.",M2
12406343,"Reduced skin capillary density during attacks of erythromelalgia implies arteriovenous shunting as pathogenetic mechanism.Erythromelalgia is characterized by burning pain, erythema, and increased temperature in acral skin. The pain is aggravated by warming and relieved by cooling. Increased microvascular arteriovenous shunting in deep dermal plexa has been hypothesized as the pathogenetic mechanism of pain in affected skin, inducing hypoxia during pain attacks. The aim of this study was to quantify skin capillary density in erythromelalgic patients before and after heat provocation, as increased skin temperature should increase the need for nutritive blood supply by the capillaries. Fourteen patients and 10 healthy control subjects were studied using an enhanced technique of computer-assisted analysis of capillary bed morphology and temperature measurements before and after central body heating. The increase in acral skin temperature was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the eight patients where symptoms were induced after heat provocation, compared to asymptomatic patients and healthy control subjects. The number of visible capillaries in a field of view (1.7 mm2) decreased significantly (p = 0.01) in erythromelalgia patients from 105 (62-137) (median with total range) to 89 (49-118) after warming in areas with numerous <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (nail bed region). In symptomatic patients an even more significant reduction was observed (p = 0.01). The capillary size was also significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) from 41.0 (31.5-50.5) (arbitrary units) to 37.3 (33.0-46.0) in symptomatic patients. The change in capillary density in the nail bed area was significantly larger in erythromelalgia patients -17 (-49 to 39) compared to controls 0 (-47 to 13) (p &lt; 0.05), and in symptomatic patients -19 (-49 to -12) compared to asymptomatic patients -8 (-48 to 39) (p &lt; 0.05) and controls (p &lt; 0.01). The reduced skin capillary density after heating is compatible with increased microvascular arteriovenous shunting of blood and a corresponding relative deficit in nutritive perfusion (steal phenomenon) with skin hypoxia, causing the symptoms in erythromelalgia.",M2
11134655,"Functional profile of almotriptan in animal models predictive of antimigraine activity.Almotriptan is a new 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist whose clinical efficacy for the treatment of migraine attacks has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials. We now compare the functional profile of almotriptan (assessed using animal models) with that of sumatriptan. Almotriptan selectively increased carotid vascular resistance in anaesthetised cats after intravenous or intraduodenal administration (ED(100)=11 microg/kg, i.v.; ED(50)=339 microg/kg, i. d.) and in anaesthetised beagle dogs following intravenous administration (ED(50)=116 microg/kg). A study in anaesthetised cats also demonstrated that almotriptan acts by selectively increasing the resistance of the carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> without adversely affecting brain irrigation. In addition, almotriptan inhibited meningeal extravasation produced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in anaesthetised guinea pigs in the dose range of 0.3-3 mg/kg, i.v.

11103520,"The vascular bed in the rabbit ear: microangiography and scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts.The vascular bed of the rabbit ear has been studied with light microscopy, microangiography and scanning electron microscopy of resin casts in a series of 20 ears. The major arteries supplying the ear were the central and rostral auricular branches of the caudal auricular artery. The caudal auricular branch was not observed, except as a small vessel supplying the rostral auricular base. The central auricular branch supplied blood to most of the auricular integument and was surrounded by capillaries extended from those supplying the skin. The periarterial capillaries formed a fine, compact network in the tunica media and were closely related to the central auricular branch. Evidence is presented suggesting that this vascular mechanism has a counter-current heat-exchange function for regulating body temperature. The artery had the well-developed internal elastic lamina and intimal cushions that regulate blood flow at the branching sites. A number of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> were also observed between arterioles and venules, particularly in marginal regions of the ear. The intimal cushions and arteriovenous anastomoses might play an additional role in thermoregulation by regulating local blood flow in the ear.",M2

10898284,"Effects of hyperthermia on uterine blood flow and shunting through uterine <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the late-pregnant ewe.The effect of maternal hyperthermia on uterine blood flow (UBF) through the two main uterine arteries and on the proportion of UBF shunted through uterine arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) was investigated. Eight late-pregnant ewes were exposed to normothermic (22-23 degrees C) or hyperthermic (approximately 39 degrees C) ambient conditions for 8 h. UBF was measured in the left and right uterine arteries using flow probes and microspheres were injected into the uterine artery before, during and after the experimental period. The distribution of microspheres between the uterus and lungs was determined to calculate changes in capillary and AVA blood flows. Hyperthermia produced a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in maternal core temperature (+1.5 degrees C), increase in maternal blood pH (+0.21; P&lt;0.05) and decrease in maternal pCO2 (-16.2 mmHg; P&lt;0.05). Blood flow to the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) remained unchanged during hyperthermia, whereas total UBF and blood flow to the contralateral uterine horn were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05), by 23.1% and 20.8%, respectively, of pre-heat control values. The proportion of UBF shunted through uterine AVAs during hyperthermia was not significantly different from values observed in normothermic ewes (21.9 +/- 0.7%). Mild to moderate hyperthermia in late-pregnant sheep induces respiratory alkalosis and decreases total blood flow to the uterus, brought about by a decrease in blood flow to the uterine horn contralateral, but not ipsilateral to the CL. Heat treatment does not alter the proportion of UBF traversing uterine AVAs.",M2
10716292,"Role of alpha-1 adrenoceptor subtypes mediating constriction of the rabbit ear thermoregulatory microvasculature.An acute in vivo preparation of the microvasculature of the rabbit ear was used to evaluate the functional role of alpha1 (alpha1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in thermoregulatory microcirculation. The effect of alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype blockade on phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction was assessed with the alpha1A, alpha1B, and alpha1D-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists 5-methyl-urapidil (10(-8) M), chloroethylclonidine (10(-5) M), and 8-[2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol[4.5]deca ne-7,9-dione dihydrochloride (BMY7378) (10(-6) M), respectively. The results demonstrated that pretreatment of the ear microvasculature with 5-methyl-urapidil or BMY7378 shifted the phenylephrine concentration-response curve rightward and significantly changed the log of the phenylephrine concentration, causing half-maximum stimulation (EC50) in arterioles (p &lt; 0.05). BMY7378 shifted the phenylephrine concentration-response curve of the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> about 100-fold rightward (p &lt; 0.05). All three alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists eliminated the vasoconstrictive effects of phenylephrine on venules. The results indicate that the ear microvasculature has a heterogenous distribution of alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes. The alpha1A and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes appear to have a greater influence on constrictive function in arterioles, whereas the alpha1D-adrenoceptor is the dominant constrictor of arteriovenous anastomoses. In general, the alpha1-adrenoceptor does not play a major vasoconstrictor role in venules. Chloroethylclonidine, an irreversible alpha1B-adrenoceptor antagonist, induced contractile responses in the ear microvasculature, probably due to its alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist effects. This study extended our understanding of the adrenergic receptor control mechanisms of a cutaneous thermoregulatory end organ characterized by two parallel perfusion circuits providing nutritional and thermoregulatory functions.",M2
10694346,"Placental angioarchitecture in monochorionic twin pregnancies: relationship to fetal growth, fetofetal transfusion syndrome, and pregnancy outcome.OBJECTIVE: We sought to correlate placental vasculature with fetal growth and outcome in monochorionic twins. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-two patients with consecutive monochorionic pregnancies underwent biweekly ultrasonography for determination of fetal growth and well-being. After delivery, blinded placental injection studies delineated vascular anastomoses and territory share. Degree of balance in <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> equaled the number of arteriovenous anastomoses in one direction minus the number in the other. RESULTS: Pregnancies affected by fetofetal transfusion syndrome (n = 21) had numbers of arteriovenous and venovenous anastomoses that were similar to those in pregnancies without fetofetal transfusion syndrome but fewer arterioarterial anastomoses (P &lt;.0001). Fetofetal transfusion syndrome occurred in 78% of pregnancies with &gt;/=1 arteriovenous and no arterioarterial anastomoses. Birth weight discordancy correlated with placental territory discordancy (P &lt;.0001) and the degree of balance in arteriovenous anastomoses (P =.004). The larger placental share twin had a greater growth velocity than its smaller placental share co-twin (P =.008) for all but one anastomotic pattern. Where arteriovenous anastomoses were aligned with the net venous outflow to the fetus with the smaller territory, co-twins had similar birth weights and growth velocities irrespective of placental share. Fetal survival was higher in pregnancies with an arterioarterial anastomosis (P =.01) but lower with a venovenous anastomosis (P =. 01). Survival of both fetuses was inversely associated with birth weight discordancy (P &lt;.0001). CONCLUSION: Although interrelationships among the various types of anastomoses are complex, our data suggest that the placental territory share and the pattern of arteriovenous anastomoses influence fetal growth, that arterioarterial anastomoses protect against fetofetal transfusion syndrome, and that venovenous anastomoses reduce perinatal survival.",M2
10528349,"[Vascularization of the cerebral cortex]Three levels are described for the study of cortical blood vessels: the main leptomeningeal arteries and veins, the fine pial network and the intracortical vessels. If the main leptomeningeal arteries and veins are well known, the functional anatomy of the fine cortical blood supply is still obscure. Pial arteries and veins form a dense superficial network. The anastomoses between arteries and between veins are numerous but no <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> were found. Numerous smooth vascular formations are suspected into the vascular walls and would regulate the pial (and intracortical) blood flow. The intracortical network is divided into arteries, veins and capillaries. Five types of arteries and veins are described according to their degree of intracortical penetration. The capillary network may be described into four layers according to their density. The lay-out of arteries and veins and their branching would allow to suspect three types of intracortical flows. Intracortical vascular units were also described each composed of a central vein surrounded by peripheral arteries. No arterial or venous anastomoses were found in the cortex whereas precapillary arteriovenous shunts would be suspected. Vascular deformities may be due to aging, are present in the cortex and in the subcortical region.",M2
10455274,"Pharmacological evidence that alpha1-and alpha2-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction of carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in anaesthetized pigs.Vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses may be involved in the therapeutic action of acutely acting anti-migraine agents, including the triptans and ergot alkaloids. While 5-HT1B/1D receptors mediate the effect of triptans, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine also interact with alpha-adrenoceptors. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors in mediating vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs. Ten minute intracarotid infusions of phenylephrine (1, 3 and 10 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or BHT 933 (3, 10 and 30 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) produced dose-dependent decreases in total carotid and arteriovenous anastomotic conductances; no changes were observed in the capillary fraction. The carotid vascular effects of phenylephrine and BHT 933 were selectively abolished by prazosin (100 microg kg(-1), i.v.) and rauwolscine (300 microg kg(-1), i.v.), respectively. The responses to phenylephrine and BHT 933 were not affected by the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935 (500 microg kg(-1), i.v.). These results show that both alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors can mediate vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs. Since vasoconstrictor activity in this in vivo model is predictive of anti-migraine activity, an agonist activity at particularly the alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes, in view of their less ubiquitous nature, could provide migraine abortive potential. Thus, the present results may aid further understanding of the mode of action of some current anti-migraine agents and may eventually be helpful in the development of future treatment in migraine.",M2
10385240,"Investigation of the role of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the sumatriptan-induced constriction of porcine carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.1. It has previously been shown that the antimigraine drug sumatriptan constricts porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses via 5-HT1-like receptors, identical to 5-H1B/1D receptors. The recent availability of silent antagonists selective for the 5-HT1B (SB224289) and 5-HT1D (BRL15572) receptor led us to further analyse the nature of receptors involved. 2. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized, bilaterally vagosympathectomized pigs, sumatriptan (30, 100 and 300 microg kg(-1), i.v.) dose-dependently decreased carotid arteriovenous anastomotic conductance by up to 70+/-5%. 3. The dose-related decreases in carotid arteriovenous anastomotic conductance by sumatriptan (30, 100 and 300 microg kg(-1), i.v.) remained unchanged in animals treated (i.v.) with 1 mg kg(-1) of BRL15572 (maximum decrease: 72+/-3%), but were significantly attenuated by 1 mg kg(-1) (maximum decrease: 30+/-11%) and abolished by 3 mg kg(-1) (maximum decrease: 3+/-7%) of SB224289. The highest dose of SB224289 did not attenuate the hypertension, tachycardia or increases in carotid blood flow induced by bolus injections of noradrenaline (0.1-3 microg kg(-1), i.v.). 4. The results indicate that sumatriptan constricts porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses primarily via 5-HT1B, but not via 5-HT1D receptors.",M2
10192543,"Hints of a functional connection between the neuropeptidergic innervation of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> and the appearance of epithelioid cells in the rabbit ear.Peripheral blood flow can be regulated by specialized vessel segments, the arteriovenous anastomoses. Their wall consists of a relatively thick layer of smooth muscle cells and so-called epithelioid cells. The epithelioid cell is a specialized myogenic cell phenotype expressing nitric oxide synthase. We studied the innervation of the different segments of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear using antisera against neuropeptide Y, tyrosine hydroxylase, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, as well as neuron-specific enolase, calbindin D and neurotubulin. The participation was especially examined of neuropeptidergic innervation and a possible morphological connection to the occurrence of epithelioid cells and a paracrine function. The NADPH diaphorase reaction and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunoelectron microscopy served to distinguish epithelioid cells from smooth muscle cells. Using conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found the most dense innervation pattern of pan-neuronal markers (neurotubulin, neuron-specific enolase), tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve fibres and neuropeptidergic nerve fibres (neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P) around the intermediate segment in arteriovenous anastomoses, whereas the venous segment was barely marked. Single nerve fibres penetrated into the medial layer and reached the epithelioid cells. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we found intercellular contacts between epithelioid cells, but not the gap junction protein connexin 43. Here, we report for the first time a correlation of the innervation pattern with epithelioid cell type in arteriovenous anastomoses. Our findings suggest that epithelioid cells of the arteriovenous anastomoses are controlled by a dense network of neuropeptidergic nerve fibres in functional connection to their paracrine role as a nitric oxide producer.",M2
10070133,"Perfusion of the human finger during cold-induced vasodilatation.We have investigated the effect of severe local cooling on the vasomotor activity of the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) and other finger vessels. The right third finger was subjected to local cooling (3 degrees C) for 30-45 min in 21 healthy, thermoneutral subjects. Blood velocity in the third finger arteries of both hands was simultaneously recorded using ultrasound Doppler, and skin temperature and laser-Doppler flux from the pulp of the cooled finger were also recorded. The results demonstrate that the initial cold-induced vasoconstriction during severe local cooling involves constriction of the AVAs as well as the two main arteries supplying this finger. During cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD), the maximum velocity values were not significantly different from those before cooling. Furthermore, the velocity fluctuations in the cooled finger were in most subjects found to be synchronous with the velocity fluctuations in the control finger. This indicates that the large blood flow to the finger and the high skin temperature during CIVD are caused by relaxation of the smooth muscle cells of the AVAs.",M2
9804258,"Vascular anatomy of monochorionic placenta in relation to discordant growth and amniotic fluid volume.The objective of this study was to determine the chorionic plate vascular anatomy of the monochorionic (MC) placenta in relation to the discordance in fetal growth with or without disparity in amniotic fluid volume. In 58 MC placentae, anastomoses were delineated by dye-contrast injection under optimal physiological conditions. Thirty-two pregnancies were complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) (n = 32), of which 16 placentae were from severe disease. Ten pregnancies with fetal growth discordance of &gt;20% and with a normal amniotic fluid index (AFI) were also studied. Sixteen uncomplicated MC pregnancies were used as controls. Severe TTTS placentae (median, m 1; range, r 0 to 2) had significantly fewer anastomoses than those from mild disease (m 2; r 1 to 4; P &lt; 0.01), discordant growth (m 3; r 2 to 6; P &lt; 0.001) and controls (m 5; r 2 to 8; P &lt; 0.001). Placentae from severe TTTS had a single unidirectional deep arteriovenous anastomosis, while milder cases, in addition, had a &lt; or = 1 mm bidirectional superficial arterioarterial (n = 9) or venovenous (n = 6) -type shunts. Multiple <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> with a paucity of superficial anastomoses were detected in discordant growth placenta. In contrast, control placentae had multiple shunts which were symmetrical in number, type and size both overall and per placenta. The subchorionic distance in severe TTTS and discordant growth placenta were comparable (m 3.5 cm; r 1.6 to 5.8 cm versus m 3.6 cm; r 2.5 to 5.7 cm), but were greater than the mild disease (m 2.5 cm; r 1.2 to 3.8 cm; P &lt; 0.01) and control groups (m 1 cm; r 0.5 to 2.4 cm; P &lt; 0.001). The perinatal mortality in severe TTTS (57%) was higher than that in the mild TTTS (17%) and growth discordant groups (15%). The paucity of superficial anastomoses with presence of solitary or multiple arteriovenous anastomoses is likely to be associated with severe TTTS and fetal growth discordance of &gt;20% respectively. In contrast, in mild TTTS additional superficial arterioarterial or venovenous channels are present along with single deep arteriovenous anastomoses.",M2

9750007,"Porcine carotid vascular effects of eletriptan (UK-116,044): a new 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with anti-migraine activity.It has been suggested that opening of cephalic <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> may be involved in the headache phase of migraine. Indeed, a number of acutely acting anti-migraine drugs, including the ergot alkaloids and sumatriptan, constrict porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. In this study, using pentobarbital anaesthetised pigs, we investigated the effects of eletriptan, a close structural analogue of sumatriptan, on the distribution of common carotid artery blood flow into arteriovenous anastomotic and nutrient (capillary) fractions. Eletriptan (10, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 microg kg(-1), i.v.) decreased the total carotid blood flow, exclusively by decreasing cephalic arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow; nutrient blood flow, particularly to the ear, skin and fat, was significantly increased. The doses of eletriptan needed to reduce arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow and conductance by 50% (ED50) were, respectively, 117+/-21 microg kg(-1) (251+/-45 nmol kg(-1)) and 184+/-42 microg kg(-1) (396+/-91 nmol kg(-1)); the highest dose caused reductions of 84+/-3% and 77+/-4%, respectively. The eletriptan-induced changes in carotid haemodynamics were clearly attenuated by pretreating the pigs with the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935 (0.5 mg kg(-1)). On the basis of these results, we conclude that (1) the eletriptan-induced constriction of cephalic arteriovenous anastomoses as well as the arteriolar dilatation in head tissues is predominantly mediated by 5-HT1B/1D receptors, and (2) eletriptan should be effective in aborting migraine headache. Clinical studies have already demonstrated its therapeutic action in migraine patients.",M2
9733346,"Endogenous nitric oxide influences arteriovenous anastomosis adrenergic tone in the conscious rabbit ear.The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the control of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) has not been studied in vivo in a thermoregulatory end organ. In this study, the effect of local inhibition of NO synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on the microvasculature in the rabbit ear (n=12) was observed in vivo through a chronically implanted ear microvascular chamber. Ear cutaneous blood perfusion (CBP), total auricular arterial flow (TAF), and ear temperature were monitored simultaneously with the direct microvascular observations. Results revealed that intrafacial artery infusion of L-NAME produced significant vasoconstriction of arterioles, AVAs, and venules (p &lt; 0.05). A decrease of ear blood perfusion also was demonstrated by changes of CBP, TAF, and surface temperature. The data provide evidence that basal generation of NO influences the vascular resistance in the thermoregulatory end organ. Moreover, endogenous NO production may be more important in regulating the AVA flow than is flow in other parts of the rabbit ear microvasculature. The effects of NO inhibition on ear microvasculature were not abolished by superior cervical ganglionectomy, indicating that NO production in the rabbit ear is not a neurally mediated mechanism. Further study with a short-term rabbit ear preparation showed that inhibition of NO production with L-NAME enhanced microvascular constrictive responses to extraluminal application of norepinephrine. NO thus appears to play a role of basal vasodilator in opposition to the basal adrenergic vasoconstrictor tone in the rabbit ear.",M2
9721025,"BMS-181885, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor ligand, in experimental models predictive of antimigraine activity and coronary side-effect potential.Many acutely acting antimigraine drugs have the ability to constrict porcine <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> as well as the human isolated coronary artery. These two experimental models seem to serve as indicators, respectively, for the therapeutic and coronary side-effect potential of the compounds. Using these two models, we have investigated the effects of BMS-181885 (3-[3-[4-(5-methoxy-4-pyrimidyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-5-(1,2-dioxo-4-me thyl-3-cyclobuten-3-yl)amino-1H-indole), a 5-HT1B/1D receptor ligand. In anaesthetised pigs, BMS-181885 (10, 30, 100 and 300 microg kg(-1)) decreased the total carotid blood flow and conduction, exclusively at the expense of the arteriovenous anastomotic fraction as the capillary fraction did in fact increase. The highest dose (300 microg kg(-1)) produced a reduction of 52+/-6% from the baseline arteriovenous anastomotic flow. When carotid haemodynamic changes after a single 100 microg kg(-1)dose of BMS-181885 or sumatriptan were studied at different time-points, BMS-188185 had a longer duration of action. Both BMS-181885 (pD2:7.9+/-0.1; Emax:9+/-3% of the contraction to 100 mM K+) and sumatriptan (pD2:6.3+/-0.1; Emax:28+/-8% of the contraction to 100 mM K+) contracted the human isolated coronary artery. The above results suggest that (i) the longer-lasting vasoconstrictor action of BMS-181885 on porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses may be related to its reported slow dissociation from 5-HT1B/1D receptor, and (ii) BMS-181885 should be able to abort migraine headaches in patients. It will be interesting to find out whether these properties are clinically important so that the drug exhibits less headache recurrence and coronary side-effects than sumatriptan.",M2
9687003,"The antimigraine agent alniditan selectively constricts porcine carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> via 5-HT1B/1D receptors.In previous studies, we have shown that several 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, including sumatriptan, potently constrict porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. This effect seems to be of high predictive value for antimigraine activity. In the present experiments, we studied the effects of a new non-indole 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, alniditan, on systemic and carotid haemodynamics in anaesthetised pigs. In control animals, no significant changes in either systemic or carotid haemodynamics were observed after four consecutive i.v. injections of physiological saline (0.5 ml each, every 20 min; n = 4). On the other hand, i.v. doses of alniditan (3, 10, 30 and 100 microg kg(-1) in 0.5 ml saline, every 20 min; n = 6) dose-dependently decreased total carotid conductance (maximum change: -31 +/- 6%) by a selective vasoconstrictor action on arteriovenous anastomoses (maximum change: -72 +/- 5%); the nutrient vascular bed dilated in response to alniditan (maximum change: +103 +/- 39%). The dose of alniditan that decreased arteriovenous anastomotic conductance by 50% was 24 +/- 8 microg kg(-1) (64 +/- 20 nmol kg(-1)). Alniditan produced a slight bradycardia (maximum change: -4 +/- 1%) and a more pronounced hypotensive effect (maximum change: -23 +/- 5%). In six animals pre-treated with the potent and selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, GR127935, the alniditan-induced changes in carotid haemodynamics were clearly antagonised, whereas the bradycardia and hypotension remained unaffected. These results suggest that alniditan selectively constricts porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses mainly via 5-HT1B/1D receptors and should be able to abort migraine headaches. The latter has indeed been confirmed in initial clinical studies in man.",M2

Sterile surgical technique was used (with pentobarbital sodium anesthesia) to equip rats with a jugular catheter and a blind-ended thermocouple reentrant tube next to the carotid artery. Tail skin and core temperature were measured with thermocouples during experiments. Tail skin blood flow was monitored with a laser Doppler flowmeter, and tail total blood flow and volume were measured with plethysmography. After baseline data were collected, saline, NPY (16, 32, 64, and 128 microg/kg), [Leu31 Pro34]NPY (63.25 microg/kg), or NPY[13-36] (44.7 microg/kg) was administered intravenously. Tail total blood flow, volume, and tail skin temperature increased, whereas tail skin blood flow and core temperature decreased in response to both NPY- and the Y1-receptor agonist [Leu31 Pro34]NPY but not in response to saline or NPY[13-36]. Studies conducted with the use of color microspheres demonstrated that arteriovenous anastomoses are involved in this NPY-induced vasodilation.",M2
9620933,"Innervation of nasal turbinate blood vessels in rhinitic and nonrhinitic children.An immunohistochemical study of the nasal mucosa was done in pediatric patients attending an otorhinolaringology (ORL) clinic. The goal was a comparison between vascular innervation in patients with or without symptoms of chronic rhinitis. All patients had an indication for tonsillectomy prior to their inclusion in this study. Samples were obtained under general anesthesia at the time of programmed surgery and fixed in a paraformaldehyde-picric acid mixture. Cryostat sections were immunostained for the following neuronal markers: protein-gene product 9.5 (PGP), calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and C-terminal peptide of neuropeptide Y (CPON). The following classes of vessels were identified: arteries, sinusoids, veins, and <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs). As shown by immunostaining with the general neuronal marker PGP, each vessel type had a characteristic innervation pattern, differing in the amount of fibers and their distribution within the adventitial and muscle layers. Evaluation of PGP, CPON, and CGRP immunoreactivity patterns indicated that rhinitic arteries and AVAs displayed a richer innervation than did nonrhinitic blood vessels. Quantification of vascular PGP immunostaining confirmed the difference of vascular innervation between nonrhinitic and rhinitic patients. Fibers immunostained by CPON partially accounted for the rhinitic arterial hyperinnervation.",M2

The former but not the latter skin area contains arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). In response to 10 min moderate bicycle exercise, an instantaneous decrease in flow was seen in the thumb pulp followed after about 4.6 min by an increase to resting levels. Blood flow in the skin fold remained constant. The results indicate that the initial reduction in blood flow rate and later increase observed in the finger at the onset of moderate exercise take place in the AVAs and not in the capillaries.",M2
9605562,"Characterization of 5-HT receptors mediating constriction of porcine carotid <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>; involvement of 5-HT1B/1D and novel receptors.1. It was previously shown that porcine cranial arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) constrict to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, as well as sumatriptan and that sumatriptan acts exclusively via 5-HT1B/1D receptors. The present study was devoted to establish the contribution of 5-HT1B/1D receptors in the constriction of AVAs elicited by 5-HT (in presence of 0.5 mg kg(-1) ketanserin), ergotamine and dihydroergotamine in anaesthetized pigs. 2. Intracarotid infusion of 5-HT (2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) and intravenous doses of ergotamine (2.5-20 microg kg(-1)) and dihydroergotamine (3-100 microg kg(-1)) reduced AVA and increased nutrient blood flows and vascular conductances. The vasodilator response to 5-HT, observed mainly in the skin and ear, was much more prominent than that of the ergot alkaloids. 3. Treatment with the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935 (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.v.) significantly attenuated both ergot-induced AVA constriction and arteriolar dilatation, whereas GR127935 only slightly affected the carotid vascular effects of 5-HT. 4. The results suggest that 5-HT constricts carotid AVAs primarily via receptors, which seem to differ from those (5-HT1B/1D) stimulated by sumatriptan. The ergot alkaloids produce AVA constriction for a substantial part via 5-HT1B/1D receptors, but also stimulate unidentified receptors. Both these non-5-HT1B/1D receptors may be targets for the development of novel antimigraine drugs. 5. The moderate vasodilator response to the ergot derivatives seems to be mediated, at least in part, by 5-HT1B/1D receptors, whereas the arteriolar dilatation caused by 5-HT may be mediated by other, possibly 5-HT7 receptors.",M2

The objective of the present study was to determine whether arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) are present in the uterine circulation of conscious, late-pregnant ewes. 2. Twenty late-pregnant ewes were assigned to two groups. In group 1, 15 microm coloured microspheres were injected into the uterine artery of the pregnant horn and the relative proportion of microspheres trapped in the uterus and lungs was determined. The percentage shunting of blood measured by this method was 17+/-3%, representing a blood flow of 164+/-39 mL/min (n = 12). Any contribution of ovarian, cervical, rectal and other vascular beds was specifically excluded in this group. 3. In group 2, total uterine capillary flow was measured using the reference blood flow method, by injecting 15 microm microspheres into the heart. Calibrated flow probes, placed on both main uterine arteries, concurrently measured total uterine blood flow. Total blood flow to the uterus (flow probe) was significantly greater (t = 3.415; P = 0.027) than uterine capillary flow (microspheres), indicating AVA shunting in the uterine circulation. Mean total blood flow to the uterus was 1749+/-160 mL/min, of which an average 25+/-5% (n = 5 sheep) was shunted. 4. The percentage AVA shunting for groups 1 and 2 was not significantly different (t = 1.219; P = 0.24) and, when combined, the mean percentage of uterine blood flow passing through AVA in the late-pregnant sheep was determined to be 19+/-3%. 5. The present study shows that AVA are present and patent in the uterine circulation of late-pregnant ewes and that they account for the shunting of approximately 20% of the uterine blood flow into the maternal venous circulation.",M2
9493116,"<e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> of the episcleral vasculature in the rabbit and rat eye.PURPOSE: To obtain more information about the functional significance of arteriovenous anastomoses as regulatory elements, the authors investigated the topography and innervation of episcleral anastomoses in the rat and rabbit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The topography of arteriovenous anastomoses in the limbal and episcleral vasculature of the rat and rabbit eye was studied by scanning electron microscopy of vascular resin casts. The perivascular distribution of the following neuropeptides was investigated by fluorescence immunohistochemistry: neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (SP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). RESULTS: The episcleral arteriovenous anastomoses connect arterioles directly with the episcleral venous plexus which also drains the aqueous humor. The nerve fiber plexus around the episcleral arteriovenous anastomoses is far more dense than around arteriovenous connections at the limbal arcades. NPY-, VIP-, SP-, and CGRP-immunoreactive fibers concentrate at the arteriolar segment of the episcleral arteriovenous anastomoses and are reduced at the venular segment. Still, numerous VIP-IR fibers are on the venous side of the rabbit episcleral anastomoses. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the elaborated innervation of the episcleral anastomoses is a prerequisite for a subtle modulation of the blood flow and possibly of the aqueous humor outflow dynamics.",M2
9408869,"Twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Three possible pathophysiologic mechanisms.OBJECTIVE: To propose a classification of twin-twin transfusion syndrome based upon three categories of placental anastomotic patterns. STUDY DESIGN: A mathematical model developed to compute fetal blood volume in monochorionic twins combines fetoplacental circulation with net fetofetal transfusion along placental anastomoses. We included (1) unequal cotyledonic sharing, assuming that smaller fractions cause smaller twins with lower blood pressure, and (2) significantly decreasing anastomotic resistance, combining Poiseuille's law with placental anastomotic growth. Fetoplacental compensatory mechanisms were not studied. RESULTS: First, unidirectional <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> produce steadily increasing fetal discordance by small anastomotic blood flow. Second, arteriovenous plus compensating anastomoses (venoarterial, arterioarterial, venovenous) produce fetal discordance followed by a dynamic steady state of minimal net fetofetal transfusion and large anastomotic flow. This circumstance mitigates further discordant growth. Third, unequal cotyledonic sharing plus superficial compensating anastomoses (arterioarterial, venovenous) produce fetal discordance followed by a steady state of equal fetal growth and small anastomotic flow. The model predictions include spontaneous disappearance and reversal of discordance. Serial measurement of fetal growth patterns and anastomotic flow could identify the syndrome's underlying pathophysiology. CONCLUSION: Testing the model predictions by relating clinical presentation with placental anatomy could increase our understanding and direct diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to match the underlying placental anatomy.",M2
9321863,"Local constriction of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the cooled finger.We have examined the influence of local cooling from 35 to 19 degrees C on spontaneous arterial blood velocity fluctuations in the acral skin of thermoneutral subjects. The skin temperature of one hand was gradually lowered in a water bath in two separate experimental runs. Simultaneous continuous blood velocity was measured from the third finger artery of both hands using ultrasound-Doppler. The large blood velocity fluctuations assumed to be caused by synchronous vasomotion of the arteriovenous anastomoses were invariably seen in the control finger artery throughout the two cooling periods, indicating that the subjects were in their thermoneutral zone. The velocity fluctuations on the cooled side remained nearly unchanged and closely correlated with those in the control finger artery during local cooling from 35 to approximately 21.5 degrees C. Below this temperature (range 23-20 degrees C) the velocity fluctuations ceased abruptly, and the velocity was nonfluctuating and continuously low. These results indicate a local thermal level below which there is abrupt, sustained closure of the arteriovenous anastomoses.",M2

MATERIAL: Six normal subjects, seven patients with unilateral, crural intermittent claudication and six patients with unilateral, chronic critical ischaemia. METHODS: Blood flow rates were measured in supine subjects by the heat washout method (the sum of blood flow rate in arteriovenous anastomoses and blood flow rate in nutritive capillaries) and by the 133Xenon washout method (blood flow rate in nutritive capillaries) after local, atraumatic labelling. Measurements were made with (a) the toe passively elevated to 50 cm above heart level, (b) at heart level and (c) passively lowered to 50 cm below heart level. RESULTS: Autoregulation of nutritive blood flow was present in normal subjects and in claudicants, but the local sympathetic veno-arteriolar axon reflex was absent in both groups. In patients with critical ischaemia blood flow rate was the same in the supine position and during lowering in arteriovenous anastomoses and in nutritive capillaries. The arteriovenous anastomoses had distinct and characteristic reaction patterns in response to lowering in each of the three examined groups and to elevation in normal subjects and in patients with intermittent claudication (not measured in patients with critical ischaemia). CONCLUSIONS: The microvascular responses to changes of orthostatic blood pressure differed among the three groups (normal subjects, patients with intermittent claudication, patients with critical chronic leg ischaemia). The heat washout method may be used to detect the functional significance of occlusive atherosclerotic disease.",M2
9050026,"Effects of avitriptan, a new 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist, in experimental models predictive of antimigraine activity and coronary side-effect potential.Several acutely acting antimigraine drugs, including ergotamine and sumatriptan, have the ability to constrict porcine <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> as well as the human isolated coronary artery. These two experimental models seem to serve as indicators, respectively, for the therapeutic and coronary side-effect potential of the compounds. Using these two models, we have now investigated the effects of avitriptan (BMS-180048; 3-[3-[4-(5-methoxy-4-pyrimidinyl)-l-piperazinyl[propyl]-N-methyl-l H-indole-5-methane-sulfonamide monofumarate), a new 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist. In anaesthetized pigs, avitriptan (10, 30, 100 and 300 micrograms.kg-1) decreased the total carotid blood flow by exclusively decreasing arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow; capillary blood flow was increased. The mean +/- SEM i.v. dose of avitriptan eliciting a 50% decrease (ED50) in the porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow was calculated to be 76 +/- 23 micrograms.kg-1 (132 +/- 40 nmol.kg-1) and the highest dose (300 micrograms.kg-1) produced a 72 +/- 4% reduction. In recent comparative experiments (DeVries et al. 1996), the mean +/- SEM ED50 (i.v.) of sumatriptan in decreasing carotid arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow was 63 +/- 17 micrograms.kg-1 (158 +/- 43 nmol.kg-1), with a reduction of 76 +/- 4% by 300 micrograms.kg-1, i.v. Both avitriptan (pD2; 7.39 +/- 0.09; Emax: 13.0 +/- 4.5% of the contraction to 100 mM K+) and sumatriptan (pD2: 6.33 +/- 0.09; Emax: 15.5 +/- 2.3% of the contraction to 100 mM K+) contracted the human isolated coronary artery. The above results suggest that avitriptan should be able to abort migraine headaches in patients, but may exhibit sumatriptan-like effects on coronary arteries. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated the therapeutic action of the drug in acute migraine.",M2
9353554,"Microvascular anatomy of the nose.The microvasculature of the nose consists of: 1) A dense subepithelial network of capillaries, with fenestrations between the endothelial cells. This network provides nutrients to the epithelium and glands, and allows passage of water into the lumen for evaporation and air-conditioning. 2) A system of capacitance vessels or sinuses, which when they distend, block the nasal lumen, and when they empty, open the nasal passages. Changes in their volume will affect the filtering and air-conditioning functions of the nose. 3) <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> which allow rapid passage of blood through the mucosa. They are probably important in air-conditioning, and in the countercurrent mechanisms that tend to keep the brain cool in a hot dry climate. The anatomical interrelationships between these different systems is not well understood, nor is their differential control in terms of actions of mediators and nerves. In neurogenic inflammation sensory nerves are excited and release local mediators such as substance P via axon reflexes. These sensory neuropeptides will cause vasodilatation, vascular congestion and extravasation of liquid from the postcapillary venules, with resultant oedema and exudate. They may also cause secretion from the submucosal glands.",M2

The sections obtained from the fetuses of 10-20-day rats were subjected to the usual processes for examination under the light microscope. Various staining processes were applied on the preparations and the simple and glomus types of AVAs determined in the mesenchyme of fetuses observed to birth every day. The regions with AVAs were then photographed by photomicroscopy and evaluated. From the 10-day embryo to birth, an increase in the smooth muscles in the wall structure of simple anastomoses was observed. It was however very difficult to follow up this increase in glomus anastomoses because the wall structure is more complicated. Their morphology was examined and compared with that in literature.",M2
8942579,"The effect of dexmedetomidine on nutrient organ blood flow.The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine decreases not only heart rate, myocardial contractility, and oxygen demand, but also cardiac output (Q). To investigate whether this reduction in Q could critically impair perfusion of individual organs, we studied the effect of dexmedetomidine on nutrient blood flow to the heart, brain, kidney, spleen, skin, intestine, liver, and <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> using the radioactive microsphere technique. Studies were conducted in 14 dogs with an open chest and anesthetized with either chloralose/urethane (CU) or fentanyl/halothane (FH), to create different baseline conditions. Hemodynamic variables, organ blood flow, arterial and mixed venous oxygen, and lactate content were measured before and after administration of 0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine intravenously (IV). After 10 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine Q decreased in both groups by 50%. The decrease in blood flow varied greatly between the organs. While flow through arteriovenous anastomoses and skin decreased by 70% to 90%, renal blood flow decreased by 30%, cerebral blood flow only when baseline blood flow was high (FH dogs), and left ventricular blood flow only in the CU group, where the largest decrease in hemodynamic variables occurred. Oxygen consumption decreased only in CU dogs, but so did arterial lactate levels. These data indicate that dexmedetomidine causes considerable redistribution of Q, predominantly reducing blood flow to less vital organs and shunt flow.",M2
8945920,"Control of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in rabbit ear model of digital perfusion.The arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) of the cutaneous microcirculation of the hands and feet are fundamental determinants of thermoregulatory blood flow and may be involved in cold intolerance. These direct microvascular studies are an initial characterization of adrenergic receptor subtypes participating in control of AVA in the ears of anesthetized male New Zealand White rabbits. Adrenergic alpha 1-stimulation with phenylephrine produced AVA constriction, whereas terazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist) produced dilation and attenuated the responses to phenylephrine. Adrenergic alpha 2-stimulation with UK-14304 produced constriction of the AVA, whereas atipamezole (an alpha 2-antagonist) produced dilation and attenuated the responses to UK-14304. When equimolar concentrations of antagonists were studied, the AVA dilation produced by alpha 2-blockade was greater than that produced by alpha 1-blockade. Norepinephrine (a mixed alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonist) also produced vasoconstriction, which was attenuated by both prazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist) and atipamezole. In summary, 1) AVA contain a heterogeneous mixture of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors, and 2) alpha 2-receptors may have a greater influence than alpha 1-receptors on overall tone in AVA.",M2

8829179,"In vivo documentation of an arteriovenous shunt in rat pancreatic acinar tissue.With the use of epiilumination fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate for the first time in vivo the existence and function of direct arteriovenous communication (arteriovenous shunt) in rat pancreatic acinar tissue. In eight Sprague-Dawley rats the corpus and tail of the pancreatic gland were reviewed for <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. In seven animals the technique did not allow us to visualize completely the arteriolar and venular vascular system due to overlying pancreatic tissue. In one animal, however, the vascular trees could be identified in their continuity over a length of several millimeters, including an arteriovenous shunt with a diameter of 12.0 microns. Analysis of volumetric blood flow revealed that 86.2% (15.61 nl/min) of the arteriolar blood volume was shunted into the venule, while only 13.8% (2.50 nl/min) of the blood volume was carried by the arteriole distal to the arteriovenous shunt to the nutritive capillary bed. There were no changes in diameter, i.e., vasoconstriction, vasodilation, or vasomotion, over an observation period of 30 min, indicating that, at least under physiological conditions, this arteriovenous communication functioned as a real  fare-through  channel.",M2

Blood flow rate measured by the heat-washout method in the thumb was about 127.5 ml (100 g x min)-1 at heart level in two subjects, (n=10), and in the pulp of the first toe in 6 subjects (n=12) 49.3 ml (100 g x min)-1 at heart level. Above heart level blood flow rate decreased with the falling pressure head, and 50 cm below heart level blood flow remained unchanged compared to heart level. The arterioles supplying the capillaries in this region showed autoregulation of blood flow to 50 cm above heart level, but a veno-arteriolar reflex was not present. Blood flow rate in the ear lobe and on the side of the nose showed a similar pattern of reaction, with a blood flow rate in the arteriovenous anastomoses of about 100 ml (100 g x min)-1 in sitting position.",M2
8736713,"Heat-washout: a new method for measuring cutaneous blood flow rate in areas with and without <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.A new method, the heat-washout method, for measuring total cutaneous blood flow rate is introduced. The measurements were performed with a transcutaneous (tc) PO2-electrode that is capable of heating and measuring local temperature, and it is constructed with a thermostatically controlled cap. The probe was heated electrically to a selected temperature 2-10 degrees above normal skin temperature. When the temperature was stable, the heating element was turned off, and the temperature was registered every 10 s until a stable baseline temperature, Tb, was obtained. Tb was subtracted from the registered temperatures giving deltaTs that were plotted in a semilogarithmic diagram. The heat-washout was monoexponential, and the slope was used for calculating blood flow rate in accordance with the principle of Kety, using a known partition coefficient. The method was applied to the forearm in two subjects, and the results were compared to blood flow rates obtained simultaneously by the 133Xe-washout method in the same area. The equation of the regression line was y = 2.5 + 0 x 968X and the correlation coefficient was 0 x 986 at temperature levels of 37-45 degrees C. In the pulp of the thumb, blood flow rates, in arteriovenous anastomoses, were estimated in two subjects by subtracting the capillary blood flow rate, measured by 133Xe-washout, from the total cutaneous blood flow rate, measured by heat-washout. Due to a relatively low diffusions coefficient for 133Xe compared to heat, 133Xe cannot be used for measurement of blood flow rate in arteriovenous anastomoses.",M2

Due to the topical pretreatment with nitroprusside the complete vasculature including segments of the aqueous humor outflow channels could be visualized. We found that 1-3 mm posterior to the limbus corneae the episcleral vessels form numerous arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) in the size of small arterioles and venules. These AVA are also located at the collector channels near Schlemm's canal and at the episcleral venous plexus which drains the collector channels. It is assumed that the AVA might influence not only the circulation in the episcleral venous plexus but also in the aqueous humor outflow routes.",M2
8623791,"Hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients produce manifestations of fetofetal transfusion syndrome in a computerized model of monochorial twin pregnancy.OBJECTIVE: In spite of recent advances in the assessment and treatment of fetofetal transfusion syndrome, its underlying mechanism remains controversial. We aimed to determine whether the clinical features of fetofetal transfusion syndrome could be explained by unidirectional or bidirectional intertwin transfusion along placental vascular anastomoses. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a dynamic computerized model of monochorial twin fetoplacental units on the basis of numerous interrelated hemodynamic, osmotic, and metabolic physiologic variables. The circulations were then linked by various combinations of direction and number of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. RESULTS: With unidirectional anastomoses disease severity, characterized by disparity in blood solids, depended on donor arterial pressure but not on the number of anastomoses. In the chronic state water movement resulting from raised osmotic pressure in the recipient and reduction in the donor produced hydroosmotic pressure equilibrium, reducing anastomotic flow to near zero. Atrial natriuretic peptide-driven urine production was markedly increased in the recipient because of the raised vascular hydrostatic pressure component. With bidirectional anastomoses recirculation between twins reduced discordancy in colloids and hematocrit, and the clinical picture was determined by the degree of asymmetry in the number of connections. CONCLUSIONS: Severe manifestations of fetofetal transfusion syndrome can be explained by unidirectional intertwin transfusion and lesser degrees by asymmetric bidirectional transfusion.",M2
8631208,"Short-term hemodynamic changes in episcleral <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> correlate with venous pressure and IOP changes in the albino rabbit.In the present study we have determined the effects of acute diameter changes in the recently discovered episcleral arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) on episcleral venous pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP) in the rabbit eye. The pressure was measured in episcleral arterioles, AVA and veins (vascular pressure) with a pressure chamber mounted on the tip of a microendoscope. After constriction of the AVA following topical administration (100 micrograms) of epinephrine we observed a decrease in the episcleral vascular pressure as well as in the IOP. Acute widening of the AVA after topical administration of 5mg nitroprusside led to a significant increase in the pressure of arterioles, AVA, veins and IOP which lasted several min. After 0.5mg topical nitroprusside the blood flow in the AVA increased. No significant effects were seen in the intravascular pressures; the IOP had a tendency to decrease. Experimental lowering of the IOP to 10mmHg caused an increase of vascular diameters and of blood flow in the AVA. It is assumed that-at least in drastic hemodynamic disorders-the degree of the AVA-perfusion might influence aqueous humor outflow and IOP due to changes of the episcleral venous pressure.",M2
8821022,"The biology of the twinning process: how placentation influences outcome.Placentation of twins has important bearing on the fetal development and neonatal outcome. Because of limitation in space of the endometrial cavity, twin placentas frequently collide during their expansion. This may restrict their growth and also lead to a somewhat increased rate of placenta previa. Moreover, abnormal cord insertions such as marginal and velamentous cords are much more frequent in multiple gestation. Absence of one umbilical artery is also much more frequent in twins. The best prognosis is had when two independent placentas develop, the dichorionic separate organs. Fusion of two separate placentas does not lead to vascular anastomoses in human twins, whereas it often does in other species (marmoset, cattle). Blood vessel fusion occurs only in monochorionic twins, all of which are  identical  (monozygotic). Large anastomoses (usually artery-to-artery) allow blood to shift rapidly from one to the other. Thus, when one twins dies, the survivor may quickly exsanguinate into the dead twin, leading to hypotension and occasionally to cerebral palsy. <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> are the basis for the twin transfusion syndrome. This results in severe prematurity and gross discordance of all sorts of physical parameters. Knowing this type of vascular shunts helped develop the prenatal laser obliteration with salvage of the twins. The worst prognosis occurs with the rarest type of placentation in twin, in which both reside in the same cavity. This is the monoamnionic-monochorionic twin placentation. By moving about, the twins often entangle their umbilical cords and some 40% to 50% may die in utero.",M2
7551746,"Identification of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> by duplex ultrasound. Implications for the treatment of varicose veins.BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) may contribute to the etiology of varicose vein disease. Duplex ultrasound has recently assumed a major role in the diagnosis of venous disease. This noninvasive method can serve as a research tool to better elucidate the role of AVA, and as a guide to the treatment of varicose veins. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and location of AVA identifiable by duplex ultrasound in a population with clinically apparent varicose veins due to underlying saphenous vein reflux. METHODS: The presence and location of AVA detected by duplex ultrasound were noted in 510 patients with varicose veins due to Doppler-positive saphenous vein reflux from three private practices. RESULTS: Twenty-six AVA were found in 19 patients (incidence 3.7%), mostly in the distal half of the long saphenous system. AVA were represented equally on both right and left sides, and regardless of previous vein stripping. Three AVA were found at the base of venous ulcers. AVA were more easily detected using higher resolution ultrasound. CONCLUSION: AVA occurring in association with saphenous vein disease and identified using duplex ultrasound are usually found below the knee in the long saphenous system, and sometimes at the base of venous ulcers. Knowledge of their presence and location may help to avert complications of sclerotherapy, and guide the approach to treatment.",M2
8549636,"Carotid blood flow distribution, haemodynamics and inotropic responses following calcitonin gene-related peptide in the pig.The sensory neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of intracarotid infusions of human alpha-CGRP (10, 30 and 100 pmol/kg.min; n = 8), as compared to that of saline (4 times; n = 8) on haemodynamics and blood flow distribution within the carotid circulation of the anaesthetized pig, using the radioactive microsphere method. Furthermore, the effects of antimigraine drugs, dihydroergotamine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.; n = 4) or sumatriptan (300 micrograms/kg i.v.; n = 4), on these parameters were studied in the presence of the infusion of the highest concentration of human alpha-CGRP. Additionally, putative positive inotropic responses to human alpha-CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were investigated in porcine isolated atrial and ventricular trabeculae. Human alpha-CGRP increased carotid artery blood flow and conductance dose-dependently, together with an enhancement in vascular pulsations. These effects were associated with a fall in systemic blood pressure with concomitant increases in heart rate and cardiac output. The increase in carotid blood flow was reflected by an increase in total capillary blood flow, predominantly to extracerebral tissues including the dura, whereas blood flow through <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> remained stable. Both dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan reduced carotid blood flow and its capillary fraction without affecting systemic vascular conductance. In tissues, these drugs reversed blood flow increases due to human alpha-CGRP in most extracerebral tissues, but failed to reduce dural blood flow. In porcine isolated atrial and ventricular trabeculae, noradrenaline (10(-8)-10(-5) M) increased force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, human alpha-CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) failed to increase force of contraction in atrial trabeculae (n = 6) and exerted only a moderate concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in ventricular trabeculae (approximately 25% of the response to 10(-5) M noradrenaline, n = 10). These data indicate that human alpha-CGRP caused arteriolar dilatation together with a fall in blood pressure in the pig. The tachycardia may be reflex-mediated, but the peptide also exerts a moderate positive inotropic action on ventricular trabeculae. The fall in systemic arterial blood pressure and the marked increase in capillary blood flow most likely prevented the opening of arteriovenous anastomoses. Furthermore, the antimigraine drugs, dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan, were able to reverse blood flow changes induced by human alpha-CGRP in the porcine carotid circulation.",M2
7653653,"Effect of local warming on hand and finger artery blood velocities.The effect of local heating on blood velocities in arteries supplying the skin of hand and fingers was studied in subjects kept in their thermoneutral zone. The temperature of one hand was steadily raised from 35 to 43 degrees C in 15 min, whereas the control hand was kept in the air or immersed in a water bath at 35 degrees C. Simultaneous blood velocity recordings from the two hands were made continuously using ultrasound Doppler. In the heated hand, a general rise in blood velocity level was seen. However, the spontaneous fluctuations in blood velocity assumed to be caused by synchronous vasomotor activity of the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) remained unchanged and closely correlated with those in the control hand throughout the experiment. Thus the central nervous control of AVA vasomotion seems to be unaffected by local heating. The elevation of blood velocity in the heated hand is probably due to dilatation of other parts of the vascular bed, e.g., ordinary arterioles in the skin. Earlier investigators, using venous occlusion plethysmography, have reported vasoconstriction in the locally heated human finger. No sign of such heat-induced vasoconstriction was found in this study.",M2
7573987,"Corrosion casting study on the vasculature of nasal mucosa in the human fetus.BACKGROUND: The vasculature of the nasal mucosa in the human fetus so far has not been investigated morphologically by modern techniques. METHODS: Nasal blood vessels were studied in 18-21-week-old human fetuses by corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The general vascular architecture was similar to that described for adult humans, with (1) a dense network of subepithelial capillaries, (2) a mucosal layer of larger vessels, predominantly veins, and (3) large arteries located near the perichondrium. Specific vessel types characteristic of the nasal mucosa and important for its functions in adults, such as cavernous veins or cushion veins, were, however, absent in the fetuses, although probable precursor forms of cushion veins could be observed. The <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> had the form of short bridges, and no tortuous or glomerular anastomoses present in the mature nasal mucosa were found. CONCLUSIONS: The underdevelopment of some vascular areas is postulated to reflect the functional immaturity of the respiratory system in the fetus.",M2
7560759,"A causal relationship between fluctuations in thermoregulatory skin perfusion and respiratory movements in man.The relationship between regular respiration with normal tidal volume and spontaneous fluctuations in blood flow through skin <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) was investigated. Laser Doppler measurements from skin areas known to contain arteriovenous anastomoses, ultrasound Doppler measurements from the radial artery and respiratory movements were recorded simultaneously in 7 supine human subjects in a thermoneutral environment. The phase relationship between respiration and the onset of sudden arteriovenous anastomoses vasoconstrictions was calculated in each subject. A few seconds before a vasoconstriction, there was a clear tendency towards synchrony in the respiration recordings, indicating that some respiration-phase-dependent event precedes the vasoconstrictions. Since arteriovenous anastomoses constrictions are accompanied by specific changes in heart rate and blood pressure, our findings link respiration to low-frequency heart rate and blood-pressure variability in humans.",M2
7560758,"<e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> and the thermoregulatory shift between cutaneous vasoconstrictor and vasodilator reflexes.The reflex changes in skin blood flow which occur in response to various non-thermal stimuli (e.g., deep inspiratory gasps, arousing or painful stimuli, emotional stress) are profoundly influenced by the thermoregulatory state. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the involvement of arteriovenous anastomoses in the thermoregulatory modulation of skin vasomotor reflexes elicited by painful intraneural electrical stimulation and emotional stress (forced arithmetics), respectively. Vasomotor responses were recorded with laser Doppler flowmeters (LDF) placed on glabrous skin containing arteriovenous anastomoses (3rd finger and thenar eminence) and hairy skin which lack them (dorsal side of the first metacarpal bone). In some experiments, a laser Doppler flowmeter emitting laser light of two different wavelengths (infrared and green light) into the same skin site was used to record skin perfusion at different depths of glabrous skin on the thenar eminence. 40 subjects were investigated, both in the cold state (finger skin temperatures below 25 degrees C) and after subsequent warming (finger skin temperatures above 30 degrees C). Thermoregulatory modulation of electrical stimulation- or stress-induced vasomotor reflexes occurred both in glabrous and hairy skin, but hairy skin differed from glabrous skin by showing no significant vasoconstrictions. Relative perfusion changes were most marked in laser Doppler flowmeter recordings using the deeper penetrating infrared light. The results suggest that arteriovenous anastomoses are major contributors to the vasoconstrictor component of vasomotor reflexes in glabrous skin of warm subjects. The reflex increase in perfusion, on the other hand, which occurs in both glabrous and hairy skin of cold subjects may be mediated by resistance vessels.",M2
8655258,"Effects of calcium channel blockers on cold-induced vasodilatation and elevated sympathetic tone in the canine internal maxillary artery bed.This study was concerned with the interactive effects of cold-induced vasodilatation, blockade of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and sympathetic nerve stimulation in the nasal vascular bed of anesthetized dogs. To estimate the distribution of the internal maxillary artery blood flow to capillaries and to <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVA), the microsphere technique in combination with electromagnetic flowmetry was used. Intraarterial infusion of verapamil resulted in a dose-dependent vasodilatation and a redistribution of the internal maxillary artery blood flow. Simultaneously applied electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk resulted in a significant fall in blood flow, caused mainly by a decrease in capillary flow. Verapamil infusion combined with cold exposure led to a simultaneous elevation of the AVA and capillary flows. When electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk was also applied, the AVA and capillary flows were affected in different manners, depending on the sequence of the stimulations. Analysis of capillary flow data in the various nasal and facial tissue compartments indicates that cold exposure, blockade of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and an elevated sympathetic tone modify the local nutritive blood flow.",M2
7658109,"A comparison of the functioning of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and control subjects in response to local hand warming.Little information is available on the functioning of the arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA's) and their involvement in the pathophysiology of cold sensitivity and abnormal thermoregulation in scleroderma. Twenty-four patients with scleroderma and twenty two control subjects were included in an investigation to test the hypothesis of abnormal functioning of AVA's. Cutaneous microcirculatory flow was measured using non-invasive instrumentation (infrared photoplethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry and thermography) which allowed microcirculatory flow to be characterized at different levels, before and after warming of the hand at 40 degrees C for 5 minutes. The sclerodermics showed significantly reduced microcirculatory flow and hand temperatures throughout the investigation indicating the presence of organic vascular structural changes. However, the most striking finding was the reduction in microcirculatory volume in the control hand in contrast to the increase in the sclerodermic hand, on warming. We propose that the decrease in microcirculatory volume in the controls is due to a form of  steal  phenomenon where dilatation of the AVA's allow the shunting of blood away from the capillaries directly into the deeper cutaneous veins. The absence of this response in the sclerodermic group suggests the failure of the AVA's to open on warming. It is likely that the morphological vascular changes may be only partly responsible for the abnormal functioning of the AVA's and that dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, as a consequence of microangiopathy, may also be a contributory factor.",M2
7529927,"The anatomic basis for arteriovenous shunting in human lower leg fascial flaps.Clinical experience has suggested that arteriovenous shunting may occur in fascial flaps.

Deep fascia was harvested from the limbs of nine embalmed cadavers. Small pieces of fascial tissue were studied with the aid of three staining techniques (methylene blue, oil red-O triethyl phosphate, and Gomori's rapid one-stage trichrome technique), which were used to enable the microvascular anatomy to be visualized more clearly. <e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e> proximal to the capillary bed and with an external diameter greater than 50 microns were identified in the suprafascial, subfascial, and intrafascial plexuses but were not found to be a common feature of the microvascular anatomy.

The results of this study establish an anatomic basis for arteriovenous shunting in fascial flaps.",M2
8543081,"Dynamics of external ocular blood flow studied by scanning angiographic microscopy.The scanning angiographic microscope (SAM) provides a solution to the considerable technical difficulties associated with conventional episcleral fluorescein angiography.

Centripetal flow was seen in all 37 scleral perforating arteries investigated. Other features were the marked individual variability, much larger vertical anterior ciliary arteries, the high frequency of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>, the complex flow patterns, the absence of a 'watershed' zone between anterior ciliary and posterior episcleral circulations, a characteristic and discontinuous distribution of 'leaky' episcleral veins, and the primacy of venous drainage into the plexus of muscular veins. Reports of retrograde blood flow in the anterior ciliary arteries in most fluorescein angiographic studies are probably incorrect, the result of unappreciated methodological problems. The SAM is an important advance on previous anterior segment fluorescein angiography techniques.",M2
7843046,"Connection between skin arteriovenous shunt flow fluctuations and heart rate variability in infants.Large, spontaneous fluctuations in blood flow to acral skin, caused by synchronous opening and closing of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs), have been demonstrated in adults in a thermoneutral environment. Individual AVA constrictions were accompanied by a diphasic heart rate (HR) response, indicating the presence of an autonomic rhythm which affected both skin AVA activity and heart rate variability. In the present study, 24 neonates were examined on day 2 (range 1-3 days) and re-examined at 14 weeks (11-17 weeks). The presence of rhythmic, synchronous fluctuations in laser Doppler flux in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot in 20 of 24 neonates strongly indicated the presence of functional skin AVA at birth. Both neonates and 3-month-old infants showed a diphasic HR response in association with cutaneous AVA constrictions. The infant response differed from the adult response mainly by the longer duration of the secondary bradycardia. This may reflect different properties of the baroreceptor reflex in infants and adults.",M2
7525067,"Nitrergic innervation and nitrergic cells in <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.Nitrergic innervation and nitrergic epithelioid cells were studied in arteriovenous anastomoses of the tongue, ear, eye, and glomus organ of the finger in different species (rat, rabbit, dog, and man), by means of immunohistochemistry for nitric oxide synthase and enzyme histochemistry utilizing the catalytic activity of this enzyme (the NADPH-diaphorase reaction). Nitrergic perivascular fibers of the tongue were concentrated along the arterial tree and were maximal at the arteriovenous anastomoses in all species. Generally, fewer fibers were located around comparable segments of the episcleral eye vasculature. Only a few nitrergic fibers were found in the canine and rabbit ear, and in the glomus organ of the human finger; however, epithelioid cells in the tunica media of arteriovenous anastomoses of these organs were NADPH-diaphorase-positive and were moderately immunoreactive for nitric oxide synthase. In the epithelioid cells, the reaction product of the NADPH-diaphorase could also be demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. The epithelioid cells were negative for the panneural and neuroendocrine marker PGP 9.5 confirming the myocytotic nature of these nitrergic cells. Thus, nitric oxide might play a role in mediating the vessel tone of arteriovenous anastomoses via nitrergic nerves or epithelioid cells.",M2
8575398,"The structure, innervation and location of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the equine foot.In the foot of the horse, arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) of epithelioid type occurred in the dermis of the coronary band, in the coronary and terminal papillae, in neurovascular bundles and at the entrance to and along the length of the dermal laminae. A particular feature of the epithelioid segment of AVAs in the horse, compared with that of other species, was the height and surface complexity of many of the endothelial cells. They extended into the lumen, forming undercut and tunnel-like areas which correlated with the characteristic surface marking of AVAs observed in vascular casts. The number of cell organelles, including the concentration of vesicles in the luminal cytoplasm, suggested cells with a high metabolic activity. The luminal surface possessed numerous microvilli and long cytoplasmic cell processes which appeared to surround material in the lumen. The innervation of AVAs was more dense than that of the arteries and consisted of adrenergic and peptidergic nerves. Noradrenaline- and neuropeptide Y-containing nerves were identified as the vasoconstrictor components of the nerve supply and occurred along arteries and formed dense plexuses around AVAs. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are vasodilators and were present in single nerve fibres which accompanied arteries and AVAs along the length of the dermal laminae. In this study the distribution, density and innervation of AVAs in the equine foot are correlated with their proposed role in the development of acute laminitis. The release of vasoactive peptides from diseased organs remote from the foot may induce inappropriate prolonged dilatation of AVAs and thus contribute to the laminar ischaemia of acute laminitis.",M2
8019774,"Inhibition of nitric oxide biosynthesis and carotid arteriovenous anastomotic shunting in the pig.1. The role of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis in the regulation of blood flow through <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> was evaluated in the carotid circulation of the anaesthetized pig. For this purpose, the effect of intracarotid (i.c.) administration of the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME: 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg-1; n = 6) or saline (n = 6) was studied on the distribution of common carotid blood flow, using the radioactive microsphere method. 2. Apart from the highest dose, L-NAME caused no major changes in the systemic haemodynamic variables. Both cardiac output and systemic vascular conductance were reduced by L-NAME (1 mg kg-1), being reversed partly by L-arginine (100 mg kg-1, i.c.). In both groups, L-arginine slightly reduced mean arterial blood pressure. 3. Total common carotid artery blood flow as well as its distribution over the capillary and arteriovenous anastomotic fraction remained stable after saline injection. In contrast, L-NAME caused a dose-dependent decline in common carotid artery blood flow and conductance and this decline was confined entirely to its arteriovenous anastomotic part. 4. Subsequent intracarotid injection of L-arginine (100 mg kg-1) reversed the reduction in total carotid conductance almost completely and that in the arteriovenous anastomotic region partially. Additionally, L-arginine increased capillary conductance significantly in the L-NAME--as well as the saline-treated animals. 5. These results indicate that the L-arginine-NO pathway contributes little to the regulation of tissue perfusion in the porcine carotid circulation. In contrast, NO seems to play an important role in shunting arterial blood through arteriovenous anastomoses in the anaesthetized pig.",M2
8277978,"NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester: systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics, tissue blood flow and arteriovenous shunting in the pig.The effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, on systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics, and tissue as well as arteriovenous anastomotic blood flows were investigated in the anaesthetized pig, using simultaneous injections of radioactive microspheres of two different sizes (diameter: 15 and 50 microns). L-NAME (1, 3 and 10 mg.kg-1) reduced systemic and pulmonary artery conductance and cardiac output, but heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure remained unchanged. L-arginine reversed the systemic and pulmonary haemodynamic changes induced by L-NAME. As detected with 15 microns microspheres, L-NAME (1 and 3 mg.kg-1) decreased tissue blood flow to and vascular conductance in the eyes, lungs, atria, kidneys, adrenals and liver. Furthermore, the difference between blood flows simultaneously measured with 15 and 50 microns microspheres, which can be equated to blood flow through <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> with a diameter between about 28 and 90 microns, was reduced by L-NAME (3 mg.kg-1) in the skin of head and gluteal regions and, as indicated by the microsphere content of the lungs, in the total systemic circulation. These results suggest that in the anaesthetized pig (i) NO is involved in the regulation of both systemic and pulmonary vascular conductance, (ii) the decrease in systemic vascular conductance is in part due to constriction of systemic arteriovenous anastomoses, and (iii) the decrease in pulmonary vascular conductance, leading to reduction of cardiac output, seems to negate the expected rise in arterial blood pressure observed, for example, in rats and rabbits following inhibition of NO-synthesis.",M2
8226482,"On the preservation and regulation of vascular tone in <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> during anesthesia.In conscious pigs, arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) are in a constricted state so that &lt; 5% of intra-atrially injected radioactive (15-microns-diam) microspheres are shunted to the lungs. Many of the anesthetic regimens frequently used in cardiovascular research dilate AVAs, thereby greatly increasing the percentage of microspheres reaching the lungs. This may seriously limit extrapolation of results obtained under anesthesia to the conscious state. We now describe that anesthesia with a combination of fentanyl and thiopental preserves the tone of AVAs, maintaining shunting under 4% of cardiac output. Furthermore, we studied in the carotid circulation of this model whether norepinephrine or 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), both contained in perivascular nerves, is responsible for this tone. Consecutive antagonism of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, 5-HT1, and 5-HT2 receptors was obtained by sequential injection of prazosin, phentolamine, ketanserin, and methiothepin. Prazosin increased AVA blood flow, partly at the expense of extracerebral tissue blood flow, but preserved cerebral blood flow. None of the other antagonists had any additional significant effect. Therefore, in this model the tone in AVAs seems to be maintained by sympathetic norepinephrine-containing nerves via alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",M2
8514703,"Distribution of blood flow in the perfused tracheae of sheep: a search for <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.The possible existence of arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) in the tracheobronchial circulation has been largely ignored; however, their presence would have many implications. Here we have searched for AVAs in the tracheal circulation of seven anesthetized sheep that were ventilated through a low cervical tracheostomy. Arteries to the midcervical trachea were isolated and perfused in situ at systemic blood pressure; blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. A vein draining the perfused segment was cannulated. Radiolabeled microspheres (16 microns diam) injected into the arterial inflow of the perfusion indicated the distribution of blood flow (cervical trachea, 69.9 +/- 4.55% (SE); esophagus, 15.1 +/- 3.9%; connective tissue and blood vessels near trachea, 9.5 +/- 1.8%; lymph nodes, 4.0 +/- 2.2%; skeletal muscle, 0.17 +/- 0.07%; trachea below intubation, 0.00%; larynx, 0.00%; other tissues 0.81 +/- 0.32%). Less than 0.6% of the activity was detected in the tracheal venous blood and lungs, indicating little shunting via AVAs. Within the trachea, blood flow (per wet weight of tissue) to the mucosa overlying smooth muscle was approximately 25% of that to the mucosa overlying cartilage. Intra-arterial infusion of methacholine doubled perfusion blood flow without altering the proportion of shunted blood. Within the trachea, blood flow increased most to the mucosa overlying smooth muscle and to smooth muscle. In conclusion the contribution of AVAs to total blood flow in the cervical trachea is &lt; 1%.",M2
8475746,"A search for <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in human skin using ultrasound Doppler.The possible existence of arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) in skin regions of the head and thorax has been investigated using the synchronous vasomotion of the AVAs. Simultaneous pairs of blood velocity recordings were made using pulsed, bidirectional Doppler ultrasound. In each pair of registrations, blood velocity was recorded in a reference artery supplying a skin area known to contain AVAs (the radial artery) together with one of four other arteries investigated, i.e. the facial artery, the angular artery, the temporal artery, and the cutaneous branches of the lateral thoracic artery. The typical large, regular fluctuations in blood velocities caused by synchronous vasomotion in the AVAs in the skin of the hand and fingers were observed invariably in the radial artery. Similar flow variations were found in the angular artery. The fluctuations in this and the radial artery were, in turn, found to be synchronous. However, we have not been able to find the flow pattern characteristic of AVA vasomotion in the temporal artery or in the cutaneous branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These results show that the skin area of the nose supplied by the angular artery contains AVAs. These AVAs partly may explain the important role of face skin in temperature regulation. These results also support the earlier assumptions that there are no or very few AVAs in the skin areas supplied by the temporal artery and the cutaneous branches of the lateral thoracic artery.",M2
1330188,"Lack of effect of the antimigraine drugs, sumatriptan, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine on arteriovenous anastomotic shunting in the dura mater of the pig.1. In anaesthetized animals, the antimigraine drugs, sumatriptan, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, reduce carotid arteriovenous anastomotic shunting. Within the carotid vascular bed <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> are located, amongst other places in the dura mater, which is a putative site of the pain during a migraine attack. 2. In this investigation, we have localized and measured the arteriovenous shunting within the carotid vascular bed of the pig by using simultaneous intracarotid injections of radiolabelled microspheres of three different sizes (10, 15 and 50 microns), which provides an index of blood flow via arteriovenous anastomoses larger than approximately 14, 27 and 90 microns diameter, respectively. The effects of sumatriptan (0.3 mg kg-1), ergotamine (0.02 mg kg-1), dihydroergotamine (0.1 mg kg-1) and saline were studied by repeating the injections of 15 and 50 microns spheres after the treatments. 3. There was no difference in shunting or entrapment between the 10 and 15 microns microsphere, indicating the absence of arteriovenous anastomoses with a diameter between 14 and 27 microns. 4. Arteriovenous anastomoses with a diameter between 27 and 90 microns, as indicated by the difference in blood flow measured by 15 and 50 microns spheres, were located in the dura mater, ears, skin, fat and, to a lesser extent, in the skeletal muscles and eyes. 5. Sumatriptan, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine reduced the overall flow in the smaller arteriovenous anastomoses (diameter between 27 and 90 microns), and even more in larger shunts (wider than 90 microns). 6. Locally, blood flow in the smaller arteriovenous shunts was reduced in the skin and fat, but not in the dura mater, ears, eyes and muscles.It is not possible to determine in which tissues blood flow in the larger arteriovenous anastomoses was reduced.7. Tissue blood flow measured with 15 gm microspheres remained unchanged after the three antimigraine drugs, implying a lack of effect on capillary flow.8. It is concluded that in the anaesthetized pigs the only evident effect of these antimigraine drugs on carotid haemodynamics is a decrease in blood flow in both smaller and larger arteriovenous anastomoses;the smaller arteriovenous anastomoses were affected in the skin and fat, but not in other tissues.",M2
1938724,"Effects of invariant sympathetic activity on cutaneous circulatory responses to heat stress.This study investigated the role of sympathetic withdrawal on blood flow responses in cutaneous <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) and capillaries to direct and indirect heat stress. This was achieved by clamping sympathetic activity (SC) to the tail of anesthetized rats so that constrictor tone remained invariant during exposure of either the animal's tail (direct heating) or body (indirect heating) to a 35 degrees C environment. Flow through the AVAs in the tail was evaluated by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF), while capillary flow was investigated by videodensitometry measurements of blood cell velocity (CBV) in single capillaries within the subepidermal vascular plexus. Both direct and indirect heating significantly increased LDF and CBV. In comparison to blood flow responses in sham-operated control rats, the SC procedure resulted in significantly lower LDF responses to both direct and indirect heat stress. By contrast, the response of CBV was not significantly affected by SC during either mode of heating. These results indicate that the withdrawal of sympathetic constrictor tone plays a role in the response of cutaneous AVAs, but not precapillary arterioles, to direct as well as indirect heat stress. Additional studies on unanesthetized animals showed that superimposing body heating on a base of local heating elicited a further increase in LDF, suggesting that local heating does not deplete neural mediated dilatory reserve.",M2
1682351,"The time course of the development of the sympathetic innervation of the vasculature of the rat tail.The development of the sympathetic innervation of the tail vasculature in the rat has been examined using catecholamine fluorescence and immunohistochemical techniques to demonstrate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The tail was found to be largely devoid of noradrenergic terminals at birth. At the earliest ages, axons within nerve trunks and paravascular axon bundles showed high levels of catecholamine fluorescence, but this virtually disappeared as the innervation of the effectors was achieved. The perivascular plexus on the caudal artery was established over the first six postnatal weeks along a rostrocaudal gradient which was retained in the adult, i.e. proximal regions were more densely innervated than distal ones. The innervation of the rest of the vasculature developed relatively late during this period, with the exception of the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> present in the distal half of the tail. These became innervated about 10 days earlier than the adjacent caudal artery at the same levels, and received a much denser innervation in the adult. At all developmental stages, distributions of TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibres were identical to those seen with catecholamine fluorescence. The sequence of development suggests that the different vascular targets are innervated by subsets of sympathetic neurons having the same neurochemistry but developing independently.",M2

The test evaluates rapid reflex changes in skin blood flow at the finger tip where there are abundant <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> with dense sympathetic innervation. Indirect body heating was employed in all subjects to induce central vasodilation and to obtain stable comparable finger tip blood flows prior to stimulus. The reflex vasoconstriction which occurs following inspiratory gasp and contralateral hand cold challenge was quantified and its reproducibility investigated on three separate occasions in 20 young subjects. The variability in responses both within and between young subjects was small. The test was applied to 10 diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy and to 10 age-matched control subjects. Vasoconstrictor reflexes were significantly lower in the diabetic group (p less than 0.005) with responses lower than 2 SD from the mean for age-matched controls. In conclusion, the test provides an assessment of focal autonomic damage which can be applied to other regions of the body rich in arteriovenous anastomoses and may have application in clinical studies investigating autonomic activity.",M2
2134889,"[Three-dimensional study of the microvascular network in the excretory end portion and the excretory ducts system of dog parotid gland]The purpose of this study was to undertake a three-dimensional analysis of the microvascular network of the glandular body and the excretory ducts system of the dog parotid gland using microcorrosive resin casting technique and examined under scanning electron microscope. Results were as follows: 1. Contributed to the direct injection of the resin through the papilla of parotid, not only the excretory ducts but also the striated ducts, intercalated ducts and the end portion were completely filled with resin, thus enabling the fabrication of the intact casts. 2. One of the advantages of the present method was the ability to distinguish the each portion of the excretory ducts system based on the resin casts surface appearance of the different structure of the wall of the lumen. 3. Within the glandular body arteries, veins and excretory ducts vessels were found running their course through the connective tissue, finally emerging through the hilus of lobules into the lobules. However, several arterioles and venules, besides of running through the hilus, directly terminated at the capillary network in lobules. 4. No <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVAs) were found in the lobules. However, AVAs were observed between the arterioles and venules distributed in the connective tissue around the lobules. 5. A large number of venous valves were observed in the veins immediately emerging from the hilus of lobules and also in the veins within the connective tissue of the gland. 6. Observing the vascular network of excretory ducts system, there was no proper vascular network belong to the intercalated ducts, however, on the striated ducts, one layer of the vascular network composed of dense capillaries was identified. Confluencing with each other, the diameter of excretory duct increased and its vascular network consist of two layers of vascular network of which inner layer was a dense capillary network similar to the striated ducts, the outer layer was a loose network composed of arterioles and venules. In the main excretory duct, these two layers of the vascular network were composed completely. 7. Some AVAs were observed in the arteriole and venule network around the main excretory duct.",M2
2260532,"Three-dimensional cytoarchitecture of the media of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the rabbit ear.Arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear were examined with scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the structural differentiation of the media of the shunt. Arterial, intermediate, and venous segments in the shunt and two layers of the media in the intermediate segment were differentiated based on cell shape and cell organization. In the arterial segment, smooth muscle cells were spindle-shaped, either elongated or short, with a few branches, and were arranged circularly or diagonally with respect to the vessel's long axis. There were also stellate muscle cells with radiating processes. In the intermediate segment, the smooth muscle cells of the outer layer of the media were also arranged circularly and resembled the elongated cells in the arterial segments, but they were more irregular in shape and had more processes than those of the arterial segment. The epithelioid cells of the inner layer of the media were oval or polygonal and oriented irregularly with respect to the vessel's long axis, clustering to form longitudinal plicae. The smooth muscle cells of the venous segment were flat with many lateral processes and formed a thin, discontinuous layer. The smooth muscle cells in the arterial segment and those of the outer layer of the intermediate segment exhibited a highly rugged surface texture, indicating their strong contractility; the epithelioid cells and the smooth muscle cells in the venous segment exhibited a generally smooth surface, indicating less contractility. The intermediate segments were supplied with a dense nerve plexus. The intermediate segments, therefore, may be actively involved in the regulation of blood flow under neuronal influence.",M2
1977433,"Redistribution of cardiac output caused by opening of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> by a combination of azaperone and metomidate.The effects of the butyrophenone, azaperone 5 mg kg-1 i.m. alone and after addition of the imidazole derivative metomidate 6 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in eight conscious pigs. Fifteen minutes after administration of azaperone, systemic arterial pressure was reduced by 35% as a result of a 45% increase in systemic vascular conductance and 10% decrease in cardiac output (Q). After azaperone, 23% of the radioactive labelled microspheres (15 (SD 1) microns) injected into the left atrium were detected in the lungs as a result of opening of arteriovenous anastomoses (baseline 3%). The increase in arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow was at the expense of the nutritional (= capillary) channels. Flow to the brain was maintained, but that to the left ventricle decreased in parallel with the reduction in arterial pressure. Vascular conductance of most other organs, except the skin, increased or was maintained. The addition of metomidate had no effect on Q because an increase in stroke volume (by 30%) compensated for the decrease in heart rate. Systemic vascular conductance decreased, most noticeably in the brain, left ventricle and skeletal muscle. We conclude that azaperone alone and in combination with metomidate had only a moderate effect on Q, but caused a redistribution in favour of arteriovenous anastomoses.",M2

A comparison of arterial and venous components of the mandibular rete revealed considerable arterial branching and <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. Although the small arteries of bowhead retia contained the same layers found in nonretial arteries, several distinctive morphologic features were evident. These included wide separation by collagenous connective tissue and small size of individual smooth muscle cells of the tunica media. These myocytes also contained considerable perinuclear glycogen and communicated minimally with adjacent myocytes by small foot-like cytoplasmic appendages as well as branching of basement membranes. Ganglia-like neural plexuses were observed within the tunica media of arterial retia. Endothelial cells lining the intima demonstrated loose peripheral edges which frequently projected into the vessel lumen, and these cells rested upon a subjacent layer of reticular fibers. It is known for some species that the retial supply to the brain in whales largely supplants an internal carotid arterial supply and that the spinal cord is supplied by retia. The physiologic role of the bowhead mandibular retia remains unknown. The retia mirabilia of cetaceans are considered as one of the morphologic adaptations which modulate hemodynamics during diving and resurfacing. The morphologic features of these vessels in the bowhead whale, as revealed by electron microscopy, appear to reflect the capability to respond in a slow but sustained manner to diving, and the large glycogen deposits may help sustain vascular myocyte metabolism during prolonged submersion.",M2

The AVAs were identifiable in the newly hatched chick, but they were extremely simple. The number of cell layers in the wall of the AVAs increased from two at hatching to four to five in the 5-month-old chickens. The density of the AVAs increased significantly during posthatching maturation. Cold acclimation of the chickens increased the density of AVAs by a factor of 2.1-3.2. Daily heat exposure also increased the density of AVAs significantly in the eyelids but had no effect in the other skin areas.

2801013,"[A scanning electron microscopic study on the <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> of rabbit ear using corrosive resin casts]Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) partake in the regulation of blood flow, and although it has been speculated that AVAs in the rabbit ear play a major role in the regulation of the body temperature, no documented work is available on the structural characteristics of AVAs in the rabbit ear. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the frequency of AVAs and their structural characteristics by using the vascular corrosive resin casts and further examination under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This method permitted not only the visualization of a three-dimensional view of AVAs, but also depicted a clear differentiation between AVAs and arterioles or venules. Within the vascular architecture of rabbit ear, three distinctive vascular layers could be identified. The frontal and dorsal epithelial vascular layers are distributed underneath the epithelium and formed with nearly all capillaries, and the intermediate vascular layer which is established with main arteries, veins and their branches. The AVAs were observed in all three vascular layers, although various venous valves were concentrated primarily in the intermediate vascular layer. In tabulating the frequency of appearance of AVAs, the mean number was 81.5 per centimeter square. The mean number of AVAs in each of the three vascular layers was 31.1 in the frontal layer, 17.1 in the intermediate layer and 33.1 in dorsal layer, respectively. The vasculature of rabbit ear was further anatomically divided into tip, middle and root portions. The mean number of AVAs in each portion, from the tip to the root was 112.9, 49.4 and 84.4, respectively. Several essential types of AVAs were observed, such as the S-shaped and similar forms which were the predominate type. Others observed were U-shaped, straight, Y-shaped and tri-branching types. Most AVAs within the intermediate vascular layer, consisting of a few small vessels which were mainly capillaries and venules, connected to the anastomosing portion of AVA. The high occurrence and strategic location of AVAs in the rabbit ear strongly suggest that AVAs in the rabbit ear partake in thermal regulation.",M2
2758221,"Reduction of cephalic arteriovenous shunting by ergotamine is not mediated by 5-HT1-like or 5-HT2 receptors.1. The potent, antimigraine drug ergotamine has affinity for both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 binding sites and constricts <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>. Since 5-HT also constricts arteriovenous anastomoses (mainly via 5-HT1-like receptors), this study investigates the involvement of 5-HT receptors in the ergotamine-induced reduction of arteriovenous shunting in the carotid circulation of the cat and pig. 2. In the cat, ergotamine (3, 10 and 30 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) reduced carotid blood flow, predominantly by a reduction in arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow. Pretreatment with ketanserin (0.5 mg kg-1, i.v.) or methiothepin (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) did not antagonize the effects of ergotamine. 3. In the pig, ergotamine (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) also reduced carotid blood flow and arteriovenous shunting, which was not affected by pretreatment with methiothepin (1 mg kg-1, i.v.). 4.

2922411,"Blood flow distribution with adrenergic and histaminergic antagonists.Superficial fibular nerve stimulation (SFNS) causes increased pre- and post-capillary resistances as well as increased capillary permeability in the dog hind paw. These responses indicate possible adrenergic and histaminergic interactions. The distribution of blood flow between capillaries and <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> (AVA) may depend on the relative effects of these neural inputs. Right hind paws of anesthetized heparinized dogs were vascularly and neurally isolated and perfused with controlled pressure. Blood flow distribution was calculated from the venous recovery of 85Sr-labeled microspheres (15 microns). The mean transit times of 131I-albumin and 85Sr-labeled microspheres were calculated. The effects of adrenergic and histaminergic antagonists with and without SFNS were determined. Phentolamine blocked the entire response to SFNS. Prazosin attenuated increases in total and AVA resistance. Yohimbine prevented increased total resistance, attenuated the AVA resistance increase, and revealed a decrease in capillary circuit resistance. Pyrilamine attenuated total resistance increase while SFNS increased capillary and AVA resistances. Metiamide had no effect on blood flow distribution with SFNS. The increase in AVA resistance with SFNS apparently resulted from a combination of alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptor stimulation but not histaminergic effects.",M2

Both GR43175 (30-1000 micrograms/kg intravenously) and ergotamine (0.3-30 micrograms/kg intravenously) caused a dose-dependent reduction in the proportion of cardiac output passing through arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). However, unlike GR43175, the effect of ergotamine (30 micrograms/kg intravenously) was associated with marked increases in diastolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. In further studies, the effect of GR43175 on the distribution of blood flow within the carotid bed has been examined. GR43175 caused a reduction in total carotid arterial blood flow which was entirely due to a reduction in flow through carotid AVAs. These results demonstrate that GR43175, unlike ergotamine, has a highly selective vasoconstrictor action on AVAs within the cranial circulation of anaesthetized cats. Such a mechanism may be important in its antimigraine activity.",M2

Testosterone levels, oxygen tension and the degree of acidity were measured in arterial and venous blood vessels of scrotally and abdominally located testes. Haemoglobin oxygen saturation was derived from the oxygen dissociation curve. Blood flow to abdominal and scrotal testes and epididymides was measured using the radioactive microsphere technique. Average blood flow to the scrotal testes and epididymides was 21 and 8 ml/min, respectively, in normal pigs. In unilaterally cryptorchid pigs average blood flow to the scrotal testis and epididymis was 23 and 6 ml/min, respectively, and to the abdominal testis and epididymis 4.2 and 1 ml/min. In pigs with bilateral scrotal testes oxygen consumption was 16 mumol O2/min/100 g. In unilaterally cryptorchid pigs oxygen consumption by the scrotal testis was 18 mumol O2/min/100 g, compared with 10 mumol O2/min/100 g by cryptorchid testes. From the percentage oxygen saturation in the various blood vessels it was calculated that 29-42% of testicular arterial blood was flowing through <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> between the testicular artery and the pampiniform plexus in the spermatic cord, thus bypassing the capillary net of the abdominal testes of unilaterally and bilaterally cryptorchid pigs. These results were supported by the testosterone measurements. In the spermatic cord of scrotal testes no blood bypassed the capillary net of the testes.",M2
3421514,"<e>Arteriovenous anastomoses</e>' function and Raynaud's phenomenon.By intrabrachial artery injections of a bolus of human albumin microspheres labeled with 99mTc in patients with primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and in a group of healthy volunteers, the authors developed a method of detecting the patency rate of arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) in the hand, after local heat and cold stimulation, by quantifying the radioactivity of the lungs expressed as a percentage of an intravenously injected radionuclide dose. With strain gauge plethysmography, simultaneous changes in the digital total (DTF) flow were also measured. After exposure of fingers to cold, 25 of 26 subjects had a clear reduction in both DTF and the AVA patency rate (APR) in comparison with the corresponding heat values. The RP patients, in particular, showed a statistically significant reduction in DTF (P less than 0.001) and in APR (P less than 0.001). These results appear to be consistent with the onset of critically reduced patency of the AVA of the hand during the ischemic phase of RP.",M2
3210873,"[Do <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> of the olfactory mucosa exist? A light and transmission electron microscopy study in the rabbit]Arteriovenous anastomoses were first mentioned more than 250 years ago. Since the original description, these peculiar vascular structures have been detected in almost every organ and tissue. In respect of the head and neck area, arteriovenous anastomoses have been mainly observed in the nasal mucosa of either humans or different animals and in the rabbit ear; the latter offers a unique chance for in-vivo studies using the ear chamber technique. Nevertheless, the existence of arteriovenous anastomoses in the nasal mucosa has often been denied. In the present study, we examined the endonasal vascular system of the rabbit by means of light- and transmission electron microscopy. No evidence for the existence of arteriovenous anastomoses could be found in the respiratory part of the nasal mucosa whereas in the deeper layers of the olfactory mucosa several vascular structures could be encountered that were similar to the glomerula digitalia of fingertips. It is emphasised that these vessels must be regarded as true arteriovenous anatomoses which might play a potential role in endonasal thermoregulation.",M2
3378254,"Wall structure of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the rabbit ear. Combined light-, scanning- and transmission electron-microscopic studies.The wall structure of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear was investigated. (1) Clusters of epithelioid smooth muscle cells form 3-4 longitudinally oriented plicae. The channel shows a single, irregularly outlined lumen, and its wall is very thin between adjacent plicae. (2) Endothelial cells covering the plicae protrude into the lumen, thus suggesting active contraction or shortening of the plicae. (3) The tunica adventitia is composed of 4-6 sheaths of flat fibroblasts, which may serve as a barrier to prevent loss of neurotransmitters. Processes of some of the fibroblasts also extend into the tunica media. (4) The tunica media is composed of an outer circular layer of typical smooth muscle cells, and an inner longitudinally running plica of ramified smooth muscle cells. Wide intercellular spaces between these ramified cells are filled with collagen fibrils, microfibrils, amorphous intercellular substances, and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts form close membrane contacts with each other, and with the smooth muscle cells. (5) Fibroblasts and other connective tissue components may function as an elastic support during active motility of the anastomotic channel.",M2
3288349,"Innervation of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the brood patch of the domestic fowl.The innervation of blood vessels in the brood patch (thoracic skin) of the domestic fowl was studied by use of the catecholamine fluorescence technique, acetylcholinesterase staining, and the immunoperoxidase technique for demonstration of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Large arteries and veins were sparsely innervated, whereas arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) were densely innervated by adrenergic, acetylcholinesterase-positive, and VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres. The rich supply of different vasomotor nerves to AVAs emphasizes the importance of these vascular shunts in regulating blood flow and, in turn, the transport of heat to the brood patch. Furthermore, the presence of VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres in the vasculature of the brood patch suggests that VIP might be the mediator of the previously reported cold-induced vasodilatation.",M2
2461925,"Innervation of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the sheep tongue: immunocytochemical evidence for coexistence of neural transmitters.In this study structural and immunocytochemical evidence has shown that arterial vessels, particularly AVAs, are associated with nerves containing peptidergic vasodilators, viz. VIP, CGRP and SP. The presence of VIP-like immunoreactivity in both P-type and C-type nerves is evidence of the coexistence of VIP and acetylcholine in cholinergic nerves and suggests the action of VIP in maintaining the opening of AVAs in heat stress conditions. The evidence for the co-existence of CGRP and SP is more direct as immunoreactivity for both peptides has been demonstrated in serial sections of the same nerve terminal. Although SP is a potent vasodilator there is little evidence of its role in thermoregulation; however it may be involved in a local axon reflex and cause antidromic vasodilatation of local vessels particularly AVAs.",M2
3359295,"Tentative identification of arterial baroreceptors associated with <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e>.Nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve were examined in the lip, nostril, upper jaw and supraorbital skin of cat by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing method. Wheatgerm agglutinin-HRP (WGA-HRP) as injected into the spinal trigeminal nucleus was transported transganglionically to nerve endings. The present study deals with presumptive baroreceptive nerve endings found on arteriovenous anastomoses and on some other large arteries. By light microscopy HRP-labeled, complexly arborized nerve endings were found on the walls of arteries located deep in the subcutaneous tissue of the lip and nostril. These arteries were identified in serial sections to be an arterial segment of an arteriovenous anastomosis. By electron microscopy characteristic nerve endings were located in the adventitia and partly extended into the adjacent connective tissue of the arterial wall. These terminals had no connective tissue capsule. Axon terminals were somewhat enlarged (1-2 microns in diameter) and extended through bundles of collagen fibrils. The terminals contained an abundance of mitochondria and some vesicles. Axon terminals were typically covered by thin Schwann cell processes, but parts of the axolemma were sometimes devoid of such Schwann cell coverings, being invested only by basal laminae. Cell bodies of Schwann cells were located apart from axons. These light and electron microscopic features of the endings resembled those of other well-defined baroreceptors reported in the carotid sinus, aortic arch and endocardium, as well as of Ruffini terminals and Golgi tendon organs, suggesting that they would be baroreceptors of arteriovenous anastomosis. In addition HRP-labeled single nerve fibers with varicosities were found in the walls of some large arteries in the facial skin. By electron microscopy, such a HRP-positive nerve fiber contained some mitochondria and vesicles in varicosities and coursed with a bundle of HRP-negative fine fibers in the adventitia of arteries. These HRP-labeled single fibers were considered to be sensory derived from trigeminal nerves.",M2
3400414,"Three-dimensional SEM study of <e>arteriovenous anastomoses</e> in the dog's tongue using corrosive resin casts.Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) participate in the regulation of blood flow. Although it has been speculated that AVAs in the dog's tongue play a role in the regulation of the body temperature, no published work is available on the structural characteristics of AVAs in the dog's tongue. The purpose of the present investigation was therefore to determine the frequency of AVAs and their structural characteristics by the fabrication of vascular corrosive resin casts and examination under a scanning electron microscope. This method permitted not only the visualization of the three-dimensional characteristics of AVAs, but also a clear differentiation between arterioles and venules. The total number of AVAs in the mucosal lamina propria of the dorsum of the left tongue half was 2,292. Several essential types such as S-shaped, hook-shaped, straight, bibranching and Y-shaped AVAs were observed, of which the S-shaped and similar types constituted the overwhelming majority; Y-shaped types have never been reported heretofore. This study also revealed that the locations where AVAs were most often distributed were, in descending order of frequency, the tip, the corpus and the root area of the tongue. This high frequency and strategic location of AVAs in the tongue strongly indicate that AVAs of the dog's tongue participate in the thermal regulation.",M2
