20575365,"Comparison of quantitative RT-PCR with cell culture to detect viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) IVb infections in the Great Lakes.Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an important pathogen of cultured and wild <e>fish</e> in marine and freshwater environments. A new genotype, VHSV IVb, was isolated from a fish collected from the Great Lakes in 2003. Since the first isolation, VHSV IVb has been confirmed in 28 species, signaling the early invasion and continued spread of this Office International des Epizooties-reportable agent. For surveillance of this virus in both wild and experimental settings, we have developed a rapid and sensitive one-step quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay that amplifies a 100-base-pair conserved segment from both the genomic negative strand and the mRNA positive strand of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of VHSV IVb. This assay is linear over seven orders of magnitude, with an analytical capability of detecting a single copy of viral RNA and reproducibility at 100 copies. The assay is approximately linear with RNA input from 50 to 1000 ng per assay and works equally well with RNA prepared from a column-based or phenol-chloroform-based method. In wild-caught fish, 97% of the cases were found to be more than three orders of magnitude more sensitive using qRT-PCR than using cell culture. Of the 1,428 fish from the Great Lakes region tested in 2006 and 2007, 24% were positive by qRT-PCR whereas only 5% were positive by cell culture. All of the fish that were positive by cell culture were also positive by qRT-PCR. Importantly, qRT-PCR sensitivity is comparable to that of cell culture detection when comparing VHSV viral RNA levels with viral titer stocks, confirming that the high qRT-PCR signals obtained with diagnostic samples are due to the accumulation of N gene mRNA by transcriptional attenuation. The qRT-PCR assay is particularly valuable for rapid and high-throughput prescreening of fish before confirmatory testing by cell culture or sequencing tissue-derived amplicons and especially in detecting infection in fish that do not show clinical signs of VHS.",M1
20575364,"Antimicrobial susceptibility of Flavobacterium psychrophilum isolates from Ontario.Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the etiological agent of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), an important disease in the Ontario <e>fish</e> farming industry and in finfish aquaculture in temperate waters worldwide. The development of antimicrobial resistance by F. psychrophilum is a concern because management of outbreaks of BCWD often requires the use of antibiotics. Seventy-two isolates of F. psychrophilum collected over a 16-year period from farmed salmonids with clinical signs of BCWD were tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobial agents using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth in custom Trek Sensititre susceptibility plates for aquaculture. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the isolates were determined by means of a broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing method established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Most of the F. psychrophilum isolates had decreased susceptibility to two of the four antibiotics licensed for use in Ontario (i.e., ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine [&gt; or =0.5/9.5 .tg/mL for 93% of isolates] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [&gt; or = 0.25/4.8 microg/mL for 89% of isolates]). High MIC values (&gt; or =2 microg/mL) were obtained for florfenicol and oxytetracycline in 53% and 61% of the isolates, respectively, and 83% of the isolates were relatively susceptible (&lt; or =16 microg/mL) to erythromycin. The MIC values were also high for ampicillin, oxolinic acid, and gentamicin.",M1
20575359,"Susceptibility of three stocks of pacific herring to viral hemorrhagic septicemia.Laboratory challenges using specific-pathogen-free Pacific herring Clupea pallasii from three distinct populations indicated that stock origin had no effect on susceptibility to viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). All of the populations were highly susceptible to the disease upon initial exposure, with significantly greater cumulative mortalities occurring in the exposed treatment groups (56.3-64.3%) than in the unexposed control groups (0.8-9.0%). Interstock differences in cumulative mortality were not significant. The virus loads in the tissues of <e>fish</e> experiencing mortality were 10-10,000 times higher during the acute phase of the epizootics (day 13 postexposure) than during the recovery phase (days 30-42). Survivors of the epizootics were refractory to subsequent VHS, with reexposure of VHS survivors resulting in significantly less cumulative mortality (1.2-4.0%) than among positive controls (38.1-64.4%); interstock differences in susceptibility did not occur after reexposure. These results indicate that data from experiments designed to understand the ecology of VHS virus in a given stock of Pacific herring are broadly applicable to stocks throughout the northeastern Pacific.",M1
20538946,"Regulation of body temperature by some Mesozoic marine reptiles.What the body temperature and thermoregulation processes of extinct vertebrates were are central questions for understanding their ecology and evolution. The thermophysiologic status of the great marine reptiles is still unknown, even though some studies have suggested that thermoregulation may have contributed to their exceptional evolutionary success as apex predators of Mesozoic aquatic ecosystems. We tested the thermal status of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs by comparing the oxygen isotope compositions of their tooth phosphate to those of coexisting <e>fish</e>. Data distribution reveals that these large marine reptiles were able to maintain a constant and high body temperature in oceanic environments ranging from tropical to cold temperate. Their estimated body temperatures, in the range from 35 degrees +/- 2 degrees C to 39 degrees +/- 2 degrees C, suggest high metabolic rates required for predation and fast swimming over large distances offshore.",M1
20536923,"Functional organization of V2a-related locomotor circuits in the rodent spinal cord.Studies of mammalian locomotion have been greatly facilitated by the use of the isolated rodent spinal cord preparation that retains the locomotor circuits needed to execute the movement. Physiological and molecular genetic experiments in this preparation have started to unravel the basic circuit organization responsible for walking in mammals. Here, we review these experiments with a focus on the functional role of excitatory V2a interneurons in the mammalian locomotor network. With regard to these neurons and other network structures we also discuss similarities and differences between the mammalian walking central pattern generator (CPG) and the <e>fish</e> swimming CPG.",M1
20536817,"Bioaccumulation syndrome: identifying factors that make some stream food webs prone to elevated mercury bioaccumulation.Mercury is a ubiquitous contaminant in aquatic ecosystems, posing a significant health risk to humans and wildlife that eat <e>fish</e>. Mercury accumulates in aquatic food webs as methylmercury (MeHg), a particularly toxic and persistent organic mercury compound. While mercury in the environment originates largely from anthropogenic activities, MeHg accumulation in freshwater aquatic food webs is not a simple function of local or regional mercury pollution inputs. Studies show that even sites with similar mercury inputs can produce fish with mercury concentrations ranging over an order of magnitude. While much of the foundational work to identify the drivers of variation in mercury accumulation has focused on freshwater lakes, mercury contamination in stream ecosystems is emerging as an important research area. Here, we review recent research on mercury accumulation in stream-dwelling organisms. Taking a hierarchical approach, we identify a suite of characteristics of individual consumers, food webs, streams, watersheds, and regions that are consistently associated with elevated MeHg concentrations in stream fish. We delineate a conceptual, mechanistic basis for explaining the ecological processes that underlie this vulnerability to MeHg. Key factors, including suppressed individual growth of consumers, low rates of primary and secondary production, hydrologic connection to methylation sites (e.g., wetlands), heavily forested catchments, and acidification are frequently associated with increased MeHg concentrations in fish across both streams and lakes. Hence, we propose that these interacting factors define a syndrome of characteristics that drive high MeHg production and bioaccumulation rates across these freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on an understanding of the ecological drivers of MeHg accumulation, we identify situations when anthropogenic effects and management practices could significantly exacerbate or ameliorate MeHg accumulation in stream fish.",M1
20531470,"Environmental context explains Lévy and Brownian movement patterns of marine predators.An optimal search theory, the so-called Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, predicts that predators should adopt search strategies known as Lévy flights where prey is sparse and distributed unpredictably, but that Brownian movement is sufficiently efficient for locating abundant prey. Empirical studies have generated controversy because the accuracy of statistical methods that have been used to identify Lévy behaviour has recently been questioned. Consequently, whether foragers exhibit Lévy flights in the wild remains unclear. Crucially, moreover, it has not been tested whether observed movement patterns across natural landscapes having different expected resource distributions conform to the theory's central predictions. Here we use maximum-likelihood methods to test for Lévy patterns in relation to environmental gradients in the largest animal movement data set assembled for this purpose. Strong support was found for Lévy search patterns across 14 species of open-ocean predatory <e>fish</e> (sharks, tuna, billfish and ocean sunfish), with some individuals switching between Lévy and Brownian movement as they traversed different habitat types. We tested the spatial occurrence of these two principal patterns and found Lévy behaviour to be associated with less productive waters (sparser prey) and Brownian movements to be associated with productive shelf or convergence-front habitats (abundant prey). These results are consistent with the Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, supporting the contention that organism search strategies naturally evolved in such a way that they exploit optimal Lévy patterns.",M1
20527323,"Responding to Pfiesteria piscicida (the <e>fish</e> killer): phantomatic ontologies, indeterminacy, and responsibility in toxic microbiology.Based on an analysis of an ongoing scientific-political controversy over the toxicity of a fish-killing microorganism, this paper explores the relationship between responsibility and nonhuman contributions to agency in experimental practices. Research into the insidious effects of the dinoflagellates Pfiesteria piscicida (the fish killer) that thrive in waters over-enriched with nutrients, has received considerable attention by both the media and government agencies concerned with public and environmental health. After nearly two decades of research, the question of whether Pfiesteria can be regarded the 'causative agent' of massive fish kills in the estuaries of the US mid-Atlantic could not be scientifically settled. In contrast to policymakers, who attribute the absence of a scientific consensus to gaps in scientific knowledge and uncertainties regarding the identity and behavior of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates, I propose that an inseparable entanglement of Pfiesteria's identities and their toxic activities challenges conventional notions of causality that seek to establish a connection between independent events in linear time. Building on Karen Barad's framework of agential realism, I argue for a move from epistemological uncertainties to ontological indeterminacies that follow from Pfiesteria's contributions to agency, as the condition for responsible and objective science. In tracking discrepant experimental enactments of Pfiesteria that have been mobilized as evidence for and against their toxicity, I investigate how criteria for what counts as evidence get built into the experimental apparatuses and suggest that the joint possibilities of causality and responsibility vary with the temporalities of the objects enacted. This discussion seeks to highlight a thorough entanglement of epistemic/ontological concerns with the ecological/political relevance of particular experiments. Finally, I introduce a new kind of scientific object that--borrowing from Derrida--I call phantomatic. Phantoms don't emerge as such, but appear as traces and are associated with specific matters of concern.",M1
20510861,"Multimodal integration in granule cells as a basis for associative plasticity and sensory prediction in a cerebellum-like circuit.The recoding of diverse sensory and motor signals by granule cells (GCs) is probably critical for the function of cerebellar circuits, yet the nature of these transformations and their significance for cerebellar information processing remain poorly understood. In cerebellum-like structures in <e>fish</e>, anti-Hebbian plasticity at parallel fiber synapses generates  negative images  that act to cancel predictable patterns of electrosensory input. Here I test the hypothesis that GCs enhance the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to generate specific negative images by selectively encoding combinations of sensory and motor signals. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings, I show (1) that a subset of GCs integrate sensory and motor signals conveyed by distinct mossy fiber classes and (2) that Purkinje-like cells exhibit plastic changes specific to the combinations of signals that individual GCs encode. Consistent with influential theories of cerebellar function, these findings suggest that selective GC output enhances the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to acquire selectivity through associative plasticity.",M1

20504831,"Influence of water hardness on acute toxicity of copper and zinc on <e>fish</e>.The aim of this study was to utilize static test for examining the acute toxicity of two essential elements, Cu and Zn, to a native fish, Capoeta fusca, by static bioassay. The acute toxicity of two heavy metals to C. fusca was determined in the soft, hard and very hard water (40, 150 and 380 mg/L as CaCO(3)). Results showed that toxicity of Cu and Zn decreased with increasing water hardness, so that water hardness had a significant effect on Cu and Zn toxicity on fish. Copper and Zn were more toxic in the soft water than in the hard water. The 96-hour lethal concentration for 50% (LC(50)) values for C. fusca were lower in the soft water compared with the hard and very hard water. The 96-hour LC(50) for Cu at the soft, hard and very hard water was found to be 1.1, 5.4 and 7.5 mg/L, respectively, while the 96-hour LC(50) for Zn at the soft, hard and very hard water was found to be 13.7, 74.4 and 102.9 mg/L, respectively.",M1
20503876,"Thermal heterogeneity mediates the effects of pulsed subsidies across a landscape.Spatial and temporal heterogeneity interact to make the foraging rates of individuals more variable than expected from models assuming that spatial and temporal dimensions of habitat conditions operate independently. For example, trophic resource pulses produce temporal patches of prey superabundance, yet little is known about how spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions mediates the ability of consumers to exploit these high-quality foraging opportunities. We studied how spatial variation in water temperature regulates the potential for juvenile coho salmon to exploit a seasonal pulsed subsidy of eggs produced by anadromous sockeye salmon. Streams within the Wood River watershed, southwestern Alaska, USA, ranged in mean summer temperature from 3.6 degrees to 14.5 degrees C. Growth of juvenile coho prior to the arrival of the seasonal egg subsidy was positively related to water temperature among streams. An in situ experiment combined with field samples of diets revealed a size threshold for egg consumption; only individuals longer than approximately 70 mm could consume eggs due to gape limitation of smaller individuals. A bioenergetics simulation demonstrated that water temperature regulated whether age-0 coho salmon could grow large enough to exceed the size threshold for egg consumption. Coho salmon that consumed eggs had energy rations that were five times higher than <e>fish</e> that did not consume eggs, resulting in a positive feedback of water temperature on their integrated seasonal growth. Across this landscape, heterogeneity in water temperature mediates individual- and population-level responses to seasonally available resource pulses. Our study illustrates that ecological mechanisms, such as size-based foraging asymmetries, can magnify the effects of climate change compared to predictions based on physiology alone.",M1
20484456,"Dietary intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and coronary events in Norwegian patients with coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Consumption of <e>fish</e> and n-3 (omega-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) has been associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the relation between dietary intake of n-3 LCPUFAs or fish and risk of future coronary events or mortality in patients with well-characterized CAD. DESIGN: This was a substudy of 2412 participants in the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial with a median follow-up time of 57 mo. Patients aged &gt;18 y diagnosed with CAD (81% men) completed a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, from which daily intakes of eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids as well as fish were estimated on the basis of diet and intakes of supplements including fish and cod liver oils. The main endpoint was a composite of coronary events, including coronary death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and unstable angina pectoris. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) intakes of n-3 LCPUFAs in quartiles 1-4 were 0.58 +/- 0.29, 0.83 +/- 0.30, 1.36 +/- 0.44, and 2.64 +/- 1.18 g/d, respectively. We found no dose-response relation between quartiles of n-3 LCPUFAs (based on intake as percentage of total energy) or fish and coronary events or separate endpoints. A post hoc additive proportional hazards model showed a slightly increased risk of coronary events at an intake of n-3 LCPUFAs &lt; approximately 0.30 g/d. CONCLUSION: Among Norwegian patients with CAD consuming relatively high amounts of n-3 LCPUFAs and fish, there were no significant trends toward a reduced risk of coronary events or mortality with increasing intakes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00354081.",M1
20484454,"Adherence to the Southern European Atlantic Diet and occurrence of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: The Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) is the traditional diet in northern Portugal and Galicia, a region in northwest Spain. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between adherence to the SEAD and the occurrence of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: This was a population-based case-control study in Porto, Portugal. Cases were patients aged &gt; or =18 y who were hospitalized with an incident AMI (n = 820), and controls were individuals without AMI selected at random from the resident population of the participating hospitals' catchment area (n = 2196). A validated food-frequency questionnaire was administered in face-to-face interviews to assess dietary intake in the previous year. We developed an SEAD adherence index with 9 key components: fresh <e>fish</e> excluding cod, cod, red meat and pork products, dairy products, legumes and vegetables, vegetable soup, potatoes, whole-grain bread, and wine. A score of 1 or 0 was assigned to each food consumed and reflected consumption that was higher or lower, respectively, than the sex-specific median in controls. RESULTS: After adjustment for the main confounders, a 1-point increment in the SEAD score was associated with a 10% reduced odds of AMI [odds ratio (OR): 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96]. In comparison with individuals in the lower quartile of the SEAD index (lowest adherence), those in the upper quartile had a 33% lower likelihood of experiencing an AMI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.88; P for trend = 0.003). An SEAD index calculated by reverse scoring for red meat and pork products and potatoes led to an even stronger inverse association between the SEAD and AMI (OR for the upper compared with the lower quartile of SEAD index: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.52; P for trend &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the SEAD was associated with lower odds of nonfatal AMI. However, some but not all food components of the SEAD may contribute to the very low coronary mortality in northern Portugal and Galicia.",M1
20481086,"Evaluation of a polyclonal antibody for the detection and identification of ranaviruses from freshwater <e>fish</e> and amphibians.A rabbit polyclonal antibody (PAb) raised against European catfish virus (ECV; isolated from black bullhead Ameiurus melas in France) was produced and then evaluated using a panel of 9 ranavirus isolates collected from different lower vertebrate species originating from Australia, North and South America, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Using ranavirus-infected epithelioma papillosum cyprini (EPC) cell cultures, the specificity of the PAb was determined by Western blot, immunogold electron microscopy, and direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the PAb reacted strongly with a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to approximately 49 kDa. Immunogold electron microscopy provided direct evidence that the epitopes recognized by this PAb were located on the outer surface of virions. The PAb was used for the preparation of a peroxidase-labeled conjugate for the direct ELISA detection of ranaviruses in infected EPC cell cultures. The specificity of the conjugated PAb was tested using ranaviruses, some representative fish viruses of the genera Rhabdovirus and Birnavirus, and samples from various non-infected fish species. The PAb detected all tested ranaviruses except for 2 Santee-Cooper ranaviruses. The direct ELISA enabled the detection of ranavirus from a concentration of 10(3.5) to 10(3.8) TCID50 ml(-1) cell culture. The results of this study revealed that the rabbit PAb raised against ECV could be useful for the development of specific and standardized diagnostic assays for the detection of ranaviruses from freshwater fish and amphibians.",M1
20480676,"Mechanisms of achromatic vision in invertebrates and vertebrates: a comparative study.Intracellular recording in the retina of the snail, Helix pomatia L., reveals the existence of two types of cell responsive to diffuse flashes of achromatic or monochromatic light: B-type cells, which respond with sustained depolarization that is sometimes accompanied by spikes, and D-type cells, which respond with sustained hyperpolarization. The peak of spectral sensitivity for both B- and D-cells falls in the 450-500 nm range and coincides with range of maximal sensitivity for the rhodopsin family of photopigments. Within a proposed two-channel model of snail achromatic vision, responses of the B- and D-cells are represented by a two-dimensional 'excitation vector'. The length of the 'excitation vector' is approximately constant, and its direction correlates with light intensity. The vector model of light encoding in the snail is discussed in relation to models of achromatic vision in vertebrates (<e>fish</e>, frog, monkey, and humans) based on psychophysical, behavioral and neurophysiological data. Intracellular data in the snail taken together with data from vertebrate animals support the hypothesis that a 2-dimensional model of brightness and darkness encoding utilizes a universal mechanism of 'vector encoding' for light intensity in neuronal vision networks.",M1
20469652,"In vitro effects of chlorpyrifos on the acetylcholinesterase activity of euryhaline <e>fish</e>, Oreochromis mossambicus.The in vitro effect of a widely used organophosphorus insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPP), on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was studied in vitro. The kinetic constants Km and Vmax and the bimolecular constant k(j) were determined in vitro. The in vitro AChE study indicated that CPP is neurotoxic and that it alters the apparent Km values widely in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a competitive type of inhibition. Based on the k(i) values, the sensitivity of AChE in brain is greater than that in gill tissue, at 7.3 x 10(-5) M and 11.92 x 10(-5) M, respectively. The study points to the importance of kinetic studies and the results suggest that in biomonitoring programmes brain AChE activity can be a good diagnostic tool for CPP toxicity.",M1
20462119,"Consumer return chronology alters recovery trajectory of stream ecosystem structure and function following drought.Consumers are increasingly being recognized as important drivers of ecological succession, yet it is still hard to predict the nature and direction of consumer effects in nonequilibrium environments. We used stream consumer exclosures and large outdoor mesocosms to study the impact of macroconsumers (i.e., <e>fish</e> and crayfish) on recovery of intermittent prairie streams after drying. In the stream, macroconsumers altered system recovery trajectory by decreasing algal and macroinvertebrate biomass, primary productivity, and benthic nutrient uptake rates. However, macroconsumer influence was transient, and differences between exclosures and controls disappeared after 35 days. Introducing and removing macroconsumers after 28 days resulted mainly in changes to macroinvertebrates. In mesocosms, a dominant consumer (the grazing minnow Phoxinus erythrogaster) reduced macroinvertebrate biomass but had little effect on algal assemblage structure and ecosystem rates during recovery. The weak effect of P. erythrogaster in mesocosms, in contrast to the strong consumer effect in the natural stream, suggests that both timing and diversity of returning consumers are important to their overall influence on stream recovery patterns. Although we found that consumers significantly altered ecosystem structure and function in a system experiencing rapid changes in abiotic and biotic factors following disturbance, consumer effects diminished over time and trajectories converged to similar states with respect to primary producers, in spite of differences in consumer colonization history. Thus, consumer impacts can be substantial in recovering ecosystems and are likely to be dependent on the disturbance regime and diversity of the consumer community.",M1
20461535,"Nuclear-export-signal-dependent protein translocation of dUTPase encoded by Singapore grouper iridovirus.The dUTPase is a ubiquitous and crucial enzyme responsible for regulating cellular levels of dUTP. In the present study, the expression pattern and translocation of a dUTPase homolog encoded by Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) were elucidated. The SGIV ORF049R encodes a dUTPase homolog, which is a peptide of 155 amino acids that contains five conserved motifs. The temporal expression pattern during infection in vitro revealed that the SGIV dUTPase was an early transcript. A leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) at the C-terminus was predicted using CBS Online Servers. Subcellular location analysis showed that SGIV dUTPase is a cytoplasmic protein. Site-direct mutagenesis by overlap extension-PCR indicated that the NES is crucial for the translocation of SGIV dUTPase from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We have discovered for the first time that the NES-dependent translocation of dUTPase is different for SGIV than for members of other species, which depend on a nuclear localization signal. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of <e>fish</e> iridoviruses.",M1

Disparate biochemical systems and diverse phylogenetic distribution patterns of light-emitting organisms highlight the ecological benefits of bioluminescence, with biochemical and genetic analyses providing new insights into the mechanisms of its evolution. The origins and functions of some bioluminescent systems, however, remain obscure. Here, I review recent advances in understanding bioluminescence in the ocean and highlight future research efforts that will unite molecular details with ecological and evolutionary relationships.",M1
20443687,"Seasonal variation in drifting eggs and larvae in the upper Yangtze, China.From 5 March to 25 July 2008, ichthyoplankton drifting into the Three Gorges Reservoir from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were sampled daily to investigate the species composition, abundance, and seasonal variation in early-stage fishes in this area. Twenty-eight species belonging to five orders and 17 families or subfamilies were identified by analyzing <e>fish</e> eggs and larvae, and a total of 14.16 billion individuals were estimated drifting through the sampling section during the investigation. Among the ichthyoplankton sampled, species in Cultrinae, Cobitidae, Gobioninae and Gobiidae, along with the common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus), comprised 89.6% of the total amount. Six peaks of drift density were identified during the sampling period, and a significant correlation was found between drift density with water discharge. The dominant species were different in each drift peak, indicating different spawning times for the major species. The total amount of the four major Chinese carps that drifted through the sampling section was estimated as 0.88 billion, indicating an increase in the population sizes of these species in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Actually, these reaches have become the largest spawning area for the four major Chinese carps in the Yangtze River. The large total amount of eggs and larvae drifting through this section demonstrated that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River provided important spawning sites for many fish species, and that conservation of this area should be of great concern.",M1

20439734,"Transfer of a cyanobacterial neurotoxin within a temperate aquatic ecosystem suggests pathways for human exposure.beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid produced by most cyanobacteria, has been proposed to be the causative agent of devastating neurodegenerative diseases on the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. Because cyanobacteria are widespread globally, we hypothesized that BMAA might occur and bioaccumulate in other ecosystems. Here we demonstrate, based on a recently developed extraction and HPLC-MS/MS method and long-term monitoring of BMAA in cyanobacterial populations of a temperate aquatic ecosystem (Baltic Sea, 2007-2008), that BMAA is biosynthesized by cyanobacterial genera dominating the massive surface blooms of this water body. BMAA also was found at higher concentrations in organisms of higher trophic levels that directly or indirectly feed on cyanobacteria, such as zooplankton and various vertebrates (<e>fish</e>) and invertebrates (mussels, oysters). Pelagic and benthic fish species used for human consumption were included. The highest BMAA levels were detected in the muscle and brain of bottom-dwelling fishes. The discovery of regular biosynthesis of the neurotoxin BMAA in a large temperate aquatic ecosystem combined with its possible transfer and bioaccumulation within major food webs, some ending in human consumption, is alarming and requires attention.",M1
20438707,"Purification, characterization and substrate specificity of a trypsin from the Amazonian <e>fish</e> tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum).An enzyme was purified from the pyloric caecum of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) through heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-75 and p-aminobenzamidine-agarose affinity chromatography. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 23.9 kDa, NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence of IVGGYECKAHSQPHVSLNI and substrate specificity for arginine at P1, efficiently hydrolizing substrates with leucine and lysine at P2 and serine and arginine at P1'. Using the substrate z-FR-MCA, the enzyme exhibited greatest activity at pH 9.0 and 50 degrees C, whereas, with BAPNA activity was higher in a pH range of 7.5-11.5 and at 70 degrees C. Moreover, the enzyme maintained ca. 60% of its activity after incubated for 3h at 60 degrees C. The enzymatic activity significantly decreased in the presence of TLCK, benzamidine (trypsin inhibitors) and PMSF (serine protease inhibitor). This source of trypsin may be an attractive alternative for the detergent and food industry.",M1
20437967,"Marine reserves: <e>fish</e> life history and ecological traits matter.Marine reserves are assumed to protect a wide range of species from deleterious effects stemming from exploitation. However, some species, due to their ecological characteristics, may not respond positively to protection. Very little is known about the effects of life history and ecological traits (e.g., mobility, growth, and habitat) on responses of fish species to marine reserves. Using 40 data sets from 12 European marine reserves, we show that there is significant variation in the response of different species of fish to protection and that this heterogeneity can be explained, in part, by differences in their traits. Densities of targeted size-classes of commercial species were greater in protected than unprotected areas. This effect of protection increased as the maximum body size of the targeted species increased, and it was greater for species that were not obligate schoolers. However, contrary to previous theoretical findings, even mobile species with wide home ranges benefited from protection: the effect of protection was at least as strong for mobile species as it was for sedentary ones. Noncommercial bycatch and unexploited species rarely responded to protection, and when they did (in the case of unexploited bentho-pelagic species), they exhibited the opposite response: their densities were lower inside reserves. The use of marine reserves for marine conservation and fisheries management implies that they should ensure protection for a wide range of species with different life-history and ecological traits. Our results suggest this is not the case, and instead that effects vary with economic value, body size, habitat, depth range, and schooling behavior.",M1
20435916,"Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires a change to the selective fishing philosophy.Globally, many <e>fish</e> species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the  6-S  selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a  balanced exploitation  approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.",M1

There is shown a wide spectrum of structural diversity of albumins in Pisces due to their participation in osmotic, plastic, and transport functions under conditions of environment and of the organism internal media. Detection of similar motifs in the piscine and mammalian albumin genes allows uniting these genes into one superfamily and considering vertebrate albumins the homologous proteins.",M1
20428089,"DNA-based <e>fish</e> species identification protocol.We have developed a fast, simple, and accurate DNA-based screening method to identify the fish species present in fresh and processed seafood samples. This versatile method employs PCR amplification of genomic DNA extracted from fish samples, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to generate fragment patterns that can be resolved on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and matched to the correct species using RFLP pattern matching software. The fish identification method uses a simple, reliable, spin column- based protocol to isolate DNA from fish samples. The samples are treated with proteinase K to release the nucleic acids into solution. DNA is then isolated by suspending the sample in binding buffer and loading onto a micro- spin cup containing a silica- based fiber matrix. The nucleic acids in the sample bind to the fiber matrix. The immobilized nucleic acids are washed to remove contaminants, and total DNA is recovered in a final volume of 100 mul. The isolated DNA is ready for PCR amplification with the provided primers that bind to sequences found in all fish genomes. The PCR products are then digested with three different restriction enzymes and resolved on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The fragment lengths produced in the digestion reactions can be used to determine the species of fish from which the DNA sample was prepared, using the RFLP pattern matching software containing a database of experimentally- derived RFLP patterns from commercially relevant fish species.",M1
20423891,"[Identification of <e>fish</e> species based on ribosomal DNA ITS2 locus]To prevent illegal fishing and sale, the most difficult problem is identification of marketed fish species, especially the parts that are difficult to be differentiated with morphological method (e.g., larval, eggs, scales, meat, products etc. To assist conservation and management of fishery resources, this paper reported a molecular genetic approach based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus. The method includes two steps: (1) the order general primers were designed according to the conservative nature of 5.8SrRAN and 28SrRNA genes within an order, and the DNA ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus fragment were then amplified and sequenced. (2) The species-specific ladders and the species-specific primers for each species were designed according to the sequencing results. The map of molecular taxonomy was constructed. This approach employs multiplex PCR that is formatted for fish species identification. We tested 210 single-species samples and 40 mix-species samples from different regions of China. The approach distinguished accurately and sensitively samples from each of the five species. This genetic and molecular approach will be useful for fish conservation, assessment, management and exploitation, strengthen in law enforcement of fishery manager, combat rare and endangered fish smuggling, and prevent commercial fraud and biological invasion by harmful nonnative species.",M1
20422710,"Molecular cloning and expression analysis of Fshr and Lhr in relation to Fshb and Lhb subunits during the period of temperature-dependent sex determination in pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis.In this study, we cloned and characterized the follicle stimulating hormone receptor (Fshr) and luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhr) cDNAs of pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), and analyzed their expression in relation to Fshb and Lhb subunits during gonadogenesis at temperatures producing only females (17 degrees C, FPT), both sexes (25 degrees C, MixPT), and only males (29 degrees C, MPT). The pejerrey Fshr cDNA had 3,069 bp for a mature protein of 694 amino acids (aa) and a signal peptide of 22 aa; the Lhr cDNA had 2,936 bp for a mature protein of 676 aa and a signal peptide of 25 aa. With the exception of Lhr in <e>fish</e> at the MPT, all genes showed significant increases and/or peaks of expression before histological differentiation of the gonads regardless of temperature. Larvae at the FPT had lower Fshb and Lhb but higher Lhr expression during the TSD period than those at the MPT; a clear pattern could not be ascertained for Fshr. At the MixPT, Fshb, Lhb, and Lhr mRNA increased in approximately half of the fish during TSD and sex differentiation and the sex ratio was 55.2% male. Based on the above results, it is suggested that animals with high Fshb and Lhb and low Lhr values represent putative males. These evidences, together with other studies, suggest that temperature may signal through the pituitary (differential expression of Fshb and Lhb) down to the gonads (differential expression of Lhr), probably affecting the regulation of steroidogenesis during the TSD process of pejerrey.",M1
20418618,"Full-scale experiences of nitrogen removal of <e>fish</e>-processing wastewater with flotation and anoxic-aerobic activated sludge system.This article presents full scale experience of one of the largest fish-processing factories in Europe with a production capacity of about 50,000 tons herring per year and a maximum daily wastewater discharge of 1,500 m(3). The wastewater treatment plant is the only direct discharger in the fish-processing industry in Germany. Thus, very low effluent values have to be keep in, especially the nitrogen reduction has to be operated during the whole year even when the temperature is low. The central point of the multi-stage WWTP (about 90,000 PE) is the biological nutrient removal (BNR) with pre-denitrification. The wastewater pre-treatment with sieves (0.8 mm) and a two staged flotation reduces the nitrogen load - mainly the particle bounded fraction - but the optimal nutrient ratios for biological treatment need to be observed. The activated sludge system has maximum OLR of 0.12 g COD/(g MLSS d) and NLR of 0.015 g TN/(g MLSS d) but a  Stand-By -Operation with periods without wastewater influent is unavoidable. Discontinuous operating is one problem. The dependence on temperature as one of the main influences of nitrification-activity is the second point.

All samples were cultured on brain heart infusion agar. All the seven isolates were Gram positive and were identified as Streptococcus sp. The 16S rRNA sequencing method yielded about 1500 bps for each strain where upon the sequence was compared to nucleotide data in Gene Bank using BLASTN 2.2.1 sequence alignment from NCBI for the nucleotide comparison. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for all the seven samples had no sequence variation between the isolates and gave a 100% similarity to plus, plus strand with Streptococcus agalactiae strain A909 Accession number NC_007432.1 and S. agalactiae strain H36B (Accession number AAJS01000007). Also the 16S rRNA sequence showed a high (92-93%) similarity between S. agalactiae and S. equi, S. suis and S. uberis. All strains appeared to be nearly identical to each other after CFA analysis using Library Generation System (LGS) software (MIDI) and were consistent to that of S. agalactiae ATCC 12386, the CFA analysis not only confirmed the results of 16S rRNA sequence but also indicated a possibility of single source of infection.

20415059,"[<e>Fish</e> in renal patient's diet: phosphorus: n-3 fatty acids ratio]OBJECTIVE: To identify between 24 marine fish species the most beneficial to renal patient evaluating its phosphorus:n-3 fatty acids ratio. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15 fishes of each specie were randomly selected; they were filleted and homogenized to take 100 g to carry out the chemical analysis by triplicate. Crude protein (Pr) was analyzed in kjeltec equipment. Potassium and calcium was detected by atomic absorption and phosphorus (P) in an UV/ Visible spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Crude protein (g/100 g) values varied from 15 (pompano) up to 28.2 (big head tile-fish). The fishes with highest (P) (mg/100 g) content were pompano (287), Spanish mackerel (274), king mackerel (257), big head tile-fish (255) and pacific barracuda (252). The specie with the lowest ratio (P): n-3 PUFA was slender frostfish (0.09), followed by albacore (0.17), king mackerel (0.40) and Spanish mackerel; the highest was blue bobo (45.20). Fishes with a high n-3 PUFA/g Pr content were albacore (71.20), king mackerel (35.96), Spanish mackerel (32.50) and rooster hind (2.76). Differences were significant (p &lt; 0.05), in (P) content, in fishes classified by the fat content in muscle (mg P/100 g): lean fishes (193), semi fatty fishes (235) and fatty fishes (244). CONCLUSIONS: None of the following fishes are recommended in renal patient's diet by it lowest contribution of n-3PUFA/g of Pr: blue bobo, yellowedge grouper, parrot sandbass. It is suggested to include chilhuil sea catfish, broomtail grouper, yellow tail snapper, southern flounder, parrot sand bass and big head tilefish by their low content of P/g Pr.

20411732,"Freshwater <e>fish</e>'s spatial patterns in isolated water springs in North-eastern Mexico.The Media Luna lake-spring was selected as representative of all thermal or no thermal springs in the zone of Valley of Rioverde, a semi-arid vegetation in the North-eastern of Mexico. This system is inhabited by 11 fish species, of which six are native. Four of the native species are endemic to the region and threatened due to touristic pressure and to the introduction of exotic species. The objectives were to determine the characteristics that influence the spatial distribution of the fish species, to analyze their spatial distribution patterns, and to describe the relationships between the different species. The general aim was to establish some basis for the conservation of these fish communities and their habitat. Several sessions were initiated in 1992 through direct observation. Later, between 1998 and 1999 five systematically seasonal sampling sessions were conducted (54 subaquatic transects/session). Finally, the data was updated by sampling in summer 2002 and winter 2006. Through the analysis was performed only for endemics of the region, like Ataeniobius toweri Meek, Cualac tessellatus Miller, Cichlasoma bartoni Bean and C. labridens Pellegrin, in at least one life stage, showed correlation with habitat variables or with other species. For these species, patterns of spatial aggregation and association with other species were observed. These results show a certain degree of specialization of endemic species to some microhabitat characteristics, as well as a significant interaction with other native species which they coexist. In addition, some significant relations between endemic and alien species suggest an antagonist relation. Management actions focused in the touristic use of the spring represent the main threat for these species, followed by an adequate management of exotic species. This study provides basis for future responsible management of these wetlands, where tourism and conservation can be combined.",M1

Two main seasonal periods were considered: 1) North Equatorial Counter Current NECC period influence (T1) and 2) California Current CC period influence (T2). In Bahía de Navidad 78 prey taxa were identified in the stomachs. From July to December (T1), 64 prey taxa were found, and from January to June (T2), 45 prey items. In Bahía de Chamela 93 prey items were identified; 74 during T1 and 60 during T2. The highest prey number was found in the stomachs of M. dentatus during T1 in Bahía de Navidad and the lowest prey number (7) was recorded in H. flaviguttatum in Bahía de Navidad in the same period. Crustaceans were the most frequently recorded prey items, followed by fishes, mollusks, polychaetes, and echinoderms in both seasonal periods and sites. The six fish species studied are considered as specialist feeders due the low values of the niche breadth index. There was little similarity among the diets.",M1

We characterized the cryptobenthic reef fish community associated with coral reef in Los Roques National Park during six week surveys. The study included 11 locations in which these fish were registered in transects of 10 x 2 m. Specimens were collected using the suction method and a fine-mesh net. A total of 31 species of six families were collected (four Blenniidae, six Chaenopsidae, one Gobiesocidae, 12 Gobiidae, seven Labrisomidae and one Tripterygiidae). Six represented new records to the park, and Coralliozetus cardonae (Chaenopsidae) was a new record for Venezuela. The most important families were Gobiidae, Chaenopsidae and Labrisomidae. Cryptic fish assemblages changed with the reef environments, with a clear distribution pattern: some species were only observed in shallow areas of less than 5 m depth, while in fringing and barrier reef areas, other species were present and differentially distributed between the reef crest and the seaward slope. These patterns probably are related to the close association that these small fish maintain with the benthos.",M1
20410471,"Parathyroid hormone-related protein-stanniocalcin antagonism in regulation of bicarbonate secretion and calcium precipitation in a marine <e>fish</e> intestine.Bicarbonate secretion in the intestine (duodenum) of marine fish has been suggested to play a major role in regulation of calcium availability for uptake. However, while the end process may lead to carbonate precipitation, regulation of transport of calcium and/or bicarbonate may actually result in fine-tuning of calcium availability for transport. To test this hypothesis, sea bream (Sparus auratus) duodenal preparations were mounted in Ussing-type chambers and the effect of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and stanniocalcin 1 (STC 1) on the control of intestinal bicarbonate secretion and calcium transport was analyzed. As expected, PTHrP increased net calcium uptake, as a result of an increase of calcium uptake without changes in calcium efflux. In contrast, purified sea bream STC 1 caused a minor decrease of calcium uptake and a two- to threefold increase in calcium efflux. As a result, STC 1 was able to invert the calcium flux from net calcium uptake to net calcium loss, which is in keeping with its known actions as a hypocalcemic factor. Furthermore, both PTHrP and STC 1 regulate intestinal bicarbonate secretion. PTHrP increased calcium uptake and simultaneously reduced the single factor that induces calcium precipitation, bicarbonate secretion. In contrast, STC 1, while reversing the calcium net flux to make it secretory, promoted intestinal bicarbonate secretion, both actions directed to decrease the calcium gradient across the epithelium and promote immobilization in the form of bicarbonate in the intestinal lumen. Together our results provide robust evidence to support an antagonistic action of PTHrP and STC 1 in the fine control of movements of both calcium and bicarbonate in the intestine of seawater fish.",M1

20409163,"Genomic approaches with natural <e>fish</e> populations.Natural populations v. inbred stocks provide a much richer resource for identifying the effects of nucleotide substitutions because natural populations have greater polymorphism. Additionally, natural populations offer an advantage over most common research organisms because they are subject to natural selection, and analyses of these adaptations can be used to identify biologically important changes. Among fishes, these analyses are enhanced by having a wide diversity of species (&gt;28 000 species, more than any other group of vertebrates) living in a huge range of environments (from below freezing to &gt; 46 degrees C, in fresh water to salinities &gt;40 ppt.). Moreover, fishes exhibit many different life-history and reproductive strategies and have many different phenotypes and social structures. Although fishes provide numerous advantages over other vertebrate models, there is still a dearth of available genomic tools for fishes. Fishes make up approximately half of all known vertebrate species, yet &lt;0.2% of fish species have significant genomic resources. Nonetheless, genomic approaches with fishes have provided some of the first measures of individual variation in gene expression and insights into environmental and ecological adaptations.

20405802,"The role of spatial dynamics in the stability, resilience, and productivity of an estuarine <e>fish</e> population.Understanding mechanisms that support long-term persistence of populations and sustainability of productive fisheries is a priority in fisheries management. Complex spatial structure within populations is increasingly viewed as a result of a plastic behavioral response that can have consequences for the dynamics of a population. We incorporated spatial structure and environmental forcing into a population model to examine the consequences for population stability (coefficient of variation of spawning-stock biomass), resilience (time to recover from disturbance), and productivity (spawning-stock biomass). White perch (Morone americana) served as a model species that exhibits simultaneous occurrence of migratory and resident groups within a population. We evaluated the role that contingents (behavioral groups within populations that exhibit divergent life histories) play in mitigating population responses to unfavorable environmental conditions. We used age-structured models that incorporated contingent-specific vital rates to simulate population dynamics of white perch in a sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay, USA. The dynamics of the population were most sensitive to the proportion of individuals within each contingent and to a lesser degree to the level of correlation in recruitment between contingents in their responses to the environment. Increased representation of the dispersive contingent within populations resulted in increased productivity and resilience, but decreased stability. Empirical evidence from the Patuxent River white perch population was consistent with these findings. A high negative correlation in resident and dispersive contingent recruitment dynamics resulted in increased productivity and stability, with little effect on resilience. With high positive correlation between contingent recruitments, the model showed similar responses in population productivity and resilience, but decreased stability. Because contingent structure involves differing patterns of nursery habitat use, spatial management that conserves sets of habitats rather than the single most productive nursery habitat would be expected to contribute to long-term population stability.",M1
20405801,"Tuning stochastic matrix models with hydrologic data to predict the population dynamics of a riverine <e>fish</e>.We developed stochastic matrix models to evaluate the effects of hydrologic alteration and variable mortality on the population dynamics of a lotic fish in a regulated river system. Models were applied to a representative lotic fish species, the flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), for which two populations were examined: a native population from a regulated reach of the Coosa River (Alabama, USA) and an introduced population from an unregulated section of the Ocmulgee River (Georgia, USA). Size-classified matrix models were constructed for both populations, and residuals from catch-curve regressions were used as indices of year class strength (i.e., recruitment). A multiple regression model indicated that recruitment of flathead catfish in the Coosa River was positively related to the frequency of spring pulses between 283 and 566 m3/s. For the Ocmulgee River population, multiple regression models indicated that year class strength was negatively related to mean March discharge and positively related to June low flow. When the Coosa population was modeled to experience five consecutive years of favorable hydrologic conditions during a 50-year projection period, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.2% annual rate. When modeled to experience five years of unfavorable hydrologic conditions, the Coosa population initially exhibited a decrease in size but later stabilized and increased at a 0.4% annual rate following the decline. When the Ocmulgee River population was modeled to experience five years of favorable conditions, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.4% annual rate. After the Ocmulgee population experienced five years of unfavorable conditions, a sharp decline in population size was predicted. However, the population quickly recovered, with population size increasing at a 0.3% annual rate following the decline. In general, stochastic population growth in the Ocmulgee River was more erratic and variable than population growth in the Coosa River. We encourage ecologists to develop similar models for other lotic species, particularly in regulated river systems. Successful management of fish populations in regulated systems requires that we are able to predict how hydrology affects recruitment and will ultimately influence the population dynamics of fishes.",M1
20405798,"Habitat degradation and fishing effects on the size structure of coral reef <e>fish</e> communities.Overfishing and habitat degradation through climate change pose the greatest threats to sustainability of marine resources on coral reefs. We examined how changes in fishing pressure and benthic habitat composition influenced the size spectra of island-scale reef fish communities in Lau, Fiji. Between 2000 and 2006 fishing pressure declined in the Lau Islands due to declining human populations and reduced demand for fresh fish. At the same time, coral cover declined and fine-scale architectural complexity eroded due to coral bleaching and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci. We examined the size distribution of reef fish communities using size spectra analysis, the linearized relationship between abundance and body size class. Spatial variation in fishing pressure accounted for 31% of the variation in the slope of the size spectra in 2000, higher fishing pressure being associated with a steeper slope, which is indicative of fewer large-bodied fish and/or more small-bodied fish. Conversely, in 2006 spatial variation in habitat explained 53% of the variation in the size spectra slopes, and the relationship with fishing pressure was much weaker (approximately 12% of variation) than in 2000. Reduced cover of corals and lower structural complexity was associated with less steep size spectra slopes, primarily due to reduced abundance of fish &lt; 20 cm. Habitat degradation will compound effects of fishing on coral reefs as increased fishing reduces large-bodied target species, while habitat loss results in fewer small-bodied juveniles and prey that replenish stocks and provide dietary resources for predatory target species. Effective management of reef resources therefore depends on both reducing fishing pressure and maintaining processes that encourage rapid recovery of coral habitat.",M1

OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between intakes of total meat, red meat, processed meat, poultry, and fish and ovarian cancer risk. DESIGN: Data came from 2 Australian population-based case-control studies conducted 10 y apart. Analyses included a total of 2049 cases and 2191 control subjects. We obtained dietary information via a food-frequency questionnaire. We estimated multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for each study by using logistic regression and combined results of the 2 studies by using random-effects models. We also assembled the published evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Although there was no association between total or red meat intake and ovarian cancer risk, women with the highest intake of processed meat had a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer in the 2 case-control studies (combined OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.21) and the meta-analysis [7 studies; pooled relative risk (RR): 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.34]. In contrast, a frequent intake of poultry was associated with borderline significant reductions in risk in the 2 case-control studies (combined OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.03) and the meta-analysis including 7 additional studies (pooled RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.01). High fish intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk in the 2 case-control studies (combined OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.94) and a smaller borderline significant reduction in the meta-analysis (6 additional studies; pooled RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.03). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that low consumption of processed meat and higher consumption of poultry and fish may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.",M1

Here we investigate the relative contribution of seasonality in irradiance and prey abundance in shaping the rapid seasonal body condition increase of a migrating predator searching visually for its prey: the Norwegian spring-spawning herring, Clupea harengus, feeding on the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Two main seasonal pulses of prey are available to herring: (1) the parent generation of C. finmarchicus, with peak abundance in March-April, which appear too early to cause the main increase in herring condition; and (2) the abundant offspring generation of C. finmarchicus, with peak abundance in June-July, too late to explain the main increase in body condition. However, a mechanistic model of ingestion rate, including both solar irradiance and prey abundance, predicted seasonal food intake in good accordance with observed herring body condition. This suggests that the seasonality in herring foraging and energy storage is closely linked to the return of longer days in spring, and less dependent on a match or mismatch with seasonal peaks in abundance of their zooplankton prey. Consequently, light related constraints on foraging may make visually searching predators at high latitudes resilient to changes and fluctuations in prey phenology and abundance, but vulnerable to changes in the light regime, such as water clarity.",M1
20391913,"Effect of cadmium on the susceptibility of Tubifex tubifex to Myxobolus cerebralis (Myxozoa), the causative agent of whirling disease.Environmental pollutants alter a wide range of host-parasite interactions in various ways. In some cases, pollution leads to a significant increase in parasite abundance, causing epidemics of parasitic diseases. In other cases, toxicants restrict the transmission success of parasites, resulting in reduction of their abundance. However, very little is known regarding whether and to what extent aquatic pollution affects myxozoan obligate parasites commonly found in <e>fish</e>. We investigated the effect of cadmium (Cd) on the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex infected with the myxozoan Myxobolus cerebralis. The oligochaetes were experimentally exposed to M. cerebralis myxospores and kept in various concentrations of Cd for 4 mo. Neither survival nor reproduction of the worms was affected by the metal, but infection prevalence and numbers of triactinosmyxon spores produced by individual worms were higher in the Cd-exposed group than the unexposed control. A comparative assay of a lethal Cd concentration (LC50) on infected and non-infected T. tubifex revealed that infected worms are more resistant to the acute toxicity of Cd, probably because uptake of Cd was reduced by the infection. These results suggest that the abundance of M. cerebralis likely increases in polluted waters and escalates the risk of whirling disease in the respective area.",M1
20391912,"Myxobolus neurophilus: morphologic, histopathologic and molecular characterization.Archived tissues from affected yellow perch Perca flavescens, as well as fresh submissions of juvenile yellow perch, walleye, fathead minnows, golden shiners and smallmouth bass cultured in the same pond or from a shared water source were examined for the presence of Myxobolus neurophilus. Archived tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with Giemsa, revealing myxozoan spores consistent with M. neurophilus. The myxospores were found beneath the ependymal lining of the central canal of the brain or free within the stratum periventriculare, with minimal or no inflammation. Unstained and stained (Wright Giemsa or Lugol's iodine) touch impressions of the brains from fresh submissions of all 5 <e>fish</e> species revealed similar myxozoan spores only in the brains of yellow perch. These were Giemsa-positive, with no iodinophilous vacuoles evident. Portions of the affected brains were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin and sectioned for histology. Pseudocysts containing myxospores were only evident in sections of the brains and spinal cords of yellow perch. Mild mononuclear meningoencephalitis was present when myxospores appeared outside of the pseudocysts. Brains fixed in 5% gluteraldehyde for scanning electron microscopic examination revealed pyriform myxospores with a smooth capsular surface. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 18S small subunit ribosomal DNA gene placed the organism within the family Myxobolidae, with no direct matches to sequences available via GenBank. Aquatic annelids from sediment obtained from the affected pond were negative for actinospores.",M1
20391908,"Evolution of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a <e>fish</e> rhabdovirus, in Europe over 20 years: implications for control.The fish pathogenic rhabdovirus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) causes substantial losses in European aquaculture. IHNV was first detected in Europe in 1987 and has since undergone considerable spread. Phylogenetic analyses of the full G-gene sequences of 73 isolates obtained from 4 countries in Europe (France, n = 18; Italy, 9; Switzerland, 4; Germany, 42) enable determination of the evolution of the virus in Europe since the first detection, and identification of characteristic changes within the G-genes of European strains. Further, the database allows us to analyse the pathways of distribution in Europe over time. The results suggest that in most of the recent cases, spread of IHNV was related to trade of infected fish. The data further demonstrate that knowledge of the sequence is required to determine the source of infections in farms.",M1
20390860,"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls in farmed <e>fish</e>, water, sediment, and feed.This investigation was undertaken to determine the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dizenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in farmed grouper tissues and environmental medium samples, including sediment, water, and feed. The water concentrations of DL-PCBs were low at 4.33-7.63 pg/L, and those of PCDD/Fs were 0.399-0.794 pg/L. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs in sediment samples were 21.4-35.3 pg/g, and those of PCBs were 54.7-100 pg/g. To identify changes in PCDD/Fs and PCBs levels in fish throughout growth, the tissue samples from hatchlings, 2-month, 15-month, 24-month, and 36-month-old orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) were analyzed. In grouper tissue samples, the total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) of the total PCBs were 0.129-0.745 pg World Health Organization- toxicity equivalent (WHO-TEQ/g) wet weight (w.w.), while total PCDD/Fs TEQ were 0.022-0.073 pg WHO-TEQ/g w.w The DL-PCBs were contributed more to the TEQ than PCDD/Fs in all fish tissue samples. Both PCDD/F and DL-PCB concentrations increase as grouper age increased. Results of this study demonstrate that PCDD/Fs and PCBs accumulate in fish tissues, and diet is the main source of PCDD/Fs and PCBs accumulations.",M1

The effect of kairomones released by the crimson-spotted rainbowfish Melanotaenia duboulayi (Castelnau) on the oviposition behavior of the freshwater mosquitoes Culex annulirostris Skuse, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Aedes notoscriptus Skuse was evaluated in both laboratory and outdoor artificial pool experiments. In the laboratory, colony-reared Cx. annulirostris selected against ovipositing in water that had contained M. duboulayi at densities of one fish per 5, 30, 180, and 1,080 liters. In contrast, gravid Ae. notoscriptus showed a preference for water that had contained the highest density of M. duboulayi (1 in 5 liters). Gravid Cx. quinquefasciatus were neither repelled nor attracted to water that had previously contained M. duboulayi. In outdoor artificial pool experiments, wild Cx. annulirostris females selected against ovipositing in pools containing caged M. duboulayi stocked at rates of 1, 4, and 10 g per 1,000 liters. When fish were removed from the pools, the repellent effect persisted for at least 24 h, whereas at the lower stocking rate, an avoidance response was not noted until 48 h after fish were placed in pools. This suggests a volatile substance, however, the exact nature of the kairomone/s has not been identified.",M1

20386204,"Radiometric analysis of samples of domestic <e>fish</e> species and radiological implications.Radiometric analysis of samples of commonly sold fish species in Pakistan were carried out for the measurement of concentrations of naturally occurring and artificial radionuclides. For this purpose, a high resolution Ge detector was employed. Mean concentrations of (226)Ra, (228)Ra, and (40)K in fish samples were 1.3 +/- 0.3, 1.0 +/- 0.2, and 90 +/- 15 Bq kg, respectively, whereas concentration of (137)Cs was not detected. The annual effective dose due to ingestion of these radionuclides through fish diet was evaluated to be 2.3 microSv y(-1). This value of effective dose is found much below the average radiation dose of 0.29 mSv y(-1) received per capita worldwide through ingestion of natural radionuclides during the consumption of food assessed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. It is concluded that fish supplies in the markets from the domestic fish farms are free from radiological risks.

20385405,"A comparison of PCB bioaccumulation factors between an arctic and a temperate marine food web.To test how environmental conditions in the Arctic and the resulting ecological adaptations affect accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the marine food web, bioaccumulation of four polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in an arctic (Barents Sea 77 degrees N-82 degrees N) and a temperate marine (Baltic Sea 54 degrees N-62 degrees N) food web were compared. Three different trophic levels were studied (zooplankton, <e>fish</e>, and seal), representing the span from first-level consumer to top predator. Previously published high-quality data on PCB water concentrations in the two areas were used for calculation of bioaccumulation factors (BAF). BAF was calculated as the ratio of the PCB concentration in the organism ([PCB](org); pg/kg lipid) to the dissolved water concentration (C(w); pg/L). The BAF(Arctic):BAF(Temperate) ratios were above 1 for all four PCB congeners in zooplankton (6.4-13.8) and planktivorous fish (2.9-5.0)), whereas the ratios were below 1 in seal. The mean ratio between arctic and temperate BAFs for all trophic levels and congeners (BAF(Arcti):BAF(Temperate)) was 4.8. When the data were corrected for the seawater temperature difference between the two ecosystems, the ratio was 2.0. We conclude that bioaccumulation differences caused by ecological or physiological adaptations of organisms between the two ecosystems were well within a water concentration variability of 50%. Further, our data support the hypothesis that lower seawater temperature lead to a thermodynamically favoured passive partitioning to organic matrices and thus elevated ambient BAFs in the Arctic compared to the Baltic Sea. This would imply that bioaccumulation in the Arctic may be described in the same way as bioaccumulation in temperate regions, e.g. by the use of mechanistic models parameterised for the Arctic.",M1
20384334,"Mercury concentrations in Arctic food fishes reflect the presence of anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), species, and life history.Single-spawning (semelparous) anadromous fishes are known to transport contaminants from marine to freshwater habitats, but little research has been conducted on contaminant biotransport by multiple-spawning (iteroparous) anadromous fishes. We examined the effect of iteroparous, anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) on mercury concentrations ([Hg]) in freshwater biota and compared [Hg] between species and life history types of Arctic charr and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Data from six lakes and one coastal marine area in the Arctic territory of Nunavut, Canada, indicated that 1) lake trout had significantly lower [Hg] in lakes where anadromous Arctic charr were present; 2) [Hg] was significantly lower in recently discovered anadromous lake trout than in resident lake trout; and 3) regardless of life history, Arctic charr had significantly lower [Hg] than lake trout. These differences were explained by <e>fish</e> condition, age-at-size, and C:N. Biomagnification of Hg, measured as log(10)[Hg]-delta(15)N slopes, did not differ between lakes with and without anadromous Arctic charr but was significantly higher in freshwater food webs ( approximately 0.2) than in the marine food web (0.08). Some biomagnification estimates were affected by correction for fish age and size. In contrast to semelparous anadromous species, biotransport of Hg by anadromous Arctic charr appears to be offset by increased growth of freshwater fishes.",M1
20383527,"Alternative splicing in teleost <e>fish</e> genomes: same-species and cross-species analysis and comparisons.Alternative splicing (AS) is a mechanism by which the coding diversity of the genome can be greatly increased. Rates of AS are known to vary according to the complexity of eukaryotic species potentially explaining the tremendous phenotypic diversity among species with similar numbers of coding genes. Little is known, however, about the nature or rate of AS in teleost fish. Here, we report the characteristics of AS in teleost fish and classification and frequency of five canonical AS types. We conducted both same-species and cross-species analysis utilizing the Genome Mapping and Alignment Program (GMAP) and an AS pipeline (ASpipe) to study AS in four genome-enabled species (Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Takifugu rubripes) and one species lacking a complete genome sequence, Ictalurus punctatus. AS frequency was lowest in the highly duplicated genome of zebrafish (17% of mapped genes). The compact genome of the pufferfish showed the highest occurrence of AS (approximately 43% of mapped genes). An inverse correlation between AS frequency and genome size was consistent across all analyzed species. Cross-species comparisons utilizing zebrafish as the reference genome allowed the identification of additional putative AS genes not revealed by zebrafish transcripts. Approximately, 50% of AS genes identified by same-species comparisons were shared among two or more species. A searchable website, the Teleost Alternative Splicing Database, was created to allow easy identification and visualization of AS transcripts in the studied teleost genomes. Our results and associated database should further our understanding of alternative splicing as an important functional and evolutionary mechanism in the genomes of teleost fish.",M1
20383378,"PAHs and n-alkanes in Mediterranean coastal marine sediments: aquaculture as a significant point source.The occurrence of polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in <e>fish</e> feed, sediment trap material and marine sediments was examined at two fish farms in the eastern Mediterranean. The average (min-max) concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish feed and particulate effluents were 316 (287-351) ng g(-1) DW and 487 (475-499) ng g(-1) DW, respectively. Lower PAH levels were determined in the underlying marine sediments. In the surface sediments under the farms (0 m distance from the edge of the cages) and in the immediate vicinity, the concentration levels of n-alkanes and PAHs were significantly higher than in the surrounding sediments in both sites. PAHs and n-alkanes individual component profiles of fish feed and sinking material were similar with the corresponding profiles of the sediment samples collected in the immediate vicinity around the cages. On a daily basis, the average PAH sedimentation fluxes under the cages was 24.4 microg m(-2) d(-1), which is considerably higher compared with the observed PAH sedimentary fluxes in the open eastern Mediterranean. Our results imply that fish farming is a significant source of these persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the marine environment and therefore a likely change in the scale of production might introduce new sources of environmental risk. Further work is required in order to develop an appropriate monitoring system for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector.",M1
20383376,"Organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers in marine and fresh water biota and in human milk.The levels and relative proportions of 11 organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers (OPs), some of which are reportedly toxic to aquatic organisms, were investigated in human breast milk and samples of <e>fish</e> and mussels from Swedish lakes and coastal areas in order to assess spatial differences in environmental exposure and spatial and temporal differences in human exposure. Some of the biota samples were collected at locations with known potential sources of OPs, but most were collected in background locations. Tris-2-chloroisopropyl phosphate (TCPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) dominated in the biota with levels ranging from 170 to 770 ng g(-1) for TCPP in perch and between 21 and 180 ng g(-1) for TPP. In milk samples, TCPP (median 45 ng g(-1)) and tributyl phosphate (median 12 ng g(-1)) were the most frequently occurring OPs. Among samples of fish from background locations, the concentrations and profiles of most OPs were quite similar, indicating that their sources were diffuse. However, in fish from sample locations near known sources, there were marked differences in OP concentrations and profiles. Fish from a stream receiving surface water from Arlanda airport displayed high levels of OPs (10 200 ng g(-1)) that are commonly used in aircraft hydraulic fluids. Fish collected at points 1 or 2 km downstream of sewage treatment plants showed significantly higher levels of tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), one of the most typically abundant OP in effluents from such plants. In the milk samples obtained from women in different towns no distinct differences were detected in OP concentrations or profiles. However, the levels of TBEP tended to be higher in milk collected 10 years ago than in milk collected more recently. However, human exposure to OPs through eating fish or to breastfeeding babies seems to be of minor importance in relation to other potential sources, such as indoor dust inhalation and ingestion.",M1

20380213,"Sublethal predators and their injured prey: linking aquatic predators and severe limb abnormalities in amphibians.While many predators completely consume their prey, others feed only on blood or tissue without killing the prey, sometimes causing ecologically significant levels of injury. We investigated the importance of sublethal predator attacks in driving an emerging issue of conservation importance: missing-limb deformities in amphibians. We combined long-term field data and manipulative experiments to evaluate the role of sublethal predation in causing abnormalities in two regions of central Oregon, U.S.A. Since 1988, western toads (Bufo boreas) in Lake Aspen have exhibited abnormalities dominated by partially missing limbs and digits at annual frequencies from &lt;1% to 35%. On Broken Top volcano, we found comparable types and frequencies of abnormalities in Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae). Field sampling and observational data implicated two aquatic predators in these abnormality phenomena: introduced sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) at Lake Aspen and corduliid dragonfly larvae (Somatochlora albicincta) at Broken Top. In experiments, these predators produced limb abnormalities identical to those observed in the respective regions. At Lake Aspen, in situ predator exclosures effectively eliminated abnormalities in toads, while comparisons among years with low and high stickleback abundance and between wetlands with and without sticklebacks reinforced the link between <e>fish</e> and amphibian abnormalities. Neither trematode parasite infection nor pesticide contamination could explain observed abnormalities. Our results suggest that predators are an important explanation for missing-limb abnormalities and highlight the ecological significance of sublethal predation in nature.",M1
20380209,"Algal populations controlled by <e>fish</e> herbivory across a wave exposure gradient on southern temperate shores.Consumers that forage across habitats can affect communities by altering the abundance and distribution of key species. In marine communities, studies of trophic interactions have generally focused on the effects of herbivorous and predatory invertebrates on benthic algae and mussel populations. However, large mobile consumers that move across habitats, such as fishes, can strongly affect community dynamics through consumption of habitat-dominating species, but their effects often vary over environmental gradients. On temperate rocky shores, herbivorous fishes are generally a small part of the fish fauna compared to the tropics, and there is sparse evidence that they play a major direct role in algal community dynamics, particularly of large brown algae that dominate many reefs. In New Zealand, however, a wide-ranging herbivorous fish, Odax pullus, feeds exclusively on macroalgae, including Durvillaea antarctica, a large low-intertidal fucoid reaching 10 m in length and 70 kg in mass. In four experiments we tested the extent of fish herbivory and how it was affected by algal canopy structure across a gradient of wave exposure at multiple sites. Exclusion experiments showed that fish impacts greatly reduced the cover and biomass of Durvillaea and that these effects decreased with increasing wave stress and algal canopy cover, effectively restricting the alga to exposed conditions. Almost all plants were entirely removed by fish where there was a sparse algal canopy in sheltered and semi-exposed sites, but there was significantly less grazing in exposed sites. Recruit Durvillaea beneath canopies were less affected by fish grazing, but they grew slowly. Successful natural recruitment, therefore, occurred almost exclusively on exposed shores outside canopies where many plants escaped severe grazing, and growth to maturity was far greater than elsewhere. Such large and direct impacts on the local and regional distribution of large brown algal populations by mobile vertebrate consumers are rare and were mediated by an environmental gradient and plant density, both of which interact with algal demographics. The study highlights that, even though herbivorous fish diversity may be low, the impacts of particular species may still be high, even in cool temperate waters where fish herbivory is usually considered to be minimal.",M1
20377310,"Birth defects in wildlife: the role of environmental contaminants as inducers of reproductive and developmental dysfunction.The etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes is not well understood. Wildlife observations provide considerable evidence that environmental contaminants can play a critical role in reproductive and developmental dysfunction. Early evidence leading to a widespread awareness of the impact of environmental chemicals on surrounding wildlife was observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes. A suite of reproductive and congenital defects was identified in birds, reptiles, and mammals alike that were attributed to high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and industrial chemicals. Due to the ubiquitous and persistent nature of many anthropogenic chemicals, these defects, including thyroid dysfunction, hatching success, egg shell thinning, and gross birth deformities, have since been identified in numerous wildlife populations across the world. Certain wildlife taxa such as amphibians are especially vulnerable to chemical perturbation and are suffering alarming population declines. Amphibian field studies have found severe hindlimb and other developmental abnormalities and it has been demonstrated that the greater the agricultural intensity, the greater the number and severity of defects in toad populations. Alligators living in contaminated lakes have shown a significant reduction in penis size and <e>fish</e> exposed to tributyltin have shown tail deformities and abnormal eye development. Physiological and molecular responses to chemical insult are often conserved across vertebrates, alerting scientists and medical professionals alike that greater attention needs to be paid to the roles environmental contaminants play in the etiology of congenital disorders in both humans and wildlife.",M1

Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most commonly used methods to evaluate oxidative stress. The present study examines the potential correlations between LPO in liver, muscle, and gill and the presence of helminths in Astyanax aeneus from a subtropical river in Mexico. Five helminth species were identified: the trematodes Uvulifer ambloplitis, a subdermal larval parasite, and Clinostomum complanatum, which infected the base of the gills; the nematodes Contracaecum sp. and Spiroxys sp.; and the acanthocephalan Polymorphus sp. The latter 3 species occurred in the posterior half of the intestine. Total helminth abundance was highest in April and July. Helminth species richness increased along a gradient from the headwaters to the middle reaches of the river. An integrated biomarker response for LPO (IBR-LPO) was assessed in the 3 tissues analyzed. IBR-LPO peaked in July. A direct correlation was found between gill and muscle LPO and mean abundance of Clinostomum complanatum, Contracaecum sp., and orthophosphate values, as well as between liver LPO and mean abundance of Polymorphus sp., whereas no relationship was found between LPO and U. ambloplitis or Spiroxys sp. This research revealed an association of both orthophosphate values and the presence or abundance of parasites with oxidative stress levels in A. aeneus, without any causal association, but rather as a result of synergistic processes associated with these variables.",M1

Samples were solubilized with NaOH at 70 degrees C and degreased of fat components by chloroform and hexane. Hydrobromic acid (HBr) was used to acidify the solubilized solution to form MeHgBr with high solvent transferability. The fraction containing MeHg-L-cysteine complexes in aqueous solution, which had been reverse-extracted from the toluene layer, were determined as MeHg. Recoveries of MeHgBr were approximately equal 95% with little variation. Analytical values for standards materials for hair and fish using the present method agreed well with certified values.",M1

Matrices analyzed included <e>fish</e> fillet, fish feed, fish oil and linseed oil, their fat content ranged from 5% to 100%. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) (using Florisil and silica cartridges) and normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography were tested for an efficient clean-up in order to obtain sample extracts free of interfering compounds. Combining sulphuric acid digestion and SPE with Florisil led to the highest efficiency in the elimination of interferences from the extracts. The sample procedure developed, together with the application of GC-(NCI)MS for measurement, led to the satisfactory determination of PBDEs at microg kg(-1) levels in complex aquaculture matrices with high lipid content. The use of a short and thin film-thickness fused-silica capillary column allowed to determine the problematic BDE 209 with satisfactory results. Three m/z ions were acquired for each analyte, which ensured a reliable identification of compounds detected in samples.",M1

We assessed the relationship of 4 common dietary patterns to the risk of breast cancer using the UK Women's Cohort Study (UKWCS). A total of 35,372 women aged between 35 to 69 yr were recruited from 1995 to 1998. The UKWCS was selected to have a wide range of dietary intakes; 28% were self-reported vegetarian. Diet was assessed at baseline by a 217-item food frequency questionnaire. Four dietary patterns were defined based on a hierarchy of consumption of <e>fish</e> and meat to reflect commonly consumed dietary patterns. Hazards ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for known confounders. Subjects were followed up for a mean of 9 yr, and 330 premenopausal and 453 postmenopausal women developed invasive breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, there was a strong inverse association between the fish eating dietary pattern 0.60 (95% CI = 0.38-0.96) but not for a vegetarian pattern 0.85 (95% CI = 0.58-1.25) compared to red meat eaters.

To investigate the effect of estrogen exposure on steroid homeostasis, we exposed roach (Rutilus rutilus) to EE2 (1-29 ng/L) for 18 days and analyzed steroid profiles in bile and plasma using targeted analyses and in liver and gonadal tissues using mass spectrometry metabolite profiling techniques (metabolomics). Exposure to EE2 resulted in a concentration dependent reduction of estrogens and androgens in bile and plasma of both male and female fish. At 10 ngEE2/L, significant reductions in concentrations of hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, 11-hydroxyandrostenedione, and 11-ketotestosterone were detected in the testes metabolome, indicating disruption of steroid biosynthesis upstream of androgen metabolism. Estrogen exposure also resulted in increased biosynthesis of cortisol and cortisone in testes and ovaries, respectively, but did not alter glucocorticoid concentrations in the liver or plasma. This first report on the effect of EE2 exposure on the steroid metabolome in fish tissues suggests that both sex steroid and glucocorticoid pathways are one of the primary targets of estrogen exposure in fish gonads and provides further insights into the mode of action of this endocrine disrupting chemical.",M1
20350001,"Changes in mercury levels in Great Lakes <e>fish</e> between 1970s and 2007.A number of initiatives have curtailed anthropogenic mercury emissions in North America over the last two decades; however, various factors, including long-range transport of global emissions, may complicate the response of fish mercury levels to remedial actions. Since the Great Lakes of North America are together the largest surface freshwater body in the world and are under the influence of many complicating factors, trends of mercury in fish from the Great Lakes can reflect the overall impact of mercury management actions at local, regional, and perhaps global scales. Here we present a comprehensive view of mercury trends in Canadian Great Lakes fish using two large (total 5807 samples), different (fillet and whole fish), and long-term (1970s-2007) monitoring data sets. The spatial differences in lake trout and walleye mercury levels during this period have generally been within a factor of 2-3 with Lakes Erie and Superior having the lowest and highest concentrations, respectively. These spatial differences have diminished in the recent years (2000-2007). The concentrations have generally declined over the three decades (mid-1970s to 2007); however, in recent years, the concentration trends are flat in Lake Ontario walleye and appear to be increasing in Lake Erie walleye. There was a mismatch in the Lake Ontario lake trout and walleye temporal trends, which shows the importance of considering more than one fish species for proper spatial/temporal trend assessments.",M1

20338776,"UVA/UVB-induced genotoxicity and lesion repair in Colossoma macropomum and Arapaima gigas Amazonian <e>fish</e>.Ultraviolet radiation is known to cause adverse effects to aquatic species and aquatic environments. The fish Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) and Arapaima gigas (pirarucu) live in the Amazon basin, near the Equator, and thus receive high intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Deforestation further aggravates the situation by reducing shade at ground level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of UVA and UVB radiation on erythrocytes of tambaqui and pirarucu fish using Micronuclei test and Comet assay. Our study showed that UV radiation caused DNA damage in both species as detected by Comet assay. In addition, there were differences in response to genotoxicity between both species, which are possibly related to their evolutionary history. Tambaqui fish exposed to ultraviolet radiation for different periods presented clear dose-response in DNA damage profile. Significant damage repair was observed 24h after cessation of ultraviolet radiation exposure. At the test conditions used, no significant increase in micronucleated cells was observed in tambaqui and pirarucu fish. Tambaqui proved to be more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation than Pirarucu, as detected by Comet assay, showing statistically higher baseline DNA damage. The present results demonstrated that alkaline Comet assay was very sensitive for detecting the UV-induced genotoxicity during the short exposure period in our study. In addition, the present study also suggests that tambaqui and pirarucu fish are useful sentinel organisms, as their UV sensitivity allows them to be effective monitors of biological hazards in the Amazon region.",M1

20335635,"Marine (n-3) fatty acids, <e>fish</e> consumption, and the 10-year risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease in a large population of Dutch adults with low fish intake.We assessed the dose-response relations within a low range of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and fish intake on fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). In a Dutch population-based cohort study, EPA+DHA and fish intake were assessed at baseline among 21,342 participants aged 20-65 y with no history of MI or stroke. Hazard ratios were calculated with Cox proportional-hazard models. During 9-14 y of follow-up (mean 11.3 y), 647 participants (3%) died, of which 82 of CHD. Fatal CHD mainly comprised MI (64 cases). In total, 252 participants survived an MI. Median intakes in quartiles of EPA+DHA were 40, 84, 151, and 234 mg/d. Medians of fish consumption in quartiles were 1.1, 4.2, 10.7, and 17.3 g/d. Compared with the lowest quartile of EPA+DHA, participants in the top quartile had a 49% lower risk of fatal CHD (95% CI: 6-73%) and a 62% lower risk of fatal MI (95% CI: 23-81%). We observed inverse dose-response relations for EPA+DHA intake and fatal CHD (P-trend = 0.05) and fatal MI (P-trend = 0.01). Results were similar for fish consumption. Nonfatal MI was not associated with EPA+DHA or fish intake. In conclusion, in populations with a low fish consumption, EPA+DHA and fish may lower fatal CHD and MI risk in a dose-responsive manner. Low intakes of EPA+DHA or fish do not seem to protect against nonfatal MI.",M1
20335541,"FADS1 FADS2 gene variants modify the association between <e>fish</e> intake and the docosahexaenoic acid proportions in human milk.BACKGROUND: The genes encoding Delta(5)- and Delta(6)-desaturases (FADS1 FADS2 gene cluster) were reported to be associated with n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) fatty acid proportions in human plasma, tissues, and milk. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can be supplied especially by dietary fish or fish oil and synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid through a pathway involving these desaturases. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether FADS gene variants modify the effect of maternal fish and fish-oil intake on plasma and milk DHA proportions. DESIGN: FADS1 rs174561, FADS2 rs174575, and intergenic rs3834458 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 309 women from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study in The Netherlands. Plasma was collected at 36 wk of pregnancy, and milk was collected at 1 mo postpartum. Fish and fish-oil intake was assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire at 34 wk of pregnancy and updated for the week of milk collection. Gene-diet interactions were tested by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: DHA proportions were lower in women homozygous for the minor allele than in women who were homozygous for the major allele (DHA proportions in plasma phospholipids: P &lt; 0.01; DHA proportions in milk: P &lt; 0.05). Fish intake ranged from 0 to 2.5 portions of fatty fish/wk, and 12 women took fish-oil supplements during pregnancy. DHA proportions in plasma phospholipids increased with increasing fish and fish-oil intake, irrespective of the genotype. DHA proportions in milk increased only with fish and fish-oil intake in the major-allele carriers. CONCLUSION: Lower proportions of DHA in milk from women who were homozygous for the minor allele could not be compensated for by increasing fish and fish-oil intake, possibly because of limited incorporation into milk.",M1

20303850,"Bipedal locomotion in crawling cells.Many complex cellular processes from mitosis to cell motility depend on the ability of the cytoskeleton to generate force. Force-generating systems that act on elastic cytoskeletal elements are prone to oscillating instabilities. In this work, we have measured spontaneous shape and movement oscillations in motile <e>fish</e> epithelial keratocytes. In persistently polarized, fan-shaped cells, retraction of the trailing edge on one side of the cell body is out of phase with retraction on the other side, resulting in periodic lateral oscillation of the cell body. We present a physical description of keratocyte oscillation in which periodic retraction of the trailing edge is the result of elastic coupling with the leading edge. Consistent with the predictions of this model, the observed frequency of oscillation correlates with cell speed. In addition, decreasing the strength of adhesion to the substrate reduces the elastic force required for retraction, causing cells to oscillate with higher frequency at relatively lower speeds. These results demonstrate that simple elastic coupling between movement at the front of the cell and movement at the rear can generate large-scale mechanical integration of cell behavior.",M1
20303571,"Concentrations of organotin compounds in various <e>fish</e> species in the Finnish lake waters and Finnish coast of the Baltic Sea.Organotin compounds (OTCs) leaching from the antifouling paints used in boats and ships have contaminated many water areas worldwide. The purpose of this study was to obtain a general view of the organotin contamination in fish in Finnish lake areas and Finnish coast of the Baltic Sea using perch as the main indicator species. Perch sampling covered areas presumed as less contaminated and areas suspected as more contaminated. Besides perch, 12 other species were sampled from sites presumed as less contaminated. OTCs measured were mono-, di- and tributyltin, mono-, di-, and triphenyltin and dioctyltin. The sum concentration of OTCs (SigmaOTCs) in perch in the least contaminated areas of the Baltic Sea were around 20 ng/g fresh weight (fw) and less than 10 ng/g fw in lake areas. In heavily contaminated areas of the Baltic Sea 150-500 ng/g fw in perch were detected. In lake areas the maximum SigmaOTCs in perch was only 30 ng/g fw. With regard to the other species in the Baltic Sea, salmon, sprat, flounder, whitefish, vendace and lamprey contained low concentrations (SigmaOTCs mainly less than 20 ng/g fw), whereas in pike, pike-perch, burbot and bream concentrations were higher. SigmaOTCs in lake fish were generally lower than in the Baltic Sea. In a distance gradient study, SigmaOTCs in perch decreased quickly from nearly 200 ng/g fw at a contaminated harbor area to 35 ng/g fw during a distance of 5 km. Further decrease was slower and reached 15 ng/g fw at 100 km. In a size dependence study triphenyltin showed better correlation with the fish length than tributyltin for all species studied, i.e. for perch (0.16 vs 0.26), pike-perch (0.13 vs 0.24) and roach (0.46 vs 0.80). High correlation for roach may be partly explained by smaller number of samples collected and small length range.",M1
20303139,"Detection of Dechlorane Plus in <e>fish</e> from urban-industrial rivers.A highly chlorinated flame retardant, Dechlorane Plus (DP), was measured in five fish species collected in 2008 from 22 river sites across South Korea. The sites consisted of 15 urban-industrial areas, three rural-industrial areas, and four rural rivers. Both syn- and anti-DP isomer were consistently detected in all fish samples regardless of sampling sites and fish species. DP has become a widespread environmental pollutant in South Korea. Concentrations of summation operatorDP isomers ranged from 0.61 to 126ngg(-1) lipid, with a mean concentration of 24.5ngg(-1) lipid. The mean summation operatorDP concentrations in the 15 urban sites (36.1+/-35.3ngg(-1) lipid) were approximately 25 times greater than those measured in the rural sites (1.4+/-1.0ngg(-1) lipid). The summation operatorDP concentrations in this study exceeded those determined in fish from the Great Lakes. DP exposure to fish is related to urbanization activity. Specific urban areas could be significant source areas of DP exposure, even in the absence of a local DP manufacturing facility. Concentrations of syn- and anti-DP isomer ranged from 0.17 to 30ngg(-1) lipid and 0.44 to 97ngg(-1) lipid, respectively. The anti-DP isomer was dominant in all samples. However, the mean f(anti) value for urban-industrial samples (0.67+/-0.060) was significantly lower than that of the technical DP standard (f(anti)=0.75; p=0.032). This observation supports that DP isomers exhibit different bioaccumulation behaviors and that syn-DP isomer more easily accumulates in biota samples than anti-DP isomer does.",M1
20297812,"Mercury contamination in <e>fish</e> in midcontinent great rivers of the United States: importance of species traits and environmental factors.We measured mercury (Hg) concentrations in whole fish from the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers to characterize the extent and magnitude of Hg contamination and to identify environmental factors influencing Hg accumulation. Concentrations were generally lower (80% of values between 20-200 ng g(-1) wet weight) than those reported for other regions (e.g., upper Midwest and Northeast U.S.). Mercury exceeded the risk threshold for belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon, the most sensitive species considered) in 33-75% of river length and 1-7% of river length for humans. Concentrations were lower in the Missouri than in the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, consistent with continental-scale patterns in atmospheric Hg deposition. Body size and trophic guild were the best predictors of Hg concentrations, which were highest in large-bodied top predators. Site geochemical and landscape properties were weakly related with fish Hg. Moreover, relationships often ran contrary to conventional wisdom, and the slopes of the relationships (positive or negative) were inconsistent among fish guilds and rivers. For example, sulfate is positively associated with fish Hg concentrations but was negatively correlated with Hg in five of six regression models of tissue concentrations. Variables such as pH, acid neutralizing capacity, and total phosphorus did not occur at levels associated with high fish Hg concentrations, partially explaining the relatively low Hg values we observed.",M1

20232082,"Sensitive and rapid detection of Clonorchis sinensis infection in <e>fish</e> by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).The fish-borne clonorchiasis caused by the oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis is endemic in a number of countries with over 35 million people being infected globally. Rapid and accurate detection of C. sinensis in its intermediate host fish is important for the control and prevention of clonorchiasis in areas where the disease is endemic. In the present study, we established a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) approach for the sensitive and rapid detection of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish. The specificity and sensitivity of primers designed from the C. sinensis cathepsins B3 gene were evaluated, and specific amplification products were obtained with C. sinensis, while no amplification products were detected with DNA of related trematodes, demonstrating the specificity of the assay. The LAMP assay was proved to be 100 times more sensitive than a conventional polymerase chain reaction for detection of C. sinensis. The established LAMP assay provides a useful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of C. sinensis in fish, which has important implications for the effective control of human clonorchiasis.",M1

Molecular characterization based on the GCAT genus specific gene showed that only 90 (75.6%) strains belonged to the genus Aeromonas. The 16S rDNA-RFLP method identified correctly most of the strains with the exception of a few that belonged to A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida or A. piscicola. Separation of these 3 species was correctly assessed with the rpoD gene sequences, which revealed that 5 strains with the RFLP pattern of A. salmonicida belonged to A. piscicola, as did 1 strain with the pattern of A. bestiarum. Correct phenotypic identification occurred in only 32 (35.5%) of the 90 strains. Only 14 (21.8%) of the 64 phenotypically identified A. hydrophila strains belonged to this species. However, coincident results were obtained in 88% (15/17) of the genetically identified A. salmonicida strains. Phenotypic tests were re-evaluated on the 90 genetically characterized Aeromonas strains and there were contradictions in the species A. sobria for a number of previously published species-specific traits. After genetic identification, the prevailing species were A. sobria, A. salmonicida, A. bestiarum, A. hydrophila, A. piscicola and A. media but we could also identify a new isolate of the recently described species A. tecta. This work emphasizes the need to rely on the 16S rDNA-RFLP method and sequencing of housekeeping genes such as rpoD for the correct identification of Aeromonas strains.",M1
20227703,"Improved compatibility of liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for tracing occurrence of barbital homologous residues in animal tissues.This work describes a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedure for multiplex screening, ultratrace quantification and reliable confirmation of barbital series residues in animal-derived food matrices. The method is developed based on a distinct dependency of the electrospray ionization (ESI) response of nine structural homologues on LC eluent properties and gas-phase ion chemistry during the ESI process. The  wrong-way-round  negative ionization aspect has been explored to optimize the compatibility of the hyphenated LC-MS/MS technique, which facilitates detection limits at 30-100-fold lower than 0.01 ppm without derivatization or post-column basification step. A mobile phase using methanol modified with 0.01% acetic acid is adopted to achieve an approximately 2-9-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio over the results under suboptimal conditions. There is no significant differential matrix effects or deuterium isotope effects on chromatographic retention and ESI responsiveness at all levels across the different analyte-matrix pairs. Mean recoveries ranged from 79.6% (barbital) to 108% (secobarbital) at fortified levels of 0.5-20 ng/g within relative standard deviations less than 11%. Between-run repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 3-11% and 5-13%, respectively. An ion ratio criterion for valid detection limit data for simultaneous screening of homologous multiresidues in complex sample matrices is proposed. The satisfactory applicability of the newly described procedure to 43 real samples including pork, poultry meat, swine liver, <e>fish</e> tissue and shrimp muscle demonstrated the LC-MS/MS technique with facile sample handling can serve as an attractive alternative analytical method accepted for regulatory purpose.",M1

20225984,"Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment: a critical review of the evidence for health effects in <e>fish</e>.The authors review the current data on the presence and reported biological effects in fish of some of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment; namely nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), fibrates, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), azoles, and antibiotics. Reported biological effects in fish in the laboratory have often been shown to be in accordance with known effects of pharmaceuticals in mammals. Water concentrations at which such effects have been reported, however, are generally, between microg L(-1) and mg L(-1), typically at least 1 order of magnitude higher than concentrations normally found in surface waters (ng L(-1)). There are exceptions to this, however, as for the case of synthetic oestrogens, which can induce biological effects in the low ng L(-1) range. Although generally effect levels for pharmaceuticals are higher than those found in the environment, the risks to wild fish populations have not been thoroughly characterised, and there has been a lack of consideration given to the likely chronic nature of the exposures, or the potential for mixture effects. As global consumption of pharmaceuticals rises, an inevitable consequence is an increased level of contamination of surface and ground waters with these biologically active drugs, and thus in turn a greater potential for adverse effects in aquatic wildlife.",M1

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association of fish and EPA plus DHA intakes with coronary calcification in a general older population. DESIGN: Diet was assessed between 1990 and 1993 by using a semiquantitative 170-item food-frequency questionnaire. Coronary calcification was assessed approximately 7 y later by electron-beam computed tomography in 1570 asymptomatic cardiac subjects with complete dietary data (44% men, mean age of 64 y). Calcium scores according to Agatston's method were divided into &lt; or = 10 (no/minimal coronary calcification), 11-400 (mild/moderate calcification), and &gt; 400 (severe calcification). Prevalence ratios (PRs) for mild/moderate and severe calcification were obtained in categories of fish and EPA plus DHA intake. PRs were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and dietary factors. RESULTS: Subjects with a fish intake &gt; 19 g/d had a significantly lower prevalence of mild/moderate calcification (PR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.98; full model) than did subjects who consumed no fish. Subjects with a high fish intake also had a lower prevalence of severe calcification (PR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.04), which was borderline statistically significant. EPA plus DHA intake showed no significant associations (PR: 0.93 and 0.97, respectively; P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found a weak inverse association between fish intake and coronary calcification. If confirmed in other population-based studies, more research is warranted to determine which components in fish can inhibit vascular calcification.",M1
20218501,"Egg fatty acid composition from lake trout fed two Lake Michigan prey <e>fish</e> species.We previously demonstrated that there were significant differences in the egg thiamine content in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush fed two Lake Michigan prey fish (alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and bloater Coregonus hoyi). Lake trout fed alewives produced eggs low in thiamine, but it was unknown whether the consumption of alewives affected other nutritionally important components. In this study we investigated the fatty acid composition of lake trout eggs when females were fed diets that resulted in different egg thiamine concentrations. For 2 years, adult lake trout were fed diets consisting of four combinations of captured alewives and bloaters (100% alewives; 65% alewives, 35% bloaters; 35% alewives, 65% bloaters; and 100% bloaters). The alewife fatty acid profile had higher concentrations of arachidonic acid and total omega-6 fatty acids than the bloater profile. The concentrations of four fatty acids (cis-13, 16-docosadienoic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) were higher in bloaters than in alewives. Although six fatty acid components were higher in lake trout eggs in 2001 than in 2000 and eight fatty acids were lower, diet had no effect on any fatty acid concentration measured in lake trout eggs in this study. Based on these results, it appears that egg fatty acid concentrations differ between years but that the egg fatty acid profile does not reflect the alewife-bloater mix in the diet of adults. The essential fatty acid content of lake trout eggs from females fed alewives and bloaters appears to be physiologically regulated and adequate to meet the requirements of developing embryos.",M1
20218498,"Gizzard shad thiaminase activity and its effect on the thiamine status of captive American alligators Alligator mississippiensis.Adult mortality and low egg hatch rate were observed among American alligators Alligator mississippiensis in Lake Griffin, Florida, between 1998 and 2003. Previous studies show that the alligator mortality is due to neurological impairment associated with thiamine (vitamin Bt) deficiency. This study determined the rate of thiaminase activity in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, a <e>fish</e> often eaten by alligators, and examined the thiamine status of captive adult alligators fed only gizzard shad. We found that the thiaminase activity of gizzard shad in Lake Griffin is 16,409 +/- 2,121 pmol/g/min (mean +/- 2SEs). This high rate of thiaminase activity was present in most months and across a wide range of shad sizes. Seven alligators were captured in the wild from Lake Griffin and Lake Woodruff, held in captivity, and fed gizzard shad. We monitored blood and muscle thiamine levels throughout the experiment and liver thiamine at the end. Over a period of 6-12 months, all of the alligators maintained weight but blood and muscle thiamine levels decreased to 25-50% of the original (healthy) values. Three animals with the greatest reduction in thiamine died, demonstrating mobility impairment and neural histopathology similar to those seen in wild alligators in Lake Griffin. Two alligators were fed shad for 10 months but then treated with thiamine. These animals showed a reduction in thiamine while eating shad, but treatment restored their thiamine levels to the initial values, which were comparable to those of normal wild Lake Griffin alligators. We demonstrated that thiamine deficiency can be induced by a diet of gizzard shad and cause neurological signs and death in alligators in captivity. We conclude that the thiaminase activity in gizzard shad is high enough to cause thiamine deficiency in wild alligators when shad are a major part of their diet.",M1
20218495,"Variations of thiaminase I activity pH dependencies among typical Great Lakes forage <e>fish</e> and Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus.The source of thiaminase in the Great Lakes food web remains unknown. Biochemical characterization of the thiaminase I activities observed in forage fish was undertaken to provide insights into potential thiaminase sources and to optimize catalytic assay conditions. We measured the thiaminase I activities of crude extracts from five forage fish species and one strain of Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus over a range of pH values. The clupeids, alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, had very similar thiaminase I pH dependencies, with optimal activity ranges (&gt; or = 90% of maximum activity) between pH 4.6 and 5.5. Rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax and spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius had optimal activity ranges between pH 5.5-6.6. The thiaminase I activity pH dependence profile of P. thiaminolyticus had an optimal activity range between pH 5.4 and 6.3, which was similar to the optimal range for rainbow smelt and spottail shiners. Incubation of P. thiaminolyticus extracts with extracts from bloater Coregonus hoyi (normally, bloaters have little or no detectable thiaminase I activity) did not significantly alter the pH dependence profile of P. thiaminolyticus-derived thiaminase I, such that it continued to resemble that of the rainbow smelt and spottail shiner, with an apparent optimal activity range between pH 5.7 and 6.6. These data are consistent with the hypothesis of a bacterial source for thiaminase I in the nonclupeid species of forage fish; however, the data also suggest different sources of thiaminase I enzymes in the clupeid species.",M1
20217139,"Plate-like permanent dental laminae of upper jaw dentition in adult gobiid <e>fish</e>, Sicyopterus japonicus.Sicyopterus japonicus (Teleostei, Gobiidae) possesses a unique upper jaw dentition different from that known for any other teleosts. In the adults, many (up to 30) replacement teeth, from initiation to attachment, are arranged orderly in a semicircular-like strand within a capsule of connective tissue on the labial side of each premaxillary bone. We have applied histological, ultrastructural, and three-dimensional imaging from serial sections to obtain insights into the distribution and morphological features of the dental lamina in the upper jaw dentition of adult S. japonicus. The adult fish has numerous permanent dental laminae, each of which is an infolding of the oral epithelium at the labial side of the functional tooth and forms a thin plate-like structure with a wavy contour. All replacement teeth of a semicircular-like strand are connected to the plate-like dental lamina by the outer dental epithelium and form a tooth family; neighboring tooth families are completely separated from each other. The new tooth germ directly buds off from the ventro-labial margin of the dental lamina, whereas no distinct free end of the dental lamina is present, even adjacent to this region. Cell proliferation concentrated at the ventro-labial margin of the dental lamina suggests that this region is the site for repeated tooth initiation. During tooth development, the replacement tooth migrates along a semicircular-like strand and eventually erupts through the dental lamina into the oral epithelium at the labial side of the functional tooth. This unique thin plate-like permanent dental lamina and the semicircular-like strand of replacement teeth in the upper jaw dentition of adult S. japonicus probably evolved as a dental adaptation related to the rapid replacement of teeth dictated by the specialized feeding habit of this algae-scraping fish.",M1

20213171,"Determination of organophosphorous flame retardants in <e>fish</e> tissues by matrix solid-phase dispersion and gas chromatography.Organophosphate esters (OPEs), utilized as flame retarding agents and/or plasticizers, are almost ubiquitous in environmental compartments, and biota and foods could be contaminated by bioaccumulation or during the treatment processes. A multiresidue method is proposed for the determination of 13 OPEs in fish tissues: analytes were simultaneously extracted and purified using the matrix solid phase dispersion technique and then determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The main parameters affecting extraction yield and selectivity, such as the type of dispersant material, clean-up co-sorbent, rinse and elution solvents, were evaluated to obtain lipid-free extracts and quantitative recoveries for OPEs. Under optimal conditions, 0.5 g of samples was dispersed with 2 g Florisil and 1 g anhydrous sodium sulphate and transferred to a solid phase extraction cartridge containing 1 g alumina. The lipids were removed using 5 mL n-hexane/dichloromethane (1:1) and analytes were recovered with 10 mL n-hexane/acetone (6:4) and directly analysed. The method developed provided recoveries between 70 and 110% for different kinds of fish, and the day-to-day variability was between 1 and 9%. This procedure constitutes the first analytical method for the analysis of OPEs in a food matrix and it is applicable to analyse a large number of samples to evaluate the occurrence and sources of OPEs in biota and foods.",M1
20212109,"Non-Ca2+-conducting Ca2+ channels in <e>fish</e> skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.During skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, membrane depolarizations activate the sarcolemmal voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.1). Ca(V)1.1 in turn triggers opening of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1) via interchannel protein-protein interaction to release Ca(2+) for myofibril contraction. Simultaneously to this EC coupling process, a small and slowly activating Ca(2+) inward current through Ca(V)1.1 is found in mammalian skeletal myotubes. The role of this Ca(2+) influx, which is not immediately required for EC coupling, is still enigmatic. Interestingly, whole-cell patch clamp experiments on freshly dissociated skeletal muscle myotubes from zebrafish larvae revealed the lack of such Ca(2+) currents. We identified two distinct isoforms of the pore-forming Ca(V)1.1alpha(1S) subunit in zebrafish that are differentially expressed in superficial slow and deep fast musculature. Both do not conduct Ca(2+) but merely act as voltage sensors to trigger opening of two likewise tissue-specific isoforms of RyR1. We further show that non-Ca(2+) conductivity of both Ca(V)1.1alpha(1S) isoforms is a common trait of all higher teleosts. This non-Ca(2+) conductivity of Ca(V)1.1 positions teleosts at the most-derived position of an evolutionary trajectory. Though EC coupling in early chordate muscles is activated by the influx of extracellular Ca(2+), it evolved toward Ca(V)1.1-RyR1 protein-protein interaction with a relatively small and slow influx of external Ca(2+) in tetrapods. Finally, the Ca(V)1.1 Ca(2+) influx was completely eliminated in higher teleost fishes.",M1
20544709,"The application of cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization to fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis and subclassification of renal neoplasms.BACKGROUND: Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is an important diagnostic test for the evaluation and management of selected renal masses. Cytogenetic analysis of cytology specimens can serve as an adjunct for precise classification because certain tumors are associated with specific chromosomal aberrations. This study summarizes our experience with the application of conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) to renal FNA specimens. METHODS: All percutaneous renal FNAs performed during 2005 through 2008 were identified from the electronic pathology database. Results of cytogenetic and FISH analyses were correlated with the final diagnoses of the renal FNAs. RESULTS: A total of 303 renal FNAs were performed. During an onsite assessment, a portion of the cytology specimen was allocated for cytogenetic analysis in 74 cases. Karyotypic analysis or FISH was successful in 44 (59%) of these. Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 27 cases. In 17 cases, a karyotype revealed a combination of trisomies/tetrasomies and in another 5 cases, FISH revealed trisomy 7 and 17, both of which are consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Two cases showed 3p deletions consistent with clear cell RCC. Trisomy 3 was observed in 1 case of clear cell RCC. Monosomy 1 and 17 was observed in a case of papillary RCC comprised oncocytic cells. In 1 case of primary renal synovial sarcoma, FISH revealed a rearrangement at the SYT locus (18q11.2). CONCLUSIONS: Renal FNA specimens are amenable to analysis by cytogenetics and FISH in the diagnosis and subclassification of renal neoplasms.",M2
20514857,"Inherited t(9;22) as the cause of DiGeorge syndrome: a case report.DiGeorge syndrome is associated with microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2. Most cases occur sporadically although vertical transmission has been documented. We report a rare case of DiGeorge syndrome in an 8-year-old girl. Blood sample of the patient was cultured and harvested following standard procedure. All of the 20 cells analysed showed a karyotype of 45, XX, -22, t (9;22) (p23; q11.2). Cytogenetic investigation done on the patient's mother revealed that she was the carrier for the translocation. Her karyotype was 46, XX, t (9;22) (p23; q11.2). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (<e>FISH</e>) analysis using TUPLE1 and N25 (Vysis, USA) probes showed deletion of the 22q11.2 region in the patient, confirming the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. FISH analysis showed no deletion of the region in the mother.",M2
20513957,"Impact of pre-treatments on nitrifying bacterial community analysis from wastewater using fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal scanning laser microscopy.Fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) are the key techniques used to investigate bacterial community structure at wastewater treatment plants. An optimum nitrifying bacterial population is necessary for nitrification, which plays a significant ecological role in regulating the overall quality of water. Nitrifying bacteria mainly appear as dense aggregates within activated sludge flocs. The impacts of five different pre-treatment methods (physical, chemical, enzymatic and combinations) on floc dispersion from two different wastewater treatment plants were determined. The effect of pre-treatment on the enumeration of the nitrifying bacterial population was also investigated. This study on floc dispersion using CSLM images showed sonication was the superior method for all the samples tested, irrespective of the sludge type. For samples from industrial wastewater plants, an optimized sonication level of 8 W for 8 min could reduce the floc size to 10 microm, whereas for domestic wastewater samples, the floc size was reduced to 10 microm at 8 W for 5 min. The maximum number of nitrifying bacterial cells was observed at this optimized level for different samples. A decrease in the number of cells was observed beyond this optimized level for both the plants. The results presented here highlight the importance of optimizing pre-treatment methods for different types of wastewater for accurate bacterial community analysis using FISH-CSLM.",M2
20513536,"Cryptic EWSR1-FLI1 fusions in Ewing sarcoma: potential pitfalls in the diagnostic use of fluorescence in situ hybridization probes.Detection of EWSR1 translocations - particularly t(11;22)(q24;q12) - is of great value in the differential diagnosis of the Ewing family of tumors. We report two cases that highlight the problems and pitfalls of identifying Ewing tumors using conventional chromosome analysis and a commercial EWSR1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) probe. In both cases, the tumor karyotype was abnormal, but a visible t(11;22)(q24;q12) was not present. The commercial EWSR1  break-apart  probe was not split in either case. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, however, identified EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcripts in both tumors, and the gene fusions were corroborated by FISH analysis with  in house  probes and confirmed by sequencing RT-PCR products. The occurrence of cryptic EWSR1-FLI1 fusions mandates that RT-PCR should be performed, particularly in those cases in which the genetic findings are not in agreement with the histologic picture.",M2
20511484,"Evidence for cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization risk stratification of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the era of novel therapie.Overall survival (OS) has improved with increasing use of novel agents in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the disease course remains highly variable, and the heterogeneity largely reflects different genetic abnormalities. We studied the impact of the Mayo risk-stratification model of MM on patient outcome in the era of novel therapies, evaluating each individual component of the model-fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), conventional cytogenetics (CG), and the plasma cell labeling index-that segregates patients into high- and standard-risk categories. This report consists of 290 patients with newly diagnosed MM, predominantly treated with novel agents, who were risk-stratified at diagnosis and were followed up for OS. Of these patients, 81% had received primarily thalidomide (n=50), lenalidomide (n=199), or bortezomib (n=79) as frontline or salvage therapies. Our retrospective analysis validates the currently proposed Mayo risk-stratification model (median OS, 37 months vs not reached for high- and standard-risk patients, respectively; P=.003). Although the FISH or CG test identifies a high-risk cohort with hazard ratios of 2.1 (P=.006) and 2.5 (P=.006), respectively, the plasma cell labeling index cutoff of 3% fails to independently prognosticate patient risk (hazard ratio, 1.4; P=.41). In those stratified as standard-risk by one of the 2 tests (FISH or CG), the other test appears to be of additional prognostic significance. This study validates the high-risk features defined by FISH and CG in the Mayo risk-stratification model for patients with MM predominantly treated with novel therapies based on immunomodulatory agents.",M2
20494259,"Applications of array comparative genomic hybridization in obstetrics.Current prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis uses mostly G-banded karyotyping of fetal cells from chorionic villi or amniotic fluid cultures, which readily detects any aneuploidy and larger structural genomic rearrangements that are more than 4 to 5 megabases in size. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) is also used for rapid detection of the common aneuploidies seen in liveborns. If there is prior knowledge that increases risk for a specific deletion or duplication syndrome, FISH with a probe specific for the region in question is done. Over the past decade, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been developed, which can survey the entire genome for submicroscopic microdeletions and microduplications, in addition to all unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities that are also detected by karyotype. aCGH in essence interrogates the genome with thousands of probes fixed on a slide in a single assay, and has already revolutionized cytogenetic diagnosis in the pediatric population. aCGH is being used increasingly for prenatal diagnosis where it is also beginning to make a significant impact. The authors review here principles of aCGH, its benefits for prenatal diagnosis and associated challenges, primarily the inability to detect balanced chromosomal abnormalities and a small risk for discovery of chromosomal abnormalities of uncertain clinical significance. The superior diagnostic power of aCGH far outweighs these concerns. Furthermore, such issues can be addressed during pre- and posttest counseling, and their impact will further diminish as the technology continues to develop and experience with its prenatal diagnostic use grows.",M2
20472851,"EGFR mutation is a better predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung carcinoma than <e>FISH</e>, CISH, and immunohistochemistry.About 10% of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) respond to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). More than 75% of  responders  have activating mutations in EGFR. However, mutation analysis is not widely available, and proposed alternatives (in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis) have shown inconsistent associations with outcome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), immunohistochemical analysis, and DNA sequencing were compared in this study of 40 NSCLC samples from TKI-treated patients. Response rates were 12 of 19 in EGFR-mutant vs 1 of 20 EGFR wild-type tumors (P = .0001), 7 of 19 FISH+ vs 4 of 17 FISH- tumors (not significant [NS]), 5 of 16 CISH+ vs 6 of 21 CISH- tumors (NS), and 3 of 9 immunohistochemically positive vs 7 of 22 immunohistochemically negative tumors (NS). EGFR mutation was associated with improved progression-free survival (P = .0004). Increased copy number (FISH or CISH) and protein expression (immunohistochemical) did not independently predict outcome. Thus, EGFR sequence analysis was the only method useful for predicting response and progression-free survival following TKI therapy in NSCLC.",M2
20461092,"Improving the yield of circulating tumour cells facilitates molecular characterisation and recognition of discordant HER2 amplification in breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) offer a non-invasive approach to obtain and characterise metastatic tumour cells, but their usefulness has been limited by low CTC yields from conventional isolation methods. METHODS: To improve CTC yields and facilitate their molecular characterisation we compared the Food and Drug Administration-approved CellSearch Epithelial Kit (CEK) to a simplified CTC capture method, CellSearch Profile Kit (CPK), on paired blood samples from patients with metastatic breast (n=75) and lung (n=71) cancer. Molecular markers including Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) were evaluated on CTCs by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (<e>FISH</e>) and compared to patients' primary and metastatic cancer. RESULTS: The median cell count from patients with breast cancer using the CPK was 117 vs 4 for CEK (P&lt;0.0001). Lung cancer samples were similar; CPK: 145 cells vs CEK:4 cells (P&lt;0.0001). Recovered CTCs were relatively pure (60-70%) and were evaluable by FISH and immunofluorescence. A total of 10 of 30 (33%) breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary and metastatic tissue had HER2-amplified CTCs. CONCLUSION: The CPK method provides a high yield of relatively pure CTCs, facilitating their molecular characterisation. Circulating tumour cells obtained using CPK technology demonstrate that significant discordance exists between HER2 amplification of a patient's CTCs and that of the primary and metastatic tumour.",M2
20453912,"The utility and application of real-time PCR and <e>FISH</e> in the detection of single-copy gene targets in Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium.The ultimate specificity in molecular-based assays for pathogen detection relies on the design of the primers and probes. Their ability to hybridize to DNA sequences found only in pathogens can be realized by designing primers and probes that are complementary to pathogen-specific virulence genes. This study evaluates the detection and enumeration strengths of real-time PCR (qPCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for selected waterborne pathogens and their ultimate applicability within a monitoring framework. Detection limits calculated in the qPCR assay were 150 tir (intimin protein receptor) gene copies for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and 2 x 103 invA (inner membrane invasive protein) gene copies for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Detection limits were, however, at least 100-fold less sensitive in wastewater extracts, partly because of the inhibitory effect of the wastewater itself. Fluorescent signals from hybridized whole target cells were below the detection limit of the FISH assay. While this research demonstrates the potential detection strength of qPCR, it highlights the need for strong dependable primer and probe sets among PCR and FISH methodologies as well as the need for further signal amplification with DNA-targeted FISH for single-copy gene targets within environmental samples.",M2
20453476,"Genomic characterization and chromosomal mapping of 5 river buffalo skeletal muscle differentiation master genes.River buffalo (Bubalus bubalis, 2n = 50, BBU) is a species of economic relevance in a number of countries. This species shows a very peculiar biology and a great capacity for environmental adaptation. There has been an increasing economic interest as well as a growing demand for a more detailed knowledge of molecular features in this species. From this perspective we report a genomic, transcriptional and cytogenetic analysis of 5 master genes involved in skeletal muscle development. Of these 5 genes, MYOD1, MYF5, MYF6 and MYOG belong to the basic helix-loop helix protein family while MSTN belongs to the TNF-B protein family. In mammals, these genes are involved in the early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, development and regeneration. These pivotal biological functions are finely regulated in a tissue- and temporal-specific manner. We used a comparative genomic approach to obtain the buffalo specific sequences of MYOD1 and MYF6. The nucleotide sequence similarity and the protein domain conservation of the newly obtained sequences are analysed with respect to bovine and other mammalian species showing sequence similarity. The presence of a polymorphism in MYOD1 coding sequence is described and its possible effect discussed. Using a quantitative PCR approach, we compared the level of the 5 transcripts in adult and fetal muscle. These genes were physically localised on river buffalo R-banded chromosomes by <e>FISH</e> using bovine genomic BAC-clones. Here, we present a genomic and cytogenetic analysis which could offer a background to better characterise the buffalo genes involved in muscle function and which may be responsible for buffalo-specific meat features.",M2
20444257,"Array-based gene expression, CGH and tissue data defines a 12q24 gain in neuroblastic tumors with prognostic implication.BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma has successfully served as a model system for the identification of neuroectoderm-derived oncogenes. However, in spite of various efforts, only a few clinically useful prognostic markers have been found. Here, we present a framework, which integrates DNA, RNA and tissue data to identify and prioritize genetic events that represent clinically relevant new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for neuroblastoma. METHODS: A single-gene resolution aCGH profiling was integrated with microarray-based gene expression profiling data to distinguish genetic copy number alterations that were strongly associated with transcriptional changes in two neuroblastoma cell lines. <e>FISH</e> analysis using a hotspot tumor tissue microarray of 37 paraffin-embedded neuroblastoma samples and in silico data mining for gene expression information obtained from previously published studies including up to 445 healthy nervous system samples and 123 neuroblastoma samples were used to evaluate the clinical significance and transcriptional consequences of the detected alterations and to identify subsequently activated gene(s). RESULTS: In addition to the anticipated high-level amplification and subsequent overexpression of MYCN, MEIS1, CDK4 and MDM2 oncogenes, the aCGH analysis revealed numerous other genetic alterations, including microamplifications at 2p and 12q24.11. Most interestingly, we identified and investigated the clinical relevance of a previously poorly characterized amplicon at 12q24.31. FISH analysis showed low-level gain of 12q24.31 in 14 of 33 (42%) neuroblastomas. Patients with the low-level gain had an intermediate prognosis in comparison to patients with MYCN amplification (poor prognosis) and to those with no MYCN amplification or 12q24.31 gain (good prognosis) (P = 0.001). Using the in silico data mining approach, we identified elevated expression of five genes located at the 12q24.31 amplicon in neuroblastoma (DIABLO, ZCCHC8, RSRC2, KNTC1 and MPHOSPH9). Among these, DIABLO showed the strongest activation suggesting a putative role in neuroblastoma progression. CONCLUSIONS: The presented systematic and rapid framework, which integrates aCGH, gene expression and tissue data to obtain novel targets and biomarkers for cancer, identified a low-level gain of the 12q24.31 as a potential new biomarker for neuroblastoma progression. Furthermore, results of in silico data mining suggest a new neuroblastoma target gene, DIABLO, within this region, whose functional and therapeutic role remains to be elucidated in follow-up studies.",M2
20439635,"Deletions of the derivative chromosome 9 do not influence the response and the outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia in early chronic phase treated with imatinib mesylate: GIMEMA CML Working Party analysis.PURPOSE: Deletions of the derivative chromosome 9 [der(9)] have been associated with a poor prognosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) across different treatment modalities. In the imatinib era, the prognostic impact of der(9) deletions has been evaluated mainly in patients with late chronic-phase (CP) CML, giving partially conflicting results. Few data are available in the early CP setting. For this reason, in 2006, the European LeukemiaNet recommendations still considered der(9) deletions as a candidate adverse prognostic factor and required a careful monitoring of the patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate the prognostic value of der(9) deletions in early CP CML, we performed an analysis of three prospective imatinib trials of the Italian Group for Hematological Malignancies of the Adult (GIMEMA) CML Working Party. RESULTS: A fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) analysis of bone marrow cells was performed at diagnosis; der(9) deletions were detected in 60 (12%) of 521 evaluable patients. At 60 months, the cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response-and the probability of event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival-in patients with and without deletions were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly support the notion that, when investigated by FISH, der(9) deletions are not a poor prognostic factor in patients with early CP CML treated with imatinib.",M2

We have performed cytogenetic analysis and recently fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) on 43 cases of MM. Clonal chromosomal changes were present in 24 (56%) cases. Hyperdiploid karyotype was found in 12 (50%) cases, hypodiploid in 8 (33%) cases, and 4 (17%) cases had a pseudodiploid karyotype. The most common numerical abnormalities were gains of whole chromosomes 15, 11, 3 and 6. Whole chromosome losses were also frequent involving chromosomes X, 13, 14, and 8. Most cases showed also structural rearrangements 71% (n = 17): del(1p), dup(1q), del(5q), del(13q), del(17p) and t(11;14)(q13;q32) (n = 4, 17%). Chromosome -13/13q deletion was found in 42% (n = 10) cases; complete loss of 13 was observed in 67% (n = 7) cases, whereas 33% (n = 3) had interstitial deletions.

20431479,"Shortened telomeres in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma: an early event in ovarian high-grade serous carcinogenesis.Short telomeres are one of the main genetic manifestations in human cancer, as they have been shown to play an important role in inducing chromosomal instability and in contributing to tumor progression. The purpose of this study was to determine if changes in telomere length occur in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), the putative precursor of  ovarian  high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Twenty-two STICs from 15 patients with concurrent but discrete HGSCs were analyzed for telomere length on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by conducting p53 immunofluorescence to assist in identifying STICs and telomere-specific <e>FISH</e>. Telomere length (short, long, or no change) in STICs was compared with HGSCs using normal fallopian tube epithelium and stromal cells as controls. We found that STICs had the shortest telomeres, as 18 (82%) of 22 STICs had short telomeres, whereas only 2 (9%) showed no change and 2 (9%) had long telomeres compared with the normal-looking tubal epithelium. In contrast, among 12 paired HGSCs and STICs, 6 HGSCs showed an increase in telomere length, one showed a decrease in length and 5 did not show any change when compared with their matched STICs, although, such as STICs, the majority of HGSCs had shorter telomeres than the associated normal tubal epithelial cells. These differences in telomere length between normal tubal epithelial cells and STICs, and between STICs and HGSCs were statisticaly significant (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the finding of short telomeres, which have been shown to be one of the earliest molecular changes in carcinogenesis, in a vast majority of STICs provides further support to the proposal that STICs are precursors of HGSC and opens new areas of research in elucidating the early events of ovarian high-grade serous carcinogenesis.",M2
20431478,"Superficial melanocytic neoplasms with pagetoid melanocytosis: a study of interobserver concordance and correlation with <e>FISH</e>.Pagetoid proliferation of single melanocytic cells or small nests of melanocytes may be seen in a variety of melanocytic neoplasms including pagetoid spitz nevi, de novo epithelioid melanocytic dysplasia, and melanoma. Distinction of these entities may be difficult as there is considerable clinical and histologic overlap in these entities. Patient outcome and management may be significantly influenced by the pathologists' impression. In this study, we collected 24 cases of superficial melanocytic neoplasms with prominent pagetoid melanocytosis. We allowed 3 experienced consultant dermatopathologists to independently evaluate these entities and score them from 1 to 4, with 1 being totally benign and 4 being melanoma. In addition, we performed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using a new melanoma FISH assay targeting 6p25, 6q23, Cep6, and 11q13. We found strong interobserver reliability in the diagnosis in 71% of cases, whereas 29% showed considerable discordance. We found that FISH accurately identified as malignant 5 of 7 cases which had a consensus diagnosis of melanoma. None of the cases with a consensus diagnosis of benign were FISH positive. Two of 11 cases considered indeterminate by the judges were positive by FISH. One of these 2 cases showed definitive histologic changes of melanoma on later complete re-excision. There is considerable discordance in superficial melanocytic neoplasm with prominent pagetoid melanocytosis even among expert consultants. There is likely a subset of such cases where FISH can play a significant role as a diagnostic aid.",M2

Biliary tract carcinoma development and progression is associated with several gene alterations, but BilIN lesions have yet to be studied in detail by molecular techniques. We describe a case of extensive intrahepatic biliary dysplasia, with lesions ranging from BilIN-1 to BilIN-3 lesions, and multifocal microscopic ICC in hepatitis C virus (HCV)- and alcohol-related cirrhosis. The small ICC foci had remained undetected prior to transplantation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) analysis was performed on three foci of BilIN-3 lesions and on three microinvasive ICC foci with a combination of three FISH probes directed against genes frequently altered in pancreatic and biliary tract carcinomas. FISH analysis revealed a CDKNA2 heterozygous deletion in one BilIN-3 focus, and in one non-contiguous ICC focus, although the deletion was just above the chosen threshold. No deletions were detected in the genomic regions encoding TP53 and SMAD4. This report documents for the first time the development of multifocal ICC in the setting of extensive biliary dysplasia in a patient with three risk factors, HCV infection, alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis, and suggests heterogeneous carcinogenesis in ICC and possible involvement of the CDKNA2 gene.",M2
20421783,"Silver in situ hybridization (SISH) for determination of HER2 gene status in breast carcinoma: comparison with <e>FISH</e> and assessment of interobserver reproducibility.The importance of HER2 status in breast cancer management has focused attention on the ability of clinical assays to correctly assign HER2 amplification status. There is no consensus as to the best method for assessing HER2 status. Disadvantages of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing include longer time required for staining and scoring slides, requirements for specialized training and fluorescence microscopy, and loss of the signal due to quenching of the fluorescent dye. Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) is a rapid fully automated assay providing permanently stained slides that are interpreted by conventional bright field microscopy which enables pathologists to evaluate slides within the context of tissue morphology. This study evaluates the concordance between SISH and FISH assays in determining the status of HER2 gene amplification in a cohort of 298 primary invasive breast carcinomas. Furthermore, we assessed in detail the variables contributing to interobserver interpretive reproducibility of HER2 SISH among 10 pathologists. HER2 was quantified using the ratio of HER2 to CHR17 signals using the conventional historical interpretation scale and also by the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists reporting scheme. For SISH status determined by consensus among 10 pathologists, overall concordance between SISH and FISH was identified in 288 of 298 cases (96.6%) using the conventional Food and Drug Administration approved criteria. Overall agreement was observed in 282 of 285 cases (98.9%) using the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists result reporting scheme (with equivocal cases removed). In conclusion, SISH represents a novel approach for the determination of HER2 status in breast cancer. The overall concordance between SISH and FISH is excellent, and the interpretation of SISH results by pathologists is most reproducible using the HER2/CHR17 ratio.",M2
20421778,"Dual-color, break-apart <e>FISH</e> assay on paraffin-embedded tissues as an adjunct to diagnosis of Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma.Both Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) are characterized by various translocations disrupting chromosome Xp11.2, which result in gene fusions involving the TFE3 transcription factor gene. Diagnostic tools to detect translocations involving the TFE3 gene on chromosome X would be valuable in the evaluation of these tumors. We developed a dual-color, break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to identify the chromosomal break point in paraffin-embedded tissue. This assay was validated using 4 cases of Xp11.2 RCC [proven by karyotype and/or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)], 2 cases of ASPS (proven by karyotype or RT-PCR), the UOK109 cell line carrying the inv(X) (p11;q12), and several negative controls (both neoplastic and non-neoplastic).

20417871,"Clonal evolution with double Ph followed by tetraploidy in imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia with e19a2 transcript in transformation.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the e19a2 transcript coding for p230 is typically associated with a benign clinical course unless accompanied at presentation with additional chromosomal abnormalities. We report here a case of CML with e19a2 who did not show additional chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis, but progressed to the fatal advanced stage in approximately 2 years. The patient was initially treated with imatinib, which, however, could be administered only intermittently at reduced doses because of recurrent thrombocytopenia and fluid retention. Nine months after starting imatinib, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) with the BCR/ABL-ES fusion probe revealed 96% and 3% of bone marrow cells with one and two BCR/ABL1 fusion signals, respectively. Two years after starting therapy, leukocytosis recurred and the bone marrow contained 8.2% large and bizarre myeloblasts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed double Ph clones as well as tetraploid cells with four to five Ph chromosomes. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of cells with two to five BCR/ABL1 fusion signals. The patient died of disease progression in 2 months. No point mutation was detected in the region coding for the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase domain by sequence analysis. It is speculated that the amplification of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene by duplication of Ph and tetraploidy led to the progression of CML with the e19a2 transcript.",M2
20417861,"A new potential oncogenic mutation in the FERM domain of JAK2 in BCR/ABL1-negative and V617F-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms revealed by a comprehensive screening of 17 tyrosine kinase coding genes.BCR/ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPNs) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematological malignancies. Over recent years, some genetic events in tyrosine kinase (TK) genes have been described as causal events of these diseases. To identify new genetic aberrations underlying these diseases, we used denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) to analyze 17 genes from two receptor-TK families (III and IV) and from three cytoplasmic-TK families (Syk, Abl, and Jak) on samples from 44 BCR/ABL1-negative and JAK2(V617F)-negative CMPN patients with different clinical phenotypes. Although screening by FISH did not reveal novel chromosomal aberrations, several sequence changes were detected. None of them were frequent events, but we identified a new potential activating mutation in the FERM domain of JAK2(R340Q). None of the germline JAK2(V617F) single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected differed in distribution between patients and control subjects. In summary, data presented here show that these genes are not frequently mutated or rearranged in CMPNs, suggesting that molecular events causing these disorders must be located in other genes.",M2
20403043,"Nuclear size measurement is a simple method for the assessment of hepatocellular aging in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Comparison with telomere-specific quantitative <e>FISH</e> and p21 immunohistochemistry.Telomere-specific quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) accurately evaluates hepatocellular aging on histological sections, but it requires appropriate tissue processing. To establish a more simple method for the assessment of hepatocellular aging, the usefulness of nuclear size measurement was clarified using biopsy liver samples from 64 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a model for oxidative stress-associated hepatocellular aging, and 11 control individuals. Relative telomere intensity (RTI) was measured on Q-FISH, and the relative nuclear size (RNS) was calculated as the average nuclear size of the hepatocytes divided by that of lymphocytes. In normal individuals and NAFLD patients, the RTI and RNS were negatively correlated. The degree of nuclear enlargement in NAFLD patients was larger than that in normal individuals with the same telomere length, possibly reflecting telomere-independent senescence. In NAFLD patients with RNS &gt;2.0, the regenerative responses, indicated by the ratio of Ki-67-positive index to serum alanine aminotransferase level, were significantly reduced. The RNS positively correlated with the p21 expression, another marker of senescence. This all indicates that nuclear enlargement progresses in parallel with reduced regenerative responses, telomere shortening, and p21 upregulation. Nuclear size measurement is an effective method for estimation of hepatocellular aging.",M2
20402673,"Homing of transplanted bone marrow cells in livers of Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice.The efficiency of differentiation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into hepatocytes in vivo and its importance in physiopathological processes is still debated. Murine schistosomiasis was used as a liver injury model and unfractionated male mice BMCs were transplanted through intrahepatic injection into non-irradiated Schistosoma mansoni-infected female mice on their 16th week post-infection. Two weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice were sacrificed on a weekly basis until 10 weeks. Tracing of male donor-derived cells in female recipient mice livers was carried out by the detection of Y chromosome expression by fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) and also of chromodomain Y-linked (CDYL) protein by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Their transformation into hepatocytes was studied by double labelling indirect IF using antibodies directed against CDYL and mouse albumin. Histopathological and electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of small hepatocyte-like cells in the periportal tracts and in between the hepatocytes facing the sinusoids. Donor-derived cells showing Y chromosome by FISH and expressing CDYL protein by IF were recovered in the infected transplanted livers. The initial number of these cells increased with increased post-transplantation time. Cells were mainly localized in the periphery of schistosoma granuloma. Few donor-derived cells appeared within the hepatic parenchymal tissue and showed positivity for albumin secretion by double labelling with IF. We suggest that transplanted bone marrow stem cells can repopulate the Schistosoma-infected liver of immunocompetent mice. Their differentiation is a complex event controlled by many factors and needs to be further characterized extensively. The extent and type of liver injury and the number of transplanted cells are important variables in the process of stem cell engraftment and differentiation into functioning hepatic cells that still need to be defined.",M2
20393578,"Transcript counting in single cells reveals dynamics of rDNA transcription.Most eukaryotes contain many tandem repeats of ribosomal RNA genes of which only a subset is transcribed at any given time. Current biochemical methods allow for the determination of the fraction of transcribing repeats (ON) versus non-transcribing repeats (OFF) but do not provide any dynamical information and obscure any transcription activity at the single-cell level. Here, we use a fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) technique that allows the detection of single-RNA molecules in individual yeast cells. We use this method complemented with theoretical modeling to determine the rate of switching from OFF to ON (activation rate) and the average number of RNA molecules produced during each transcriptional burst (burst size). We explore how these two variables change in mutants and different growth conditions, and show that this method resolves changes in these two variables even when the average rDNA expression is unaltered. These phenotypic changes could not have been detected by traditional biochemical assays.",M2
20377173,"Waste activated sludge fermentation for hydrogen production enhanced by anaerobic process improvement and acetobacteria inhibition: the role of fermentation pH.In this study an efficient strategy, i.e., controlling the fermentation pH at constant pH 10, for significantly increasing hydrogen yield from waste activated sludge (WAS) via the improvement of anaerobic process (sludge solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification) and inhibition of hydrogen consumption by acetobacteria was reported. Without addition of pure hydrogen producer and nutrient source, the effect of different constant pH in the range of pH 4-11 on hydrogen production from WAS was compared with that of different initial pH. The maximal hydrogen yield was observed respectively at constant pH 10 and initial pH 10, but the former was 47.8% higher than the latter (26.9 versus 18.2 mL per gram volatile suspended solids) and much greater than that reported in literature. Then, the mechanisms for constant pH 10 resulting in remarkably higher hydrogen production than initial pH 10 were investigated. It was observed that constant pH 10 fermentation showed much higher solubilization of sludge main particulate organic matters, hydrolysis of solubilized organic materials and acidification of hydrolyzed products, which were of benefit to the hydrogen production. Also, there was more acetic but less propionic acid in the constant pH 10 test, which was in correspondence with the theory of fermentation type affecting hydrogen production. Moreover, in the reactor of initial pH 10 the produced hydrogen was readily converted to acetic acid, but no obvious hydrogen consumption was observed in constant pH 10 reactor. Further investigation of microorganisms with enzymes analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) indicated that the activity and growth of acetobacteria in the reactor of constant pH 10 was much lower than those in initial pH 10 reactor.",M2
20376808,"[The clinical and experimental analyses of a multiple myeloma patient with derivative der(Y;1)]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of a rare chromosome abnormality der(Y)t(Y;1) in a patient with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: The chromosome spread was prepared after 24 h culture of bone marrow. G-banding technique was used to analyze the karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) was performed to ascertain the origin of abnormal chromosome detected by conventional karyotypic analysis. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of the CD38/CD138/ZAP70. Immunoelectrophore was applied to identify the type of immunoglobulin. RESULTS: A complex pattern of chromosome rearrangement was observed: 92,XXYY[3]/49,X,der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q21),t(11;14)(q13;q32),+18,+20,+21[47]/49,X,idem,del(13q22),ace[1]/98,XX,der(Y)t(Y;1) x 2,+18,+18,+20,+20,+21,+21[10]/46,XY[19]. The result was confirmed by metaphase-FISH. The type of immunoglobulin was IgD with the level of 6.24g/L. The CD38/CD138 was positive but ZAP70 was negative. CONCLUSION: Structural abnormality of chromosome Y is rare in blood malignancy. Most of them were described in myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorders. It is the first report of der(Y)t(Y;1) abnormality in multiple myeloma.",M2
20376798,"[The different signal patterns of two <e>FISH</e> probes in the FISH detection of Ph-positive leukemia and their clinical significance]OBJECTIVE: To compare the signal patterns of dual color extra-signal BCR/ABL probe (ES-FISH) and dual color dual fusion BCR/ABL probe (D-FISH) in the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of Ph-positive leukemia, and to explore their diagnostic value. METHODS: ES-FISH probe and D-FISH probe were used, respectively, to detect the BCR/ABL fusion gene in 74 cases with typical t(9;22)(q34;q11) and 37 cases with variant t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation or complex karyotypic abnormalities containing Ph translocation. RESULTS: The BCR/ABL fusion gene in all cases with typical t(9;22)(q34;q11) could be detected by both FISH probes. D-FISH had a signal pattern of 1O1G2F, while ES-FISH showed a signal pattern of 2O1G1F. ES-FISH enables the minor breakpoint cluster region to be identified in 9 cases (12.2% ) of Ph-positive leukemia, whereas D-FISH could not differentiate the minor breakpoint cluster region from major breakpoint cluster region. D-FISH could distinguish simple ABL gene deletion from simultaneous deletion of the ABL and BCR genes in 8 cases (10.8%) of Ph-positive leukemia patients, but ES-FISH could not. For variant Ph translocation or complex karyotypic abnormalities containing Ph translocation, each FISH probe showed four or six types of signal pattern, most of which were atypical. The exact interpretation was dependent on conventional karyotypic analysis and FISH on metaphases. CONCLUSION: ES-FISH and D-FISH probes displayed different signal patterns in Ph-positive leukemia due to their differences in size and covered regions. ES-FISH and D-FISH probes may be selected as better probe for Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia and Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. When imatinib was used for treatment, there was no preference between ES-FISH and D-FISH probe, because major breakpoint cluster region, minor breakpoint cluster region and partial sequence deletion of derivative chromosome 9, would not affect the prognosis of Ph-positive leukemia. However, considering that ES-FISH probe has a better cost-performance than D-FISH probe does, it is recommended as first choice.",M2
20376795,"[Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of partial trisomy 4q and partial monosomy 10q in a patient]OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the karyotype of a girl with moderate mental retardation and growth retardation, perform correlation analysis between chromosomal variation and phenotype, and investigate the application and superiority of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) in clinical cytogenetic diagnosis. METHODS: G-banded chromosome analysis, array-CGH, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) were used to ascertain the karyotype of the patient and her relatives. RESULTS: G-banding analysis of the patient showed a derivative chromosome 10 with an extra fragment on its long arm terminal, both her father and grandmother had an apparently balanced translocation t(4;10)(q25;q26). Array-CGH revealed that the breakpoint on chromosome 4 was located at 4q26. In addition, a microdeletion of about 0.54 Mb del(10)(q26.3) was identified from the patient. FISH and RQ-PCR confirmed that the del(10)(q26.3) was also present in both her father and grandmother. CONCLUSION: No recognizable phenotype was associated with del(10)(q26.3). The abnormal phenotypes presented in the patient may be ascribed to the 4q26-q35.2 triplication. Further more, compared with conventional cytogenetic analysis, array-CGH is of high resolution and high accuracy.",M2
20371060,"XMRV infection in patients with prostate cancer: novel serologic assay and correlation with PCR and <e>FISH</e>.OBJECTIVES: To develop a serum-based assay to detect neutralizing antibodies to the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) retrovirus and to use this assay with polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization to identify patients with prostate cancer previously exposed to XMRV infection and those who carry XMRV viral sequences in their prostate. METHODS: Patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy were enrolled, and biologic specimens were obtained at surgery. The patients were genotyped for the R462Q RNASEL variant using a TaqMan genotyping assay on DNA from the peripheral blood. A serum assay that detects XMRV neutralizing antibodies was developed and used to determine which patients had serologic evidence of previous infection with XMRV virus. Some of these patients were also tested for the presence of XMRV nucleotide sequences in their prostate using polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. RESULTS: At a serum dilution of 1:150, our assay detected 11 (27.5%) of 40 patients with XMRV neutralizing antibodies, including 8 (40%) of 20 with the RNASEL genotype QQ and 3 (15%) of 20 with either the RQ or RR genotype. These results were in complete concordance with 2 other assays (polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization), which were designed to detect XMRV infection. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV infects some patients with prostate cancer. Neutralizing antibodies against XMRV correlated with 2 independent methods of detecting the virus in the prostate. The antibody response suggests that with clinical serologic assay development, it might be possible to screen patients for XMRV infection. The cases presented in the present report provided biologic samples that can be used for the development of a clinically relevant assay.",M2
20362229,"Clinical usefulness of fluorescence in situ hybridization for diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer.We evaluated the performance of the fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) assay in comparison with that of urinary cytology for the detection of bladder urothelial carcinoma in routine clinical practice. Voided urine samples from 602 patients with hematuria were analyzed. The bladder cancer group consisted of 95 patients who had biopsy-proven bladder cancer, and the control group consisted of 507 patients without bladder cancer. We found a significant difference between the overall sensitivities of FISH and cytology (60% vs. 28.4%, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001). The overall specificity was 99% with cytology and 94.9% with FISH, although this difference was not statistically significant. The mean values for all four probes in the true-positive group were higher than those in the false-positive group. The difference in the mean values between the two groups was significant only for the CEP3 and CEP17 probes. Furthermore, the severity of the genetic alterations detected by FISH showed a positive correlation with both tumor invasiveness (stage Ta --&gt; T1, T2) and histological grade (G1, G2 --&gt; G3). Together, these findings suggest that FISH can be a useful diagnostic and surveillance tool for patients who are suspected of having new or recurrent bladder cancer.",M2
20362225,"Analysis of fluorescence in situ hybridization, mtDNA quantification, and mtDNA sequence for the detection of early bladder cancer.We designed this study to test the sensitivities of cytology, the nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) in the early detection of urothelial carcinoma, and to identify mtDNA alterations in urinary epithelial cells. We collected 41 urine samples and 26 corresponding peripheral blood samples from patients with clinically suspected urothelial carcinoma. The FISH and NMP22 assays detected 92.1% of the cancers, and cytology detected 60.5%. In the low-grade group, NMP22 and FISH analyses were more sensitive than cytology, but in the high-grade group, all three methods showed approximately 90% sensitivity. Overall, the FISH and NMP22, or FISH and cytology assays combined detected 97.4% of cancers, while cytology with NMP22 detected 92.1%. In the low-grade group, the sensitivity of the three methods combined was above 80%, but in high-grade group, the combined sensitivity was approximately 100%. In the mtDNA control region, we detected characteristic heteroplasmic mtDNA substitution mutations in 1 patient and a mtDNA length heteroplasmic mutation in 303 polyC or 16184 poly C in 20 patients. Overall, urothelial carcinoma-specific mtDNA mutations were observed in 20 of the 26 patients (76.9%). The average mtDNA copy numbers in urine samples and corresponding peripheral blood samples (83.45 +/- 60.36 and 39.0 +/- 24.38, respectively) (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) differed significantly (P &lt; 0.001). The mtDNA copy numbers in the urine samples from patients with high-grade and low-grade tumors (81.83 +/- 67.78 and 86.49 +/- 46.69, respectively) did not differ significantly (P = 0.589). In conclusion, the FISH assay showed the highest sensitivity for detecting low-grade urothelial carcinoma, and mtDNA copy numbers in urine samples were higher than those in the corresponding peripheral blood samples. The frequency of mtDNA mutations in the D-loop region in patients with cancer was approximately 80% in our study. This report further supports the significance of genetic alteration in urothelial carcinoma and the clinical utility of the FISH, mtDNA quantitation polymerase chain reaction, mtDNA sequencing, and capillary electrophoresis for this purpose.",M2
20359736,"Expression of nuclear Notch3 in cervical squamous cell carcinomas and its association with adverse clinical outcomes.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the functional role of Notch3 in human cervical carcinomas. METHODS: Notch3 expression in cervical cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and data on clinical variables were collected by retrospective chart review. We used dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) to analyze DNA copy number alterations in cervical cancer. Inactivation of Notch3 and knocking down Notch3 gene were done using gamma-secretase inhibitor and Notch 3 specific SiRNA to asses Notch3 function in cervical cancer either in vivo or in vitro. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Notch3 was significantly overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinomas compared with adenocarcinomas. In contrast to normal cervical tissue and cervical intraepithelial neoplasms [CINs], squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated higher nuclear Notch3 immunoreactivity. Notch3 amplification was not found in any cervical carcinomas using FISH analysis. Notch3 nuclear expression was significantly correlated with Jagged-1, a putative Notch3 ligand, and Pbx1b, a potential Notch3 downstream target (P&lt;0.05).Patients with cervical carcinomas positive for nuclear Notch3 expression had significantly shorter overall survival than their peers whose tumors did not express nuclear Notch3. Inactivation of Notch3 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in ME180 and SKGIIIb cell lines that overexpressed Notch3. Injection of a gamma-secretase inhibitor into ME180 cell tumors established on mice, demonstrated a reduction in tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Notch3 might play important role for the proliferation and survival of Notch3 overexpressing tumors and that inactivation of Notch3 may represent a new therapeutic avenue for cervical squamous cell carcinomas.",M2
20358617,"Characterization of an interstitial 4q32 deletion in a patient with mental retardation and a complex chromosome rearrangement.Interstitial deletions of chromosome band 4q32 are rare. We report on a 22-year-old female patient with a de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 4q32 and a balanced translocation t(2;5)(p21;q12.1). Clinical problems of the patient comprised mild to moderate mental retardation, psychosis, obesity, broad nasal root, sparse lateral eyebrows, thin upper lip, short philtrum, micrognathia, and strabismus. Analysis by whole genome array CGH using an Agilent 244K oligonucleotide array and subsequent <e>FISH</e> using BAC clones from the 4q32 region revealed an unexpectedly complex rearrangement comprising a deletion of approximately 10 Mb in 4q32.1q32.3 and the insertion of two small fragments of 0.8 and 0.11 Mb originating from the derivative chromosome 4q32 into derivative chromosome 5q. The breakpoints of the t(2;5) translocation were mapped by BAC-FISH; no genes were disrupted by these breakpoints. The deleted interval in 4q32 harbored more than 30 genes, and haploinsufficiency of one or several of these genes is likely to have caused the clinical problems of the patient. Candidate genes for cognitive defects are GRIA2, GLRB, NPY1R, and NPY5R. In conclusion, this patient increases our knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of interstitial 4q32 deletions. Reports of patients with overlapping deletions will be needed to elucidate the role of individual genes and to establish genotype-phenotype correlations.",M2
20357826,"EVI1 overexpression in distinct subtypes of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.Overexpression of the ecotropic virus integration-1 (EVI1) gene (EVI1+), localized at chromosome 3q26, is associated with adverse outcome in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In pediatric AML, 3q26 abnormalities are rare, and the role of EVI1 is unknown. We studied 228 pediatric AML samples for EVI1+ using gene expression profiling and RQ-PCR. EVI1+ was found in 20/213 (9%) of children with de novo AML, and in 4/8 with secondary AML. It was predominantly found in MLL-rearranged AML (13/47), monosomy 7 (2/3), or FAB M6/7 (6/10), and mutually exclusive with core-binding factor AML, t(15;17), and NPM1 mutations. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) was performed to detect cryptic 3q26 abnormalities. However, none of the EVI1+ patients harbored structural 3q26 alterations. Although significant differences in 4 years pEFS for EVI1+ and EVI1- pediatric AML were observed (28%+/-11 vs 44%+/-4, P=0.04), multivariate analysis did not identify EVI1+ as an independent prognostic factor. We conclude that EVI1+ can be found in approximately 10% of pediatric AML. Although EVI1+ was not an independent prognostic factor, it was predominantly found in subtypes of pediatric AML that are related with an intermediate to unfavorable prognosis. Further research should explain the role of EVI1+ in disease biology in these cases. Remarkably, no 3q26 abnormalities were identified in EVI1+ pediatric AML.",M2
20357620,"Is cytology reliable for epidermal growth factor receptor gene evaluation in non-small cell lung cancer?BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number has been proposed as predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

20357507,"Simultaneous detection and differentiation of Staphylococcus species in blood cultures using fluorescence in situ hybridization.OBJECTIVE: To develop a new protocol for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in blood cultures using fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), without cultivation and biotyping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes were used to target the variable regions of the 16S rRNA of S. aureus and CoNS, the probes were labeled with fluorochrome Cy3 (red signal) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (green signal), respectively. It is not possible to design one probe that will hybridize to all CoNS species. Therefore, in this study two differentially labeled probes (STA and SAU) were mixed and used to detect and differentiate S. aureus from CoNS rapidly in a single smear. Samples of 189 positive blood cultures with Gram-positive cocci in clusters and 11 Gram-positive cocci in chains or pairs were included. RESULTS: The FISH assay showed 91.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for S. aureus and 100% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity for CoNS when hybridized with STA and SAU probes. Meanwhile, the assay showed 91.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for S. aureus and 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity for CoNS, when hybridized with the SAU probe only. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the FISH technique was suitable for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of Staphylococcus sp. in blood cultures.",M2
20350212,"Pseudonegative BCL2 protein expression in a t(14;18) translocation positive lymphoma cell line: a need for an alternative BCL2 antibody.AIM: The t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation induces BCL2 protein expression in most follicular lymphomas. However, a small number of cases lack BCL2 expression despite carrying the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation. This study aims to explore the mechanism accounting for the lack of BCL2 protein expression when the t(14;18) translocation is present. METHODS: BCL2 expression in the t(14;18) positive cell lines FL18, Karpas-422, SU-DHL-4 and SU-DHL-6, was analysed by Western blotting and by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies. <e>FISH</e> analysis was performed to confirm the cytogenetic changes in the cell lines and real time quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the BCL2 mRNA level. Sequence analysis of translocated BCL2 was performed on FL18, Karpas-422, SU-DHL-4 and SU-DHL-6 cell lines. RESULTS: In FL18, Karpas-422, and SU-DHL-4, the BCL2 mRNA level correlated with the BCL2 protein expression. In contrast, BCL2 protein was not detected in SU-DHL-6 line using standard anti-BCL2 antibody (BCL2/124), despite the presence of the t(14;18) translocation and high level of mRNA. cDNA sequencing of translocated BCL2 showed three mutations in the SU-DHL-6 cell line, one of which resulted in an amino acid substitution (I48F) in the region recognised by the standard BCL2 antibody, whereas the other two were silent mutations at aa71 and aa72. Interestingly, when BCL2 expression was tested with an alternative antibody, E17, the protein was detected in SU-DHL-6, suggesting that the 'negativity' of SU-DHL-6 line for BCL2 using the standard antibody is spurious. Amino acid changes were found in Karpas-422 (G47D, P59L) and SU-DHL-4 (P59T, S117R) but these did not affect BCL2 detection. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that some somatic mutations of the translocated BCL2 gene may prevent epitope recognition by BCL2 antibodies, and hence cause false negative expression using the standard antibody. It is recommended that in practice all BCL2 negative cases should routinely be stained with an alternative antibody to prevent false negativity.",M2
20345376,"Differential responses of Prochlorococcus and SAR11-dominated bacterioplankton groups to atmospheric dust inputs in the tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean.The metabolic responses of indigenous dominant bacterioplankton populations to additions of dust were examined in the tropical northeast Atlantic. Subsurface seawater samples were treated with dust, added directly or indirectly as a 'leachate' after its rapid dissolution in deionized water. Samples were incubated at ambient temperature and light for up to 24 h and microbial metabolic responses were assessed by (35)S-methionine ((35)S-Met) uptake. Prochlorococcus and low nucleic acid (LNA) cells were sorted by flow cytometry to determine their group-specific responses. Sorted cells were also phylogenetically affiliated using <e>FISH</e>. The high-light-adapted ecotype II dominated the Prochlorococcus group and 73+/-14% of LNA prokaryotes belonged to the SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria. Both Prochlorococcus and LNA cells were metabolically impaired by the addition of dust (40+/-28% and 37+/-22% decrease in (35)S-Met uptake compared with controls, respectively). However, LNA bacterioplankton showed minor positive responses to dust leachate additions (7+/-4% increase in (35)S-Met uptake), while the metabolic activity of Prochlorococcus cells decreased in the presence of dust leachate by 16+/-11%. Thus, dust dissolution in situ appears to be more deleterious to Prochlorococcus than SAR11-dominated LNA bacterioplankton and hence could initiate a compositional shift in the indigenous bacterioplankton.",M2
20340097,"The role of fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis and classification of lymphoproliferative disorders on fine-needle aspiration.BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been used in the evaluation of lymphadenopathy for a long time and is highly reliable in the identification of metastatic malignancies. However, the role of FNA in the assessment of new lymphoproliferative disorders continues to be a subject of debate. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of molecular cytogenetic studies in FNA diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: A retrospective, computer-based search for lymph node FNAs from 2006 to 2007 was performed. Cases with either fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were subjected to further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 243 lymph node FNAs were performed during the period, including 104 that were positive/suspicious for metastatic malignancies, 16 that were positive/suspicious for lymphomas, 15 that demonstrated atypical lymphoid proliferation, 73 that were reactive, 14 that were deemed granulomas, and 21 that were determined to be nondiagnostic. Molecular analysis included combined FISH/PCR in 4 cases, FISH only in 7 cases, and PCR only in 4 cases. By using multiplex PCR, 6 cases with atypical/negative flow cytometry results were diagnosed as 4 B-cell lymphomas, 1 T-cell lymphoma, and 1 reactive lymph node; and 4 cases that had atypical T cells determined by flow cytometry were diagnosed as reactive. One CD10-negative follicular lymphoma and 2 cases with suspicious flow cytometry results were positive for t(14;18)(q32;q21) by FISH. Forty-five cases had follow-up histology with 3 false-negative findings and no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, multiplex PCR studies for immunoglobulin heavy-chain or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were useful for demonstrating clonality, and FISH studies were able to detect translocations or gene rearrangements that allowed for the subclassification of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.",M2
20339289,"DNA double strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations.DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are ultimate lesions for the formation of chromosomal aberrations (CAs). The formation of CAs is dependent on many factors; some of these are discussed in this review. <e>FISH</e> methodologies have uncovered CA types which cannot be seen with the classical staining methods, and thereby widened our understanding of the origin of CAs. The mobility of DSBs in interphase nuclei is limited. This makes it especially difficult to understand the origin of complex CAs involving many chromosomes. Even using high-resolution mBAND FISH to analyze CAs, the ratio of inter-/intrachromosomal CAs is higher than 1. From this it was postulated that only a subset of DSBs, namely, complex or clustered DSBs give rise mainly to interchromosomal CAs. The finding that endonucleases induce CAs does not fit the idea of complex DSBs being responsible for CA. Probably it is the proximity and not the complexity of DSBs which leads to CA.",M2

20335538,"Metabolic cycling in single yeast cells from unsynchronized steady-state populations limited on glucose or phosphate.Oscillations in patterns of expression of a large fraction of yeast genes are associated with the  metabolic cycle,  usually seen only in prestarved, continuous cultures of yeast. We used <e>FISH</e> of mRNA in individual cells to test the hypothesis that these oscillations happen in single cells drawn from unsynchronized cultures growing exponentially in chemostats. Gene-expression data from synchronized cultures were used to predict coincident appearance of mRNAs from pairs of genes in the unsynchronized cells. Quantitative analysis of the FISH results shows that individual unsynchronized cells growing slowly because of glucose limitation or phosphate limitation show the predicted oscillations. We conclude that the yeast metabolic cycle is an intrinsic property of yeast metabolism and does not depend on either synchronization or external limitation of growth by the carbon source.",M2
20332669,"Expression and alteration of p16 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine (1) the expression of P16 protein relative to sites of presentation, immunophenotypic subgroups and proliferative indices of tumour cells, and (2) the relationship between p16 gene alterations and P16 protein overexpression in 70 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: Expression of P16, CD10, BCL-6, MUM-1 and proliferation marker (Ki-67) was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) was employed to detect p16 alterations. RESULTS: P16 overexpression was shown in 45.7% (32/70) of the DLBCL cases, and was significantly correlated with CD10 (p = 0.022) and germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) phenotype (p = 0.022). High expression of P16 was inversely associated with high proliferative activity (Ki-67 index greater than 75%) (p = 0.020). Of the 47 cases that yielded interpretable FISH results, 57.4% (27/47) showed deletions of p16 and 27.7% (13/47) showed gains of p16. P16 overexpression and p16 deletions were mutually exclusive (p = 0.019). There was no correlation between P16 overexpression and p16 gains (p = 0.621). CONCLUSIONS: The GCB and non-GCB subgroups of DLBCLs show different patterns of P16 expression. High levels of P16 may mitigate tumour cell proliferation. Gains of p16 do not necessarily increase P16 protein expression.",M2
20332472,"Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a cytogenetic study of 33 patients diagnosed between 1981 and 2008.BACKGROUND: The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting from a t(9;22)(q34;q11), is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities observed among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Main of study: To analyze the distribution of Ph chromosome-positive ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis and/or relapse of 208 patients shown to have B-cell ALL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies using probe LSI BCR-ABL dual ES color (Abbott, Rungis, France) and other types of probes were performed on the available cytogenetic pellets. RESULTS: Thirty-three Ph chromosome-positive ALL patients were identified between 1981 and 2008. The Ph chromosome was present in 39.7% of the patients older than 25 years, but in only 4.3% of the patients younger than 15 years. A pseudodiploid karyotype was found in 68.75% of the patients and hypodiploidy in a further 15.6% of the patients. <e>FISH</e> studies revealed the breakpoint to be located in the major breakpoint cluster region in 20% of the patients and in the minor in the remaining 80% of the patients. Complex rearrangements of the derivative chromosomes 9 or 22 were identified in four patients, including a complex Ph translocation, t(9;22;X). CONCLUSION: Ph chromosome-positive ALL patients show cytogenetic characteristics that differ from those of other ALL patients.",M2
20332300,"Lung cancer biomarkers: FISHing in the sputum for risk assessment and early detection.This perspective on Varella-Garcia et al. (beginning on p. 447 in this issue of the journal) discusses the role of sputum-based biomarkers in the risk assessment and early detection of lung cancer. The importance of the detection of sputum epithelial chromosomal aneusomy by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) as a potential risk or early-detection biomarker is discussed in the context of other biomarkers and models in lung carcinogenesis. The presently reported findings on FISH in sputum cells are an important contribution worthy of further investigation in defined clinical settings.",M2
20332298,"The detection of chromosomal aneusomy by fluorescence in situ hybridization in sputum predicts lung cancer incidence.Lung cancer usually is disseminated (advanced) and has a poor prognosis at diagnosis. Current and former smokers are at a high risk for lung cancer and are candidates for prevention and early detection strategies. Sputum is a potential source of biomarkers that might determine either lung cancer risk or the presence of early lung cancer, but no current sputum test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for effective screening. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) to measure chromosomal aneusomy (CA) in sputum samples collected prospectively from 100 incident lung cancer cases and 96 controls (matched on age, gender, and date of collection) nested within an ongoing high-risk cohort. The CA-FISH assay was aimed at four DNA targets: epidermal growth factor receptor, MYC, 5p15, and CEP 6. The sensitivity of a positive CA-FISH assay (abnormal for two or more of the four markers) for lung cancer was substantially higher for samples collected within 18 months (76% sensitivity) than for samples collected more than 18 months (31%) before lung cancer diagnosis. Sensitivity was higher for squamous cell cancers (94%) than for other histologic types (69%). CA-FISH specificity based on samples collected within 18 months before diagnosis was 88%. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of lung cancer for specimens collected within 18 months before a cancer diagnosis was higher for the CA-FISH assay [OR, 29.9; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 9.5-94.1] than for previously studied ORs of cytologic atypia (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6) and gene promoter methylation (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.2-35.5). Whether CA-FISH is an indicator of extreme risk for incident lung cancer or detects exfoliated cancer cells is unknown. The apparent promise of CA-FISH in sputum for assessing lung cancer risk and/or for lung cancer early detection now needs to be validated in a clinical screening trial.",M2
20331734,"Chromosome 9p24 abnormalities: prevalence, description of novel JAK2 translocations, JAK2V617F mutation analysis and clinicopathologic correlates.OBJECTIVES: Current information is insufficient regarding the prevalence, cytogenetic details, JAK2 involvement, JAK2V617F mutational status, and clinicopathologic correlates of chromosome 9p24 abnormalities. The current study was designed to provide additional data in this regard. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic cytogenetics database spanning the years 1989-2008 was screened for chromosome 9p24 abnormalities. Bone marrow (BM) morphology was re-reviewed and relevant clinical information retrospectively obtained. Structural abnormalities of JAK2 were examined by <e>FISH</e> and JAK2V617F mutation analysis. RESULTS: Among 24 262 unique patient cytogenetic studies, chromosome 9p24 abnormalities were identified in 25 patients ( approximately 0.06%): 12 with myeloid and 13 with lymphoid neoplasms. The associated karyotype was complex in 12 of the 13 lymphoid but in only four of the 12 myeloid cases. Archived BM was available in 23 cases that allowed additional FISH studies and JAK2V617F mutation analysis. FISH analysis disclosed JAK2 involvement in 10 patients including five myeloid and five lymphoid cases; the associated karyotype was complex in all the lymphoid but in none of the myeloid cases. Five patients displayed previously undescribed JAK2 translocations: t(8;9)(q22;p24), t(9;17)(p24;q23), t(4;9)(q25;p24), t(2;9)(p21;p24) and t(8;9)(q13;p24). JAK2-associated chromosomal translocations, in a non-complex karyotype setting, were documented in four patients, all of whom carried a diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and harbored JAK2V617F. Two patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma displayed complex karyotype and JAK2 amplification by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome 9p24 abnormalities are rare and do not always involve JAK2. The subset with JAK2 translocations are usually associated with MPN and harbor JAK2V617F, suggesting a cause-effect relationship. The current study also describes five novel translocations involving JAK2.",M2
20303688,"Arsenic-resistant bacteria associated with roots of the wild Cirsium arvense (L.) plant from an arsenic polluted soil, and screening of potential plant growth-promoting characteristics.A rhizobacterial community, associated with the roots of wild thistle Cirsium arvense (L.) growing in an arsenic polluted soil, was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) analysis in conjunction with cultivation-based methods. In the bulk, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane fractions of the soil, the qualitative picture obtained by FISH analysis of the main phylogenetic bacterial groups was similar and was predominantly comprised of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. The arsenic-resistant isolates belonged to 13 genera, the most abundant being those of Bacillus, Achromobacter, Brevundimonas, Microbacterium, and Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria grew in the presence of high arsenic concentrations (over 100mM arsenate and 10mM arsenite). Most strains possessed the ArsC, ArsB and ACR3 genes homologous to arsenate reductase and to the two classes of arsenite efflux pumps, respectively, peculiar to the ars operon of the arsenic detoxification system. ArsB and ACR3 were present simultaneously in highly resistant strains. An inconsistency between 16S rRNA phylogenetic affiliations and the arsenate reductase sequences of the strains was observed, indicating possible horizontal transfer of arsenic resistance genes in the soil bacterial community. Several isolates were able to reduce arsenate and to oxidise arsenite. In particular, Ancylobacter dichloromethanicum strain As3-1b possessed both characteristics, and arsenite oxidation occurred in the strain also under chemoautotrophic conditions. Some rhizobacteria produced siderophores, indole acetic acid and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, thus possessing potential plant growth-promoting traits.",M2
20303018,"Detection of cryptic and variant IGH-MYC rearrangements in high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization: implications for cytogenetic testing.In recent years it has become increasingly evident that MYC rearrangements are not confined to classical Burkitt lymphoma (BL), but also occur in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in the new subtype,  B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL  (BCLU), which was recently described in the 2008 revision of the World Health Organization classification. The accurate identification of MYC rearrangements in these three subtypes of high-grade lymphoma is becoming increasingly critical both in terms of diagnosis of classical BL and in light of the prognostic implications in cases of DLBCL and BCLU. We describe three cases of high-grade lymphoma in which cryptic insertion events, resulting in clinically significant IGH-MYC rearrangements, were detectable using an IGH/MYC three-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) probe set, but were not detected using break-apart MYC FISH probes, thus highlighting the limitations of using break-apart probes as a stand-alone test, particularly with the increased use of interphase FISH analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of these patients.",M2
20303011,"Genomic alterations of chromosome region 11p as predictive marker by array comparative genomic hybridization in lung adenocarcinoma patients.Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number with an extremely high resolution and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. In this study, we used aCGH to compare genomic alterations in fresh-frozen lung cancer tissues of 21 adenocarcinomas (AdCCs) (11 early relapse and 10 nonrelapse) and identified genomic alterations that showed significant by different frequency between early relapse and nonrelapse AdCCs. Twelve clones were identified by the false discovery rate (FDR) test, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were selected as predictive markers. The significant gain clones were found in 11p (11p15.4, 11p15.1, and 11p13). When the cutoff value was 2, study of the association between candidate clones and relapse prediction revealed that early relapse and nonrelapse groups were most effectively separated. To further validate the gain of chromosome 11p region that was identified by array CGH, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) was performed. To further confirm the results of aCGH, copy number changes of cancer-related candidate genes in AdCC patients were compared by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Array CGH and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were found to correspond to delineated DNA copy number changes. Genomic alterations of chromosome 11p region in AdCC patients were observed with aCGH, and a relapsable marker was identified in the nonrelapse group. This marker could be useful in stratifying patient groups according to likelihood of relapse for adjuvant treatment after surgical resection.",M2
20298612,"Examination of equine glandular stomach lesions for bacteria, including Helicobacter spp by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.BACKGROUND: The equine glandular stomach is commonly affected by erosion and ulceration. The aim of this study was to assess whether bacteria, including Helicobacter, could be involved in the aetiology of gastric glandular lesions seen in horses. RESULTS: Stomach lesions, as well as normal appearing mucosa were obtained from horses slaughtered for human consumption. All samples were tested for urease activity using the Pyloritek assay, while mucosal bacterial content was evaluated using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation. In selected sub samples, bacteria characterisation was pursued further by cloning and sequencing. Mucosal lesions were found in 36/63 stomachs and included hyperplastic rugae, polypoid structures and focal erosions. None of the samples were tested positive for urease activity or for <e>FISH</e> using the Helicobacter genus specific probe. In samples of lesions, as well as normal samples, clones with 99% similarities to Lactobacillus salivarius and Sarcina ventriculi were found. Escherichia like bacterium clones and Enterococcus clones were demonstrated in one focal erosion. Based on a phylogenetic tree these clones had 100% similarity to Escherichia fergusonii and Enterococcus faecium. The Enterococcus were found colonising the mucosal surface, while E. fergusonii organisms were also demonstrated intraepithelial. CONCLUSION: Gastric Helicobacter spp. could not be verified as being involved in lesions of the glandular stomach of the horse. Since E. fergusonii has been described as an emerging pathogen in both humans and animals, the finding of this bacterium in gastric erosion warrants further clarification to whether gastric infection with this type bacterium is important for horses.",M2

In this chapter, we describe protocols to perform three basic FISH techniques in filamentous fungi: (a) FISH mapping of unique sequences on the somatic chromosomes and interphase nuclei, (b) chromosome painting to detect a specific chromosome in the genome by fluorescent painting of the whole chromosome, and (c) fiber FISH on the stretched DNA fibers for physical mapping. The ways of preparing target specimens unique to filamentous fungi are included in the protocols.",M2
20237601,"Analysis of chromosomal structural polymorphisms in the St, P, and Y genomes of Triticeae (Poaceae).The St, P, and Y genomes are three important genomes in the tribe Triticeae, which includes many perennial species. To study polymorphisms within the chromosomes of the St, P, and Y genomes, a GISH-<e>FISH</e> method was developed that allowed them to be clearly distinguished. The karyotypes of five individuals from population Z1925 of Kengyilia grandiglumis (Keng) J.L. Yang et al. (2n = 6x = 42, StStPPYY) were analyzed. The results showed that there were structural polymorphisms in all of the chromosomes from the three individual genomes. The polymorphisms were found mainly in the terminal regions of chromosomes and infrequently near the centromeric region. Of all the chromosomes, 1P, 1St, 1Y, 2Y, 3St, and 3Y showed the most polymorphisms. The polymorphisms within the individual chromosomes suggested that more extensive and scientific conclusions regarding the origin and evolution of genomes in wild species of Triticeae would be achieved by studying a population as a sampling and analysis unit.",M2
20237595,"Cytological characterization of sunflower by in situ hybridization using homologous rDNA sequences and a BAC clone containing highly represented repetitive retrotransposon-like sequences.In the present work we report new tools for the characterization of the complete chromosome complement of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing repetitive sequences with similarity to retrotransposons and a homologous rDNA sequence isolated from the sunflower genome as probes for <e>FISH</e>. The rDNA signal was found in 3 pairs of chromosomes, coinciding with the location of satellites. The BAC clone containing highly represented retroelements hybridized with all the chromosome complement in FISH, and used together with the rDNA probe allowed the discrimination of all chromosome pairs of sunflower. Their distinctive distribution pattern suggests that these probes could be useful for karyotype characterization and for chromosome identification. The karyotype could be subdivided into 3 clear-cut groups of 12 metacentric pairs, 1 submetacentric pair, and 4 subtelocentric pairs, thus resolving previously described karyotype controversies. The use of BAC clones containing single sequences of specific markers and (or) genes associated with important agricultural traits represents an important tool for future locus-specific identification and physical mapping.",M2
20233419,"Characterization of the ovine ribosomal protein SA gene and its pseudogenes.BACKGROUND: The ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), previously named 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor/67-kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in a number of pathological processes, such as cancer and prion diseases. In all investigated species, RPSA is a member of a multicopy gene family consisting of one full length functional gene and several pseudogenes. Therefore, for studies on RPSA related pathways/pathologies, it is important to characterize the whole family and to address the possible function of the other RPSA family members. The present work aims at deciphering the RPSA family in sheep. RESULTS: In addition to the full length functional ovine RPSA gene, 11 other members of this multicopy gene family, all processed pseudogenes, were identified. Comparison between the RPSA transcript and these pseudogenes shows a large variety in sequence identities ranging from 99% to 74%. Only one of the 11 pseudogenes, i.e. RPSAP7, shares the same open reading frame (ORF) of 295 amino acids with the RPSA gene, differing in only one amino acid. All members of the RPSA family were annotated by comparative mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) localization. Transcription was investigated in the cerebrum, cerebellum, spleen, muscle, lymph node, duodenum and blood, and transcripts were detected for 6 of the 11 pseudogenes in some of these tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In the present work we have characterized the ovine RPSA family. Our results have revealed the existence of 11 ovine RPSA pseudogenes and provide new data on their structure and sequence. Such information will facilitate molecular studies of the functional RPSA gene taking into account the existence of these pseudogenes in the design of experiments. It remains to be investigated if the transcribed members are functional as regulatory non-coding RNA or as functional proteins.",M2
20231497,"Sensitivity of fluorescence in situ hybridization for melanoma diagnosis using RREB1, MYB, Cep6, and 11q13 probes in melanoma subtypes.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) using probes targeting 6p25, 6q23, 11q13, and Cep6 in melanoma subtypes. DESIGN: Blinded comparison of chromosomal copy number changes detected using FISH targeting 6p25, 6q23, 11q13, and Cep6 in benign nevi and melanoma subtypes. SETTING: Dermatopathology Laboratory, Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ten individuals with benign nevi and 123 with melanoma (70 superficial spreading, 28 lentigo maligna, 22 nodular, and 3 acral lentiginous melanomas). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity of previously developed criteria using FISH using probes targeting 6p25, 6q23, 11q13, and Cep6 in the melanoma subtypes. RESULTS: Overall, sensitivity was 83.0% and specificity was 94.0%. The 6p25 gain criterion had the highest sensitivity overall and in each subtype. The assay was most sensitive in the subgroups of nodular and acral melanomas and least sensitive in the superficial spreading subtype. The 11q13 gain was more commonly seen in chronically sun-damaged skin and infrequently in non-chronically sun-damaged skin. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous changes in melanoma occur at the molecular level, and the changes are different among melanoma subtypes. Clonal abnormalities in chromosome 6 with increased copies of the short arm relative to the long arm are common in all melanoma subtypes, suggesting that isochromosome 6 is common in all variants of cutaneous melanoma subtypes. An increase in copy number of 11q13 is most frequent in chronically sun-damaged melanomas.",M2

20227843,"Bacterioplankton diversity and community composition in the Southern Lagoon of Venice.The Lagoon of Venice is a large water basin that exchanges water with the Northern Adriatic Sea through three large inlets. In this study, the 16S rRNA approach was used to investigate the bacterial diversity and community composition within the southern basin of the Lagoon of Venice and at one inlet in October 2007 and June 2008. Comparative sequence analysis of 645 mostly partial 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated high diversity and dominance of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes at the lagoon as well as at the inlet station, therefore pointing to significant mixing. Many of these sequences were close to the 16S rRNA of marine, often coastal, bacterioplankton, such as the Roseobacter clade, the family Vibrionaceae, and class Flavobacteria. Sequences of Actinobacteria were indicators of a freshwater input. The composition of the bacterioplankton was quantified by catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-<e>FISH</e>) with a set of rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. CARD-FISH counts corroborated the dominance of members of the phyla Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. When assessed by a probe set for the quantification of selected clades within Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, bacterioplankton composition differed between October 2007 and June 2008, and also between the inlet and the lagoon. In particular, members of the readily culturable copiotrophic gammaproteobacterial genera Vibrio, Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas were enriched in the southern basin of the Lagoon of Venice. Interestingly, the alphaproteobacterial SAR11 clade and related clusters were also present in high abundances at the inlet and within the lagoon, which was indicative of inflow of water from the open sea.",M2
20225199,"Detection of chromosomal anomalies in endometrial atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma by using fluorescence in situ hybridization.BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is the most common pelvic gynecological malignancy. The diagnosis of well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma, atypical hyperplasia, and hyperplasia is often challenging. The authors sought to investigate the utility of chromosomal anomalies for the detection of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using multitarget fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>). METHODS: Samples were collected by endometrial Tao brush and processed by liquid-based cytological preparation protocol from consecutive cases to include 50 benign, 50 hyperplasia without atypia, 47 atypical hyperplasia, and 53 endometrial cancers. Each was hybridized using fluorescence-labeled DNA probes to chromosomes 1, 8, and 10. The FISH signals were enumerated in 100 cells per case, and the chromosomal anomalies were correlated with pathologic findings, including histologic diagnoses on matched endometrial tissue samples. RESULTS: Numeric chromosomal anomalies were found in 0% (0 of 50) of benign, 20% (10 of 50) of hyperplasia, 74% (35 of 47) of atypical hyperplasia, and 87% (46 of 53) of carcinoma specimens. The mean percentage of cells with chromosomal changes was 55% in cancer specimens, which was significantly higher than that in hyperplasia without atypia (13%, P &lt; .0001) and atypical hyperplasia (32%, P = .003). The most frequent chromosomal anomaly was gain of chromosome 1. FISH anomalies had an overall sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 90% for the detection of atypical hyperplasia and/or endometrial carcinoma. There was no association with grade of endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Multitarget FISH appears to be useful for the differential diagnosis of hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial adenocarcinoma, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. It is also a potential tool for the early detection of neoplastic cells in endometrial cytology specimens. Endometrial hyperplasia with FISH-detected chromosomal anomalies may represent a clinically significant subset of cases that warrant close clinical follow-up.",M2
20224843,"Cardiac abnormalities and facial anthropometric measurements in children from the Free State and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa with chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion.INTRODUCTION: Microdeletions of chromosome 22 are common and have a prevalence of at least 1/4 000. Cardiac abnormalities, abnormal facial features and palatal abnormalities are frequently present in these patients. AIM: To describe the cardiac lesions and selected measurable facial features in children from the Free State and Northern Cape presenting at the Cardiology Unit of the Universitas Academic Hospital complex in Bloemfontein. METHODS: This was a prospective study in which patients with abnormal facial characteristics were tested using a fluorescence in situ hybridisation (<e>FISH</e>) probe for the 22q11.2 microdeletion. Forty children tested positive for the microdeletion. All patients underwent an echocardiogram and where possible, facial anthropometric measurements were performed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 3.6 years (range 0.04 years, i.e. 2 weeks to 16.2 years). Tetralogy with or without pulmonary atresia was diagnosed in 43% (n = 17) of the children and truncus arteriosus in 20% (n = 8). A rightsided aortic arch was present in 43% (n = 17) of the patients. Mid-facial height was slightly longer (median = 1.0; range -0.5 to 3.3) and width narrower (median = -1.4; range -2.2 to 0.1) than normal. Ear height and width were notably small compared to normal, with median -scores = -3.3 (range -4.8 to -2.6) and = -2.4 (range -3.4 to -1.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Microdeletions of chromosome 22q11 are present in children from the Free State and Northern Cape. Conotruncal cyanotic heart lesions, especially tetralogy with or without pulmonary atresia and truncus arteriosus were the most frequent congenital cardiac diagnoses. A right-sided aortic arch was also commonly present in these children. Facial features varied and small ears were the most noteworthy anthropometric feature. A right-sided aortic arch with or without a congenital cardiac lesion, a long, narrow mid-face and small ears should alert the physician to the possibility of a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22.",M2

This study describes the development of fluorescently labelled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides and a FISH assay to detect and identify Cryptococcus neoformans in culture and biological samples. All C. neoformans reference and clinical isolates gave positive signals with the specific oligonucleotide probes, whereas all non-target yeast species gave negative reactions with the same probes. The assay was also successfully applied to the detection of C. neoformans cells in cerebrospinal samples from patients with clinical diagnosis of cryptococcosis. The described FISH-based assay revealed to be practical, sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of C. neoformans yeasts.",M2
20218056,"A fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) procedure to assist in differentiating benign from malignant melanocytic lesions.OBJECTIVE: Misdiagnosis of melanocytic lesions can result in unnecessary psychological distress to patients, under- or overtreatment, inaccurate prognosis and improper follow-up and family member surveillance. It is well recognized that, despite many attempts to 1) put forth a set of histologic criteria that can accurately and reproducibly be used to diagnose melanocytic lesions, and 2) identify reliable markers of malignancy as an adjunct to routine histopathology, misdiagnoses still occur in a significant number of cases. METHOD: A multi-color FISH probe mixture has been devised to assist pathologists in differential diagnosis of difficult melanocytic lesions. The mixture includes a centromeric probe for chromosome 6 and unique sequence probes for three other chromosomal regions that have most frequently shown amplifications or deletions in melanoma. We have carried out a preliminary evaluation of this new probe set in 25 cases of benign and malignant pigmented lesions. RESULTS: The tool reliably identified all nevi and ordinary melanomas, and only failed to identify a pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma and two malignant lesions that, by morphology and behavior, have distinct features from common invasive melanomas, i.e., a desmoplastic melanoma and a nevoid melanoma. Considering this, 100% specificity and 75% sensitivity was achieved. CONCLUSION: The FISH tool used in this study was able to separate accurately benign nevi from ordinary melanoma. Failure to identify uncommon melanocytic lesions adds to its advantage and calls for further studies to unveil the molecular profile of these rare entities.",M2
20216378,"Accurately assessing her-2/neu status in needle core biopsies of breast cancer patients in the era of neoadjuvant therapy: emerging questions and considerations addressed.BACKGROUND: Emerging data show that patients with operable, HER-2/neu overexpressed/amplified breast carcinomas have significantly better responses (more frequently obtaining pathologic complete response and greater percent disease-free survival) when treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin) simultaneously with neoadjuvant chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. With the increasing use of neoadjuvant therapies, clinicians require information on biomarkers including HER-2/neu status at the time of needle core biopsy. Concordance rates between fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>)-determined HER-2/neu status on needle core biopsies and on subsequent excisional biopsies of the same tumor have not been well studied. Moreover, the practice of automatically performing ( reflexing ) 2+ immunohistochemical (IHC) staining needle core biopsies for FISH analysis on the same sample needs to be validated. In this study, we set out to (1) determine the accuracy of HER-2/neu status as determined by FISH on needle core biopsy material compared with FISH on the subsequent excisional biopsy of the same tumor with special consideration of IHC 2+staining cases and (2) determine the constancy of HER-2/neu status in pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated tumor in the form of needle core biopsy and excisional biopsy samples, respectively. DESIGN: 100 patients whose needle core biopsies and subsequent excisional biopsy samples were pathologically evaluated at our institution were studied. For each patient, unstained sections from both specimens were prepared and used for IHC or FISH. IHC was carried out using the HercepTest kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Parallel unstained slides were used to carry out FISH (dual probe, Vysis). Statistical analyses were carried out on the resulting data generated after interpretation. RESULTS: The concordance rate between FISH results determined on the needle core biopsy and subsequent excisional biopsy of the same tumor was 86% (kappa=0.56, P=2x10). If equivocal FISH cases (&gt; or =1.8 to &lt; or =2.2 amplification ratio) in a needle core biopsy or excisional biopsy specimen or both, were excluded, the concordance rate increased to 95% (kappa coefficient=0.86, P=2x10). Fourteen of 100 (14%) cases showed 2+ IHC staining in the needle core biopsy specimen with good concordance of FISH-determined HER-2/neu status between the needle core biopsy and excisional biopsy specimens (79% agreement and kappa=0.512, P=0.05). Nine, 3, and 2 cases of the 14 cases were amplified, equivocal, and negative on the excisional biopsy specimens, respectively. Of the 15 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 93% and 87% had no change in HER-2/neu status as determined by IHC or FISH, respectively, in the excisional biopsy specimen when compared with that determined on the prior core biopsy sample. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent overall concordance was achieved between FISH-determined HER-2/neu status on the needle core biopsy and that determined on the subsequent excisional biopsy of the same tumor. These results suggest that intratumoral heterogeneity of HER-2/neu assessed by FISH is not a significant confounding factor when analyzing smaller sized samples. Furthermore, 79% of 2+IHC staining needle core biopsy cases showed concordant FISH results in the needle core biopsy and subsequent excisional biopsy specimens. Our results show good concordance, however, larger cohorts need to be studied to verify this finding. HER-2/neu status remains unchanged in the majority of cases when comparing pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated specimens.",M2
20215729,"Chromosomal evolution in the Brazilian geckos of the genus Gymnodactylus (Squamata, Phyllodactylidae) from the biomes of Cerrado, Caatinga and Atlantic rain forest: evidence of Robertsonian fusion events and supernumerary chromosomes.Chromosomes of the South American geckos Gymnodactylus amarali and G. geckoides from open and dry areas of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil, respectively, were studied for the first time, after conventional and AgNOR staining, CBG- and RBG-banding, and <e>FISH</e> with telomeric sequences. Comparative analyses between the karyotypes of open areas and the previously studied Atlantic forest species G. darwinii were also performed. The chromosomal polymorphisms detected in populations of G. amarali from the states of Goiás and Tocantins is the result of centric fusions (2n = 38, 39 and 40), suggesting a differentiation from a 2n = 40 ancestral karyotype and the presence of supernumerary chromosomes. The CBG- and RBG-banding patterns of the Bs are described. G. geckoides has 40 chromosomes with gradually decreasing sizes, but it is distinct from the 2n = 40 karyotypes of G. amarali and G. darwinii due to occurrence of pericentric inversions or centromere repositioning. NOR location seems to be a marker for Gymnodactylus, as G. amarali and G. geckoides share a medium-sized subtelocentric NOR-bearing pair, while G. darwinii has NORs at the secondary constriction of the long arm of pair 1. The comparative analyses indicate a non-random nature of the Robertsonian rearrangements in the genus Gymnodactylus.",M2
20212114,"The latent human herpesvirus-6A genome specifically integrates in telomeres of human chromosomes in vivo and in vitro.Previous research has suggested that human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) may integrate into host cell chromosomes and be vertically transmitted in the germ line, but the evidence--primarily fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>)--is indirect. We sought, first, to definitively test these two hypotheses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from families in which several members, including at least one parent and child, had unusually high copy numbers of HHV-6 DNA per milliliter of blood. FISH confirmed that HHV-6 DNA colocalized with telomeric regions of one allele on chromosomes 17p13.3, 18q23, and 22q13.3, and that the integration site was identical among members of the same family. Integration of the HHV-6 genome into TTAGGG telomere repeats was confirmed by additional methods and sequencing of the integration site. Partial sequencing of the viral genome identified the same integrated HHV-6A strain within members of families, confirming vertical transmission of the viral genome. We next asked whether HHV-6A infection of naïve cell lines could lead to integration. Following infection of naïve Jjhan and HEK-293 cell lines by HHV-6, the virus integrated into telomeres. Reactivation of integrated HHV-6A virus from individuals' PBMCs as well as cell lines was successfully accomplished by compounds known to induce latent herpesvirus replication. Finally, no circular episomal forms were detected even by PCR. Taken together, the data suggest that HHV-6 is unique among human herpesviruses: it specifically and efficiently integrates into telomeres of chromosomes during latency rather than forming episomes, and the integrated viral genome is capable of producing virions.",M2
20211207,"Visualization of initial bacterial colonization on dentine and enamel in situ.Bacterial colonization of dentine is of high relevance in cariology, endodontology and periodontology. The aim of the present in situ study was to establish recent methods for visualization and quantification of initial bacterial adherence to dentine in comparison to enamel. For this purpose, bovine enamel and dentine slabs were fixed on buccal sites of individual upper jaw splints worn by 6 subjects for 30min, 120min and 360min, respectively. Adherent bacteria on the slabs were visualized and quantified with DAPI-staining (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) of streptococci and eubacteria using the CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy) as well as an epifluorescence microscope. In addition, the number of colony forming units was quantified after desorption. Representative samples were processed for SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy). All methods clearly indicated that a significantly higher number of bacteria adhered to dentine than to enamel. Furthermore, the amount of bacteria on the dentine increased with increasing oral exposure time, but remained rather constant on the enamel. The CLSM allowed visualization of bacteria in the dentinal tubules. Bacteria were found preferentially at the openings of the dentine tubules, but were distributed randomly on the enamel. In conclusion, the adopted methods are suitable for visualization and quantification of bacterial adhesion to dentine. Even the initial bacterial colonization of dentine is much more pronounced than bacterial adherence to the enamel.",M2
20205957,"Rapid differentiation of Francisella species and subspecies by fluorescent in situ hybridization targeting the 23S rRNA.BACKGROUND: Francisella (F.) tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia. Due to its low infectious dose, ease of dissemination and high case fatality rate, F. tularensis was the subject in diverse biological weapons programs and is among the top six agents with high potential if misused in bioterrorism. Microbiological diagnosis is cumbersome and time-consuming. Methods for the direct detection of the pathogen (immunofluorescence, PCR) have been developed but are restricted to reference laboratories. RESULTS: The complete 23S rRNA genes of representative strains of F. philomiragia and all subspecies of F. tularensis were sequenced. Single nucleotide polymorphisms on species and subspecies level were confirmed by partial amplification and sequencing of 24 additional strains. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) assays were established using species- and subspecies-specific probes.Different FISH protocols allowed the positive identification of all 4 F. philomiragia strains, and more than 40 F. tularensis strains tested. By combination of different probes, it was possible to differentiate the F. tularensis subspecies holarctica, tularensis, mediasiatica and novicida. No cross reactivity with strains of 71 clinically relevant bacterial species was observed. FISH was also successfully applied to detect different F. tularensis strains in infected cells or tissue samples. In blood culture systems spiked with F. tularensis, bacterial cells of different subspecies could be separated within single samples. CONCLUSION: We could show that FISH targeting the 23S rRNA gene is a rapid and versatile method for the identification and differentiation of F. tularensis isolates from both laboratory cultures and clinical samples.",M2
20203476,"Standardized reference ideogram for physical mapping in the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus).Basic cytogenetic data, such as diploid number and general chromosome morphology, are available for many reptilian species. Here we present a detailed cytogenetic examination of the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) karyotype, including the creation of the first fully annotated G-band standard ideogram for any crocodilian species. The C. porosus karyotype contains macrochromosomes and has a diploid number of 34. This study presents a detailed description of each chromosome, permitting unambiguous chromosome identification. The fully annotated standardized C. porosus ideogram provides the backbone to a standard nomenclature system which can be used to accurately identify specific band locations. Seven microsatellite containing fosmid clones were fluorescently labeled and used as fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) probes for physical localization. Chromosome locations for each of these FISH probes were successfully assigned, demonstrating the utility of the fully annotated ideogram for genome mapping.",M2
20203257,"Subcuticular bacteria associated with two common New Zealand echinoderms: Characterization using 16S rRNA sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.Many echinoderms contain subcuticular bacteria (SCB), symbionts which reside in the lumen between the host's epidermal cells and outer cuticle. This relationship is common, existing in about 60% of echinoderms studied so far, yet the function of SCB remains largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic analysis was carried out on 16S rRNA sequences obtained from echinoderm-associated bacteria, resulting in the identification of four species of putative SCB. All four bacteria were identified from the holothurian Stichopus mollis, and two of the four were also found in the asteroid Patiriella sp. Two of these bacteria belong to the Alphaproteobacteria, and two to the Gammaproteobacteria. In addition to phylogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) assays were carried out on Patiriella sp., S. mollis, and the asteroid Astrostole scabra. Results showed that Patiriella sp. and S. mollis contain SCB, in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis, while SCB were not detected in A. scabra. Of the bacteria detected using FISH, more than 80% were recognized as belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria in both host species. However, in S. mollis about 20% of the detected SCB successfully hybridized with the Gammaproteobacteria-specific probe, whereas bacteria belonging to this class were never observed in Patiriella sp. This is only the second study to characterize SCB by molecular means, and is the first to identify SCB in situ using FISH.",M2
20203220,"Out of the darkness and into the light: bright field in situ hybridisation for delineation of ERBB2 (HER2) status in breast carcinoma.Assessment of ERBB2 (HER2) status in breast carcinomas has become critical in determining response to the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. The current joint College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for the evaluation of HER2 status in breast carcinoma involve testing by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (<e>FISH</e>). However, neither of these modalities is without limitations. Novel bright field in situ hybridisation techniques continue to provide viable alternatives to FISH testing. While these techniques are not limited to evaluation of the HER2 gene, the extensive number of studies comparing bright field in situ techniques with other methods of assessing HER2 status allow a robust evaluation of this approach. Analysis of the literature demonstrates that, when used to assess HER2 gene status, bright field in situ hybridisation demonstrates excellent concordance with FISH results. The average percentage agreement in an informal analysis of studies comparing HER2 amplification by chromogenic in situ hybridisation with FISH was 96% (SD 4%); kappa coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 1.0. Although a much smaller number of studies are available for review, similar levels of concordance have been reported in studies comparing HER2 amplification by methods employing metallography (silver in situ hybridisation) with FISH. A summary of the advancements in bright field in situ hybridisation, with focus on those techniques with clinical applications of interest to the practicing pathologist, is presented.",M2
20198419,"<e>FISH</e> mapping of microsatellite loci from Drosophila subobscura and its comparison to related species.Microsatellites are highly polymorphic markers that are distributed through all the genome being more abundant in non-coding regions. Whether they are neutral or under selection, these markers if localized can be used as co-dominant molecular markers to explore the dynamics of the evolutionary processes. Their cytological localization can allow identifying genes under selection, inferring recombination from a genomic point of view, or screening for the genomic reorganizations occurring during the evolution of a lineage, among others. In this paper, we report for the first time the localization of microsatellite loci by fluorescent in situ hybridization on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. In Drosophila subobscura, 72 dinucleotide microsatellite loci were localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization yielding unique hybridization signals. In the sex chromosome, microsatellite distribution was not uniform and its density was higher than in autosomes. We identified homologous segments to the sequence flanking the microsatellite loci by browsing the genome sequence of Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila melanogaster. Their localization supports the conservation of Muller's chromosomal elements among Drosophila species and the existence of multiple intrachromosomal rearrangements within each evolutionary lineage. Finally, the lack of microsatellite repeats in the homologous D. melanogaster sequences suggests convergent evolution for high microsatellite density in the distal part of the X chromosome.",M2
20195387,"Sex-related differences in length and erosion dynamics of human telomeres favor females.Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at chromosomal ends contributing to genomic integrity. In somatic cells, telomeres are shortened during DNA reduplication. Thus, telomere erosion has been regarded as a biological clock. Applying the telomere/centromere (T/C)-<e>FISH</e> technique to human peripheral blood lymphocytes, we showed that pangenomically, telomere shortening is linear in centenarians and that this attrition is delayed in females. Statistics reveal a greater skewness in telomere length distribution in females. As the morphological correlate, we find abnormally long telomeres distributed at random. This  erratic extensive elongation  (EEE) of telomeres is a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon in non-neoplastic cells, and females are more successful in this respect. As evidenced by endoreduplication, EEE is transmitted to the cells' progeny. The mechanism involved is likely to be the alternative pathway of telomere elongation (ALT), counteracting erosion and already known to operate in neoplastic cells.",M2
20194460,"Fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) of mitotic chromosomes from Drosophila larval brain.The fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique permits fine mapping of both middle and highly repetitive DNA sequences along Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin. Best results are obtained when this technique is coupled with DAPI staining and digital recording of fluorescent signals. For example, if digital images of the FISH signals and DAPI fluorescence are detected separately using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, they can then be pseudocolored and merged using suitable computer programs. This allows precise overlapping of the DAPI banding (which is identical to the Hoechst 33258 banding) and the FISH signals, facilitating the assignment of the repetitive sequence under study to specific regions of the cytological map of D. melanogaster heterochromatin. This article describes FISH procedures that are routinely used with larval brain squashes, including preparation of slides, preparation of biotin- and digoxigenin-labeled probes, hybridization, and detection.",M2
20193844,"Molecular cytogenetic analysis of Korean patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia.To compare the molecular cytogenetic characteristics between Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) and multiple myeloma (MM), we performed interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) in Korean patients with WM and MM. Forty patients with WM and 132 patients with MM were enrolled onto the study. FISH was performed with seven different probes: 6q21, 6q23, CEP4, CEP9, immunoglobulin (IgH) breakapart, RB1 gene, and 1q25. Out of 22 WM patients, 4 (18%) had abnormal karyotypes, mainly structural changes on conventional karyotyping. After performing FISH for the available 29 cases, deletions of 6q23 and 6q21 were newly detected in 3 cases (10%). There was no other anomaly, including trisomy 4 in WM. No 6q deletion was observed in MM patients, but RB1 deletion was the most common change (45%), followed by IgH translocation (42%) and gain of 1q (38%). In conclusion, Korean WM patients had a low rate of 6q deletion (10%) and no trisomy 4.",M2
20193483,"Use of amniocytes for prenatal diagnosis of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome: a feasibility study.BACKGROUND: A study of prenatal genetic diagnosis for 22q11.2 microdeletion, which has a wide phenotypic spectrum that involves almost all organs, is rarely reported in China. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of 22q11.2 microdeletion in congenitally malformed fetuses via the fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) technique and to investigate the feasibility of use of amniocytes to diagnose 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome prenatally. METHODS: The study enrolled 23 cases of fetal cardiac malformation, as indicated by ultrasound in Beijing Anzhen Hospital and 14 cases of non-cardiac malformation, as determined by type-B ultrasound in Beijing Anzhen Hospital and other hospitals. Amniotic fluid was obtained by amniocentesis before odinopoeia, and the stillborn fetuses of the induced labor were preceded to autopsy. The amniotic fluid of 20 cesarean deliveries during the same period of time was used as a control. The TUPLE1 gene in the amniotic fluid of malformed and normal fetuses was assessed by the FISH method. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of the TUPLE1 gene deletion in the amniotic fluid cells from fetuses with cardiac deformations and fetuses without such malformations were 43.5% and 57.1%, respectively. The deletion of TUPLE1 was significantly associated with fetal malformation. CONCLUSION: Chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion is one of the major factors leading to fetal congenital malformations, and prenatal FISH screening for 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome is technically feasible using amniocytes.",M2

METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-eight women, 30 - 59 year-old and having normal intelligence in a community of Shenzhen, were examined with liquid-based cytology. Human pappiloma-virus (HR-HPV) was tested by hybrid capture II (HC-II) and hTERC gene detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>). Patients with ASCUS and above lesion, and/or positive HR-HPV results and/or amplification of hTERC gene were examined by colposcopy, multiple biopsies of cervical quadrant and pathology. RESULTS: The frequencies of CIN I, II, III, cervical cancer were 55 (14.18%), 4 (1.03%), 9 (2.32%) and 1 (0.26%) respectively, with the rate of hTERC gene amplification as 8.76%. There were significantly differences of hTERC amplification among the samples with different cytological and histological lesions as well with HPV infection (P &lt; 0.01). (1) The positive rate of HPV infection was 17.01%; the positive rates of hTERC gene amplification were 19.70% in HPV positive and 6.52% in HPV negative samples and the results were significantly different (P &lt; 0.01). (2) Cytologically, the rates of hTERC gene amplification appeared to be as follows: NILM (5.97%), ASCUS (18.75%), LSIL (10.00%), ASC-H (66.67%), HSIL (100.00%). There was a marked increase of hTERC amplification in patients with HSIL and above lesions (P &lt; 0.01). (3) On histology findings, the rates of hTERC gene amplification were as follows: NILM (0%), CIN I (5.45%), CIN II (50.00%), CIN III (77.78%), and invasive carcinoma (100.00%). There was a marked increase of hTERC amplification in patients with CIN II and above lesions (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: There was a close correlation between amplification of hTERC and histological as well cytological lesions which increased progressively along with the severity of cytological and histological grade. The evidence of hTERC, with or without amplification, might serve as a prognostic indicator to measure the grade of lesion.",M2
20193127,"Pig large tumor suppressor 2 (Lats2), a novel gene that may regulate the fat reduction in adipocyte.Clenbuterol, a Beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, has been proven to be a powerful repartition agent that can decrease fat deposition. Based on results from our previous cDNA microarray experiment of pig clenbuterol administration, a novel up-regulated EST was full-length cloned (4859 bp encoding 1041 amino acids) and found to be the pig homolog of large tumor suppressor 2 (Lats2). We mapped pig Lats2 to chromosome 11p13-14 by using <e>FISH</e>, and western blotting demonstrated that pig Lats2 protein was most abundant in adipose. In Drosophila, Lats2 ortholog was reported as a key component of the Hippo pathway which regulates cell differentiation and growth. Here, we show that pig Lats2 exhibit inverted expression to YAP1, another member of the Hippo pathway which positively regulates cell growth and proliferation, during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Our results suggested that Lats2 may involve in Hippo pathway regulating the fat reduction by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation and growth.",M2
20190090,"Biofilm formation on reverse osmosis membranes is initiated and dominated by Sphingomonas spp.The initial formation and spatiotemporal development of microbial biofilm layers on surfaces of new and clean reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and feed-side spacers were monitored in situ using flow cells placed in parallel with the RO system of a full-scale water treatment plant. The feed water of the RO system had been treated by the sequential application of coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration, ultrafiltration, and cartridge filtration processes. The design of the flow cells permitted the production of permeate under cross-flow conditions similar to those in spiral-wound RO membrane elements of the full-scale system. Membrane autopsies were done after 4, 8, 16, and 32 days of flow-cell operation. A combination of molecular (fluorescence in situ hybridization [<e>FISH</e>], denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE], and cloning) and microscopic (field emission scanning electron, epifluorescence, and confocal laser scanning microscopy) techniques was applied to analyze the abundance, composition, architecture, and three-dimensional structure of biofilm communities. The results of the study point out the unique role of Sphingomonas spp. in the initial formation and subsequent maturation of biofilms on the RO membrane and feed-side spacer surfaces.",M2
20188804,"Twelve-gel slide format optimised for comet assay and fluorescent in situ hybridisation.The comet assay is widely used to measure DNA damage and repair in basic research, genotoxicity testing and human biomonitoring. The conventional format has 1 or 2 gels on a microscope slide, 1 sample per slide. To increase throughput, we have designed and tested a system with 12 smaller gels on one slide, allowing incubation of individual gels with different reagents or enzymes. Thus several times more samples can be analysed with one electrophoresis run, and fewer cells and smaller volumes of test solutions are required. Applications of the modified method include treatment with genotoxic agents at different concentrations; simultaneous analysis of different lesions using a range of enzymes; analysis of cell extracts for DNA repair activity; and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (<e>FISH</e>) to comet DNA with specific labelled probes.",M2
20186810,"Prenatal diagnosis of a recombinant chromosome 7 resulting in trisomy 7q11.22 --&gt; qter.Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 7 is complex due to only a few reported cases. We report here on a stillborn boy with very large duplication of 7q11.22 --&gt; qter, encompassing almost the entire long arm of chromosome 7. Ultrasound, fetal and parental chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses were performed. Sonographic findings included growth retardation, micrognathia, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic coarctation, bradyarrhythmia, pericardial effusion, bilateral hydronephrosis, infravesical obstruction, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Chromosome analysis after cordocentesis at 23 weeks of gestation revealed an abnormal male karyotype with 46 chromosomes and a derivative chromosome 7 with a very large duplication of the long arm, 46,XY,der(7)(qter --&gt; q11.2::p22 --&gt; qter). The mother was found to carry an apparently balanced pericentric inversion, 46,XX,inv(7)(p22q11.2). Thus, the recombinant chromosome 7 [rec(7)dup(7q)inv(7)(p22.3q11.22)mat] of the fetus must have arisen through meiotic crossing-over between the inverted chromosome and the normal chromosome 7 in the maternal germline. FISH and array CGH results confirmed the recombinant chromosome 7 in the fetus and indicated a loss of 1.9 Mb at chromosome 7pter --&gt; p22.3 (pter to 1,948,072 bp), and a gain of 87.04 Mb at chromosome 7q11.22 --&gt; qter (71,760,154 bp to qter). The rare syndrome of almost complete trisomy 7q may be suspected in cases of growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, micrognathia, aortic coarctation and VSD and hydronephrosis. Invasive prenatal diagnosis must be offered to the parents.",M2
20185966,"Real-time RT-PCR analysis for evaluating the Her2/neu status in breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The Her2/neu status is of great clinical value in breast tumor patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques are the test of choice for many practicing pathologies. The main objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the relationship between Her2/neu breast cancer amplification and overexpression (DNA, mRNA and protein). METHODS: To accomplish this goal, we evaluated Her2/neu mRNA expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, gene amplification by FISH and protein expression by IHC. RESULTS: An excellent correlation between FISH and IHC Her2/neu results was observed, confirming that protein levels were directly related to DNA amplification. Polysomy 17 was frequently found in tumors showing Her2/neu overexpression. However, we did not find any statistically significant correlation among DNA, mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that Her2/neu could be post-transcriptionally regulated. CONCLUSIONS: There was a highagreement between Her2/neu gene amplification and protein overexpression but not mRNA expression levels. Nevertheless, IHC3+ and FISH-positive tumors indicated higher expression levels of Her2/neu mRNA by RT-PCR than those observed in IHC and FISH-negative tumors. These findings question the relevance of quantitative RT-PCR in routine assessment of Her2/neu overexpression in human breast cancer in the clinical laboratory setting.",M2
20184781,"Genomic aberrations in borderline ovarian tumors.BACKGROUND: According to the scientific literature, less than 30 borderline ovarian tumors have been karyotyped and less than 100 analyzed for genomic imbalances by CGH. METHODS: We report a series of borderline ovarian tumors (n = 23) analyzed by G-banding and karyotyping as well as high resolution CGH; in addition, the tumors were analyzed for microsatellite stability status and by <e>FISH</e> for possible 6q deletion. RESULTS: All informative tumors were microsatellite stable and none had a deletion in 6q27. All cases with an abnormal karyotype had simple chromosomal aberrations with +7 and +12 as the most common. In three tumors with single structural rearrangements, a common breakpoint in 3q13 was detected. The major copy number changes detected in the borderline tumors were gains from chromosome arms 2q, 6q, 8q, 9p, and 13q and losses from 1p, 12q, 14q, 15q, 16p, 17p, 17q, 19p, 19q, and 22q. The series included five pairs of bilateral tumors and, in two of these pairs, informative data were obtained as to their clonal relationship. In both pairs, similarities were found between the tumors from the right and left side, strongly indicating that bilaterality had occurred via a metastatic process. The bilateral tumors as a group showed more aberrations than did the unilateral ones, consistent with the view that bilaterality is a sign of more advanced disease. CONCLUSION: Because some of the imbalances found in borderline ovarian tumors seem to be similar to imbalances already known from the more extensively studied overt ovarian carcinomas, we speculate that the subset of borderline tumors with detectable imbalances or karyotypic aberrations may contain a smaller subset of tumors with a tendency to develop a more malignant phenotype. The group of borderline tumors with no imbalances would, in this line of thinking, have less or no propensity for clonal evolution and development to full-blown carcinomas.",M2

Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) test results showed that 5%, 9.5%, 14%, 24%, 29%, 38% and 62% inhibition occurred in the potential methane production (PMP) rate of the sludge at toluene concentrations of 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.6 mM and 1 mM, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) results showed that relative abundance of archaeal cells was approx. 19% throughout the SMA tests. The anaerobic sludge was dominated by acetoclastic genus Methanosaeta which were slightly affected by increasing toluene concentrations do not have any effect on relative abundance of Methanosaeta spp., which was between 73% +/- 1.6 and 68% +/- 2.1 of the archaeal population.",M2
20178124,"Experimental evaluation of decrease in the activities of polyphosphate/glycogen-accumulating organisms due to cell death and activity decay in activated sludge.Decrease in bacterial activity (biomass decay) in activated sludge can result from cell death (reduction in the amount of active bacteria) and activity decay (reduction in the specific activity of active bacteria). The goal of this study was to experimentally differentiate between cell death and activity decay as the cause of decrease in bacterial activity. By means of measuring maximal anaerobic phosphate release rates, verifying membrane integrity by live/dead staining and verifying presence of 16S rRNA with fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), the decay rates and death rates of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) in a biological nutrient removal (BNR) system and a laboratory phosphate removing sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system were determined, respectively, under famine conditions. In addition, the decay rate and death rate of glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) in a SBR system with an enrichment culture of GAOs were also measured under famine conditions. Hereto the maximal anaerobic volatile fatty acid uptake rates, live/dead staining, and FISH were used. The experiments revealed that in the BNR and enriched PAO-SBR systems, activity decay contributed 58% and 80% to the decreased activities of PAOs, and that cell death was responsible for 42% and 20% of decreases in their respective activities. In the enriched GAOs system, activity decay constituted a proportion of 74% of the decreased activity of GAOs, and cell death only accounted for 26% of the decrease of their activity.",M2

20173501,"Amplification of the human telomerase gene in liquid-based preparations is associated with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma.The aim of this study was to analyze the amplification of the human telomerase gene (TERC) in cervical specimens by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), and FISH findings were compared with cytologic and histologic diagnoses. Slides prepared from 123 liquid-based preparations from cervical specimens with cytologic diagnoses of negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (n=20), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (n=22), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n=55), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n=21), or invasive cervical carcinomas (n=5) were analyzed for the amplification of TERC using a 2-color FISH probe. The results of the cytologic analysis and those of concurrent or subsequent biopsies were compared with the FISH findings. Results showed that amplification of TERC was significantly associated with both cytologic and histologic diagnoses (P&lt;0.05). Patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or squamous cell carcinoma cytology diagnoses had significantly higher percentages of cells with the amplification of TERC than did patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, ASC-US, and negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (P&lt;0.005). FISH can be performed on cervical liquid-based preparations to detect the amplification of TERC. This test may be an adjunct to cytology screening, early detection of cervix neoplasm, and may determine the progressive potential of individual lesions, especially in high-risk patients.",M2
20173065,"Rickettsia symbionts cause parthenogenetic reproduction in the parasitoid wasp Pnigalio soemius (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae).Bacteria in the genus Rickettsia are intracellular symbionts of disparate groups of organisms. Some Rickettsia strains infect vertebrate animals and plants, where they cause diseases, but most strains are vertically inherited symbionts of invertebrates. In insects Rickettsia symbionts are known to have diverse effects on hosts ranging from influencing host fitness to manipulating reproduction. Here we provide evidence that a Rickettsia symbiont causes thelytokous parthenogenesis (in which mothers produce only daughters from unfertilized eggs) in a parasitoid wasp, Pnigalio soemius (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Feeding antibiotics to thelytokous female wasps resulted in production of progeny that were almost all males. Cloning and sequencing of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene amplified with universal primers, diagnostic PCR screening of symbiont lineages associated with manipulation of reproduction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) revealed that Rickettsia is always associated with thelytokous P. soemius and that no other bacteria that manipulate reproduction are present. Molecular analyses and FISH showed that Rickettsia is distributed in the reproductive tissues and is transovarially transmitted from mothers to offspring. Comparison of antibiotic-treated females and untreated females showed that infection had no cost. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and gltA gene sequences placed the symbiont of P. soemius in the bellii group and indicated that there have been two separate origins of the parthenogenesis-inducing phenotype in the genus Rickettsia. A possible route for evolution of induction of parthenogenesis in the two distantly related Rickettsia lineages is discussed.",M2
20169940,"[Comparison of two HER-2 <e>FISH</e> kits on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues: signal detection and simple procedure]The gene amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) help to select breast cancer patients who could benefit from therapeutic strategies targeting HER-2, trastuzumab. For formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens, the preprocessing procedure, which is consisted of heat-treatment and protease digestion, is necessary to detect probe specific signal by FISH. We compared the findings of two commercial kits for HER-2 (Histra HER2 FISH Kit [JOKOH CO.LTD] and Pathvysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit [Abbot Molecular CO. LTD]) using 9 breast cancer specimens, which were fixed in formalin for various durations after the surgical extirpation or biopsy. The two kits showed the same results that HER-2/17 centromere (17cen) signal ratio was within normal rage (&lt; 2.0) in 7 cases among 9 and was over 2.0 in remaining 2. Histra could obtain sufficient signals on both surgical and needle biopsy speciments after the same pretreatments. PathVysion, on the other hand, require a different protease or modification of protease digestion time. Furthermore, the specific signals for HER-2 and 17cen could be observed more clearly by Histra than PathVysion under fluorescensce microscope. Histra is more suitable for routine examination because of its simple and constant-processing procedure.",M2
20169180,"Uncoupling of satellite DNA and centromeric function in the genus Equus.In a previous study, we showed that centromere repositioning, that is the shift along the chromosome of the centromeric function without DNA sequence rearrangement, has occurred frequently during the evolution of the genus Equus. In this work, the analysis of the chromosomal distribution of satellite tandem repeats in Equus caballus, E. asinus, E. grevyi, and E. burchelli highlighted two atypical features: 1) several centromeres, including the previously described evolutionary new centromeres (ENCs), seem to be devoid of satellite DNA, and 2) satellite repeats are often present at non-centromeric termini, probably corresponding to relics of ancestral now inactive centromeres. Immuno-<e>FISH</e> experiments using satellite DNA and antibodies against the kinetochore protein CENP-A demonstrated that satellite-less primary constrictions are actually endowed with centromeric function. The phylogenetic reconstruction of centromere repositioning events demonstrates that the acquisition of satellite DNA occurs after the formation of the centromere during evolution and that centromeres can function over millions of years and many generations without detectable satellite DNA. The rapidly evolving Equus species gave us the opportunity to identify different intermediate steps along the full maturation of ENCs.",M2
20166207,"Circulating endothelial cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: clinical-prognostic and biologic significance.BACKGROUND: In patients with cancer, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are increased and are correlated with an aggressive disease course. However, the clinical and biologic significance of CECs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains uncertain. METHODS: In 170 patients with CLL, CEC levels were quantified by flow cytometry and were correlated with clinical and biologic data. In addition, CECs were characterized by immunophenotypic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>), and gene expression profile analyses. RESULTS: In patients with CLL, CECs were increased compared with controls. A higher level of CECs (&gt;20/microL) identified a subset of patients with a more aggressive disease course characterized by a shorter time to first treatment both in univariate and multivariate analyses. In FISH analysis, 7 patients had a significant proportion of CECs and presented with the same cytogenetic lesion of neoplastic lymphocytes and immunophenotypic features of endothelial progenitor cells. The gene expression profile of sorted CECs revealed a molecular pattern, suggesting a derivation from CLL leukemic cells with increased cell survival and proliferation, diminished cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, and enhanced proangiogenic function compared with their normal counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest that, in CLL, CECs may represent a biologic marker of aggressiveness and disease progression to be considered for new, targeted antiangiogenic treatments.",M2
20164092,"Minimizing off-target signals in RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization.Fluorescent in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) techniques are becoming extremely sensitive, to the point where individual RNA or DNA molecules can be detected with small probes. At this level of sensitivity, the elimination of 'off-target' hybridization is of crucial importance, but typical probes used for RNA and DNA FISH contain sequences repeated elsewhere in the genome. We find that very short (e.g. 20 nt) perfect repeated sequences within much longer probes (e.g. 350-1500 nt) can produce significant off-target signals. The extent of noise is surprising given the long length of the probes and the short length of non-specific regions. When we removed the small regions of repeated sequence from either short or long probes, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by orders of magnitude, putting us in a regime where fluorescent signals can be considered to be a quantitative measure of target transcript numbers. As the majority of genes in complex organisms contain repeated k-mers, we provide genome-wide annotations of k-mer-uniqueness at http://cbio.mskcc.org/ approximately aarvey/repeatmap.",M2
20164021,"Comparison of chromosome centromere topology in differentiating cells with myogenic potential.Chromosome territories (CT's) constitute the critical element of the intranuclear architecture. Position of these compartmentalized structures plays an important role in functioning of entire genome. Present study was to examine whether the centromeres position of chromosomes 4, X and Y can be changed during differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes. Topological analysis of these centromeres was based on two-dimensional fluorescent hybridization in situ (2D-<e>FISH</e>). During differentiation process the majority of X chromosome centromeres analyzed shifted to the peripheral part of a nucleus and similar phenomenon was observed with one of the chromosome 4 centromeres. Completely different tendency was noticed when investigating the location of the chromosome Y centromeres. Centromeres of this chromosome migrated to the centre of a nucleus. The results obtained demonstrated visible changes in chromosome topology along the myogenic stem cells differentiation.",M2
20164017,"Review of imaging solutions for integrated quantitative immunohistochemistry in the Pathology daily practice.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays an essential role in Pathology. In order to improve reproducibility and standardization of the results interpretation, IHC quantification methods have been developed. IHC interpretation based in whole slide imaging or virtual microscopy is of special interest. The objective of this work is to review the different computer-based programs for automatic immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) evaluation. Scanning solutions and image analysis software in immunohistochemistry were studied, focusing especially on systems based in virtual slides. Integrated scanning and image analysis systems are available (Bacus TMAScore, Dako ACIS III, Genetix Ariol, Aperio Image Analysis, 3DHistech Mirax HistoQuant, Bioimagene Pathiam). Other image analysis software systems (Definiens TissueMap, SlidePath Tissue Image Analysis) can be applied to several virtual slide formats. Fluorescence is the preferred approach in HistoRx AQUA, since it allows for a better compartmentalization of signals. Multispectral imaging using CRi Nuance allows multiple antibodies immunohistochemistry, and different stain unmixing. Most current popular automated image analysis solutions are aimed to brightfield immunohistochemistry, but fluorescence and FISH solutions may become more important in the near future. Automated quantitative tissue microarrays (TMA) analysis is essential to provide high-throughput analysis. Medical informatics standards in images (DICOM) and workflow (IHE) under development will foster the use of image analysis in Pathology Departments.",M2

20158889,"Adult case of partial trisomy 9q.BACKGROUND: Complete and partial trisomy 9 is the fourth most common chromosomal disorder. It is also associated with various congenital characteristics affecting the cranio-facial, skeletal, central nervous, gastrointestinal, cardiac and renal systems. Very few cases have been reported in adults. Partial trisomy 9q is also associated with short stature, poor growth and growth hormone deficiency. This is the first reported case of an extensive endocrinology investigation of short stature in trisomy 9q and the outcome of growth hormone treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case involves a 23-year-old female of pure partial trisomy 9q. The case involves a 23-year old female with pure partial trisomy 9q involving a duplication of 9q22.1 to q32, de novo, confirmed by genetic studies using fluorescene in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) method. The diagnosis was at 6 years of age. She did not demonstrate all the congenital morphologies identified with trisomy 9q disorders especially in relation to multi-organ morphologies. There is also a degree of associated intellectual impairment. At prepuberty, she was referred for poor growth and was diagnosed with partial growth hormone deficiency. She responded very well to treatment with growth hormone and is currently living an independent life with some support. CONCLUSIONS: Trisomy 9q is associated with short stature and failure to thrive. Growth hormone deficiency should be identified in cases of trisomy 9q and treatment offered. This is the first reported case of response to growth hormone replacement in partial trisomy 9.",M2
20154468,"Recent advances in rice genome and chromosome structure research by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>).Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an effective method for the physical mapping of genes and repetitive DNA sequences on chromosomes. Physical mapping of unique nucleotide sequences on specific rice chromosome regions was performed using a combination of chromosome identification and highly sensitive FISH. Increases in the detection sensitivity of smaller DNA sequences and improvements in spatial resolution have ushered in a new phase in FISH technology. Thus, it is now possible to perform in situ hybridization on somatic chromosomes, pachytene chromosomes, and even on extended DNA fibers (EDFs). Pachytene-FISH allows the integration of genetic linkage maps and quantitative chromosome maps. Visualization methods using FISH can reveal the spatial organization of the centromere, heterochromatin/euchromatin, and the terminal structures of rice chromosomes. Furthermore, EDF-FISH and the DNA combing technique can resolve a spatial distance of 1 kb between adjacent DNA sequences, and the detection of even a 300-bp target is now feasible. The copy numbers of various repetitive sequences and the sizes of various DNA molecules were quantitatively measured using the molecular combing technique. This review describes the significance of these advances in molecular cytology in rice and discusses future applications in plant studies using visualization techniques.",M2
20154457,"A case of severe mental and developmental retardation associated with 14q terminal monosomy/5q terminal trisomy.I previously described the case of a 19 year-old female with severe mental retardation, developmental retardation, microcephalus, short stature, bilateral microphthalmia, ptosis and blepharophimosis(1). Now, I present clinical descriptions of her half-siblings, who have a different father. Subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization (<e>FISH</e>) analysis of the proband demonstrated 5q terminal trisomy and 14q terminal monosomy. I presume that her mother harbors a balanced translocation between the terminal of chromosome 5q and 14q. I suggest that familial cases of mental retardation and dysmorphic features should be screened for terminal chromosomal abnormalities by FISH or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), even if G-banding analysis or high-resolution chromosome analysis is normal.",M2
20163722,"Chromosomal imbalances are uncommon in chagasic megaesophagus.BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease is a human tropical parasitic illness and a subset of the chronic patients develop megaesophagus or megacolon. The esophagus dilation is known as chagasic megaesophagus (CM) and one of the severe late consequences of CM is the increased risk for esophageal carcinoma (ESCC). Based on the association between CM and ESCC, we investigated whether genes frequently showing unbalanced copy numbers in ESCC were altered in CM by fluorescence in situ (<e>FISH</e>) technology. METHODS: A total of 50 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal mucosa specimens (40 from Chagas megaesophagus-CM, and 10 normal esophageal mucosa-NM) were analyzed. DNA FISH probes were tested for FHIT, TP63, PIK3CA, EGFR, FGFR1, MYC, CDKN2A, YES1 and NCOA3 genes, and centromeric sequences from chromosomes 3, 7 and 9. RESULTS: No differences between superficial and basal layers of the epithelial mucosa were found, except for loss of copy number of EGFR in the esophageal basal layer of CM group. Mean copy number of CDKN2A and CEP9 and frequency of nuclei with loss of PIK3CA were significantly different in the CM group compared with normal mucosa and marginal levels of deletions in TP63, FHIT, PIK3CA, EGFR, CDKN2A, YES and gains at PIK3CA, TP63, FGFR1, MYC, CDNK2A and NCOA3 were detected in few CM cases, mainly with dilation grades III and IV. All changes occurred at very low levels. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic imbalances common in esophageal carcinomas are not present in chagasic megaesophagus suggesting that these features will not be effective markers for risk assessment of ESCC in patients with chagasic megaesophagus.",M2
