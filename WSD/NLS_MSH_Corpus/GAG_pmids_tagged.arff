19957600,"[Genetic characteristics of HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains in four provinces, southern China]OBJECTIVE: To analyze the genetic characteristics of HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains prevailing in the four provinces of southern China. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from the newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals reported in 2006 in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi and Hunan province. The <e>gag</e> and env gene fragments were amplified from RNA template extracted from plasma using RT and nested PCR methods. CRF01_AE sequences were analyzed by phylogenetic methods and characterized by calculating the genetic distance and Entropy analysis. RESULTS: Two main epidemic clusters were found to exist in the CRF01_AE strains from 210 HIV-1 CRF01_ AE infected individuals collected in the 4 provinces, southern China. It was found that no international reference strain was closely correlated with cluster I, which including 123 samples. The strains in cluster II, consisting 57 cases of samples, were closely related with the strains identified in Vietnam. Genetic distance analysis of gag and env genes showed that the diversity of cluster I was obviously less than that of cluster II. Data on nucleotide polymorphism showed that nucleotides compositions of 42 sites in gag and 40 sites in env were significantly different between the two clusters. When compared with cluster II, the polymorphism decreased at 61 nucleotide sites but increased at 21 sites in cluster I. CONCLUSION: This was the first report describing that two main epidemic clusters were existed in CRF01_AE strains prevailing in the 4 provinces, Southern China. The virus in cluster I was the dominant strain in this region, with shorter period of circulation and higher proportion seen in the HIV-infected population, which might belong to CRF01_AE strain with certain features facilitating the spread of the virus. The virus in cluster II was highly homology with the CRF01_AE strains from Vietnam, and seemed to have had several events of epidemics in populations in border regions of China and Vietnam.",M1
19929694,"Comparative cell-mediated immunogenicity of DNA/DNA, DNA/adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), or Ad5/Ad5 HIV-1 clade B <e>gag</e> vaccine prime-boost regimens.BACKGROUND: We report composite results from the Merck phase I program of near-consensus clade B human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 gag vaccines. METHODS: Healthy HIV-uninfected adults were enrolled in 6 blinded placebo-controlled studies evaluating the immunogenicity of (1) a 4-dose regimen of a DNA vaccine, (2) a 3-dose priming regimen of the DNA vaccine with a booster dose of an adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine, or (3) a 3-dose regimen of the Ad5 vaccine. The DNA plasmid was provided with or without an aluminum phosphate or CRL1005 adjuvant. The primary end point was the unfractionated HIV-1 gag-specific interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) response 4 weeks after the final dose. RESULTS: Overall, 254 (83%) of 307 subjects randomized to the vaccine groups were evaluable. Adjuvants did not enhance immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine. Postboost ELISpot responder frequencies were higher for Ad5-containing regimens than for the DNA/DNA regimen (33%) but were similar for DNA/Ad5 (55%) and Ad5/Ad5 (50%). DNA/DNA elicited mainly a CD4 response, whereas Ad5/Ad5 elicited mainly a CD8 response; DNA/Ad5 generated CD4 and CD8 responses comparable to those of DNA/DNA and Ad5/Ad5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The DNA vaccine alone or as a priming regimen for the Ad5 vaccine did not increase unfractionated ELISpot responses compared with the Ad5 vaccine alone. Qualitative T cell responses to different vaccine regimens deserve further study.",M1
19861549,"Imaging the interaction of HIV-1 genomes and <e>Gag</e> during assembly of individual viral particles.The incorporation of viral genomes into particles has never previously been imaged in live infected cells. Thus, for many viruses it is unknown how the recruitment and packaging of genomes into virions is temporally and spatially related to particle assembly. Here, we devised approaches to simultaneously image HIV-1 genomes, as well as the major HIV-1 structural protein, Gag, to reveal their dynamics and functional interactions during the assembly of individual viral particles. In the absence of Gag, HIV-1 RNA was highly dynamic, moving in and out of the proximity of the plasma membrane. Conversely, in the presence of Gag, RNA molecules docked at the membrane where their lateral movement slowed and then ceased as Gag assembled around them and they became irreversibly anchored. Viral genomes were not retained at the membrane when their packaging signals were mutated, nor when expressed with a Gag mutant that was not myristoylated. In the presence of a Gag mutant that retained membrane- and RNA-binding activities but could not assemble into particles, the viral RNA docked at the membrane but continued to drift laterally and then often dissociated from the membrane. These results, which provide visualization of the recruitment and packaging of genomes into individual virus particles, demonstrate that a small number of Gag molecules recruit viral genomes to the plasma membrane where they nucleate the assembly of complete virions.",M1
19845640,"Cellular genes derived from Gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons in mammalian genomes.Gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons, a group of long terminal repeat retrotransposons related to vertebrate retroviruses, are found in the genome of many fungi, plants, and animals. Although multiple families of such retroelements are present in fish, active Gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons have all been eliminated from the lineage leading to mammals at least 180 million years ago. However, over 50 cellular genes related to Gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons have been identified in mammalian genomes, indicating recurrent  molecular domestication  of these elements by their host during evolution. Most retrotransposon-derived proteins are conserved in divergent mammalian species and show sequence similarity to <e>Gag</e> proteins, major structural proteins for retroelement particle formation. Among the proposed and demonstrated biological functions for gag-derived genes, placenta formation in the mouse requires two gag-derived genes from the same family. Some forms of epigenetic regulation of gag-related genes might derive from host genome defense mechanisms that repelled retrotransposon ancestors. Together, such observations support a major role for transposable elements as a source of new coding sequences allowing important genetic innovations during evolution.",M1
19781770,"The use of PEGylated poly [2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] as a mucosal DNA delivery vector and the activation of innate immunity and improvement of HIV-1-specific immune responses.To minimize the cytotoxicity of poly (2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) as a gene delivery vector, we synthesized PEGylated PDMAEMA by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Here we report its effects on transfection efficiency in vitro delivered with a GFP expression plasmid and immunogenicity in vivo after complexed with a HIV <e>gag</e> gene DNA vaccine. mPEG(113)-b-PDMAEMA(94) was efficient in condensing DNA and formed polyplexes with an average diameter of about 150 nm. The in vitro transfection experiments demonstrated that PEGylation dramatically decreased the cytotoxicity at the N/P ratios above 30, although the transfection efficiency in vitro was reduced. Interestingly, mice in vivo vaccination study clearly showed that PEGylated PDMAEMA used as DNA delivery vector significantly improved the prime effect of DNA vaccine through intranasal administration. Importantly, PEGylated PDMAEMA was further proved its ability to induce cytokines production by murine macrophages. Overall, mPEG-b-PDMAEMA can be used as an efficient DNA vaccine vector which enhances adaptive immune responses by activating innate immunity.",M1
19775717,"Importance of the major splice donor and redefinition of cis-acting sequences of gutless feline foamy virus vectors.Foamy virus vectors are potent alternatives to lenti- and gamma-retroviral vectors for gene therapy. To construct and optimize gutless feline foamy virus (FFV) replication-deficient (RD) vectors, viral elements essential for optimal efficient marker gene transduction were characterized and fine-mapped and packaging clones constructed. For these purposes, new <e>Gag</e> and Pol expression clones which allow efficient expression of packaging proteins and vectors carrying deletions in coding and non-coding regions of the genome were constructed and functionally evaluated. These studies demonstrate that the 5' major splice donor (5' SD) is indispensable for RD vectors while defined mutations introduced to inactivate the gag start codon improve transgene delivery efficiency. Based on these findings, new gutless FFV vectors were generated yielding un-concentrated vector titers above 10(5) transducing units (TU)/ml. By minimizing the second cis-acting sequence in the pol gene, only 3.8 kb viral sequences are maintained in the novel gutless FFV RD vectors.",M1
19759567,"Partial protection against SIV challenge by vaccination of adenovirus and MVA vectors in rhesus monkeys.This study explores the effect of priming rhesus monkeys with an Ad5/35 vector expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) <e>gag</e> and gp120, and then boosting the animals with an modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector encoding the same antigens after a 2-month interval. The animals were intravenously challenged with 100 TCID50 of highly pathogenic SIVmac239 virus 2 months after the booster vaccination. The priming vaccination induced robust SIV-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, and boosting further enhanced the cellular immunity. Vaccination reduced peak and long-term viral loads by 1-2 logs for a period of &gt;6 months, as reflected by a reduction in both the SIV RNA and DNA levels. Of considerable interest, the immunized monkeys did not suffer from loss of CD4 T cells, particularly central memory CD4 T cells. These results demonstrate that prophylactic vaccination with Ad5/35 followed by MVA reduces viral replication and prevents CD4 T-cell loss, and that these effects may decrease the likelihood of disease progression.",M1
19685389,"[Genetics of dystonia]The dystonias comprise a heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In contrast to the frequent sporadic forms, a variety of rare familial forms are caused by genetic mutations with mendelian inheritance. In recent years, significant progress has been made with regard to the identification of genes causing dystonia, and to the molecular pathophysiology underlying dystonic symptoms. Currently, 18 gene loci have been described causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus syndromes or paroxysmal dystonia. The most frequent form of inherited dystonia, according to current knowledge, is early-onset generalized DYT1 dystonia, caused by a deletion of three basepairs, <e>GAG</e>, in the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene, torsinA, participates in association of the endoplasmatic reticulum and the nuclear envelope with the cytoskeleton and hereby might influence the reaction of cells to various stresses and/or the development of specific neuronal populations involved in movement control in the brain. Other genes which have only recently been identified include: THAP1, causing adolescent-onset primary dystonia of mixed type (DYT6); ATP1A3, responsible for Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12); PRKRA, causing young-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT16); and SLC2A1, causing paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia with haemolytic anemia (DYT18). Further, five other loci for primary dystonia (DYT2, DYT4, DYT7, DYT13 and DYT17) have been identified, for which the causative genes remain to be discovered.",M1
19671285,"[Primers of <e>gag</e> gene for HIV-1 subtyping in China and application thereof in practice]OBJECTIVE: To design the appropriate primers of gag gene for HIV-1 subtyping in molecular epidemiology survey based on the genetic characteristics derived from the main HIV-1 strains prevailing in China. METHODS: The gag genes of HIV-1 CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and subtype C, together with subtyping reference sequences, were obtained from HIV sequence database. Referring to the alignments and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 full gag sequences, new primers of gag gene for amplification and subtyping were designed. The target fragment was used to construct neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree and evaluate its reliability. The newly designed primers (GUX/GDX) were used to amplify the plasma samples to evaluate their efficiency. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree of 306/c-gag fragments (positions 836-1507 of HIV-1 strain HXB2) showed that CRF07_BC and subtype C strains formed clusters with low bootstrap values (59% for CRF07_BC and 70% for subtype C), and the phylogenetic tree could not distinguish the sequences of CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and subtype C very well. Whereas the sequences of CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and subtype C from GUX/GDX (positions 781-1861) were clustered separately with higher bootstrap values (99%, 99%, and 77% respectively). In practice, a very good amplification and sequencing efficiency with over 90% positive results on average were obtained with GUX/GDX. Five clusters of subtype B, C, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC were formed with higher confidence (Bootstrap values all above 80%). The reliable phylogenetic tree could be constructed based on the fragments sequenced only with antisense primer (GDX). CONCLUSION: Fragments obtained with GUX/GDX primers of gag gene can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic tree with high reliability to distinguish the HIV-1 strains circulating in China, especially for the major BC recombinant and subtype C strains, which provides a useful tool in HIV molecular epidemiologic research.",M1
19655167,"Genetic variants A1826H and D2937Y in <e>GAG</e>-beta domain of versican influence susceptibility to intestinal-type gastric cancer.PURPOSE: Versican regulates adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival of cells, and plays an important role in cancer development. A case-control association study was performed to test genetic association of versican polymorphisms with susceptibility to gastric cancer. METHODS: In this study, 1,101 unrelated Korean subjects including 612 gastric cancer patients and 489 healthy controls were genotyped for all 21 exonic polymorphisms in the versican gene (VCAN) encoding amino acid changes in versican. Cancer susceptibility associations with the polymorphisms were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and gender and with control for multiple testing. RESULTS: Two amino acid changes in GAG-beta domain of versican encoded by two almost fully correlated (r (2) = 0.97) nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in VCAN were associated with gastric cancer. The association was evident in intestinal-type but not in diffuse-type gastric cancer. The minor-allele homozygote of rs188703 (G &gt; A, R1826H) or rs160277 (G &gt; T, D2937Y) was significantly associated with a twofold decreased susceptibility to intestinal-type gastric cancer when compared with the other genotypes (adjusted odds ratio = 0.52 or 0.51, P = 0.0098 or 0.0087, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal-type gastric cancer susceptibility is associated with two amino acid changes of versican in the GAG-beta domain, which is critical for enhancement of cell proliferation and activation of EGFR signal pathway by versican, and changes from the major to minor alleles may impair the function to decrease susceptibility to cancer.",M1
19559455,"A combination of defective DNA and protective host factors are found in a set of HIV-1 ancestral LTNPs.We studied viral evolution in three HIV-1 ancestral patients from a group of LTNPs; although some minor sequences showing viral evolution were detected in all patients, the extremely low viral evolution of their viruses was shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the env sequences. Complete nucleotide sequencing of viral DNA showed the major presence of deletions. In two patients, deletions of 1088 and 228 nucleotides mapped to 5' LTR-<e>gag</e> region; in the other, a 247 nucleotide deletion was positioned in pol gene up to the vif ORF. These deleted genomes became dominant during follow up. Patient's viruses displayed 13 common mutations in conserved residues, from the 5' LTR to the nef gene. These mutations provided evidence of a common origin. Regarding host characteristics, one patient had HLA B2705/B5801; another B1402/B5701; whereas a third showed B3901/B4402 and was Delta32-CCR5 heterozygous. These HIV controllers presented a combination of deleted viral genomes and host protective factors.",M1
19320567,"High HIV Type 1 prevalence and wide genetic diversity with dominance of recombinant strains but low level of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in untreated patients in northeast Gabon, Central Africa.The northeast of Gabon, central Africa is characterized by high population density and a high rate of immigration from the surrounding countries. To determine the prevalence, circulating subtypes, and antiretroviral resistance mutations of HIV-1, 810 blood samples were collected from the general population of the two main cities (Oyem and Makokou) of this region. Of these, 61 (7.5%) were found to be positive for HIV-1. Analysis of the env (gp120), pol, and <e>gag</e> (p24) sequences as well as phylogenetic analyses showed at least eight different viral lineages. The most prevalent strains were CRF02 recombinants, followed by subtypes A, D, and C. The remaining strains were found to be F, J, G, and also, for the first time in Gabon, the recombinant form CRF11cpx. Analysis of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase from this untreated population showed a low level of specific mutations. These mutations were associated with subtype polymorphism rather than with resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The wide diversity and the emergence of recombinant strains are in accordance with the rapid spread of new HIV strains in the population and, thus, the dynamic evolution of the epidemic.",M1
19239094,"[Molecular evolution of mobile elements of the gypsy group: a homolog of the <e>gag</e> gene in Drosophila]Retrotransposons of the gypsy group of Drosophila melanogaster that are structurally similar to retroviruses of vertebrates occupy an important place among retroelements of eukaryotes. The infectious abilities of some retrotransposons of this group (gypsy, ZAM, and Idefix) have been demonstrated experimentally, and therefore they are true retroviruses. It is supposed that retrotransposons can evolve acquiring new components, the sources of which remain to be elucidated. In this work, the CG4680 gene (Gag related protein, Grp) homologous to gag of retrotransposons of the gypsy group has been identified in the genome of D. melanogaster and characterized. The Grp gene product has a highly conserved structure in different species of the Drosophilidae family and is under of stabilizing selection, which suggests its important genomic function in Drosophila. In view of the earlier data, it can be concluded that homologous genes of all components of gypsy retrotransposons are present in the Drosophila genome. These genes can be both precursors and products of domestication of retrovirus genes.",M1
19216784,"APOBEC3G induces a hypermutation gradient: purifying selection at multiple steps during HIV-1 replication results in levels of G-to-A mutations that are high in DNA, intermediate in cellular viral RNA, and low in virion RNA.BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring Vif variants that are unable to inhibit the host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G) have been isolated from infected individuals. A3G can potentially induce G-to-A hypermutation in these viruses, and hypermutation could contribute to genetic variation in HIV-1 populations through recombination between hypermutant and wild-type genomes. Thus, hypermutation could contribute to the generation of immune escape and drug resistant variants, but the genetic contribution of hypermutation to the viral evolutionary potential is poorly understood. In addition, the mechanisms by which these viruses persist in the host despite the presence of A3G remain unknown. RESULTS: To address these questions, we generated a replication-competent HIV-1 Vif mutant in which the A3G-binding residues of Vif, Y(40)RHHY(44), were substituted with five alanines. As expected, the mutant was severely defective in an A3G-expressing T cell line and exhibited a significant delay in replication kinetics. Analysis of viral DNA showed the expected high level of G-to-A hypermutation; however, we found substantially reduced levels of G-to-A hypermutation in intracellular viral RNA (cRNA), and the levels of G-to-A mutations in virion RNA (vRNA) were even further reduced. The frequencies of hypermutation in DNA, cRNA, and vRNA were 0.73%, 0.12%, and 0.05% of the nucleotides sequenced, indicating a gradient of hypermutation. Additionally, genomes containing start codon mutations and early termination codons within <e>gag</e> were isolated from the vRNA. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sublethal levels of hypermutation coupled with purifying selection at multiple steps during the early phase of viral replication lead to the packaging of largely unmutated genomes, providing a mechanism by which mutant Vif variants can persist in infected individuals. The persistence of genomes containing mutated gag genes despite this selection pressure indicates that dual infection and complementation can result in the packaging of hypermutated genomes which, through recombination with wild-type genomes, could increase viral genetic variation and contribute to evolution.",M1
19137855,"Expression of bovine leukemia virus p24 protein in bacterial cell.Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a member of the family Retroviridae, genus Deltaretrovirus that has three important gene including <e>gag</e>, pol and env. This virus causes B-cell lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma in cows. In the first step PCR product of gag gene of BLV isolated in different regions of Iran and BLV-FLK strain were cloned in to a pTZ57R/T vector, then insert were digested by BglII and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned in to pET-28(a) as an expression vector. For the expression of p24 protein, the pET-28(a) recombinant vector was transformed in BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli competent cell and after induction of the protein having been expressed by IPTG, the presence of gag expressed protein was shown in immunoblotting and SDS-PAGE system. With respect to the remarkable frequency of infection to BLV in Iran and the necessity of controlling it through vaccination with recombinant vaccines of gp51, manufacturing and applying the recombinant p24 protein are vital goals in recognition and distinction between infection and responses caused by vaccine.",M1
19095008,"Improvements in the detection of small ruminant lentivirus infection in the blood of sheep by PCR.The polymerase chain reaction on blood samples has been considered a complement to serological methods for the detection of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) infections in sheep and goats. This is a report on the results of a study to evaluate the use of the same blood sample for the detection of infected animals by ELISA and PCR. A comparison between the results obtained by applying PCRs targeting LTR and <e>gag</e> sequences on blood clot, serum and peripheral blood leucocytes was made. In addition to simplifying sampling and laboratory work, the use of blood clot samples with the gag-PCR improved remarkably the detection of infected animals. Finally, this study has shown the existence of a cell-free viremia in the serum of SRLV-infected sheep.",M1
19023406,"Phylogenetic dependency networks: inferring patterns of CTL escape and codon covariation in HIV-1 <e>Gag</e>.HIV avoids elimination by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) through the evolution of escape mutations. Although there is mounting evidence that these escape pathways are broadly consistent among individuals with similar human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, previous population-based studies have been limited by the inability to simultaneously account for HIV codon covariation, linkage disequilibrium among HLA alleles, and the confounding effects of HIV phylogeny when attempting to identify HLA-associated viral evolution. We have developed a statistical model of evolution, called a phylogenetic dependency network, that accounts for these three sources of confounding and identifies the primary sources of selection pressure acting on each HIV codon. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for identifying sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and codon evolution as well as the deleterious effects of failing to account for all three sources of confounding. We then apply our approach to a large, clinically-derived dataset of Gag p17 and p24 sequences from a multicenter cohort of 1144 HIV-infected individuals from British Columbia, Canada (predominantly HIV-1 clade B) and Durban, South Africa (predominantly HIV-1 clade C). The resulting phylogenetic dependency network is dense, containing 149 associations between HLA alleles and HIV codons and 1386 associations among HIV codons. These associations include the complete reconstruction of several recently defined escape and compensatory mutation pathways and agree with emerging data on patterns of epitope targeting. The phylogenetic dependency network adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that sites of escape, order of escape, and compensatory mutations are largely consistent even across different clades, although we also identify several differences between clades. As recent case studies have demonstrated, understanding both the complexity and the consistency of immune escape has important implications for CTL-based vaccine design. Phylogenetic dependency networks represent a major step toward systematically expanding our understanding of CTL escape to diverse populations and whole viral genes.",M1
19019964,"HLA-associated clinical progression correlates with epitope reversion rates in early human immunodeficiency virus infection.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can evade immunity shortly after transmission to a new host but the clinical significance of this early viral adaptation in HIV infection is not clear. We present an analysis of sequence variation from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV adaptation in 189 acute seroconverters followed for up to 3 years. We measured the rates of variation within well-defined epitopes to determine associations with the HLA-linked hazard of disease progression. We found early reversion across both the <e>gag</e> and pol genes, with a 10-fold faster rate of escape in gag (2.2 versus 0.27 forward mutations/1,000 amino acid sites). For most epitopes (23/34), variation in the HLA-matched and HLA-unmatched controls was similar. For a minority of epitopes (8/34, and generally associated with HLA class I alleles that confer clinical benefit), new variants appeared early and consistently over the first 3 years of infection. Reversion occurred early at a rate which was HLA-dependent and correlated with the HLA class 1-associated relative hazard of disease progression and death (P = 0.0008), reinforcing the association between strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, viral fitness, and disease status. These data provide a comprehensive overview of viral adaptation in the first 3 years of infection. Our findings of HLA-dependent reversion suggest that costs are borne by some escape variants which may benefit the host, a finding contrary to a simple immune evasion paradigm. These epitopes, which are both strongly and frequently recognized, and for which escape involves a high cost to the virus, have the potential to optimize vaccine design.",M1
18984025,"Systemic DNA immunization against ovine lentivirus using particle-mediated epidermal delivery and modified vaccinia Ankara encoding the <e>gag</e> and/or env genes.To determine whether systemic immunization with plasmid DNA and virus vector against visna/maedi virus (VMV) would induce protective immune responses, sheep were immunized with VMV gag and/or env sequences using particle-mediated epidermal bombardment and injection of recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara. The results showed that immunization induced both humoral and cell-mediated responses prior to and after virus challenge. The vaccination protocol did not prevent infection, but immunization with the gag gene or a combination of gag and env genes resulted in significantly reduced provirus loads in blood and mediastinal lymph node, respectively. Provirus loads in lung and draining lymph node were unaffected, but p25 expression was undetectable in lungs of animals immunized with a combination of gag and env genes. Analysis of target tissues for lesions at post-mortem showed that immunization with the env gene caused a significant increase in lesion score, while the gag gene or a combination of gag and env genes had no effect. Inclusion of the ovine interferon-gamma gene in the initial priming mixture had minimal effect on immune responses, provirus load, or lesion development, although it resulted in a decreased p25 expression in the lung. The results thus show that systemic immunization with gag or a combination of gag and env genes reduces provirus load in blood and lymphoid tissue, respectively whereas env immunization has no effect on provirus load but increased lesion development.",M1
18974279,"The secondary structure of the 5' end of the FIV genome reveals a long-range interaction between R/U5 and <e>gag</e> sequences, and a large, stable stem-loop.Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus that infects cats and is related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although it is a common worldwide infection, and has potential uses as a human gene therapy vector and as a nonprimate model for HIV infection, little detail is known of the viral life cycle. Previous experiments have shown that its packaging signal includes two or more regions within the first 511 nucleotides of the genomic RNA. We have undertaken a secondary structural analysis of this RNA by minimal free-energy structural prediction, biochemical mapping, and phylogenetic analysis, and show that it contains five conserved stem-loops and a conserved long-range interaction between heptanucleotide sequences 5'-CCCUGUC-3' in R/U5 and 5'-GACAGGG-3' in gag. This long-range interaction is similar to that seen in primate lentiviruses where it is thought to be functionally important. Along with strains that infect domestic cats, this heptanucleotide interaction can also occur in species-specific FIV strains that infect pumas, lions, and Pallas' cats where the heptanucleotide sequences involved vary. We have analyzed spliced and genomic FIV RNAs and see little structural change or sequence conservation within single-stranded regions of the 5' UTR that are important for viral packaging, suggesting that FIV may employ a cotranslational packaging mechanism.",M1
18945463,"Interferon-beta expressed by a rabies virus-based HIV-1 vaccine vector serves as a molecular adjuvant and decreases pathogenicity.Type I interferon is important in anti-viral responses and in coordinating the innate immune response. Here we explore the use of interferon-beta to adjuvant the response to a rabies virus (RV) vaccine vector expressing both HIV-1 <e>Gag</e> and IFN-beta. Viral load and immune responses of immunized mice were analyzed over time. Our results indicate that the RV expressing IFN-beta (IFN+) is highly attenuated when compared to control RV and demonstrate that the expression of IFN-beta reduces viral replication approximately 100-fold. Despite the decrease in replication, those mice immunized with the IFN+ RV had a significantly greater number of activated CD8+ T cells. The increased activation of CD8+ T cells was dependent on IFN-beta signaling, as we saw no difference following infection of IFNAR-/- mice. Although mice immunized with IFN+ have a greater primary immune response than controls, immunized mice that were challenged with vaccinia-expressing Gag had no significant difference in the number or functionality of CD8+ T cells. The increased CD8+ T cell activation in the presence of IFN-beta, even with greatly reduced viral replication, indicates the beneficial effect of IFN-beta for the host.",M1
18826508,"Molecular subtyping of feline immunodeficiency virus from cats in Melbourne.OBJECTIVE: To determine the subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) present in the domestic cat population in Melbourne. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 42 cats that had serum antibodies against FIV. DNA was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify variable regions of the envelope (env) and group specific antigen (<e>gag</e>) genes of FIV. PCR products were directly sequenced or sequenced after cloning when direct sequencing yielded ambiguous results. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and comparisons made with representative sequences of different subtypes. RESULTS: The variable region of the env gene was successfully amplified by PCR from 41 of the 42 cats. All 41 were found to cluster with subtype A env sequences. The variable region of the gag gene was successfully amplified by PCR from all 42 cats. Forty-one were found to cluster with subtype A gag genes and one was found to cluster with subtype B sequences, suggesting that it may be derived from a recombinant env A/gag B virus. CONCLUSIONS: Subtype A is the predominant FIV type in Melbourne, although a subtype A/B recombinant was identified in the population of FIV positive cats. These results of env gene analysis were similar to those in a previous Australian study, suggesting that subtype A predominates in Australia. The results of the gag gene analysis show the importance of analysing multiple areas of the FIV genome when assigning FIV subtypes. Comparison with other major urban centres may provide useful information about the phylogenic diversity of FIV in Australia.",M1
18812199,"Potent specific immune responses induced by prime-boost-boost strategies based on DNA, adenovirus, and Sendai virus vectors expressing <e>gag</e> gene of Chinese HIV-1 subtype B.To study the immune responses elicited by multiple vectors and develop vaccines strategies against prevalent HIV-1 strains in China, we have examined the potency of vaccine regimens of plasmid DNA, adenovirus, and Sendai virus vectors expressing HIV-1 gag consensus sequence of HIV-1 isolates from China for inducing specific immune responses. In BALB/c mice, combination of these vectors induced higher Gag-specific cellular immune response than any regimen using single vector alone. The prime-boost-boost regimen consisting of the triple heterologous vectors induced Gag-specific T-cell responses the most efficiently. In rhesus macaques, the prime-boost-boost regimen induced potent Gag-specific cellular immune responses as well as long lasting humoral immune response, and each booster resulted in rapid and efficient expansion of Gag-specific T cells. These results indicate that this prime-boost-boost regimen using triple heterologous vectors is a promising AIDS vaccine candidate for efficiently inducing HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. Its further studies as a promising scheme for therapeutic and/or prophylactic HIV-1 vaccines should be grounded.",M1
18797137,"Growth ability in simian cells of monkey cell-tropic HIV-1 is greatly affected by downstream region of the vif gene.To obtain monkey-tropic (mt) HIV-1 derivatives with distinct biological characteristics and to improve the viral growth property, we have generated several variants from a prototype mt HIV-1 designated NL-DT5R (X4-tropic). The prototype HIV-1 contains a portion of <e>gag</e> and entire vif genes from SIVmac in its genome. The two derivatives carrying 3' half-genomic region of the SF162 (R5-tropic) or 89.6 (dual-tropic) isolate displayed very retarded or no viral growth, respectively, in a simian cell line HSC-F. In contrast, the three clones containing a part of env gene (encoding the V1-V4 region) from SF162, YU-2 (R5-tropic) or 89.6 showed different growth kinetics in HSC-F cells, although they grew somewhat more poorly than the NL-DT5R. Comparison of various viral proteins potentially involved in the different biological properties has revealed that, while amino acid sequences of Tat, Rev, Vpr, Vpu and Nef are quite conserved among the clones, those in the surface (SU) region of Env are relatively heterologous. Our data described here have shown that the 3' half of viral genome other than gag and vif genes greatly affects the growth property of mt HIV-1 in simian cells.",M1
18792916,"Role of the feline immunodeficiency virus L-domain in the presence or absence of <e>Gag</e> processing: involvement of ubiquitin and Nedd4-2s ligase in viral egress.RNA-enveloped viruses bud from infected cells by exploiting the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. In this context, ubiquitination of structural viral proteins and their direct interaction with cellular factors involved in the MVB biogenesis through short proline rich regions, named late domains (L-domains), are crucial mechanisms. Here we report that, in contrast with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a non-primate lentivirus, is strictly dependent for its budding on a  PSAP -type L-domain, mapping in the carboxy-terminal region of Gag, irrespective of a functional viral protease. Moreover, we provide evidence that FIV egress is related to Gag ubiquitination, that is, linked to the presence of an active L-domain. Finally, although FIV Gag does not contain a PPxY motif, we show that the Nedd4-2s ubiquitin ligase enhances FIV Gag ubiquitination and it is capable to rescue viral mutants lacking a functional L-domain. In conclusion, our data bring to light peculiar aspects of FIV egress, but we also demonstrate that a non-primate lentivirus shares with HIV-1 a novel mechanism of connection to the cellular budding machinery.",M1
18753865,"The epidemic origin and molecular properties of B': a founder strain of the HIV-1 transmission in Asia.OBJECTIVE: To clarify the epidemic origin and molecular properties of the B' subtype that is an important strain in the HIV-1 epidemic in Asia. DESIGN: The genealogical relationship between the B' and B subtype was investigated with two globally representative datasets covering the <e>gag</e> and env regions. B' sequences were identified, from which the epidemic origin, population genetics and the signature mutation sites of the B' subtype were inferred. METHODS: Two globally representative datasets were compiled, using phylogenetic methods. Through coalescent-based analysis, the genealogical relationship between the B' and B subtypes was investigated. The divergence times and population genetic parameters of B' were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov Chains Monte Carlo sampling under a relaxed molecular clock method. Additionally, molecular properties of the B' were identified by performing comparative sequence analysis with the HIV-1 M group. RESULTS: About 15 years later after the B subtype began to spread, the B' diverged from the B subtype. The demographic history of B' was reconstructed, and the epidemic of B' was estimated to originate around 1985. Eight and nine distinct signature mutation sites, unique to B', were found around the p17 and V3 regions, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our research is the first large-scale investigation on HIV-1 B' at a global level and provides a deep insight into one of the founder strains of HIV-1 epidemic in Asia. Our results provide an important reference for HIV scientists, public health officials and HIV vaccine designers.",M1
18753231,"HIV-1 subtype C Pr55gag virus-like particle vaccine efficiently boosts baboons primed with a matched DNA vaccine.A DNA vaccine expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) southern African subtype C <e>Gag</e> (pTHGag) and a recombinant baculovirus Pr55gag virus-like particle prepared using a subtype C Pr55gag protein (Gag VLP) was tested in a prime-boost inoculation regimen in Chacma baboons. The response of five baboons to Gag peptides in a gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay after three pTHGag immunizations ranged from 100 to 515 spot-forming units (s.f.u.) per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whilst the response of two baboons to the Gag VLP vaccine ranged from 415 to 465 s.f.u. per 10(6) PBMCs. An increase in the Gag-specific response to a range of 775-3583 s.f.u. per 10(6) PBMCs was achieved by boosting with Gag VLPs the five baboons that were primed with pTHGag. No improvement in Gag responses was achieved in this prime-boost inoculation regimen by increasing the number of pTHGag inoculations to six. IFN-gamma responses were mapped to several peptides, some of which have been reported to be targeted by PBMCs from HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals. Gag VLPs, given as a single-modality regimen, induced a predominantly CD8+ T-cell IFN-gamma response and interleukin-2 was a major cytokine within a mix of predominantly Th1 cytokines produced by a DNA-VLP prime-boost modality. The prime-boost inoculation regimen induced high serum p24 antibody titres in all baboons, which were several fold above that induced by the individual vaccines. Overall, this study demonstrated that these DNA prime/VLP boost vaccine regimens are highly immunogenic in baboons, inducing high-magnitude and broad multifunctional responses, providing support for the development of these products for clinical trials.",M1
18708237,"Interactions of reverse transcriptase sequences in Pol with <e>Gag</e> and LysRS in the HIV-1 tRNALys3 packaging/annealing complex.During HIV-1 assembly, tRNA(Lys3), the primer for reverse transcriptase (RT) in HIV-1, is selectively packaged into the virus due to a specific interaction between Gag and lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). However, while Gag alone will incorporate LysRS, tRNA(Lys3) packaging also requires the presence of RT thumb domain sequences in GagPol. The formation of a tRNA(Lys3) packaging/annealing complex involves an interaction between Gag/GagPol/viral RNA and LysRS/tRNA(Lys), and herein, we have investigated whether the transfer of tRNA(Lys3) from LysRS to RT sequences in Pol by a currently unknown mechanism is facilitated by an interaction between LysRS and Pol. We demonstrate that, in addition to its interaction with Gag, LysRS also interacts with sequences within the connection/RNaseH domains in RT. However, cytoplasmic Gag/Pol interactions, detected by either coimmunoprecipitation or incorporation of Pol into Gag viral-like particles, were found to be insensitive to the overexpression or underexpression of LysRS, indicating that a Gag/LysRS/RT interaction is not essential for Gag/Pol interactions. Based on this and previous work, including the observation that the RT connection domain is not required for tRNA(Lys3) packaging, but is required for tRNA(Lys3) annealing, a model is proposed for a tRNA(Lys3) packaging/annealing complex in which the interaction of Gag with Pol sequences during early viral assembly facilitates the retention in budding viruses of both tRNA(Lys3) and early Pol processing intermediates, with tRNA(Lys3) annealing to viral RNA further facilitated by the LysRS/RT interaction.",M1
18695319,"Existence of proviral porcine endogenous retrovirus in fresh and decellularised porcine tissues.PURPOSE: Swine are expected to be utilized as xenograft donors for both whole organ and cellular transplantation. A major concern in using porcine organs for transplantation is the potential of transmission of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). Tissue-engineered or decellularised heart valves have already been implanted in humans and have been marketed by certain companies after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The aim of this study was to examine the existence of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) in fresh and decellularised porcine tissues. METHODS: Porcine tissues (both fresh and decellularised) were analysed using validated assays specific for PERV: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PERV specific <e>GAG</e> sequences were found in the porcine heart tissue samples using PCR for DNA and RT- PCR for RNA. All tissue samples (both fresh and treated tissues) like aortic valve, pulmonary valve and heart muscle showed the presence of PERV DNA. RT PCR for PERV was positive in all fresh tissues and was found to be negative in decellularised treated tissues. CONCLUSIONS: PCR is a rapid, specific test for the detection of PERV virus in xenografts. These findings have demonstrated that the presence of proviral DNA form of PERV in porcine tissues needs to be carefully considered when the infectious disease potential of xenotransplantation is being assessed.",M1
18667928,"Phylogenetic investigation of transmission pathways of drug-resistant HIV-1 utilizing pol sequences derived from resistance genotyping.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of transmission links existing between patients recently infected with HIV strains containing transmitted drug resistance (TDR) mutations. METHODS: Virus from 63 individuals recently infected with HIV-1 containing TDR mutations was analyzed phylogenetically to determine virological links. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum likelihood and distance-based methods. Monophyletic clusters detected on the basis of pol sequences were confirmed using env and <e>gag</e> sequences. Potential bias caused by the presence of drug resistance mutations was assessed by reanalyzing the pol sequence set after the omission of 16 drug resistance codons identified in the TDR population. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed 9 apparent transmission clusters involving 24 of the 63 (38%) TDR patients. Each cluster was supported by high bootstrap values and low intracluster genetic distances. The 9 transmission clusters were confirmed in separate analyses using env and gag sequences and in pol sequences after the removal of codons associated with drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Pol sequences generated during baseline resistance genotyping for newly HIV-infected patients provide the opportunity for real-time phylogenetics to identify sources of multiple HIV transmission events. This study demonstrated the existence of several distinct clusters of patients whose TDR strains were linked. Several discrete clusters involving transmission of K103N- and/or M41L-resistant virus to multiple recipients were detected, suggesting that multiple transmission pathways can exist for viruses with the same resistance mutations.",M1
18667521,"Basal budding and replication of the murine leukemia virus are independent of the <e>gag</e> L domains.Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV) Gag protein contains three identified late (L) domains, PPPY, YPAL, and PSAP, which are thought to interact with the endosomal sorting machinery to assist budding. We created single and combined L-domain mutants in all permutations and tested the resulting clones for budding and replication. Budding and replication of all viruses with mutated PPPY were greatly reduced; however, the basal replication level was retained, demonstrated by the slow spread of the viruses in culture. Mutations in PSAP or YPAL did not affect budding or spreading, demonstrating that these two motifs are dispensable for efficient MMuLV replication. Furthermore, the basal budding level was maintained following inhibition of endosomal sorting machinery, emphasizing that the basal budding of MMuLV is independent of this machinery.",M1
18625749,"Immune-driven recombination and loss of control after HIV superinfection.After acute HIV infection, CD8(+) T cells are able to control viral replication to a set point. This control is often lost after superinfection, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate in an HLA-B27(+) subject that loss of viral control after HIV superinfection coincides with rapid recombination events within two narrow regions of <e>Gag</e> and Env. Screening for CD8(+) T cell responses revealed that each of these recombination sites (approximately 50 aa) encompassed distinct regions containing two immunodominant CD8 epitopes (B27-KK10 in Gag and Cw1-CL9 in Env). Viral escape and the subsequent development of variant-specific de novo CD8(+) T cell responses against both epitopes were illustrative of the significant immune selection pressures exerted by both responses. Comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of CD8 responses and viral evolution indicated that the recombination events quickly facilitated viral escape from both dominant WT- and variant-specific responses. These data suggest that the ability of a superinfecting strain of HIV to overcome preexisting immune control may be related to its ability to rapidly recombine in critical regions under immune selection pressure. These data also support a role for cellular immune pressures in driving the selection of new recombinant forms of HIV.",M1
18620496,"Quantification of simian immunodeficiency virus cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutant viruses.Escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) pressure is common in HIV-1 infection of humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of macaques. CTL escape typically incurs a fitness cost as reversion back to wild-type can occur upon transmission. We utilized sequence-specific primers and DNA probes with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to sensitively and specifically track wild-type and escape mutant viremia at the Mane-A*17-restricted SIV <e>Gag</e>(371379) epitope AF9 in pigtail macaques. The generation of minor escape mutant populations is detected by the real-time PCR 2 weeks earlier than observed using standard sequencing techniques. We passaged the AF9 CTL escape mutant virus into two naïve Mane-A*17-negative pigtail macaques and showed that reversion to wild-type was rapid during acute infection and then slowed considerably at later stages of the infection. These data help refine our understanding of how CTL escape mutant viruses evolve.",M1
18614631,"Marked epitope- and allele-specific differences in rates of mutation in human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) <e>Gag</e>, Pol, and Nef cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes in acute/early HIV-1 infection.During acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, early host cellular immune responses drive viral evolution. The rates and extent of these mutations, however, remain incompletely characterized. In a cohort of 98 individuals newly infected with HIV-1 subtype B, we longitudinally characterized the rates and extent of HLA-mediated escape and reversion in Gag, Pol, and Nef using a rational definition of HLA-attributable mutation based on the analysis of a large independent subtype B data set. We demonstrate rapid and dramatic HIV evolution in response to immune pressures that in general reflect established cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response hierarchies in early infection. On a population level, HLA-driven evolution was observed in approximately 80% of published CTL epitopes. Five of the 10 most rapidly evolving epitopes were restricted by protective HLA alleles (HLA-B*13/B*51/B*57/B*5801; P = 0.01), supporting the importance of a strong early CTL response in HIV control. Consistent with known fitness costs of escape, B*57-associated mutations in Gag were among the most rapidly reverting positions upon transmission to non-B*57-expressing individuals, whereas many other HLA-associated polymorphisms displayed slow or negligible reversion. Overall, an estimated minimum of 30% of observed substitutions in Gag/Pol and 60% in Nef were attributable to HLA-associated escape and reversion events. Results underscore the dominant role of immune pressures in driving early within-host HIV evolution. Dramatic differences in escape and reversion rates across codons, genes, and HLA restrictions are observed, highlighting the complexity of viral adaptation to the host immune response.",M1
18593342,"Molecular epidemiology demonstrated three emerging clusters of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype B infection in Hong Kong.We conducted a molecular epidemiological study on newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients in Hong Kong to identify the epidemiological linkage of HIV-1 infection in the locality. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for HIV-1 was performed on newly diagnosed HIV-1-positive sera collected from January 2002 to December 2006. PCR products correspond to the env C2V3V4 region and <e>gag</e> p17/p24 junction of the HIV-1 genome were nucleotide sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the acquired nucleotide sequences revealed that CRF01_AE and subtype B were the two dominant HIV-1 subtypes. Analyses also demonstrated the presence of three emerging HIV-1 clusters among the subtype B sequences in Hong Kong. Individual cluster possesses a unique cluster-specific amino acid signature for identification. Data show that one of the clusters (Cluster I) is rapidly expanding. In addition to the unique cluster-specific amino acid signature, the majority of sequences in Cluster I harbor a 6-amino acid insertion at the gag p17/p24 junction in a region that is thought to be closely associated with HIV-1 infectivity.",M1
18573204,"Expression of HIV-1 antigens in plants as potential subunit vaccines.BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has infected more than 40 million people worldwide, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated <e>Gag</e> (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice. RESULTS: Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful, although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems; however, the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of p24 and p17/p24 yielded best, to more than 1 mg p24/kg fresh weight. Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC. CONCLUSION: Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested, and p24 and p17/p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag. Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. The p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC, showing that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine.",M1
18559113,"Recombination in feline immunodeficiency virus from feral and companion domestic cats.BACKGROUND: Recombination is a relatively common phenomenon in retroviruses. We investigated recombination in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus from naturally-infected New Zealand domestic cats (Felis catus) by sequencing regions of the <e>gag</e>, pol and env genes. RESULTS: The occurrence of intragenic recombination was highest in env, with evidence of recombination in 6.4% (n = 156) of all cats. A further recombinant was identified in each of the gag (n = 48) and pol (n = 91) genes. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees across genes identified cases of incongruence, indicating intergenic recombination. Three (7.7%, n = 39) of these incongruencies were found to be significantly different using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.Surprisingly, our phylogenies from the gag and pol genes showed that no New Zealand sequences group with reference subtype C sequences within intrasubtype pairwise distances. Indeed, we find one and two distinct unknown subtype groups in gag and pol, respectively. These observations cause us to speculate that these New Zealand FIV strains have undergone several recombination events between subtype A parent strains and undefined unknown subtype strains, similar to the evolutionary history hypothesised for HIV-1  subtype E .Endpoint dilution sequencing was used to confirm the consensus sequences of the putative recombinants and unknown subtype groups, providing evidence for the authenticity of these sequences. Endpoint dilution sequencing also resulted in the identification of a dual infection event in the env gene. In addition, an intrahost recombination event between variants of the same subtype in the pol gene was established. This is the first known example of naturally-occurring recombination in a cat with infection of the parent strains. CONCLUSION: Evidence of intragenic recombination in the gag, pol and env regions, and complex intergenic recombination, of FIV from naturally-infected domestic cats in New Zealand was found. Strains of unknown subtype were identified in all three gene regions. These results have implications for the use of the current FIV vaccine in New Zealand.",M1
18555885,"Tsg101 can replace Nedd4 function in ASV <e>Gag</e> release but not membrane targeting.The Late (L) domain of the avian sarcoma virus (ASV) Gag protein binds Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase E3 family members and is the determinant of efficient virus release in avian and mammalian cells. We previously demonstrated that Nedd4 and Tsg101 constitutively interact raising the possibility that Nedd4 links ASV Gag to the ESCRT machinery. We now demonstrate that covalently linking Tsg101 to ASV Gag lacking the Nedd4 binding site (Deltap2b-Tsg101) ablates the requirement for Nedd4, but the rescue of budding occurs by use of a different budding mechanism than that used by wild type ASV Gag. The evidence that Tsg101 and Nedd4 direct release by different pathways is: (i) Release of the virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from Gag in DF-1, an avian cell line, was resistant to dominant-negative interference by a Tsg101 mutant previously shown to inhibit release of both HIV and Mo-MLV. (ii) Release of VLPs from DF-1 cells was resistant to siRNA-mediated depletion of the endogenous pool of Tsg101 in these cells. (iii) VLPs assembled from wild-type ASV Gag exhibited highly efficient release from endosome-like membrane domains enriched in the tetraspanin protein CD63 or a fluorescent analogue of the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine. However, the VLPs assembled from the L domain mutant Deltap2b or a chimeric Deltap2b-Tsg101 Gag lacked these domain markers even though the chimeric Gag was released efficiently compared to the Deltap2b mutant. These results suggest that Tsg101 and Nedd4 facilitate Gag release through functionally exchangeable but independent routes and that Tsg101 can replace Nedd4 function in facilitating budding but not directing through the same membranes.",M1
18549827,"Functional significance of the <e>GAG</e> trinucleotide-repeat polymorphism in the gene for the catalytic subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase.Gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. A GAG-repeat polymorphism in the 5' UTR of the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of GCL (GCLC) has been associated with altered GSH levels in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that this polymorphism is associated with altered GCL activity and blood GSH levels in vivo. A total of 256 healthy United States black and white adults were genotyped for the GAG polymorphism and blood GSH levels were measured. In a subset of 107 individuals, blood GCL activity was determined. Five alleles with 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 GAG repeats were observed. The most prevalent genotype was 7/9 (40%) followed by 7/7 (32%) and 9/9 (11%). GSH levels were 15% lower in 9/9 individuals than 7/9 individuals (P=0.05). GCL activity was 21% lower in 9/9 individuals than 7/7 individuals (P=0.04). A decreasing trend of GCL activity was observed in the order of 7/7&gt;7/9&gt;9/9 (P=0.04). These findings show that 9/9 individuals have lower blood GSH levels, which is likely due to a decrease in GCL activity. Such individuals might be more susceptible to oxidative stress-related diseases than individuals with other genotypes.",M1
18549307,"Impact of preexisting vector immunity on the efficacy of adeno-associated virus-based HIV-1 <e>Gag</e> vaccines.Vectors based on primate-derived adeno-associated virus (AAV) are being considered in the development of genetic vaccines against a number of diseases including infection with HIV-1. Preexisting immunity to the vaccine carrier as a result of natural infections could potentially compromise vaccine efficacy. This study evaluates the impact of neutralizing antibodies against AAV capsids on the ability of HIV-1 Gag-expressing vectors to elicit transgene-specific T and B cell responses. Mice were passively transferred with pooled human immunoglobulin at various doses to simulate human antivector humoral immunity. Vectors based on serotype 2, which were evaluated in the clinic, were compared with those created from the novel monkey isolates AAV7 and AAV8. Inhibition of AAV2-directed Gag responses occurred at doses of human immunoglobulin 10- to 20-fold less than was required to inhibit immunogenicity of AAV7 and AAV8 vectors. Cynomolgus macaques were screened for preexisting immunity to AAV7 and AAV8 and sera from individual animals were passively transferred into mice that were analyzed for AAV vaccine efficacy. There was a correlation between the level of preexisting capsid neutralizing titers and diminution of vaccine efficacy; sera from a number of animals with no detectable neutralizing antibodies showed partial vaccine inhibition, suggesting that the in vitro assay is less sensitive than the in vivo passive transfer assay for detecting neutralizing antibodies to AAV.",M1

18524823,"DNA <e>gag</e>/adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) gag and Ad5 gag/Ad5 gag vaccines induce distinct T-cell response profiles.Results from Merck's phase II adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) gag/pol/nef test-of-concept trial showed that the vaccine lacked efficacy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a high-risk population. Among the many questions to be explored following this outcome are whether (i) the Ad5 vaccine induced the quality of T-cell responses necessary for efficacy and (ii) the lack of efficacy in the Ad5 vaccine can be generalized to other vector approaches intended to induce HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-specific T-cell responses. Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of the T-cell response profiles from cohorts of clinical trial subjects who received the HIV CAM-1 gag insert delivered by either a regimen with DNA priming followed by Ad5 boosting (n = 50) or a homologous Ad5/Ad5 prime-boost regimen (n = 70). The samples were tested using a statistically qualified nine-color intracellular cytokine staining assay measuring interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and gamma interferon production and expression of CD107a. Both vaccine regimens induced CD4(+) and CD8(+) HIV gag-specific T-cell responses which variably expressed several intracellular markers. Several trends were observed in which the frequencies of HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T cells and IL-2 production from antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in the DNA/Ad5 cohort were more pronounced than in the Ad5/Ad5 cohort. Implications of these results for future vaccine development will be discussed.",M1
18495196,"Distinct viral determinants for the packaging of human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3C.Human APOBEC3G and other APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases inhibit a variety of retroviruses, including Vif-deficient HIV-1. These host proteins are packaged into viral particles and inhibit the replication of virus in new target cells. A3G and A3F are known to be efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions by binding to 7SL RNA through the <e>Gag</e> NC domain; however, the packaging mechanisms of other APOBEC3 proteins are poorly defined. We have now demonstrated that APOBEC3C (A3C) can be efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions that are deficient for viral genomic RNA. Inhibition of the encapsidation of 7SL RNA into HIV-1 virions blocked the packaging of A3G, but not A3C. While the NC domain is required for efficient packaging of A3G, deletion of this domain had little effect on A3C packaging into HIV-1 Gag particles. A3C interacted with HIV-1 Gag which was MA domain-dependent and RNA-dependent. Deletion of the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag inhibited A3C but not A3G packaging into HIV-1 Gag particles. Thus, A3G and A3C have evolved to use distinct mechanisms for targeting retroviruses.",M1
18433307,"Safety and immunogenicity of a replication-incompetent adenovirus type 5 HIV-1 clade B <e>gag</e>/pol/nef vaccine in healthy adults.BACKGROUND: The safety and immunogenicity of the MRK adenovirus type 5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 clade B gag/pol/nef vaccine, a replication-incompetent adenovirus type 5-vectored vaccine designed to elicit cell-mediated immunity against conserved human immunodeficiency virus proteins, was assessed in a phase 1 trial. METHODS: Healthy adults not infected with human immunodeficiency virus were enrolled in a multicenter, dose-escalating, blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate a 3-dose homologous prime-boost regimen of the trivalent MRK adenovirus type 5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine containing from 3 x 10(6) to 1 x 10(11) viral particles per 1-mL dose administered on day 1, during week 4 and during week 26. Adverse events were recorded for 29 days after each intradeltoid injection. The primary immunogenicity end point was the proportion of study participants with a positive unfractionated Gag-, Pol-, or Nef-specific interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot response measured 4 weeks after administration of the last dose. RESULTS: Of 259 randomized individuals, 257 (99%) received &gt; or = 1 dose of vaccine or placebo and were included in the safety analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot results were available for 217 study participants (84%) at week 30. No serious vaccine-related adverse events occurred. No study participant discontinued participation because of vaccine-related adverse events. The frequency of injection-site reactions was dose dependent. Vaccine doses of &gt; or = 3 x 10(9) viral particles elicited positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot responses to &gt; or = 1 vaccine component in &gt; 60% of recipients. High baseline antibody titers against adenovirus type 5 diminished enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot responses at all doses except the 3 x 10(10) viral particle dose. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine was generally well tolerated and induced cell-mediated immune responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 peptides in most healthy adults. Despite these findings, vaccination in a proof-of-concept trial with use of this vaccine was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.",M1
18369187,"Unexpected roles for UPF1 in HIV-1 RNA metabolism and translation.The HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) contains the major structural protein, pr55(<e>Gag</e>), viral genomic RNA, as well as the host protein, Staufen1. In this report, we show that the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) factor UPF1 is also a component of the HIV-1 RNP. We investigated the role of UPF1 in HIV-1-expressing cells. Depletion of UPF1 by siRNA resulted in a dramatic reduction in steady-state HIV-1 RNA and pr55(Gag). Pr55(Gag) synthesis, but not the cognate genomic RNA, was efficiently rescued by expression of an siRNA-insensitive UPF1, demonstrating that UPF1 positively influences HIV-1 RNA translatability. Conversely, overexpression of UPF1 led to a dramatic up-regulation of HIV-1 expression at the RNA and protein synthesis levels. The effects of UPF1 on HIV-1 RNA stability were observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm and required ongoing translation. We also demonstrate that the effects exerted by UPF1 on HIV-1 expression were dependent on its ATPase activity, but were separable from its role in NMD and did not require interaction with UPF2.",M1
18314205,"A heteroduplex assay for the rapid detection of dual Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 infections.The predominance of circulating and unique recombinant forms (URFs) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) in Cameroon suggests that dual infection occurs frequently in this region. Despite the potential impact of these infections on the evolution of HIV diversity, relatively few have been detected. The failure to detect dual infections may be attributable to the laborious and costly sequence analysis involved in their identification. As such, there is a need for a cost-effective, more rapid method to efficiently distinguish this subset of HIV-positive individuals, particularly in regions where HIV diversity is broad. In the present study, the heteroduplex assay (HDA) was developed to detect dual HIV-1 infection. This assay was validated on sequential specimens obtained from 20 HIV+ study subjects, whose single or dual infection status was determined by standard sequence analysis. By mixing <e>gag</e> fragments amplified from the sequential specimens from each study subject in HDA reactions, it was shown that single and dual infection status correlated with the absence and presence, respectively, of heteroduplex bands upon gel electrophoresis. Therefore, this novel assay is capable of identifying dual infections with a sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of sequence analysis. Given the impact of dual infection on viral recombination and diversity, this simple technique will be beneficial to understanding HIV-1 evolution within an individual, as well as at a population level, in West-Central Africa and globally.",M1
18267010,"Differential control of CXCR4 and CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 <e>Gag</e>.BACKGROUND: The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery functions to sort cellular receptors into the lumen of the multivesicular body (MVB) prior to lysosomal degradation. ESCRT components can also be recruited by enveloped viruses to sites of viral assembly where they have been proposed to mediate viral egress. For example, HIV-1 budding is dependent on Gag-mediated recruitment of the cellular ESCRTs-I, -III, AIP1/Alix and Vps4 proteins. Viral recruitment of ESCRT proteins could therefore impact on host cell processes such as receptor downregulation. RESULTS: Here we show that downregulation of the HIV-1 co-receptor, CXCR4, by its ligand SDF-1, is ESCRT-I dependent. Expression of HIV-1 Gag attenuated downregulation of CXCR4, resulting in accumulation of undegraded receptors within intracellular compartments. The effect of Gag was dependent on an ESCRT-I interacting motif within the C-terminal p6 region of Gag. In contrast, PMA-induced downregulation of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 was independent of ESCRT-I and Vps4; HIV-1 Gag had no effect on this process. CONCLUSION: These results establish that the HIV-1 receptor, CD4, and co-receptor, CXCR4 are differentially regulated by ESCRT proteins. HIV-1 Gag selectively modulates protein sorting at the MVB, interfering with ESCRT-I dependent but not ESCRT-I independent processes.",M1
18191436,"Virus-like particle formation and translational start site choice of the plant retrotransposon Tto1.Ty1/copia group retrotransposon Tto1 from tobacco was put under control of an inducible promoter for expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The system was used to analyze intermediates of the transposition process. The Tto1 RNA 5' region has a complex structure and contains several AUG codons. We therefore sought to experimentally define the translation initiation site. Constructs starting at various positions within the structural <e>gag</e> region were expressed in planta and functionally characterized. We found that gag proteins starting at the first ATG of the gag-pol ORF (ATG1), but also those starting at the third ATG of the gag-pol ORF (ATG3), can form virus-like particles (VLPs). However, gag protein expressed by the inducible Tto1 element had a size similar to gag starting at ATG1, and mutation of ATG1 in the inducible element abolished reverse transcription. This suggested that translation initiation at ATG1 is essential for the Tto1 life cycle. To support this conjecture, gag protein starting at ATG1, or gag protein shortened amino-terminally by nine amino acids (starting at the second ATG of the gag region, ATG2), was co-expressed with Tto1 carrying mutations at ATG1 and ATG2. Trans-complementation of the defective Tto element by gag starting at ATG1, but not by gag starting at ATG2, defines ATG1 as the functional translation initiation site.",M1
18167642,"Sequence variation occurs in CD4 epitopes during early HIV infection.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether viral sequence variation occurs in HIV-specific CD4 epitopes during early HIV infection. METHODS: <e>Gag</e>, Nef, and integrase (Int) sequences were obtained from the plasma of 7 subjects identified during acute HIV-1 infection. Changes in the viral sequence were determined based on comparison of sequences obtained at 2 time points during early infection. Peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were measured at matched time points using interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays to identify CD4 epitopes. RESULTS: An average of 4 mutations were identified per subject. The majority of the mutations were nonsynonymous and resulted in a total of 6 amino acid changes in Gag, 7 changes in Nef, and 6 changes and a deletion in Int. Half of the sequence changes were within recognized CD4 epitopes. Mutations within CD4 epitopes were coincident with changes in the peptide-specific CD4 response. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that sequence variation occurs within recognized CD4 epitopes during early HIV infection. Furthermore, it suggests that mutations within HIV-specific CD4 epitopes may affect T helper cell function.",M1
18160188,"Evaluation of the Friend Virus model for the development of improved adenovirus-vectored anti-retroviral vaccination strategies.We evaluated the suitability of the Friend Virus (FV) model for the development of improved adenovirus vectors for anti-retroviral vaccination using two types of adenovirus vectors, encoding F-MuLV Env and <e>Gag</e>, which differed only in their fiber genes (Ad5 and Ad5F35). Genetically FV-resistant C57BL/6 mice and highly susceptible CB6F1 hybrid mice were vaccinated by either homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimen. After FV challenge, viral loads in the spleens of C57BL/6 mice were reduced approximately 250-fold and were below the detection threshold in &gt;50% of the mice. Vaccination outcome was critically influenced by the route of vector administration. In CB6F1 mice, vaccination resulted in reduced viremia, delayed onset of splenomegaly, and induction of FV-specific T cells as assessed by tetramer staining. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination resulted in significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers, translating into improved immune protection, in contrast to coexpression of cytokines. Our results suggest that the FV model can provide insight into the development of improved adenovirus vectors for HIV-1 vaccination.",M1
18063124,"Specific detection of small ruminant lentiviral nucleic acid sequences located in the proviral long terminal repeat and leader-<e>gag</e> regions using real-time polymerase chain reaction.Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of proviral nucleic acid sequences of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) in blood samples was developed and evaluated. Priming oligonucleotides were designed on the highly conserved 5' untranslated leader-gag region while those on the long terminal repeat (LTR) assay were derived from literature. DNA was extracted from the buffycoat interlayer of centrifuged blood samples. Real-time PCR was performed by means of LightCycler technology (Roche Applied Science) using melting temperature analysis (SYBR Green I) for detection. Results were compared with those of serology using samples from Dutch sheep and goat flocks with known SRLV statuses, with sequential samples from a natural transmission experiment and samples from different regions in Norway, France, Spain and Italy. Real-time PCR testing, especially the application of oligonucleotides for priming the leader-gag region appeared promising in detecting SRLV specific proviral DNA in blood samples from both sheep and goats.",M1
18041297,"Surveillance of subtype and genetic variation of the circulating strains of HIV-1 in Thailand.Two HIV-1 strains, CRF01_AE and subtype B', were reported in Thailand during the early years of the epidemic. Recently, an intersubtype recombination of HIV-1 strain was found in Thailand. Eight-hundred and twenty-eight samples collected during years 1995-2004 from high-risk groups in Bangkok, northern, northeastern, and southern region of Thailand were studied. HIV-1 env nucleotide sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis of the circulating HIV-1 strain. By single HIV-1 region (env) genotyping, CRFO1_AE was found in 97.3% and HIV-1 subtype B was found in 2.7%. A predominance of CRF01_AE was found in all geographic regions. Parallel analysis of the HIV-1 <e>gag</e> and env genes demonstrated that 2.1% and 4.0% of recombinant HIV-1 strains were found using p17 and p24 region sequences, respectively. The recombinant gag gene was also found in one southern isolate. Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 isolated from 20 provinces in 2002 suggested the northern and northeastern isolates were more related than the southern isolates which had the lowest genetic diversity of 0.13. The GPGQ V3 loop tip was also present in isolates from all regions. The molecular epidemiological data from this study may be useful for surveillance design as well as targeting prevention efforts. It also provides information regarding new antigenic regions of circulating strains responsible for the HIV-1 epidemic in Thailand.",M1

Secondly, PCR using primers specific for the HIV-1 <e>gag</e>, pol and env genes for detection of HIV-1 sequences in these DNA were performed. RESULTS: Intestinal bacteria DNA of HIV/AIDS patients hybridized in colony and dot blot hybridization assay for HIV-1 specific sequences. PCR products synthesized on specific primers of HIV-1 gag (115 bp), env (142 bp), pol-env (1484) genes were found to be for more than 90% homologous to the corresponding sequence in HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal bacteria of HIV/AIDS patients are bearing sequences for more than 90% identical with those of HIV-1.",M1
17961216,"Control of <e>gag</e>-pol gene expression in the Candida albicans retrotransposon Tca2.BACKGROUND: In the C. albicans retrotransposon Tca2, the gag and pol ORFs are separated by a UGA stop codon, 3' of which is a potential RNA pseudoknot. It is unclear how the Tca2 gag UGA codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. However, in other retroelements, translational readthrough of the gag stop codon can be directed by its flanking sequence, including a 3' pseudoknot. RESULTS: The hypothesis was tested that in Tca2, gag stop codon flanking sequences direct translational readthrough and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein. Sequence from the Tca2 gag-UGA-pol junction (300 nt) was inserted between fused lacZ and luciferase (luc) genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual reporter construct. Although downstream of UGA, luc was expressed, but its expression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3' end of lacZ. Luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. Evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct UGA readthrough. Using reporter genes in C. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the Tca2 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were compared. Of the two promoters, only the LTR promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition. Tca2 pol protein, epitope-tagged in C. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag-UGA-pol RNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. However, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag UGA-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in S. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag UGA bypass in Tca2.",M1
17922931,"HIV subtypes in Scotland, 2000-2006.The purpose of this study was to document the dynamics of HIV-1 subtypes in Scotland over a 6-year period. Viral RNA from all-new diagnoses was amplified by nested PCR and sequenced in the <e>gag</e> and/or env regions. Subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis, and aligned with demographic data including likely route and geographical origin of infection. We present data on 80% of all new diagnoses in Scotland between April 2000 and April 2006. Within the background of an expanding epidemic, subtype B predominates in men who have sex with men and intravenous drug users but there is a small but consistent number of UK-acquired infections in these risk groups caused by non-B subtypes. In heterosexuals, non-B subtypes acquired abroad, especially Africa, are still the largest group but again UK-acquired numbers are rising.

17854955,"Live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes expressing HIV <e>Gag</e>: immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.Induction of strong cellular immunity will be important for AIDS vaccine candidates. Natural infection with wild-type Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), an orally transmitted organism, is known to generate strong cellular immunity, thus raising the possibility that live attenuated Lm could serve as a vaccine vector. We sought to examine the potential of live attenuated Lm to induce cellular immune responses to HIV Gag. Rhesus macaques were immunized with Lmdd-gag that expresses HIV gag and lacks two genes in the D-alanine (D-ala) synthesis pathway. Without this key component of the bacterial cell wall, vaccine vector replication critically depends on exogenous D-ala. Lmdd-gag was given to animals either solely orally or by oral priming followed by intramuscular (i.m.) boosting; D-ala was co-administered with all vaccinations. Lmdd-gag and D-ala were well tolerated. Oral priming/oral boosting induced Gag-specific cellular immune responses, whereas oral priming/i.m. boosting induced systemic as well as mucosal anti-Gag antibodies. These results suggest that the route of vaccination may bias anti-Gag immune responses either towards T-helper type 1 (Th1) or Th2 responses; overall, our data show that live attenuated, recombinant Lmdd-gag is safe and immunogenic in primates.",M1
17767972,"<e>Gag</e> genetic heterogeneity of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) in naturally infected horses in Canada.Gag genetic heterogeneity of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) variants in naturally infected horses in Canada was studied since very limited information is available on the variability of EIAV Gag sequences in public database. A phylogenetic analysis based on 414nts of Gag gene sequences amplified by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the distinct divergence of these variants compared to other published strains in a corresponding region. Significant predicted amino acid sequence variations were also identified in an immunorelevant region within this fragment which corresponded to a previously characterized cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitope cluster (EC2, aa 77-119). Furthermore, alignment of the predicted full-length Gag protein gene sequences of some of these variants associated with clinical cases of EIA in Canada with the published sequences of EIAV originating from other countries revealed conserved and variant sequences in regions corresponding to other characterized CTL epitope clusters, EC1, EC3 and EC4. Conserved sequences identified among different variant strains might have an important implication for their screening and selection of putative peptide epitopes to mediate relevant immune response and cross protection against divergent field strains of EIAV.",M1
17725419,"The complexity of circulating HIV type 1 strains in Oyo state, Nigeria.Multiple HIV-1 subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are known to circulate in West Africa. We undertook a survey of HIVs in Oyo state, in southwestern Nigeria. We analyzed 71 samples from Ibadan, the capital city, and 33 samples from Saki, 100 miles west of Ibadan. We sequenced part of the <e>gag</e> gene and the envelope C2V3 region from 102 and 89 samples, respectively. In the 87 samples for which both genes were sequenced, subtype G and CRF02_AG were found in equal proportions (32.2% each). Other samples included CRF06_cpx (8.0%), subtype A (2.3%), C (1.1%), unclassified (1.1%), or discordant sequences suggesting the presence of a large number of recombinants involving CRF02_AG and/or subtype G (20.7%) or other subtypes (2.3%). The subtype/CRF designation was concordant in two gene fragments in the majority of samples evaluated. However, we observed differences in subtype distribution between the two locations with a predominance of subtype G in Ibadan and CRF02 in Saki. This is the first in-depth analysis of HIV variability at a state level in Nigeria. Our analysis revealed a significant level of viral heterogeneity and a geographical difference in subtype distribution, and demonstrated that CRF02_AG does not account for the majority of circulating strains.",M1
17705166,"Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Santa Catarina State confirms increases of subtype C in Southern Brazil.Recent studies have demonstrated an increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C in southern Brazil. Although Santa Catarina State (SC) is located in this area and presents one of the country's highest incidences of HIV/AIDS, knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in such State is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the HIV-1 molecular diversity and epidemiological profile of HIV-1-infected patients from SC. DNA samples were PCR amplified and HIV-1 subtypes were determined using both env and <e>gag</e> genes by direct sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 48% were subtype C and 23% were subtype B. Possible recombinant forms were observed for both B/C (23%) and B/F (6%) subtypes.

17686788,"Circularization of the HIV-1 RNA genome.Genomic RNA circularization has been proposed for several RNA viruses. In this study, we examined if the 5' and 3' ends of the 9-kb HIV-1 RNA genome can interact. In vitro assays demonstrated a specific interaction between transcripts encompassing the 5' and 3' terminal 1 kb, suggesting that the HIV-1 RNA genome can circularize. Truncation of the transcripts indicated that the 5'-3' interaction is formed by 600-700 nt in the <e>gag</e> open reading frame and the terminal 123 nt of the genomic RNA. Detailed RNA structure probing indicates that sequences flanking the 3' TAR hairpin interact with complementary sequences in the gag gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all HIV-1 subtypes can form the 5'/3' interaction despite considerable sequence divergence, suggesting an important role of RNA circularization in the HIV-1 replication cycle.",M1

17617899,"Impairment of alternative splice sites defining a novel gammaretroviral exon within <e>gag</e> modifies the oncogenic properties of Akv murine leukemia virus.BACKGROUND: Mutations of an alternative splice donor site located within the gag region has previously been shown to broaden the pathogenic potential of the T-lymphomagenic gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus, while the equivalent mutations in the erythroleukemia inducing Friend murine leukemia virus seem to have no influence on the disease-inducing potential of this virus. In the present study we investigate the splice pattern as well as the possible effects of mutating the alternative splice sites on the oncogenic properties of the B-lymphomagenic Akv murine leukemia virus. RESULTS: By exon-trapping procedures we have identified a novel gammaretroviral exon, resulting from usage of alternative splice acceptor (SA') and splice donor (SD') sites located in the capsid region of gag of the B-cell lymphomagenic Akv murine leukemia virus. To analyze possible effects in vivo of this novel exon, three different alternative splice site mutant viruses, mutated in either the SA', in the SD', or in both sites, respectively, were constructed and injected into newborn inbred NMRI mice. Most of the infected mice (about 90%) developed hematopoietic neoplasms within 250 days, and histological examination of the tumors showed that the introduced synonymous gag mutations have a significant influence on the phenotype of the induced tumors, changing the distribution of the different types as well as generating tumors of additional specificities such as de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and histiocytic sarcoma. Interestingly, a broader spectrum of diagnoses was made from the two single splice-site mutants than from as well the wild-type as the double splice-site mutant. Both single- and double-spliced transcripts are produced in vivo using the SA' and/or the SD' sites, but the mechanisms underlying the observed effects on oncogenesis remain to be clarified. Likewise, analyses of provirus integration sites in tumor tissues, which identified 111 novel RISs (retroviral integration sites) and 35 novel CISs (common integration sites), did not clearly point to specific target genes or pathways to be associated with specific tumor diagnoses or individual viral mutants. CONCLUSION: We present here the first example of a doubly spliced transcript within the group of gammaretroviruses, and we show that mutation of the alternative splice sites that define this novel RNA product change the oncogenic potential of Akv murine leukemia virus.",M1
17537671,"Molecular screening shows extensive HIV-1 genetic diversity in Central West Brazil.BACKGROUND: Information is limited about HIV-1 subtypes circulating in less populated Brazilian areas where the AIDS epidemic is expanding, such as in the Central West region. OBJECTIVE: To describe HIV-1 subtypes in patients from the States of Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso in Central West Brazil. STUDY DESIGN: Heteroduplex mobility analysis of nested-PCR products from env (primers: ED5/ED12, ES7/ES8) and <e>gag</e> regions (primers: H1P202/H1G777, H1Gag1584/g17) of 406 HIV-1 isolates from Goias (n=271), Mato Grosso do Sul (n=85) and Mato Grosso (n=50) collected from 2001 to 2004. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 26 years (1-79 range), 68.7% (279/406) females, 69.9% (269/385) sexual exposure, 14.3% parenteral risk, 15.8% vertical cases. Overall 69.9% (284/406) of HIV-1 subtypes were concordant B(env)/B(gag), 1.7% F(env)/F(gag) and 1% C(env)/C(gag). Discordant HIV-1 isolates were 14.5% (59/406), mainly B(env)/F(gag) and F(env)/B(gag) (49/59); five were B(env)/D(gag), four B(env)/C(gag) and one C(env)/D(gag).

17461768,"DNA-enzyme-mediated cleavage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <e>Gag</e> RNA is significantly augmented by antisense-DNA molecules targeted to hybridize close to the cleavage site.DNA-enzymes (Dzs) usually cleave short synthetic target RNAs very efficiently, but this activity diminishes significantly when tested on full-length RNAs, primarily because of the rigid secondary structures near the target sequence. We identified two Dzs, one each for 81-17 and 10-23 Dz, which cleaved the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag RNA poorly. We sought to use short oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with the hope that it will facilitate Dz-mediated cleavage. The efficiencies of several ODNs were analyzed for their ability to augment the 8-17 Dz-mediated cleavage. We observed that ODNs that hybridized close to 5' and 3' ends of the target sequence were able to enhance significantly 8-17 Dz-mediated cleavage activity in a dose-dependent manner. The same was true for 10-23 Dz with ODNs that hybridized close to the target site. Thus, it was possible to enhance significantly the cleavage activity of poorly cleaving HIV-1 Gag-specific Dzs by using sequence-specific ODNs. This combination of antisense and catalytic Dz will, in principle, result in more effective gene suppression that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes.",M1

A novel deletion of 7aa (including a KELY motif) in the central region of the CRF07_BC gag p6 domain was detected, which has not been reported in other HIV-1 subtypes. Further deletions of up to 13aa (including KQE and KELY motifs) was also found in this domain, representing the biggest natural deletion up to now.

Partial regions of <e>gag</e> and pol and the entire env were examined for sequence variation in DNA samples from cases of Jembrana disease obtained from Bali, Sumatra and South Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo. A high level of nucleotide conservation (97-100%) was observed in gag sequences from samples taken in Bali and Sumatra, indicating that the source of JDV in Sumatra was most likely to have originated from Bali. The pol sequences and, unexpectedly, the env sequences from Bali samples were also well conserved with low nucleotide (96-99%) and amino acid substitutions (95-99%). However, the sample from South Kalimantan (JDV(KAL/01)) contained more divergent sequences, particularly in env (88% identity). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the JDV(KAL/01)env sequences clustered with the sequence from the Pulukan sample (Bali) from 2001. JDV appears to be remarkably stable genetically and has undergone minor genetic changes over a period of nearly 20 years in Bali despite becoming endemic in the cattle population of the island.",M1
17415035,"Routine HIV-1 genotyping as a tool to identify dual infections.OBJECTIVES: The incidence of HIV-1 dual infections is generally thought to be low, but as dual infections have been associated with accelerated disease progression, its recognition is clinically important. Methods to identify HIV-1 dual infections are time consuming and are not routinely performed. DESIGN: Genotyping of the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (prot/RT) genes is commonly performed in the western world to detect drug-resistance mutations in clinical isolates. In our hospital, prot/RT baseline sequencing is part of the patient care for all newly infected patients in the Amsterdam region since 2003. We reasoned that degenerate base codes in this sequence could indicate either extensive viral evolution or infection with multiple HIV-1 strains. METHODS: We amplified, cloned and sequenced multiple HIV-1 envelope (env)-V3 and <e>gag</e> sequences from patients with 34 or more (range 34-99) degenerate base codes in the ViroSeq genotyping RT sequence (37 out of 1661 available records) to estimate the number of HIV-1 dual infections in this group. RESULTS: Of the 37 patients included in this study, 16 (43.2%, equal to 1% of the 1661 total records) had an HIV-1 dual infection based on phylogenetic analysis of env-V3/gag sequences. If only sequences with 45 or more degenerate base codes were taken into account, 73.3% of patients showed evidence of a dual infection. CONCLUSION: We describe an additional use of routinely performed HIV-1 genotyping. In patients with a high number of degenerate bases (&gt; or = 34) in RT it is important to consider the possibility of a dual HIV-1 infection.",M1
17411382,"HIV type 1 subtype C <e>gag</e> and nef diversity in Southern Africa.Several HIV-1 subtype C-specific gag- and/or nef-based vaccines are currently intended for clinical trial in southern Africa. Here we provide sequences of 64 gag and 45 nef genes sampled in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa and assess the degree of southern African HIV-1 diversity that will confront these vaccines. Whereas reasonable phylogenetic evidence exists for geographical clustering of subtype C gag and nef sequences from various other parts of the world, there is little evidence of similar population founder effects in the southern African epidemic. The entire breadth of subtype C diversity is represented in the southern African genes suggesting there may be no advantage in producing region- or country-specific subtype C vaccines. We do not, however, find much evidence of intersubtype recombination in the Southern African genes, implying that the likelihood of vaccine failure due to the emergence of intersubtype recombinants is probably low.",M1
17411367,"Limitations to contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis in establishing HIV type 1 transmission networks in Cuba.Sequence analysis can be used to evaluate transmission networks. We have used retrospective samples to examine two HIV-1 transmission networks established by contact tracing. Regions of the HIV-1 region representing segments of <e>gag</e> and env were amplified by RT-PCR from frozen plasma samples and the sequence of each PCR product was determined. Within one of the networks (composed of 38 subjects) we found only a subset of the tested sequence clusters was consistent with the reported epidemiological linkage. Of 15 presumed transmission events where sequence data were available, 9 could be rejected either by subtype mismatch or by phylogenetic tests. In the other network (composed of 89 subjects) we were able to assess sequences for 26 presumed transmission events, 18 of which were rejected based on subtype discordance. Long lags in time between the time of transmission and the time of sequence sampling (ranging from 2 to 18 years) may limit the sensitivity for the detection of sequence linkage. Also, superinfection and incomplete epidemiological information are other factors that will limit the concordance of phylogenetic reconstruction and reported epidemiological linkage.",M1
17396997,"Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection and full-length genomic analysis of circulating recombinant form 07_BC strains from injection drug users in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that there was an outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan in 2004. The objectives of the present study were to conduct a molecular epidemiological analysis and to characterize the full-length genome of the Taiwanese CRF07_BC. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients with HIV-1/AIDS from hospitals and 133 HIV-1-infected inmates from detention centers were recruited. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to determine subtypes and evolutionary relationships. Recombination breakpoints of 2 full-length CRF07_BC strains were elucidated using a bootscanning method. RESULTS: Of 206 HIV-1-infected patients who received a diagnosis in 2004, 44.7% were infected with subtype B, 53.4% with CRF07_BC, and 1.5% with CRF01_AE. Ninety-eight percent (109/111) of IDUs were infected with CRF07_BC. Deletions of 7-11 amino acids in both p6(<e>gag</e>) and p6(pol) proteins were noted among the Taiwanese CRF07_BC strains. The CRF_07BC strains belonged to 2 phylogenetic clusters, and the first cluster contained only CRF07_BC strains from the southern part of Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: The Taiwanese CRF07_BC strains had 97% full-length sequence homology with the prototype from mainland China. CRF07_BC was first introduced into the southern region in 2002 and then spread to other regions in Taiwan in 2004.",M1

In this study, we evaluate the immunogenicity and protective immunity of an adenovirus vector (Ad) in BALB/c mice and cynomolgus monkeys. We developed an HIV vaccine containing the HIV clade C gag gene using a replication-defective chimeric adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector incorporating Ad35 fiber (Ad5/35); this vector has exhibited low hepatotoxicity in animal models. We observed that immunization with the Ad5/35 vaccine generated heightened HIV-specific immune responses in both mice and monkeys. Furthermore, the Ad5/35 vector vaccine produced a cross-immunity against challenge with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing HIV clade B gag. These results demonstrate that Ad5/35 vaccines expressing HIV clade C gag may be promising candidates for clinical trials.",M1
17368087,"Quantitation of HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma and CSF of asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients from South India using a TaqMan real time PCR assay.BACKGROUND: Most of the quantitation assays for HIV-1 RNA used currently are designed and optimized for HIV-1 subtype B viruses and hence may not be suitable for India, where the predominant subtype is HIV-1 subtype C. OBJECTIVES: Development and standardization of HIV-1 TaqMan real time PCR assay suitable for measuring plasma and CSF viral RNA levels in HIV subtype C infected individuals. STUDY DESIGN: A TaqMan real time PCR was developed using primers and probes selected in the <e>gag</e> region for detection of Indian HIV-1 subtype C strain. Plasma (n=120) and CSF samples (n=46) obtained from HIV infected subjects were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. A comparative evaluation was carried out with a commercially available quantitative HIV viral load assay (Roche Amplicor Version 1.5). RESULTS: The TaqMan assay was able to amplify all HIV-1 group M subtypes except subtype E. Viral loads could be estimated in all the plasma (n=120) and 40/46 CSF samples obtained from HIV positive subjects. Sensitivity of this assay was found to be 180 copies/ml. Correlation with the commercially available viral load assay was very good (r=0.885). CONCLUSIONS: A TaqMan real time PCR was standardized for HIV-1 subtype C and it was more sensitive (180 copies/ml) than standard Amplicor monitor assay, Version 1.5 (400 copies/ml).",M1
17366634,"Inclusion body myositis with human immunodeficiency virus infection: four cases with clonal expansion of viral-specific T cells.OBJECTIVE: Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), a common adult-onset myositis, is characterized by an antigen-driven inflammatory response and vacuolar degeneration. The cause is unknown. We report the association of sIBM with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and explore the clonality and viral specificity of the autoinvasive T cells. METHODS: Clinicopathological studies in four HIV-infected patients with IBM were performed. The clonal restriction of endomysial T cells, compared with peripheral blood, was examined by spectratyping. Immunohistochemical studies using human leukocyte antigen-A* 0201-<e>gag</e> tetramers and the most dominant Vb families were performed in serial muscle biopsy sections to examine whether clonally expanded autoinvasive T cells are viral specific and invade muscle fibers expressing the allele-specific monomorphic major histocompatibility complex class I antigen. RESULTS: Prominent clonal restriction of certain Vb families was noted among the endomysial T cells with evidence of in situ expansion. Approximately 10% of the autoinvasive CD8(+) cells were human leukocyte antigen-A* 0201-HIV-gag specific and invaded muscle fibers expressing the specific human leukocyte antigen-A* 0201 allele. These cells belonged to restricted Vb families. The HIV gag antigen was present on several endomysial macrophages but not within the muscle fibers. INTERPRETATION: sIBM develops in patients who harbor HIV. In HIV-IBM, a subset of CD8(+) T cells surrounding muscle fibers are viral specific and may play a role in the disease mechanism by cross-reacting with antigens on the surface of muscle fibers. This study provides a paradigm that a chronic viral infection in genetically susceptible individuals can trigger viral specific T cell clones that persist within the muscle and lead to development of sIBM.",M1
17349752,"Genetic characterization of maedi-visna virus (MVV) detected in Finland.The aim of the study was to characterize the small-ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) detected in Finland by defining their phylogenetic relationships and by studying the evolution of the virus based on a well-known epidemiology. The study material comprised lung tissue samples of 20 sheep from 5 different farms, a cell-cultured virus from one of the original sheep lung samples, and a blood sample of a goat. The sheep were identified as positive during seroepidemiologic screenings in 1994-1996 and the goat in 2001. Initial classification of a 251 nucleotide sequence within <e>gag</e> gene amplified from the uncultured samples as well as from the cell-cultured virus showed that the SRLVs were genetically close and that they were more closely related to the prototype ovine maedi-visna viruses (MVVs) than to the caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV). The lentivirus detected from the goat aligned within the cluster of the Finnish ovine viruses, demonstrating a natural sheep-to-goat transmission. Further phylogenetic analysis of the proviral gag, pol and env sequences confirmed the initial classification and showed that they constituted a new subtype within the diverse MVV group. The sequence analyses also showed that the virus had remained genetically relatively stable, in spite of the time given for virus evolution, an estimated 20 years, and in spite of the virus crossing the host species barrier.",M1
17346134,"Reduction of anti-HIV-1 <e>Gag</e> immune responses during co-immunization: immune interference by the HIV-1 envelope.Immunization with more than one immunogen (co-immunization) is an efficient regimen to induce immunity to multiple antigens. However, immune interference has been reported using multi-plasmid DNA immunizations. HIV-1 envelope (Env) and Gag gene products are the predominant immunogens used in current AIDS vaccines, although, few studies have evaluated possible immune interference when these two antigens are co-administered. Therefore, in this study, immune interference during co-inoculation was examined using DNA vaccines expressing lentiviral Envs and Gag from gene sequences optimized for efficient expression in mammalian cells (codon-optimized). BALB/c mice vaccinated in separate hind legs with each plasmid individually elicited high titer immune responses, however, when HIV-1 Env(gp120) and HIV-1 Gag(p55) DNA plasmids were co-inoculated, there was a reduction in the immune responses elicited to HIV-1 Gag(p55). To determine if the anti-HIV-1 Gag(p55) immune interference was specific to HIV-1 Env(gp120), mice were co-immunized with plasmids expressing the surface envelope protein from two additional lentiviruses, Env(gp130)-SIV or Env(gp90)-EIAV, or a soluble form of hemagglutinin (sHA) from influenza virus and HIV-1 Gag(p55)- or SIV Gag(p55)-DNA. Interestingly, there was no reduction in anti-HIV-1 Gag(p55) immune responses using other lentiviral envelopes or the influenza sHA. Also, none of the lentiviral envelopes reduced anti-SIV Gag(p55) immune responses during co-immunization. Therefore, anti-HIV-1 Gag immune interference appears specific to co-immunizations with HIV-1 Env(gp120) and may involve a yet undefined immunological mechanism(s).",M1
17337054,"Molecular characterization of lentiviruses from goats from Poland based on <e>gag</e> gene sequence analysis.Caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) infection in goats is worldwide but with higher prevalence in industrialized countries. While positive serology of CAEV in Polish goats was reported there was no genetic study of this virus. In this study, we described the molecular characterization of lentiviruses isolated from seropositive goats from Poland. We cloned and sequenced a fragment from the gag gene covering part of the coding sequences for the matrix (MA) p17 and for the capsid (CA) p25 proteins. Resulting nucleotide sequences were aligned with those from other ovine/caprine lentivirus isolates. We present data showing that the sequences of most goat lentivirus isolates are closer to the prototypic CAEV-Co isolate, nevertheless from one goat we isolated a virus that is closer to the sheep Maedi Visna virus (MVV) isolate. This might indicate a recent cross-species infection from sheep to goat.",M1
17325604,"Safety and immunogenicity of a <e>Gag</e>-Pol candidate HIV-1 DNA vaccine administered by a needle-free device in HIV-1-seronegative subjects.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate HIV DNA vaccine administered using a needle-free device. DESIGN: In this phase 1, dose escalation, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 21 healthy adults were randomized to receive placebo or 0.5, 1.5, or 4 mg of a single plasmid expressing a Gag/Pol fusion protein. Each participant received repeat immunizations at days 28 and 56 after the first inoculation. Safety and immunogenicity data were collected. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild injection site reactions, including pain, tenderness, and erythema. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. HIV-specific antibody response was not detected in any vaccinee by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIV-specific T-cell responses to Gag or Pol as measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and intracellular cytokine staining were of low frequency and magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: This candidate HIV DNA vaccine was safe and well tolerated. No HIV-specific antibody responses were detected, and only low-magnitude HIV-specific T-cell responses were detected in 8 (53%) of 15 vaccinees. This initial product led to the development of a 4-plasmid multiclade HIV DNA Vaccine Research Center vaccine candidate in which envelope genes expressing Env from clades A, B, and C and a Nef gene from clade B have been added.",M1
17263643,"Genetic and biologic characterization of HIV type 1 subtype C isolates from south Brazil.The molecular and biological properties of HIV-1 subtype C strains from South Brazil were investigated. We sequenced <e>gag</e> and env fragments of viruses from 22 HIV-1-infected individuals from Porto Alegre City, which has the highest frequency of subtype C in the country. The sequences were then compared with other subtype B, C, and F strains isolated in Brazil and other countries using phylogenetic methods. Amino acid signatures were identified and correlated with phenotypic characteristics. We identified six strains with subtype C (27.3%), eight subtype B (36.4%), one subtype F (4.5%), six C/B recombinants (27.3%), and one B/F recombinant (4.5%). The Brazilian subtype C sequences formed a unique phylogenetic group and presented 6 and 18 specific amino acid signatures in gag and env, respectively. Three distinct patterns of C/B recombinants presented characteristic Brazilian amino acid substitutions. Subtype C viruses were predominantly R5 and non-syncytium-inducing, while C/B recombinants were R5/X4 and syncytium-inducing viruses. These findings suggest that subtype C viruses circulating in Brazil are the result of a unique introduction into the country. Recombination events between subtypes B and C have been occurring frequently for more than 10 years in South Brazil. Biological characterization confirms the hypothesis that subtype C is distinct from the others in the evolution of coreceptor utilization.",M1
17233757,"Host ABCE1 is at plasma membrane HIV assembly sites and its dissociation from <e>Gag</e> is linked to subsequent events of virus production.In primate cells, assembly of a single HIV-1 capsid involves multimerization of thousands of Gag polypeptides, typically at the plasma membrane. Although studies support a model in which HIV-1 assembly proceeds through complexes containing Gag and the cellular adenosine triphosphatase ABCE1 (also termed HP68 or ribonuclease L inhibitor), whether these complexes constitute true assembly intermediates remains controversial. Here we demonstrate by pulse labeling in primate cells that a population of Gag associates with endogenous ABCE1 within minutes of translation. In the next approximately 2 h, Gag-ABCE1 complexes increase in size to approximately that of immature capsids. Dissociation of ABCE1 from Gag correlates closely with Gag processing during virion maturation and occurs much less efficiently when the HIV-1 protease is inactivated. Finally, quantitative double-label immunogold electron microscopy reveals that ABCE1 is recruited to sites of assembling wild-type Gag at the plasma membrane but not to sites of an assembly-defective Gag mutant at the plasma membrane. Together these findings demonstrate that a population of Gag present at plasma membrane sites of assembly associates with ABCE1 throughout capsid formation until the onset of virus maturation, which is then followed by virus release. Moreover, the data suggest a linkage between Gag-ABCE1 dissociation and subsequent events of virion production.",M1
17209773,"Phylogenetic analysis of env, <e>gag</e>, and tat genes of HIV type 1 detected among the injecting drug users in West Bengal, India.A recent occurrence of HIV-1 seropositivity among a group of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Darjeeling, a hilly district in northern West Bengal, revealed overall 11.8% HIV seroprevalence. Our study based on env (C2-V3), gag (p24-p7), and tat (exon-1) genomic regions of HIV-1 detected among this population showed that Darjeeling IDU sequences belonged to subtype C. Interestingly, the IDU sequences from Darjeeling were again found to be closer to the C strains from Manipur, a northeastern state in India, which is linked to the Golden Triangle via the Manipur-Myanmar border, rather than the IDU C sequences from Nepal, a neighboring country of India. The outgroup reference strains from different sites of IDU-driven epidemics in the world like Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Spain belonged to the nonsubtype C group and formed separate clusters from the subtype C cluster in our analysis. These results indicate a rapid spread of HIV-1 by possible drug trafficking along international boundaries, which might also help in the invasion of HIV-1 among IDUs of Darjeeling through the Manipur-Myanmar border of India.",M1
17197803,"In a mixed subtype epidemic, the HIV-1 <e>Gag</e>-specific T-cell response is biased towards the infecting subtype.OBJECTIVES: Southwest Tanzania is affected by an HIV-1 epidemic consisting of subtypes A, C, and D, and their recombinant forms. This study was designed to assess whether the Gag- and Nef-specific T-cell response is biased towards recognizing the infecting subtype. METHODS: The infecting subtypes were characterized with a Multi-hybridization assay that discriminates between subtypes A, C and D. The interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay was used to detect the Gag- and Nef-specific T-cell responses in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 56 seropositive patients. To study the HIV-specific T-cell responses, isolate-based Gag and Nef peptide sets representative of the locally occurring subtypes were used. The results were analysed at the total protein and single peptide level. RESULTS: In the study population, 35% were infected with a pure C subtype, 24% and 23% with ACD or AC recombinant forms, respectively. The total magnitude (P &lt; 0.01) and breadth (P &lt; 0.01) of the Gag-specific T-cell response detected with the subtype C-Gag peptide set was significantly greater than that detected with either the subtype A-Gag or D-Gag peptide sets. No significant difference was observed in the Nef-specific response. In 85% of responses targeting the most immunodominant Gag epitopes with subtype-specific sequence differences, the best recognized epitope variant corresponded to the infecting subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The Gag-specific T-cell response had a preference for recognizing peptides related to the infecting subtype.",M1
17179668,"Recombinant vaccinia DIs expressing simian immunodeficiency virus <e>gag</e> and pol in mammalian cells induces efficient cellular immunity as a safe immunodeficiency virus vaccine candidate.A highly attenuated vaccinia virus substrain of Dairen-I (DIs) shows promise as a candidate vector for eliciting positive immunity against immune deficiency virus. DIs was randomly obtained by serial 1-day egg passages of a chorioarantoic membrane-adapted Dairen strain (DIE), resulting in substantial genomic deletion, including various genes regulating the virus-host-range. To investigate the impact of that deletion and of the subsequent insertion of a foreign gene into that region of DIs on the ability of the DIs recombinant to induce antigen-specific immunity, we generated a recombinant vaccinia DIs expressing fulllength gag and pol genes of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (rDIsSIV gag/pol) and studied the biological and immunological characteristics of the recombinant natural mutant. The rDIsSIV gag/pol developed a tiny plaque on the chick embryo fibroblast (CEF). Viral particles of rDIsSIV gag/pol as well as SIV Gag-like particles were electromicroscopically detected in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the recombinant DIs strain grows well in CEF cells but not in mammalian cells. While rDIsSIV gag/pol produces SIV proteins in mammalian HeLa and CV-1 cells, recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara strain (MVA) expressing SIV gag and pol genes (MVA/SIV239 gag/pol) clearly replicates in HeLa and CV-1 cell lines under synchronized growth conditions and produces the SIV protein in all cell lines. Moreover, intradermal administration of rDIsSIV gag/pol or of MVA/SIV239 gag/pol elicited similar levels of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells specific for SIV Gag. If the non-productive infection characteristically induced by recombinant DIs is sufficient to trigger immune induction, as we believe it is, then a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine employing the DIs recombinant would have the twin advantages of being both effective and safe.",M1
17155905,"Inhibition of infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions via lentiviral vector encoded short antisense RNAs.During the life cycles of most retroviruses and lentiviruses, dimerization and packaging of two copies of viral genomic RNA is required for the subsequent conversion of RNA into double stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase. For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), dimerization is mediated by interactions of the stem-loop structures in the dimerization-packaging, or psi (Psi) domain. We have tethered anti-HIV <e>gag</e> ribozymes and small antisense RNAs to the HIV Psi domain in an HIV-1 lentiviral vector to facilitate copackaging of these replication inhibitors with HIV genomic RNAs during HIV infectious challenge. In order to maximize the base pairing of the ribozymes or antisense segments to the HIV-1 genomic target, sequences in HIV-1 were identified that are highly accessible to antisense pairing. Ribozymes or antisense RNAs designed to target these sequences were inserted in the lentiviral vector at the same relative distance to the Psi element as the HIV-1 target sites. Packaged vectors were transduced into CEM cells followed by challenges with HIV-1. Only the constructs that harbored short antisense segments complementary to HIV-1 gag produced replication incompetent HIV-1. These results demonstrate that a short stretch of antisense pairing downstream of the dimerization domain in an HIV-based vector can drive dimerization and provide a powerful approach for inhibition of HIV-1.",M1
17145123,"Effect of promoter strength on protein expression and immunogenicity of an HSV-1 amplicon vector encoding HIV-1 <e>Gag</e>.Helper-free herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors elicit robust immune responses to encoded proteins, including human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) antigens. To improve this vaccine delivery system, seven amplicon vectors were constructed, each encoding HIV-1 Gag under the control of a different promoter. Gag expression levels were analyzed in murine and human cell lines, as well as in biopsied tissue samples from injected mice; these data were then compared with Gag-specific T cell responses in BALB/c mice. The magnitude of the amplicon-induced immune response was found to correlate strongly with the level of Gag production both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the best correlation of the strength of the amplicon-induced immune response was with antigen expression in cultured DC rather than expression at the tissue site of injection or in cultured cell lines. These findings may have implications for the generation of improved HSV-1 amplicon vectors for HIV-1 vaccine delivery.",M1
17132935,"Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by siRNA targeting conserved regions of <e>gag</e>/pol.Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HIV-1gag, vif, tat, rev and host CD4 and CCR5 have been reported to inhibit HIV replication. However, the sequence divergence of HIV and the concentration dependence of siRNA activity represent significant challenges to RNAi mediated inhibition. To determine the parameters of RNAi in suppression of HIV-1 we screened seven siRNA candidates targeting highly conserved regions of gag/pol, based on target site GC content, for antiviral activity at varying concentrations. Only two of these inhibited CA-p24 production more than 50%, 2064 and 2161. Activity varied with concentration, with 100 nM producing optimal suppression. Requirements for target sequence conservation and activity over a range of concentrations may severely limit the number of siRNA candidates for therapeutic development.",M1
17129685,"A deep-branching clade of retrovirus-like retrotransposons in bdelloid rotifers.Rotifers of class Bdelloidea, a group of aquatic invertebrates in which males and meiosis have never been documented, are also unusual in their lack of multicopy LINE-like and gypsy-like retrotransposons, groups inhabiting the genomes of nearly all other metazoans. Bdelloids do contain numerous DNA transposons, both intact and decayed, and domesticated Penelope-like retroelements Athena, concentrated at telomeric regions. Here we describe two LTR retrotransposons, each found at low copy number in a different bdelloid species, which define a clade different from previously known clades of LTR retrotransposons. Like bdelloid DNA transposons and Athena, these elements are found preferentially in telomeric regions. Unlike bdelloid DNA transposons, many of which are decayed, the newly described elements, named Vesta and Juno, inhabiting the genomes of Philodina roseola and Adineta vaga, respectively, appear to be intact and represent recent insertions, possibly from an exogenous source. We describe the retrovirus-like structure of the new elements, containing <e>gag</e>, pol, and env-like open reading frames, and discuss their possible origins, transmission, and behavior in bdelloid genomes.",M1
17125939,"Application of RNA interference for inhibiting the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus in chronically infected cell lines.RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in which double-stranded RNA induces the post-transcriptional sequence-specific degradation of homologous messenger RNA. The present study was carried out to apply the RNAi technology to inhibit the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Four small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to the FIV <e>gag</e> gene were synthesized and transfected into a feline fibroblastic cell line chronically infected with FIV (CRFK/FIV). These synthetic siRNAs efficiently inhibited the replication of FIV. Next, we examined the effect of retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIV-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on the replication of FIV in a feline T-cell line chronically infected with FIV (FL4). The retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIV-specific shRNA was shown to markedly inhibit the replication of FIV in the FL4 cells. These results provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based gene therapy strategy to control FIV infection.",M1

METHODS: HIV-1 env and <e>gag</e> genes were amplified by nested PCR from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 122 HIV-1 carriers confirmed in Shenzhen. The C2-V3 region (about 450 bp) of HIV-1 env and P17/ P24 region were sequenced. RESULTS: Among 122 samples, 6 HIV-1 strains including 3 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of CRF01_AE, CRF08_BC, CRF07_BC and 3 subtypes of B', B, C were found in Shenzhen, and the percentages were 45.1% (55/122) for CRF01_AE, 31.1% (38/122) for CRF08_BC, 6.6% (8/122) for CRF07_BC, 14.8% (18/122) for B' subtype, 1.6% (2/122) for B subtype, and 0.8% (1/122) for C subtype. The intragroup genetic distances were (4.455 +/- 1.478)%, (2.997 +/- 1.345)%, (4.380 +/- 2.024)%, (5.186 +/- 2.487)%, and (4.869 +/- 2.638)%, respectively. In comparison with the sequence of respective international strains 01AE. TH. 90. CM240, 97CNGX-9F, CN. 97. C54A, B. US. 83. JRFL, and RLA2, the genetic distances were (5. 228 +/- 0.823)%, (3.634 +/- 1.073)%, (4.233 +/- 1.119)%, (4.950 +/- 2.564)%, and (5.795 +/- 2.198)%, respectively. The major subtypes found in injection drug users (IDUs) were CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and CRF01_AE strains. CRF01_AE and B' strains were epidemic mainly in sexual workers.

While CRF01_AE is predominant among sexual workers, CRF08_BC and CRF01_AE are major subtypes among IDU population.",M1
17100767,"An adaptation of recombinant vaccinia-based ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining for a comparative measurement of cellular immune responses in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in West Africa.An efficient and quantitative tool for rapid assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced cellular immune responses is important for resource-limited settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. Modifications are required to previously reported methods for evaluating ex-vivo antigen-specific cellular responses based on direct recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISPOT) and by flow cytometry intracellular cytokine assay (ICA). We made such modifications in order to detect specific responses and compared quantitative cellular immune responses in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected Gambians. The sensitivity of the rVV-based ELISPOT assay was on average 1.25 interferon (IFN)-gamma spot forming cells (SFC) per 50 000 PBMCs specific for either infection, and 5 IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells/50 000 in the ICA. The level of IFN-gamma SFC detected by ELISPOT and by ICA were correlated (P &lt; 0.02). ICA detected pol-specific responses in 88% and 67% of HIV-1 and HIV-2 subjects, respectively, and <e>gag</e>-specific responses in more than 80% of both infections. Lower proportions of responders were obtained with ELISPOT, for which pol responses were present in 60% of HIV-1 and 46% of HIV-2 infected patients, and gag responses in 55% and 69%, respectively. The assays did not show any significant difference in cellular immune responses between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected subjects with CD4% &gt;or= 20%. These outcomes are comparable with results obtained using standard techniques and thus this method is a suitable, rapid and less expensive assessment of cellular immunity.",M1
17067276,"Genetic and phylogenetic characterization of structural genes from non-B HIV-1 subtypes in Italy.A molecular and phylogenetic characterization on env and <e>gag</e> subgenomic regions has been performed in our laboratory on HIV-1 variants identified in seropositive individuals residing in Italy, infected in the 1999-2001 period, and five non-B-subtype HIV-1 isolates have been described. To confirm the phylogenetic characterization and to determine the genomic organization of three non-B HIV-1 isolates (A, G, and CRF02- AG), the complete gag, pol, and gp120 ORFs (approx. 6900 bp) have been sequenced for each of them. The phylogenetic tree analyses performed on the whole sequence or on individual genes suggested, for the A and G isolates, the identification of divergent strains that do not cluster into any of the known subsubtypes. This has been further validated by pairwise distance analysis. On the contrary, the phylogenetic classification of the CRF02-AG isolate has been confirmed and an overall typical pattern of intragenomic breakpoints has been observed by a Simplot analysis. These results confirm the constant HIV-1 molecular evolution and indicate the relevance of a continuous molecular monitoring of HIV-1 isolates for the development of appropriate vaccine candidates.",M1
17054986,"Luman, a new partner of HIV-1 TMgp41, interferes with Tat-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 LTR.In our search for new partners of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), we found that the cytoplasmic domain of the TMgp41 (TMgp41 CD) subunit of HIV-1 Env interacted with Luman, a transcription factor of the CREB/ATF family. Luman is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and subjected to activation by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The RIP process permits the release of the activated amino-terminal fragment of Luman into the cytoplasm, and its import into the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that interaction between the TMgp41 CD and Luman requires a region encompassing the b-Zip and TM domains of Luman and decreases the stability of this factor. Moreover, we found that overexpression of a constitutively active form of Luman in cells transfected with HXB2R HIV-1 provirus decreased the intracellular expression of <e>Gag</e> and Env and led to a decrease in virion release. This negative effect of activated Luman on HIV-1 production was correlated to the inhibition of Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, which might be related to an interaction of activated Luman with Tat. Altogether, these results show that Luman acts as a partner of two major HIV-1 proteins: the TMgp41 Env subunit and Tat. The interaction between the TMgp41 subunit of Env and Luman affects the stability of the full-length Luman protein, the precursor of the activated, nuclear form of Luman, which acts negatively on Tat-mediated HIV-1 transactivation.",M1
17030101,"Development of a PCR to diagnose BLV genome in frozen semen samples.The sanitary and economic impact of BLV infection is associated with the interference in the international movement of cattle and their germ plasm. Although experimental data support the improbability that semen from BLV-positive bulls could infect recipient cows, restriction for commercialization of semen from infected animals is still present. The objective of this work was to standardize a PCR assay to diagnose the presence of BLV genome in frozen semen samples. The developed methodology involves the amplification of an internal fragment of <e>gag</e> gene. The limit of detection of this technique was six viral particles, using gag-PCR followed by hybridization analysis. Frozen semen samples from seropositive bulls were analyzed. It was possible to detect proviral DNA in 9 out of 173 samples. Additionally, a biological test in susceptible sheep was performed in order to evaluate the transmission of BLV genome by semen from seropositive animals. This data strongly suggest that semen from seropositive bulls that resulted negative by PCR can be used for artificial insemination (AI), accompanied by proper collection protocols. The development of this PCR assay constitutes a valuable diagnostic tool to determine the BLV-free status of frozen semen samples used for AI.",M1
16989614,"Impact of <e>Gag</e> sequence variability on level, phenotype, and function of anti-HIV Gag-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes in untreated chronically HIV-infected patients.The role of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in controlling viral replication during chronic HIV infection remains controversial. Viral escape mutations driven by immune pressure have been postulated to be an important mechanism contributing to the evasion of CD8(+) T cell responses. To explore this issue in more detail, HIV-1 p17 sequence variability was examined in chronically HIV-infected patients, in parallel with the level, phenotype, and function of HIV-SL9-specific CD8(+) T cell. Thirty-one HLA-A*0201(+) (A2(+)) and 10 HLAA* 02() (A2()) patients were included. The phenotype of SL9-specific CD8(+) T cell and their ability to produce IFN-gamma were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. The HIV Gag p17 was sequenced and the mean variability score for each residue within SL9 and the two epitope flanking regions were calculated using Shannon entropy. The mean variability of SL9 and the proportion of patients with amino acid changes within SL9 were similar in A2(+) and A2() patients. Patients without Tet(+) cells had a significantly higher prevalence of aminoacid changes in SL9 than patients with Tet(+) cells. Interestingly, in patients with Tet(+) cells, the Y79F mutation within SL9 tended to be associated with lower levels of Tet(+) cells. We did not find any association between amino acid changes within SL9 and the differentiation stage of Tet(+) cells, or with IFN-gamma production. A similar analysis within the epitope flanking sequences did not reveal differences in the variability of these regions. These results suggest that viral mutations driven by immune selection pressure may play an important role in evading the immunological response in chronically HIV-infected individuals.",M1
16894207,"<e>Gag</e>-Pol bearing a reverse transcriptase drug-resistant mutation influences viral genomic RNA incorporation into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles.The unspliced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA is both the messenger for Gag and Gag-Pol and the viral genomic RNA (vRNA) that is packaged into the virion. Although Gag alone is sufficient for the incorporation of vRNA into virus particles, Gag-Pol molecules play an important role in vRNA dimerization and virion maturation. Here, a cis model for vRNA packaging was demonstrated, in which nascent Gag-Pol molecules were preferentially co-encapsulated with their cognate RNA used as the template. Genome-incorporation frequencies were evaluated for two distinct HIV-1 proviral clones differing in their ability to respond to nevirapine (NVP) treatment in one round of infection. It was shown that, under NVP selection, there was a twofold-higher incorporation of vRNAs and integration of provirus genome carrying NVP resistance when compared with the wild-type counterpart. Although cis incorporation has been already demonstrated for Gag, the novelty of these findings is that newly acquired resistant mutations in Gag-Pol will select their specific genomic RNA during virus replication, thus rapidly increasing the chance of the emergence of resistant viruses during the course of anti-retroviral treatment.",M1
16797087,"Gene transfer system derived from the caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus.Lentiviruses are attractive candidates for therapeutic vectors, because of their ability to infect non-dividing target cells. Vectors based on HIV-1 efficiently transfer gene expression to a variety of dividing or quiescent cells, but are subject to reservations on safety grounds. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) is a lentivirus inducing only minor pathology in its natural host and in related species after cross-species transmission. To test the CAEV potential as vector for gene transfer, a cassette expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of a CMV promoter was inserted into the CAEV genome, producing the pK2EGFPH vector. When pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G envelope protein, this vector allowed efficient transfer of GFP expression in human cells (up to 86% of GFP-expressing cells into the TE671 cell line). Three vectors carrying different parts of the viral <e>gag</e>, pol and env genes were then developed, together with a CAEV packaging system. These vectors allowed delimitation of the minimal CAEV sequences necessary for an improvement of vector production compared to the previously described CAEV-based vectors [Mselli-Lakhal et al., 1998. Defect in RNA transport and packaging are responsible for low transduction efficiency of CAEV-based vectors. Arc. Virol. 143, 681-695]. While our previous vectors were produced in a helper/vector system, the present vectors are produced in a helper/free system. However, these vector titers remain lower than those obtained with other lentiviral vectors carrying equivalent packaging sequences. We discuss on possible reasons of such differences and possible improvements.",M1
16771221,"RNA in situ hybridization for the detection of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus in infected cells.In the present study, we have applied a novel approach to generate specific digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled RNA probes to detect Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) <e>gag</e> gene in the FIV-infected feline T-lymphoblastoid cell line (MYA-1). This involved cloning of the FIV gag gene into a PCR Script vector containing both T3 and T7 promoters, followed by amplification of the insert and the two promoter sequences, using specific primer sequences. The FIV RNA probes were more sensitive than FIV DNA probes. This approach should make RNA in situ hybridization more accessible for use in routine diagnosis.",M1
16760407,"Effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transframe protein p6* mutations on viral protease-mediated <e>Gag</e> processing.The proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles mediated by the viral pol-encoded protease (PR) is essential for viral infectivity. The pol coding sequence partially overlaps with the gag coding sequence and is translated as a Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. Within Gag-Pol, the C-terminal p6(gag) domain is replaced by a transframe peptide referred to as p6*, which separates the Gag nucleocapsid domain from PR. Several previous in vitro studies have ascribed a PR-suppression regulatory function to p6*. Here, it was demonstrated that an HIV-1 Gag-Pol lacking p6* is efficiently incorporated into virions when coexpressed with HIV-1 Gag precursor. However, the released virions are not processed appropriately and show a greatly reduced viral infectivity. This suggests that the p6* is indispensable during the process of PR-mediated virus particle maturation.",M1
16721846,"Molecular analysis and phylogenetic characterization of HIV in Iran.The rate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in Iran has increased dramatically in the last few years. While the earliest cases were found in hemophiliacs, intravenous drug users are now fueling the outbreak. In this study, both the 122 clones of HIV-1 <e>gag</e> p17 and the 131 clones of env V1-V5 region were obtained from 61 HIV-1 seropositives belonging to these two groups in Iran. HIV-1 subtyping and phylogenetic analysis was done by heteroduplex mobility assays (HMA) and multiple clone sequencing. The result indicated all hemophiliacs are infected with HIV-1 subtype B and all intravenous drug users are infected with HIV-1 subtype A. Since intravenous drug abuse is the major transmission route in Iran, HIV-1 subtype A is likely to be the dominant viral subtype circulating in the country. The analysis of genetic distances showed subtype B viruses in Iran to be twice as heterogeneous as the subtype A viruses. In conclusion, this first molecular study of HIV-1 genotypes in Iran suggests two parallel outbreaks in distinct high-risk populations and may offer clues to the origin and spread of infection in Iran.",M1
20406966,"Attenuation of tumor growth by formation of antiproliferative glycosaminoglycans correlates with low acetylation of histone H3.Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) chains anchored to core proteins form proteoglycans, widely distributed cell-surface macromolecules with multiple functions, such as regulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling, cell-cell interactions, and uptake of biomolecules. The biosynthesis of GAG can be manipulated by xylosides attached to various hydrophobic groups, and we have earlier reported that a naphthoxyloside, 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) beta-D-xylopyranoside (XylNapOH), which serves as a primer for GAG synthesis, reduces tumor load up to 97% in vivo, despite lower efficiency in vitro. Here we show, using radiolabeled xylosides and coculture experiments, that XylNapOH-treated bladder and breast carcinoma cells secrete antiproliferative GAG chains that are taken up by both normal and cancer cells and transported to the cell nuclei where they induce an antiproliferative effect, accompanied by apoptosis. We also show that XylNapOH treatment lowers the level of histone H3 acetylation selectively in bladder and breast carcinoma cells without affecting expression of histone H3. However, XylNapOH-primed GAG chains from normal cells are not internalized and do not cause growth retardation. Using in vitro and in vivo C6 glioma cell and tumor models, we show that XylNapOH is much more effective in vivo than in vitro. We propose that, in vivo, the antiproliferative XylNapOH-primed GAG chains produced by tumor cells inhibit tumor growth in an autocrine fashion by formation of antiproliferative GAG chains on the xyloside prodrug, whereas no antiproliferative GAG chains are produced by surrounding normal cells. This is a novel mechanism for targeting tumor cells, making these xylosides promising drug candidates for antitumor therapy.",M2
20363748,"Characterization of the chemokine CXCL11-heparin interaction suggests two different affinities for glycosaminoglycans.Chemokines orchestrate the migration of leukocytes in the context of homeostasis and inflammation. In addition to interactions of chemokines with receptors on migrating cells, these processes require interactions of chemokines with glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) for cell surface localization. Most chemokines are basic proteins with Arg/Lys/His residue clusters functioning as recognition epitopes for GAGs. In this study we characterized the GAG-binding epitopes of the chemokine I-TAC/CXCL11. Four separate clusters of basic residues were mutated to alanine and tested for their ability to bind to GAGs in vitro and to activate the receptor, CXCR3. Mutation of a set of basic residues in the C-terminal helix (the 50s cluster, (57)KSKQAR(62)) along with Lys(17), significantly impaired heparin binding in vitro, identifying these residues as components of the dominant epitope. However, this GAG mutant retained nearly wild type receptor binding affinity, and its ability to induce cell migration in vitro was only mildly perturbed. Nevertheless, the mutant was unable to induce cell migration in vivo, establishing a requirement of CXCL11 for GAG binding for in vivo function. These studies also led to some interesting findings. First, CXCL11 exhibits conformational heterogeneity, as evidenced by the doubling of peaks in its HSQC spectra. Second, it exhibits more than one affinity state for both heparin and CXCR3, which may be related to its structural plasticity. Finally, although the binding affinities of chemokines for GAGs are typically weaker than interactions with receptors, the high affinity GAG binding state of CXCL11 is comparable with typical receptor binding affinities, suggesting some unique properties of this chemokine.",M2
20329491,"Structural and cellular changes in canine myxomatous mitral valve disease: an image analysis study.BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the single most common cardiac disease of the dog, and bears close similarities to chronic degenerative mitral valve disease in humans. However, limited quantitative data are available on cellular and morphological changes in both species. The study aim was to use an image analysis system to examine various morphological changes associated with MMVD, and in particular to measure changes in cell numbers in overtly myxomatous areas of the distal portion of the valve. METHODS: Mitral valve complexes were collected from normal dogs and dogs with varying severity of myxomatous mitral valve disease (veterinary Whitney grades 1-4; a measure of disease severity and age-related disease progression in the dog). An image analysis technique (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to measure valve leaflet length, thickness, connective tissue content and density, glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content, cell number and shape in normal and myxomatous areas of diseased valves. RESULTS: There was a change in the valve leaflet anterior/posterior length ratio in the diseased valves, suggestive of valve lengthening. Distinct and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) changes occurred in the valve thickness ratio for both anterior and posterior leaflets as the disease progressed, and the posterior leaflet thickness ratios were consistently higher than for the anterior leaflets. There was a statistically significant decrease in cell numbers in overtly myxomatous areas of the distal portion of affected valves compared to similar locations in normal valves, but there was no difference between the different grades of disease. The majority of cells in both diseased and normal valves had a circularity score typical of a spindle (elongated) shape. Connective tissue derangement was clearly seen in the myxomatous areas, and this was associated with a significant reduction in connective tissue density. The reduction in connective tissue density was associated with advancing disease severity (age). There was an increase in GAG expression with disease severity, as shown by the level of Alcian blue staining, but this could not be quantified with ImageJ. CONCLUSION: Mitral valve myxomatous degeneration in the dog is associated with lengthening and thickening of valve leaflets, a loss of connective tissue, and a decrease in cell numbers in selected myxomatous areas, but no change in cell circularity. Some of these changes were age- (disease severity-) related.",M2
20308118,"Biologically active collagen-based scaffolds: advances in processing and characterization.A small number of type I collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds (collagen-<e>GAG</e> scaffolds; CGSs) have unusual biological activity consisting primarily in inducing partial regeneration of organs in the adult mammal. Two of these are currently in use in a variety of clinical settings. CGSs appear to induce regeneration by blocking the adult healing response, following trauma, consisting of wound contraction and scar formation. Several structural determinants of biological activity have been identified, including ligands for binding of fibroblasts to the collagen surface, the mean pore size (which affects ligand density) and the degradation rate (which affects the duration of the wound contraction-blocking activity by the scaffold). Processing variables that affect these determinants include the kinetics of swelling of collagen fibres in acetic acid, freezing of the collagen-GAG suspension and cross-linking of the freeze-dried scaffold. Recent developments in the processing of CGSs include fabrication of scaffolds that are paucidisperse in pore size, scaffolds with gradients in physicochemical properties (and therefore biological activity) and scaffolds that incorporate a mineral component. Advances in the characterization of the pore structure of CGSs have been made using confocal and nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM). The mechanical behaviour of CGSs, as well as the resistance to degradative enzymes, have been studied. Following seeding with cells (typically fibroblasts), contractile forces in the range 26-450 nN per cell are generated by the cells, leading to buckling of scaffold struts. Ongoing studies of cell-seeded CGSs with NLOM have shown an advantage over the use of confocal microscopy due to the ability of the former method to image the CGS surfaces without staining (which alters its surface ligands), reduced cell photodamage, reduced fluorophore photobleaching and the ability to image deeper inside the scaffold.",M2
20231458,"Dally-like core protein and its mammalian homologues mediate stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Hedgehog signal response.The distribution and activities of morphogenic signaling proteins such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Wingless (Wg) depend on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs consist of a core protein with covalently attached heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) chains. We report that the unmodified core protein of Dally-like (Dlp), an HSPG required for cell-autonomous Hh response in Drosophila embryos, alone suffices to rescue embryonic Hh signaling defects. Membrane tethering but not specifically the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage characteristic of glypicans is critical for this cell-autonomous activity. Our studies further suggest divergence of the two Drosophila and six mammalian glypicans into two functional families, an activating family that rescues cell-autonomous Dlp function in Hh response and a family that inhibits Hh response. Thus, in addition to the previously established requirement for HSPG GAG chains in Hh movement, these findings demonstrate a positive cell-autonomous role for a core protein in morphogen response in vivo and suggest the conservation of a network of antagonistic glypican activities in the regulation of Hh response.",M2
20217136,"Interleukin-1alpha treatment of meniscal explants stimulates the production and release of aggrecanase-generated, <e>GAG</e>-substituted aggrecan products and also the release of pre-formed, aggrecanase-generated G1 and m-calpain-generated G1-G2.Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce meniscal matrix degradation and inhibition of endogenous repair mechanisms, but the pathogenic mechanisms behind this are mostly unknown. Therefore, we investigated details of interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha)-induced aggrecan turnover in mature meniscal tissue explants. Fibro-cartilagenous disks (3 mm diameter x 1 mm thickness) were isolated from the central, weight-bearing region of menisci from 2-year-old cattle. After 3 or 6 days of IL-1alpha-treatment, GAG loss (DMMB assay), biosynthetic activity ([(35)SO(4)]-sulfate and [(3)H]-proline incorporation), gene expression (quantitative RT-PCR) and the abundance (zymography, Western blot) of matrix-degrading enzymes and specific aggrecan products were determined. Meniscal fibrocartilage had a 4-fold lower GAG content (per wet weight) than adjacent articular cartilage, and expressed MMPs-1, -2, -3 and ADAMTS4 constitutively, whereas ADAMTS5 m-RNA was essentially undetectable. Significant IL-1 effects were a decrease in biosynthetic activity, an increase in GAG release and in the expression/abundance of MMP-2, MMP-3 and ADAMTS4. Fresh tissue contained aggrecan core protein products similar to those previously described for bovine articular cartilage of this age. IL-1 induced the release of aggrecanase-generated CS-substituted products including both high (&gt;250 kDa) and low molecular weight (about 75 kDa) species. TIMP-3 (but not TIMP-1 and -2 or a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor) inhibited IL-1-dependent GAG loss. In addition, IL-1 induced the release of preformed pools of three known G1-bearing products. We conclude that aggrecanases are responsible for IL-1-stimulated GAG release from meniscal explants, and that IL-1 also stimulates release of G1-bearing products, by a process possibly involving hyaluronan fragmentation.",M2
20200157,"NMR analysis of the structure, dynamics, and unique oligomerization properties of the chemokine CCL27.Chemokines have two essential interactions in vivo, with G protein-coupled receptors, which activate intracellular signaling pathways, and with glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>), which are involved in cell surface localization and transport. Although it has been shown that chemokines bind and activate their respective G protein-coupled receptors as monomers, many chemokines oligomerize upon GAG binding, and the ability to oligomerize and bind GAGs is required for in vivo function. In this study, we investigated the structure, dynamics, and oligomerization behavior of cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK, also known as CCL27) by NMR. (15)N relaxation and translational self-diffusion rates indicate that CCL27 oligomerizes, but in contrast to many other chemokines that form relatively discrete oligomers, CCL27 transitions between monomer, dimer, and tetramer species over a relatively narrow concentration range. A three-dimensional structure determination was pursued under conditions where CCL27 is primarily dimeric, revealing the standard motif for a chemokine monomer. Analysis of chemical shift perturbations of (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra, relaxation-dispersion experiments, and filtered nuclear Overhauser effects suggest that CCL27 does not adopt a discrete CXC or CC dimer motif. Instead, CCL27 has uncommon oligomerization behavior, where several equilibria involving relatively low affinity interactions between different interfaces seem to be simultaneously at work. However, interaction with heparin avidly promotes oligomerization under conditions where CCL27 is monomeric by itself. We hypothesize that the plasticity in the oligomerization state may enable CCL27 to adopt different oligomeric structures, depending on the nature of the GAG binding partner, thereby providing a mechanism for increased diversity and specificity in GAG-binding and GAG-related functions.",M2
20186668,"The composition of hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering can influence glycosaminoglycan profile.The injectable and hydrophilic nature of hydrogels makes them suitable candidates for cartilage tissue engineering. To date, a wide range of hydrogels have been proposed for articular cartilage regeneration but few studies have quantitatively compared chondrocyte behaviour and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis within the hydrogels. Herein we have examined the nature of ECM synthesis by chondrocytes seeded into four hydrogels formed by either temperature change, self-assembly or chemical cross-linking. Bovine articular cartilage chondrocytes were cultured for 14 days in Extracel, Pluronic F127 blended with Type II collagen, Puramatrix and Matrixhyal. The discriminatory and sensitive technique of fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) was used to determine the fine detail of the glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>); hyaluronan and chondroitin sulphate. FACE analysis for chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronan profiles in Puramatrix closely matched that of native cartilage. For each hydrogel, DNA content, viability and morphology were assessed. Total collagen and total sulphated GAG production were measured and normalised to DNA content. Significant differences were found in total collagen synthesis. By day 14, Extracel and Puramatrix had significantly more total collagen than Matrixhyal (1.77+/-0.26 microg and 1.97+/-0.26 microg vs. 0.60+/-0.26 microg; p&lt;0.05). sGAG synthesis occurred in all hydrogels but a significantly higher amount of sGAG was retained within Extracel at days 7 and 14 (p&lt;0.05). In summary, we have shown that the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of each hydrogel directly or indirectly influenced ECM formation. A detailed understanding of the ECM in the development of engineered constructs is an important step in monitoring the success of cartilage regeneration strategies.",M2
20171639,"The region-dependent biphasic viscoelastic properties of human temporomandibular joint discs under confined compression.The objective of this study was to determine the biphasic viscoelastic properties of human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs, correlate these properties with disc biochemical composition, and examine the relationship between these properties and disc dynamic behavior in confined compression. The equilibrium aggregate modulus (H(A)), hydraulic permeability (k), and dynamic modulus were examined between five disc regions. Biochemical assays were conducted to quantify the amount of water, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content in each region. The creep tests showed that the average equilibrium moduli of the intermediate, lateral, and medial regions were significantly higher than for the anterior and posterior regions (69.75+/-11.47kPa compared to 22.0+/-5.15kPa). Permeability showed the inverse trend with the largest values in the anterior and posterior regions (8.51+/-1.36x10(-15)m(4)/Ns compared with 3.75+/-0.72x10(-15)m(4)/Ns). Discs were 74.5% water by wet weight, 62% collagen, and 3.2% GAG by dry weight. Regional variations were only observed for water content which likely results in the regional variation in biphasic mechanical properties. The dynamic modulus of samples during confined compression is related to the aggregate modulus and hydraulic permeability of the tissue. The anterior and posterior regions displayed lower complex moduli over all frequencies (0.01-3Hz) with average moduli of 171.8-609.3kPa compared with 454.6-1613.0kPa for the 3 central regions. The region of the TMJ disc with higher aggregate modulus and lower permeability had higher dynamic modulus. Our results suggested that fluid pressurization plays a significant role in the load support of the TMJ disc under dynamic loading conditions.",M2
20155726,"Glycosaminoglycan treatment in glomerulonephritis? An interesting option to investigate.Patients with primary and secondary chronic glomerular diseases are at significant risk for progression to end-stage renal disease. Unfortunately the treatment armamentarium is relatively limited in terms both of available agents and of specificity. Experimental evidence supports the idea that heparin-derived agents and glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) favorably affect primary and secondary renal diseases. While a number of clinical exploratory studies have addressed the effect of these agents in microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric diabetic patients, very few have investigated their activity in nondiabetic renal conditions. This paper will review the experimental and clinical evidence on the use of GAGs in renal disease other than diabetic nephropathy, following the reports of experimental findings supporting their use and the possible mechanisms involved: anticoagulant and antiproliferative activity, effect on growth factors (PDGF, FGF2 and TGF-beta1), inhibition of heparanase, macrophage renal infiltration and of the renin-angiotensin system, and decrease in proteinuria. Targeting these pathogenic loops with GAG treatment might be revealed to be very rewarding from a clinical point of view. Prospective randomized controlled trials with large case populations and definite entry criteria are clearly indicated.",M2
20143537,"[The levels of cortisol and glycosaminoglycans in patients with uveitis in rheumatic diseases]The serum levels of cortisol and glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) were studied in patients with uveitis in rheumatic diseases (RD). Among the patients with this pathology, there was a more preponderance of persons with low cortisol levels. In acute uvitis in the presence of RD, the mean serum content of this hormone was significantly lower than that in infectious and idiopathic uveitis. In RD, uveitis ran well with positive changes in the serum levels of cortisol, which increased during treatment. Its poor course was observed when the low content of cortisol remained or decreased still further. GAG exchange in uveitis patients with RD changed: there was an inverse correlation between the level of hyaluronic acid and that of cortisol (r = -0.7994; p = 0.031); the same correlation was found in males between the concentration of summary GAG and that of cortisol (r = -9832; p = 0.003) and chondroitin sulfate (r = -9965; p = 0.001).",M2
20136838,"Genistein reduces glycosaminoglycan levels in a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type II.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a deficit of specific lysosomal enzymes catalysing glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) degradation. The typical pathology involves most of the organ systems, including the brain, in its severe forms. The soy isoflavone genistein has recently attracted considerable attention as it can reduce GAG synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, genistein is able to cross the blood-brain barrier in the rat. The present study was undertaken to assess the ability of genistein to reduce urinary and tissue GAG levels in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used mice with genetic deletion of iduronate-2-sulphatase (one of the GAG catabolizing enzymes) which provide a model of MPS type II. Two doses of genistein, 5 or 25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), were given, in the diet for 10 or 20 weeks. Urinary and tissue GAG content was evaluated by biochemical and histochemical procedures. KEY RESULTS: Urinary GAG levels were reduced after 10 weeks' treatment with genistein at either 5 or 25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1). In tissue samples from liver, spleen, kidney and heart, a reduction in GAG content was observed with both dosages, after 10 weeks' treatment. Decreased GAG deposits in brain were observed after genistein treatment in some animals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There was decreased GAG storage in the MPSII mouse model following genistein administration. Our results would support the use of this plant-derived isoflavone in a combined therapeutic protocol for treatment of MPS.",M2
20124102,"Kinetics of chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions control neutrophil migration into the airspaces of the lungs.Chemokine-glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) interactions are thought to result in the formation of tissue-bound chemokine gradients. We hypothesized that the binding of chemokines to GAGs would increase neutrophil migration toward CXC chemokines instilled into lungs of mice. To test this hypothesis we compared neutrophil migration toward recombinant human CXCL8 (rhCXCL8) and two mutant forms of CXCL8, which do not bind to heparin immobilized on a sensor chip. Unexpectedly, when instilled into the lungs of mice the CXCL8 mutants recruited more neutrophils than rhCXCL8. The CXCL8 mutants appeared in plasma at significantly higher concentrations and diffused more rapidly across an extracellular matrix in vitro. A comparison of the murine CXC chemokines, KC and MIP-2, revealed that KC was more effective in recruiting neutrophils into the lungs than MIP-2. KC appeared in plasma at significantly higher concentrations and diffused more rapidly across an extracellular matrix in vitro than MIP-2. In kinetic binding studies, KC, MIP-2, and rhCXCL8 bound heparin differently, with KC associating and dissociating more rapidly from immobilized heparin than the other chemokines. These data suggest that the kinetics of chemokine-GAG interactions contributes to chemokine function in tissues. In the lungs, it appears that chemokines, such as CXCL8 or MIP-2, which associate and disassociate slowly from GAGs, form gradients relatively slowly compared with chemokines that either bind GAGs poorly or interact with rapid kinetics. Thus, different types of chemokine gradients may form during an inflammatory response. This suggests a new model, whereby GAGs control the spatiotemporal formation of chemokine gradients and neutrophil migration in tissue.",M2
20109313,"Growth of human septal chondrocytes in fibrin scaffolds.BACKGROUND: Tissue engineering of nasal septal cartilage has been the focus of research owing to its superior structural rigidity and ease of harvest. In vitro constructs formed from septal chondrocytes using fibrin glue within a polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffold have been shown to be viable, but their cellular growth and expression of differentiated features still have not been quantified. In this study, we evaluated cellular proliferation and production of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) components in fibrin glue preparations within a PGA scaffold. METHODS: Human chondrocytes were expanded for one passage in monolayer in culture medium. The cells were then grown in (1) fibrinogen, (1/2)x-thrombin, (1/2)x (F/2:T/2); (2) fibrinogen, 1/10x-thrombin, 1/10x (F/10:T/10); (3) fibrinogen, 1x-thrombin, 1/100x (F/1:T/100). RESULTS: Cellular proliferation and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) production per cell were highest in the F/2:T/2 preparations. Greater proliferation was seen in chondrocyte-fibrin composites seeded onto the PGA scaffold when compared with chondrocytes seeded onto the PGA scaffold alone. No significant difference in GAG production was seen. CONCLUSION: The addition of fibrin glue to chondrocytes seeded onto a PGA scaffold results in increased cellular proliferation while maintaining production of ECM components. Long-term stable fibrin gels in combination with PGA scaffolds may facilitate generation of cartilaginous tissue for use in reconstructive surgery.",M2
20108346,"Comparison of differential biomarkers of osteoarthritis with and without posttraumatic injury in the Hartley guinea pig model.The objective was to compare biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism in synovial fluid from Hartley guinea pig knees, with and without anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), to establish whether detectable differences in biomarker levels exist between primary and secondary osteoarthritis (OA). Synovial fluid lavages and knees were obtained from 3-month (control group) and 12-month (primary OA group) animals. Another group of animals (posttraumatic OA group) underwent unilateral ACLT at 3 months, and samples were obtained 9 months postsurgery. Synovial fluid concentrations of stromal cell-derived-factor (SDF-1), collagen fragments (C2C), proteoglycan (<e>GAG</e>), lubricin, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), and Interleukin-1 (IL-1beta) were evaluated. Cartilage damage was assessed via histology. The highest concentrations of C2C and SDF-1 in synovial fluid were found in the posttraumatic OA group, moderate concentrations were found in the primary OA group, and low concentrations in the control group. GAG release in synovial fluid was similar to C2C and SDF-1. The lubricin concentrations were significantly lower in ACLT joints than either the control or 12-month primary OA groups, but not between the control and primary OA groups. Higher levels of MMP-13 and IL-1beta were detected in the joints of the posttraumatic OA group as compared to the control or primary OA groups. Histology revealed greatest OA damage in the posttraumatic OA group, followed by moderate and minimal damage in primary OA and control groups, respectively. This study indicates that the biomarkers and progression of OA may differ in the Hartley guinea pig models with and without posttraumatic OA.",M2
20085843,"Encircling the tendon repair site with collagen-<e>GAG</e> reduces the formation of postoperative tendon adhesions in a chicken flexor tendon model.BACKGROUND: Tendon healing is a complex and coordinated event involving the activation of extrinsic mechanisms as in classic reparative skin wound healing as well as intrinsic mechanisms characteristic of regenerative wound healing. Despite improvements in surgical and rehabilitative techniques, tendon adhesions remain the most frequent cause of disability following tendon surgery. In this animal model, we evaluated the use of a clinically available, biocompatible collagen- glycosaminoglycan (GAG) material as an adjunct to surgical tendon repair. METHODS: Thirty-two white leghorn chickens underwent surgical tendon repair of their left second and fourth digits. Digits were randomized to study and control groups. In both groups, the long flexor tendon was divided and repaired using a modified Kessler's repair. In the study group, collagen-GAG membrane was wrapped around the repair site. Animals were immobilized with a plaster cast and sacrificed at 3 wk. Sixteen animals had their tendon repair sites histologically assessed and graded for healing and adhesion formation. Eight animals had their tendon repairs assessed for quantification of the work associated with flexion, employing a specifically designed biomechanical apparatus. Eight animals had their repair sites tested for bursting strength. RESULTS: Control (untreated) tendons showed fibrous tissue surrounding the repair sites with approximately 50% of the circumference of the repair site adherent to surrounding tissue elements. The mean histologic grades for control and study group were 3.1+/-0.2 and 1.9+/-0.2, respectively. The difference between mean grades for control and study group samples was statistically significant (paired t-test: P&lt;0.01). The work of flexion (WOF) for flexion cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the control group was 0.58, 0.55, 0.46, and 0.44N/mm, respectively. The study (collagen-GAG wrapped) group had WOF values 0.16, 0.14, 0.10, 0.09N/mm, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (paired t-test, P&lt;0.01). The mean bursting strength of repaired tendons for control and study groups were 14.3+/-1.87N and 11.5+/-1.85N, respectively. There was no significant difference in bursting strength between the groups (paired t-test, P=0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Collagen-GAG reduces formation of early postoperative tendon adhesions in this chicken flexor tendon repair model. Collagen-GAG wrapped tendons healed with minimal peritendinous adhesion formation and required less effort for flexion. The investing collagen-GAG membrane did not appear to interfere with either the quality or strength of healing.",M2
20042606,"Platelet-derived growth factor differentially regulates the expression and post-translational modification of versican by arterial smooth muscle cells through distinct protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways.The synthesis of proteoglycans involves steps that regulate both protein and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) synthesis, but it is unclear whether these two pathways are regulated by the same or different signaling pathways. We therefore investigated signaling pathways involved in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated increases in versican core protein and GAG chain synthesis in arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). PDGF treatment of ASMCs resulted in increased versican core protein synthesis and elongation of GAG chains attached to the versican core protein. The effects of PDGF on versican mRNA were blocked by inhibiting either protein kinase C (PKC) or the ERK pathways, whereas the GAG elongation effect of PDGF was blocked by PKC inhibition but not by ERK inhibition. Interestingly, blocking protein synthesis in the presence of cycloheximide abolished the PDGF effect, but not in the presence of xyloside, indicating that GAG synthesis that results from PKC activation is independent from de novo protein synthesis. PDGF also stimulated an increase in the chondroitin-6-sulfate to chondroitin-4-sulfate ratio of GAG chains on versican, and this effect was blocked by PKC inhibitors. These data show that PKC activation is sufficient to cause GAG chain elongation, but both PKC and ERK activation are required for versican mRNA core protein expression. These results indicate that different signaling pathways control different aspects of PDGF-stimulated versican biosynthesis by ASMCs. These data will be useful in designing strategies to interfere with the synthesis of this proteoglycan in various disease states.",M2
20034665,"In vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage grafts based on adult human stem cells and 3D-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds.Three-dimensionally woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro. The specific objectives were to: (i) produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage-like mechanical properties, (ii) demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21 days of culture on PCL scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 21-day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically (p&lt;0.05). Construct DNA, total collagen, and glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher collagen content (p&lt;0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls. Chondrogenic additives yielded constructs with higher GAG (p&lt;0.05) and earlier expression of collagen II mRNA if serum was not present in medium. These results show feasibility of functional cartilage tissue engineering from hMSC and 3D-woven PCL scaffolds.",M2
20010383,"Lidocaine cytotoxicity to the zygapophysial joints in rabbits: changes in cell viability and proteoglycan metabolism in vitro.STUDY DESIGN.: To examine whether lidocaine cytotoxicity to chondrocytes has been implicated in the development of osteoarthritis of the zygapophysial joints. OBJECTIVE.: This study was performed to determine the effects of varying concentrations and exposure times of lidocaine on the viability and proteoglycan metabolism of rabbit zygapophysial chondrocytes in vitro. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Zygapophysial joint injections are commonly administered with lidocaine for chronic spinal pain in orthopedic treatment. A lot of studies on the effect of zygapophysial joint injections are clinical, but many questions on the effect of lidocaine to zygapophysial chondrocytes remain unanswered. METHODS.: Cartilage was obtained from zygapophysial joints of adult rabbits. Chondrocytes in alginate beads were cultured in medium containing 6% fetal calf serum at 370 mOsmol at cell densities of 4 million cells/mL. They were then cultured for 24 hours under 21% oxygen with 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% lidocaine, and without lidocaine as control. The cell viability profile across intact beads was determined by manual counting using fluorescent probes (LIVE/DEAD assay) and transmission electron microscopy. Lactate production was measured enzymatically as a marker of energy metabolism. Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) accumulation was measured using a modified dimethylmethylene blue assay. RESULTS.: Cell viability decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the concentration range of 0.125% to 1.0% lidocaine under the confocal microscope. Under the electron microscope, apoptosis increased as the concentration of lidocaine increased. GAG accumulation/tissue volume decreases as the concentration of lidocaine increased. However, GAG produced per million cells and the rate of lactate production per live cell was significantly higher for cells cultured at 0.5% and 1% lidocaine than the control group. CONCLUSION.: While these in vitro results cannot be directly extrapolated to the clinical setting, this data suggestcaution in prolonged exposure of zygapophysial cartilage to high concentration lidocaine.",M2
20004976,"A novel CXCL8 protein-based antagonist in acute experimental renal allograft damage.Acute renal allograft damage is caused by early leukocyte infiltration which is mediated in part by chemokines presented by glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) structures on endothelial surfaces. CXCL8 can recruit neutrophils and induce the firm arrest of monocytes on activated endothelial cells. A human CXCL8-based antagonist (dnCXCL8) designed to generate a dominant-negative mutant protein with enhanced binding to GAG structures and reduced CXCR1/2 receptor binding ability was tested in models of early allograft injury. The agent displayed enhanced binding to GAG structures in vitro and could antagonize CXCL8-induced firm adhesion of monocytes as well as neutrophils to activated microvascular endothelium in physiologic flow assays. In a rat model of acute renal damage, dnCXCL8 treatment limited proximal tubular damage and reduced granulocyte infiltration. In a Fischer 344 (RT1(lvl)) to Lewis (RT1(l)) rat acute renal allograft model, dnCXCL8 was found to reduce monocyte and CD8+ T-cell infiltration into glomeruli and to limit tubular interstitial inflammation and tubulitis in vivo. Early treatment of allografts with agents like dnCXCL8 may help reduce acute allograft damage and preserve renal morphology and thereby help limit chronic dysfunction.",M2
19966464,"Complex formation of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glycosaminoglycans.Glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>), large anionic glycopolymers, are the glycan portion of proteoglycans and are important components of the extracellular matrix. Recently we reported that polysialic acid, a polyanionic glycopolymer specific to the brain, binds neurotrophic factors to form a large complex. It is not clear whether GAGs also bind neurotrophic factors to form a large complex. In the present study, we demonstrate that a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dimer directly binds GAGs other than chondroitin and hyaluronic acid to form a large complex. Neurotrophin-3 showed similar GAG binding properties. Furthermore, BDNF, after forming a large complex with GAG, bound to the BDNF receptors tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B and p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR). These findings suggest that GAGs function to produce a reservoir of BDNF and other neurotrophic factors, and may serve to regulate their local concentrations on the cell surface.",M2
19958052,"Low oxygen tension during incubation periods of chondrocyte expansion is sufficient to enhance postexpansion chondrogenesis.To determine whether low oxygen (O(2)) tension during expansion affects the matrix density, as well as quantity, of cartilage formed, and to determine whether application of low O(2) tension during incubation periods alone is sufficient to modulate chondrogenic expression, rabbit chondrocytes expanded at either 21% O(2) or 5% O(2) were analyzed for glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) and DNA content, total collagen, and gene expression during expansion and postexpansion aggregate cultures. When cultured as aggregates at 21% O(2), chondrocytes expanded at 5% O(2) produced cartilage aggregates that contained more total GAG, GAG per wet weight, GAG per DNA, and total collagen than chondrocytes expanded at 21% O(2). Less of an effect on GAG and collagen content was observed when aggregate culture was performed at 5% O(2). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of COL2A1 expression showed upregulated levels of type IIA (an early marker) and IIB (a late marker) during expansion and elevated levels of type IIB during aggregate culture in chondrocytes expanded in low O(2). The application of low O(2) tension during incubation periods of chondrocyte expansion enhances the ultimate cartilage matrix density and quantity, and this enhancement can be achieved through the use of an O(2) control incubator.",M2
19951286,"Therapy with nonglycosaminoglycan-binding mutant CCL7: a novel strategy to limit allograft inflammation.Chemokines are immobilized by binding to glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>). A non-GAG-binding mutant CCL7 (mtCCL7) was developed that retained its affinity for chemokine receptors. This mtCCL7 induced leukocyte chemotaxis in diffusion gradients but did not stimulate trans-endothelial migration (p&lt;0.01). Unlike wild-type CCL7, mtCCL7 persisted in the circulation of BALB/c mice for more than 6 h and prevented leukocyte infiltration of skin isografts (p&lt;0.05). Treatment with mtCCL7 marginally increased the survival of C57BL/6 to BALB/c skin allografts and reduced graft infiltration by CD3+ cells (p&lt;0.05). Importantly, mtCCL7 promoted long-term (&gt;40 day) graft survival following minor histocompatibility (HY) antigen mismatched C57BL/6 skin transplantation; control grafts were rejected by day 24. Treatment with mtCCL7 produced a significant decrease in the frequency of IFN-gamma producing donor-reactive splenic T cells, reduced CCR2 expression by circulating leukocytes for 6 h (p&lt;0.01) and blocked the normal increase in affinity of alpha4beta1 integrins for VCAM-1 following transient chemokine stimulation. These data suggest that mtCCL7 persists in the circulation and reduces both specific T-cell priming and the capacity of circulating immune cells to respond to GAG-bound chemokine at sites of developing inflammation.",M2
19951121,"Effects of sodium hyaluronate and triamcinolone acetonide on glucosaminoglycan metabolism in equine articular chondrocytes treated with interleukin-1.OBJECTIVE-To determine whether the effects of a high-molecular-weight sodium hyaluronate alone or in combination with triamcinolone acetonide can mitigate chondrocyte glyocosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) catabolism caused by interleukin (IL)-1 administration. SAMPLE POPULATION-Chondrocytes collected from metacarpophalangeal joints of 10 horses euthanized for reasons unrelated to joint disease. PROCEDURES-Chondrocyte pellets were treated with medium (negative control), medium containing IL-1 only (positive control), or medium containing IL-1 with hyaluronic acid only (0.5 or 2.0 mg/mL), triamcinolone acetonide only (0.06 or 0.6 mg/mL), or hyaluronic acid (0.5 or 2.0 mg/mL) and triamcinolone acetonide (0.06 or 0.6 mg/mL) in combination. Chondrocyte pellets were assayed for newly synthesized GAG, total GAG content, total DNA content, and mRNA for collagen type II, aggrecan, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. RESULTS-High-concentration hyaluronic acid increased GAG synthesis, whereas high-concentration triamcinolone acetonide decreased loss of GAG into the medium. High concentrations of hyaluronic acid and triamcinolone acetonide increased total GAG content. There was no change in DNA content with either treatment. Triamcinolone acetonide reduced COX-2 mRNA as well as aggrecan and collagen type II expression. Treatment with hyaluronic acid had no effect on mRNA for COX-2, aggrecan, or collagen type II. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results indicated that high concentrations of hyaluronic acid or triamcinolone acetonide alone or in combination mitigated effects of IL-1 administration on GAG catabolism of equine chondrocytes.",M2
19944077,"Differences in gene expression of human xylosyltransferases and determination of acceptor specificities for various proteoglycans.The xylosyltransferase (XT) isoforms XT-I and XT-II initiate the posttranslational glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) synthesis. Here, we determined the relative expression of both isoforms in 33 human cell lines. The majority of tested cell lines showed dominant XYLT2 gene expression, while only in 23132/87, JAR, NCI-H510A and THP-1 was the XT-I mRNA expression higher. Nearly equal expression levels were detected in six cell lines. Additionally, to shed light on putative differences in acceptor specificities the acceptor properties of potential acceptor sequences were determined. Peptides were expressed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing putative or known GAG attachment sites of in vivo proteoglycans. Kinetic analysis showed that K(m) and V(max) values for XT-I mediated xylosylation were slightly higher than those for XT-II, and that XT-I showed a lesser stringency concerning the acceptor sequence. Mutagenesis of the bikunin peptide sequence in the G-S-G attachment site and flanking regions generated potential acceptor molecules. Here, mutations on the N-terminal side and the attachment site were found to be more susceptible to a loss of acceptor function than mutations in the C-terminus. Altogether the known consensus sequence a-a-a-a-G-S-G-a-a/G-a ('a' representing Asp or Glu) for XT-I mediated xylosylation could be approved and additionally extended to apply to XT-II as well.",M2
19940357,"The development of a bioreactor to perfuse radially-confined hydrogel constructs: design and characterization of mass transport properties.Limitations to nutrient transport provide a challenge to the development of 3D tissue-engineered constructs. A heterogeneous distribution of viable cells and functional matrix within the developing tissue is a common consequence. In the present study, a bioreactor was developed to perfuse fluid through cylindrical agarose constructs. The transport and distribution of dextran molecules (FD-4, FD-500, FD-2000) within the agarose was visualized in order to determine the bioreactors effectiveness for transport enhancement. By 24 h, the perfusion bioreactor achieved 529%, 395% and 294% higher concentrations of FD-4, FD-500 and FD-2000, respectively, than those solely due to diffusion. Of particular interest was the effectiveness of the bioreactor to transport molecules to the central region of the constructs. In this respect, the perfusion bioreactor was found to increase transportation of FD-4, FD-500 and FD-2000 by 30%, 291% and 222% over that of diffusion. Articular chondrocytes were cultured and perfused using the bioreactor. The improved molecular transport achieved led to an average 75% and 1340% increase of DNA and sulphated <e>GAG</e>, respectively at 20 days. More significantly was the 106% and 1603% increase of DNA and GAG, respectively, achieved at the central core of the 3D constructs.",M2
19919557,"Activation of cathepsin D by glycosaminoglycans.We have previously shown that heparin can increase the activity of the proenzyme form of Alzheimer's beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Cathepsin D (CD) is a member of the aspartic protease family and has sequence similarity to BACE1. Therefore, we examined whether heparin and other glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) can influence the activity of CD. Heparin and other GAGs were found to stimulate the activity of recombinant proCD. Desulfation of heparin almost abolished the stimulation, indicating that sulfate groups were important for the stimulatory effect. In addition, the stimulation was dependent on the length of the GAG chain, as larger GAGs were more potent in their ability to stimulate proCD than shorter fragments. In the presence of heparin, limited autocatalytic proteolysis of the proenzyme was increased, suggesting that heparin increases the activity of proCD by accelerating the conversion of proCD, which has little activity, to pseudoCD, an active form lacking residues 1-26 of the prodomain. Furthermore, the activity of spleen-derived mature CD, which lacks the entire 44 amino acid residue prodomain, was also increased by heparin, indicating that the catalytic domain of CD contains at least one region to which GAGs bind and stimulate enzyme activity. Because heparin also stimulated the activity of pseudoCD, proenzyme activation was probably accelerated by the interaction of heparin with the catalytic domain of pseudoCD. However, it is possible that heparin may also activate the proenzyme directly. On the basis of this study, we propose that GAGs may regulate CD activity in vivo.",M2
19918911,"Altered lumbar spine structure, biochemistry, and biomechanical properties in a canine model of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII.Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency in beta-glucuronidase activity, leading to systemic accumulation of poorly degraded glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>). Along with other morbidities, MPS VII is associated with pediatric spinal deformity. The objective of this study was to examine potential associations between abnormal lumbar spine matrix structure and composition in MPS VII, and spine segment and tissue-level mechanical properties, using a naturally occurring canine model with a similar clinical phenotype to the human form of the disorder. Segments from juvenile MPS VII and unaffected dogs were allocated to: radiography, gross morphology, histology, biochemistry, and mechanical testing. MPS VII spines had radiolucent lesions in the vertebral body epiphyses. Histologically, this corresponded to a GAG-rich cartilaginous region in place of bone and elevated GAG staining was seen in the annulus fibrosus. Biochemically, MPS VII samples had elevated GAG in the outer annulus fibrosus and epiphyses, low calcium in the epiphyses, and high water content in all regions except the nucleus pulposus. MPS VII spine segments had higher range of motion and lower stiffness than controls. Endplate indentation stiffness and failure loads were significantly lower in MPS VII samples, while annulus fibrosus tensile mechanical properties were normal. Vertebral body lesions in MPS VII spines suggest a failure to convert cartilage to bone during development. Low stiffness in these regions likely contributes to mechanical weakness in motion segments and is a potential factor in the progression of spinal deformity.",M2
19912578,"Glycosaminoglycan chains affect exocytic and endocytic protein traffic.Protein glycosylation such as N- and O-linked glycans as well as glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) have been shown to contribute to polarized sorting in epithelial cells. Here, we analyzed the effect of GAGs more generally on protein traffic also in non-polarized cells. Using short sequence tags of 10-17 amino acids encoding known GAG attachment sites, we have converted the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, which constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and endosomes, into a proteoglycan. Expressed in HeLa cells, the receptor was almost completely modified with a chondroitin sulfate chain and could be efficiently labeled by [35S]sulfation. GAG attachment altered the steady-state distribution of the receptor by inhibiting endocytosis, while recycling was not affected. The reduced internalization is not the result of immobilization by interaction with the extracellular matrix, because fluorescence recovery after photobleaching did not detect an increased immobile fraction nor even a significant change in mobility. GAG chains furthermore accelerated Golgi-to-cell surface transport of H1. The same acceleration of export was also observed for a GAG-tagged version of the secretory protein alpha1-protease inhibitor, suggesting that this effect acts generally on proteoglycans, possibly by directing them into distinct carriers. Our results show novel roles of GAGs in protein sorting also in non-polarized cells.",M2

The structure of GAG complexes with proteins can reveal details of their mechanisms of action in living systems and help to design new pharmaceuticals. Molecular modelling together with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) provide indispensable information on structure and dynamics of GAGs and their complexes. The present review focuses on applications of high-resolution NMR, CD and molecular modelling to the analysis of GAGs. The most advanced theoretical methods used at present in GAG research, density functional theory methods (DFT), are also discussed.",M2
19899445,"In vitro response of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells seeded in a type-I collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold for skin wound repair under the mechanical loading condition.In order to achieve successful wound repair by regenerative tissue engineering using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), it is important to understand the response of stem cells in the scaffold matrix to mechanical stress. To investigate the clinical effects of mechanical stress on the behavior of cells in scaffolds, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were grown on a type-I collagen-glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) scaffold matrix for one week under cyclic stretching loading conditions. The porous collagen-GAG scaffold matrix for skin wound repair was prepared, the harvested canine MSCs were seeded on the scaffold, and cultured under three kinds of cyclic stretching loading conditions (0%: control, 5% strain, 15% strain). After 7 days incubation, MSCs were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically regarding the proliferation and differentiation. Cultured MSCs in the high strain (15% strain) group showed active alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and poor differentiation into type-I collagen-positive cells, whereas enhanced differentiation into type-I collagen positive cells and a lack of alpha-SMA expression where shown in the lower stress (5% strain) group. These results suggest that mechanical stress may affect the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, and subsequently the wound healing process, through attachment interactions between the stem cells and scaffold matrix. Our findings provide an additional consideration for clinical treatment of wound repair using regenerative tissue engineering.",M2

19861178,"Effect of chitosan scaffold microstructure on mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis.Although numerous biomaterials have been investigated as scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering, the effect of their microstructure on final construct characteristics remains unclear. The biocompatibility of chitosan and its similarity with glycosaminoglycans make it attractive as a scaffold for cartilage engineering. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of chitosan scaffold structure on mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and chondrogenesis. Chitosan fibrous scaffolds and chitosan sponges were seeded with mesenchymal stem cells in a chondrogenic medium. Constructs were analyzed 72 h after seeding via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), weight measurements and DNA quantification. Constructs were cultured for 10 or 21 days prior to confocal microscopy, SEM, histology, quantitative analysis (weight, DNA and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>)), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Mesenchymal stem cells maintained a viability above 90% on all chitosan scaffolds. The cell numbers in the constructs were similar at 72 h, 10 days and 21 days. However, matrix production was improved in chitosan fibrous constructs based on the GAG quantification and collagen II mRNA expression. Chondrogenesis on chitosan scaffolds is superior on microfibers compared to macroporous sponges.",M2
19853561,"The core protein of glypican Dally-like determines its biphasic activity in wingless morphogen signaling.Dally-like (Dlp) is a glypican-type heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), containing a protein core and attached glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) chains. In Drosophila wing discs, Dlp represses short-range Wingless (Wg) signaling, but activates long-range Wg signaling. Here, we show that Dlp core protein has similar biphasic activity as wild-type Dlp. Dlp core protein can interact with Wg; the GAG chains enhance this interaction. Importantly, we find that Dlp exhibits a biphasic response, regardless of whether its glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage to the membrane can be cleaved. Rather, the transition from signaling activator to repressor is determined by the relative expression levels of Dlp and the Wg receptor, Frizzled (Fz) 2. Based on these data, we propose that the principal function of Dlp is to retain Wg on the cell surface. As such, it can either compete with the receptor or provide ligands to the receptor, depending on the ratios of Wg, Fz2, and Dlp.",M2
19845002,"A validated model of <e>GAG</e> deposition, cell distribution, and growth of tissue engineered cartilage cultured in a rotating bioreactor.In this work a new phenomenological model of growth of cartilage tissue cultured in a rotating bioreactor is developed. It represents an advancement of a previously derived model of deposition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in engineered cartilage by (i) introduction of physiological mechanisms of proteoglycan accumulation in the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as by correlating (ii) local cell densities and (iii) tissue growth to the ECM composition. In particular, previously established predictions and correlations of local oxygen concentrations and GAG synthesis rates are extended to distinguish cell secreted proteoglycan monomers free to diffuse in cell surroundings and outside from the engineered construct, from large aggrecan molecules, which are constrained within the ECM and practically immovable. The model includes kinetics of aggregation, that is, transformation of mobile GAG species into immobile aggregates as well as maintenance of the normal ECM composition after the physiological GAG concentration is reached by incorporation of a product inhibition term. The model also includes mechanisms of the temporal evolution of cell density distributions and tissue growth under in vitro conditions. After a short initial proliferation phase the total cell number in the construct remains constant, but the local cell distribution is leveled out by GAG accumulation and repulsion due to negative molecular charges. Furthermore, strong repulsive forces result in expansion of the local tissue elements observed macroscopically as tissue growth (i.e., construct enlargement). The model is validated by comparison with experimental data of (i) GAG distribution and leakage, (ii) spatial-temporal distributions of cells, and (iii) tissue growth reported in previous works. Validation of the model predictive capability--against a selection of measured data that were not used to construct the model--suggests that the model successfully describes the interplay of several simultaneous processes carried out during in vitro cartilage tissue regeneration and indicates that this approach could also be attractive for application in other tissue engineering systems.",M2
19840848,"FAK mediates signal crosstalk between type II collagen and TGF-beta 1 cascades in chondrocytic cells.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of crosstalk between the type II collagen and TGF-beta1 signaling pathways in chondrocytic cells. Articular chondrocytes, isolated from porcine knee cartilage, and the SW1353 cell line were cultured on either type II collagen-coated or -uncoated plates in the presence or absence of TGF-beta1. Expression of pSMAD 2, pSMAD 3, pFAK(Y397) and pFAK(Y925) in articular chondrocytes and the SW1353 cell line was analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell proliferation rates and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content was determined after treatment with type II collagen or/and TGF-beta1. For inhibition study, human FAK-specific RNA small interference (siFAK) in SW1353 cell line was performed. In this study, expression of pSMAD 2, pSMAD 3, pFAK(Y397) and pFAK(Y925) were synergistically increased by co-treatment with type II collagen and TGF-beta1 in articular chondrocytes. The proliferation of porcine articular chondrocytes and GAG secretion in SW1353 cells were synergistically increased by co-stimulation with type II collagen and TGF-beta1. Synergistically increased expression and nuclear translocation of pSMAD 2 and pSMAD 3 and GAG secretion of SW1353 cells were significantly inhibited by siFAK transfection. Therefore, we suggest that FAK-SMAD 2/3 mediates signal crosstalk between type II collagen and TGF-beta1 and regulates GAG secretion in chondrocytic cells.",M2
19834953,"Optical coherence tomography grading correlates with MRI T2 mapping and extracellular matrix content.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and T2 mapping are emerging clinical imaging technologies with potential to detect subsurface changes in cartilage retaining a macroscopically intact articular surface. This study tests the hypothesis that OCT correlates with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 values, and that OCT signal is sensitive to cartilage matrix degeneration. Forty-five osteochondral cores were harvested from five human tibial plateau explants after MRI T2 mapping. Cores underwent OCT imaging and were graded as follows: A, obvious birefringence; B, no birefringence; C, subsurface voids and/or irregular surface. Extracellular matrix content was determined and cores underwent histologic and polarized light microscopy (PLM) evaluation. Grade B and C cores had 25% higher superficial T2 values (p = 0.047) and 50% higher deep T2 values (p = 0.012) than grade A cores. Grade B and C cores had 36% higher glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content compared to grade A cores (p = 0.009). Histology and PLM demonstrated increased surface irregularity and structural disorganization with increasing OCT grade. OCT grade and T2 value increased with increasing collagen disorganization, suggesting that MRI T2 mapping and OCT are sensitive to changes in collagen structure. Our results demonstrate the ability of OCT and T2 mapping to detect early cartilage degeneration in clinically normal appearing cartilage.",M2

19831472,"A nonlinear constituent based viscoelastic model for articular cartilage and analysis of tissue remodeling due to altered glycosaminoglycan-collagen interactions.A constituent based nonlinear viscoelastic (VE) model was modified from a previous study (Vena, et al., 2006,  A Constituent-Based Model for the Nonlinear Viscoelastic Behavior of Ligaments,  J. Biomech. Eng., 128, pp. 449-457) to incorporate a glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>)-collagen (COL) stress balance using compressible elastic stress constitutive equations specific to articular cartilage (AC). For uniaxial loading of a mixture of quasilinear VE constituents, time constant and relaxation ratio equations are derived to highlight how a mixture of constituents with distinct quasilinear VE properties is one mechanism that produces a nonlinear VE tissue. Uniaxial tension experiments were performed with newborn bovine AC specimens before and after approximately 55% and approximately 85% GAG depletion treatment with guanidine. Experimental tissue VE parameters were calculated directly from stress relaxation data, while intrinsic COL VE parameters were calculated by curve fitting the data with the nonlinear VE model with intrinsic GAG viscoelasticity neglected. Select tissue and intrinsic COL VE parameters were significantly different from control and experimental groups and correlated with GAG content, suggesting that GAG-COL interactions exist to modulate tissue and COL mechanical properties. Comparison of the results from this and other studies that subjected more mature AC tissue to GAG depletion treatment suggests that the GAGs interact with the COL network in a manner that may be beneficial for rapid volumetric expansion during developmental growth while protecting cells from excessive matrix strains. Furthermore, the underlying GAG-COL interactions appear to diminish as the tissue matures, indicating a distinctive remodeling response during developmental growth.",M2

Hypothyroidism in rats was induced by methylotiouracil treatment or by thyreoidectomy. The thyroid hormones [freeT3 (fT3), freeT4 (fT4)] and pituitary TSH were measured in plasma with radioimmunological method. The glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) and total collagen were measured in heart muscle of both left and right ventricles. Cells from the rat's heart were isolated and cultured. The cells were identified as myofibroblasts by electron microscopy method. The effects of TSH in concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 20 mIU/ml, on connective tissue accumulation in heart myofibroblasts cultures were tested. The primary hypothyroidism was developed both in groups with thyroidectomy and with methylthiouracil. The levels of fT3 and fT4 both in rats with thyreoidectomy and animals treated with methylthiouracil were decreased and TSH level in these two experimental groups was elevated. In the heart of the rats with experimental hypothyroidism increased content of both GAG and collagen was found. Myofibroblast number in culture was increased by TSH. Regardless of the method of its induction, hypothyroidism increased collagen and GAG contents in the heart. TSH is not involved in regulation of collagen and glycosaminoglycans accumulation in the heart of rats affected with primary hypothyroidism.",M2
19824406,"[Serum levels of glycosaminoglycans, hydroxyproline, and fibronectin in patients with spinal osteochondrosis]The content of the major components of the extracellular matrix was studied in 60 patients with spinal osteochondrosis over time during complex rehabilitative therapy including radon-containing mineral baths (before, 7-9 and 14-15 days after treatment). The complex rehabilitative treatment using radon baths in patients with spinal osteochondrosis was shown to result in a reduction in the serum level of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) and total oxyproline by the end of a course of therapy, which suggests the lower rate of destructive processes in the extracellular matrix. The determination of GAG concentrations and oxyproline forms in patients with asteochondrosis may be used to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment performed.",M2
19815108,"Contrast enhanced computed tomography can predict the glycosaminoglycan content and biomechanical properties of articular cartilage.OBJECTIVE: An early hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA) is the progressive loss of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>), the extracellular matrix (ECM) component of articular cartilage that confers it with compressive stiffness. Our aim in this work is to establish the feasibility of using Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) with an anionic iodinated contrast agent - Cysto Conray II - as a minimally invasive tool to measure the changes in the GAG content as well as the compressive stiffness of articular cartilage. METHODS: The GAG content of mated osteochondral plugs excised from bovine patello-femoral joints was progressively degraded using chondroitinase ABC. The mated plugs were then immersed in an anionic, tri-iodinated contrast agent, imaged using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), subjected to an unconfined compressive stress relaxation test and the GAG content measured using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay. Partial correlation analysis was performed to compare the variation in X-ray attenuation measured by pQCT to the variation in GAG content and in equilibrium compressive modulus. RESULTS: The X-ray attenuation of cartilage exposed to an anionic, tri-iodinated, contrast agent measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) accounted for 83% of the variation in GAG content (r(2)=0.83, P&lt;0.0001) and 93% of the variation in the equilibrium compressive modulus (r(2)=0.93, P&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSION: Using a mated osteochondral plug model to evaluate the biochemical composition and biomechanical properties of cartilage, this study demonstrates the interrelationships between X-ray attenuation, GAG content, and equilibrium compressive modulus, and that CECT can be used to monitor and quantify changes in the GAG content and biomechanical properties of articular cartilage.",M2
19813262,"Synoviocytes are more sensitive than cartilage to the effects of minocycline and doxycycline on IL-1alpha and MMP-13-induced catabolic gene responses.The objective of this study was to determine the primary articular tissue target of doxycycline and minocycline. Synoviocytes-cartilage cocultures (n = 4) were treated with MMP-13 (25 ng/mL medium) or IL-1 (1.0 ng/mL medium) for 24 h. Doxycycline (4.3, 0.43, 0.043 microM) or minocycline (10, 1.0 or 0.1 microM) were then added and cultures were continued for 96 h. Cartilage and media were analyzed for <e>GAG</e> content. Quantitative PCR was used to measure cartilage MMP-3, MMP-13, aggrecan, COL2A1, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 expression, and synoviocyte MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADMATS-5 expression. Total and active MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS 4/5 enzymes were measured in culture medium. All concentrations of doxycycline and minocycline diminished GAG accumulation in the media. All concentrations of minocycline, but only the highest concentration of doxycycline decreased MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression in synoviocytes but not cartilage, and basal ADAMTS-5 mRNA levels in both synoviocytes and cartilage. Only minocycline decreased active MMP-13 protein in synoviocytes. In summary, the protective effects of tetracycline compounds are more pronounced in synoviocytes than cartilage, and following minocycline compared to doxycycline. Studies to determine the molecular mechanism of action of the tetracyclines in synoviocytes might lead to the design of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of OA or RA.",M2
19807980,"Cartilage outgrowth in fibrin scaffolds.BACKGROUND: Fibrin glue has been a favorable hydrogel in cartilage tissue engineering, but implantation of chondrocyte-fibrin suspensions have resulted in volume loss. In this study, human septal cartilage chips were seeded onto a fibrin scaffold, and cellular proliferation and production of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) were evaluated. METHODS: Human septal cartilage was diced into cartilage chips and encased with and without fibrin glue. Four conditions were initially tested for DNA content and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) production: (1) control medium in tissue culture, (2) control medium with fibrin glue, (3) collagenase-supplemented medium in tissue culture, and (4) collagenase-supplemented medium seeded in fibrin glue. Cartilage chips cultured in collagenase-treated medium were then seeded onto either cell culture plates, suspended in alginate, or mixed with fibrin. Cellular proliferation, GAG production, and histochemistry were evaluated. RESULTS: Fibrin preparations increased cellular proliferation and DNA content. GAG levels were highest in collagenase-treated samples encased in fibrin. Cartilage chips treated with collagenase showed increased cellular proliferation in the fibrin preparations compared with preparations without fibrin. GAG increased with the addition of fibrin when compared with explant. Histochemistry revealed increased GAG accumulation in the regions between the cartilage chips with the addition of fibrin. CONCLUSION: Adding fibrin glue to collagenase-treated cartilage chips results in increased proliferation and maintains ECM production and, therefore, may facilitate generation of cartilaginous tissue for use in reconstructive surgery.",M2
19800448,"Alphav and beta1 integrins regulate dynamic compression-induced proteoglycan synthesis in 3D gel culture by distinct complementary pathways.OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to test the hypothesis that specific integrin receptors regulate chondrocyte biosynthetic response to dynamic compression at early times in 3D gel culture, during initial evolution of the pericellular matrix, but prior to significant accumulation of further-removed matrix. The study was motivated by increased use of dynamic loading, in vitro, for early stimulation of tissue engineered cartilage, and the need to understand the effects of loading, in vivo, at early times after implantation of constructs. METHODS: Bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded in 2% agarose gels (15x10(6)cells/mL) and incubated for 18 h with and without the presence of specific integrin blockers (small-molecule peptidomimetics, function-blocking antibodies, and RGD-containing disintegrins). Samples were then subjected to a 24-h dynamic compression regime found previously to stimulate chondrocyte biosynthesis in 3D gel as well as cartilage explant culture (1 Hz, 2.5% dynamic strain amplitude, 7% static offset strain). At the end of loading, proteoglycan (PG) synthesis ((35)S-sulfate incorporation), protein synthesis ((3)H-proline incorporation), DNA content (Hoechst dye 33258) and total glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content (dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB) dye binding) were assessed. RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, dynamic compression increased PG synthesis and total GAG accumulation compared to free-swelling controls. Blocking alphavbeta3 abolished this response, independent of effects on controls, while blocking beta1 abolished the relative changes in synthesis when changes in free-swelling synthesis rates were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both alphavbeta3 and beta1 play a role in pathways that regulate stimulation of PG synthesis and accumulation by dynamic compression, but through distinct complementary mechanisms.",M2
19800307,"Glycosaminoglycans reduced inflammatory response by modulating toll-like receptor-4 in LPS-stimulated chondrocytes.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) complex induces specific signaling pathways, such as the myeloid differentiation primary response protein-88 (MyD88) and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6), involving NF-kappaB activation. As previous data reported that hyaluronan (HA) and heparan sulfate (HS) may interact with TLR-4, the aim of this study was to investigate whether glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) may modulate the TLR-4 receptor in a model of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines in mouse chondrocytes. LPS stimulation up-regulated all inflammation parameters. The GAG treatment produced various effects: HA reduced MyD88 and TRAF-6 levels and NF-kappaB activation at the higher dose only, and exerted a very low anti-inflammatory effect; chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin-6-sulfate significantly inhibited MyD88, TRAF-6 and NF-kappaB activation, the inflammation cytokines, and inducible nitric oxide synthase; HS, like C4S, significantly reduced MyD88, TRAF-6, NF-kappaB and inflammation. Specific TLR-4 blocking antibody confirmed that TLR-4 was the target of GAG action.",M2
19790062,"Parathyroid hormone 1-34 inhibits terminal differentiation of human articular chondrocytes and osteoarthritis progression in rats.OBJECTIVE: Parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH[1-34]), a parathyroid hormone analog, shares the same receptor, PTH receptor 1, with parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). This study was undertaken to address the hypothesis that PTH(1-34) inhibits terminal differentiation of articular chondrocytes and in turn suppresses the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: We studied the effect of PTH(1-34) on human articular chondrocytes with azacytidine (azaC)-induced terminal differentiation in vitro and on papain-induced OA in the knee joints of rats. In the in vitro study, we measured the levels of messenger RNA for SOX9, aggrecan, type II collagen, type X collagen, alkaline phosphatase (AP), Indian hedgehog (IHH), Bcl-2, and Bax by real-time polymerase chain reaction, levels of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) by dimethylmethylene blue assay, and rate of apoptosis by TUNEL staining. In the in vivo study, we evaluated the histologic changes in GAG, type II collagen, type X collagen, and chondrocyte apoptosis in the articular cartilage of rat knees. RESULTS: AzaC induced terminal differentiation of human chondrocytes, including down-regulation of aggrecan, type II collagen, and GAG and up-regulation of type X collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and IHH. Apoptosis was reversed by 3-10 days of treatment with 10 nM PTH(1-34). SOX9 expression was not changed by either azaC or PTH(1-34) treatment. Bcl-2 and Bax were up-regulated on day 10 and day 14, respectively, after azaC induction of terminal differentiation, but PTH(1-34) treatment did not reverse this effect. Furthermore, PTH(1-34) treatment reversed papain-induced OA changes (decreasing GAG and type II collagen, and increasing type X collagen and chondrocyte apoptosis) in the knee joints of rats. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that PTH(1-34) inhibits the terminal differentiation of human articular chondrocytes in vitro and inhibits progression of OA in rats in vivo, and may be used to treat OA.",M2
19790045,"Mechanical injury potentiates proteoglycan catabolism induced by interleukin-6 with soluble interleukin-6 receptor and tumor necrosis factor alpha in immature bovine and adult human articular cartilage.OBJECTIVE: Traumatic joint injury can damage cartilage and release inflammatory cytokines from adjacent joint tissue. The present study was undertaken to study the combined effects of compression injury, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) on immature bovine and adult human knee and ankle cartilage, using an in vitro model, and to test the hypothesis that endogenous IL-6 plays a role in proteoglycan loss caused by a combination of injury and TNFalpha. METHODS: Injured or uninjured cartilage disks were incubated with or without TNFalpha and/or IL-6/sIL-6R. Additional samples were preincubated with an IL-6-blocking antibody Fab fragment and subjected to injury and TNFalpha treatment. Treatment effects were assessed by histologic analysis, measurement of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) loss, Western blot to determine proteoglycan degradation, zymography, radiolabeling to determine chondrocyte biosynthesis, and Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine chondrocyte production of IL-6. RESULTS: In bovine cartilage samples, injury combined with TNFalpha and IL-6/sIL-6R exposure caused the most severe GAG loss. Findings in human knee and ankle cartilage were strikingly similar to those in bovine samples, although in human ankle tissue, the GAG loss was less severe than that observed in human knee tissue. Without exogenous IL-6/sIL-6R, injury plus TNFalpha exposure up-regulated chondrocyte production of IL-6, but incubation with the IL-6-blocking Fab significantly reduced proteoglycan degradation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that mechanical injury potentiates the catabolic effects of TNFalpha and IL-6/sIL-6R in causing proteoglycan degradation in human and bovine cartilage. The temporal and spatial evolution of degradation suggests the importance of transport of biomolecules, which may be altered by overload injury. The catabolic effects of injury plus TNFalpha appeared partly due to endogenous IL-6, since GAG loss was partially abrogated by an IL-6-blocking Fab.",M2
19778432,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha-dependent aggrecan cleavage and release of glycosaminoglycans in the meniscus is mediated by nitrous oxide-independent aggrecanase activity in vitro.INTRODUCTION: Little is known about factors that induce meniscus damage. Since joint inflammation appears to be a causative factor for meniscal destruction, we investigated the influence of tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) on glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) release and aggrecan cleavage in an in vitro model. METHODS: Meniscal explant disks (3 mm diameter x 1 mm thickness) were isolated from 2-year-old cattle. After 3 days of TNFalpha-treatment GAG release (DMMB assay), biosynthetic activity (sulfate incorporation), nitric oxide (NO) production (Griess assay), gene expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (quantitative RT-PCR, zymography), and immunostaining of the aggrecan fragment NITEGE were determined. RESULTS: TNFalpha induced release of GAG as well as production of NO in a dose-dependent manner, while sulfate incorporation was decreased. TNFalpha increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4 mRNA expression, whereas collagen type I was decreased, and aggrecan, collagen type II as well as MMP-1, -2, -13 and ADAMTS-5 were variably affected. Zymography also showed a TNFalpha-dependent increase in MMP-3 expression, but pre-dominantly in the pro-form. TNFalpha-dependent formation of the aggrecanase-specific aggrecan neoepitope NITEGE was induced. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3, but not TIMP-1 or -2 inhibited TNFalpha-dependent GAG release and NITEGE production, whereas inhibition of TNFalpha-dependent NO generation with the NO-synthetase inhibitor L-NMMA failed to inhibit GAG release and NITEGE production. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that aggrecanase activity (a) is responsible for early TNFalpha-dependent aggrecan cleavage and GAG release in the meniscus and (b) might be involved in meniscal degeneration. Additionally, the meniscus is a TNFalpha-dependent source for MMP-3. However, the TNFalpha-dependent NO production seems not to be involved in release of proteoglycans under the given circumstances.",M2
19777586,"Serum-free, chemically defined medium with TGF-beta(3) enhances functional properties of nucleus pulposus cell-laden carboxymethylcellulose hydrogel constructs.Degeneration of the nucleus pulposus (NP) has been implicated as a major cause of low back pain. Tissue engineering strategies may provide a viable NP replacement therapy; however, culture conditions must be optimized to promote functional tissue development. In this study, a standard serum-containing medium formulation was compared to a chemically defined, serum-free medium to determine the effect on matrix elaboration and functional properties of NP cell-laden carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogels. Additionally, both media were further supplemented with transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-beta(3)). Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content increased in both TGF-beta(3)-treated groups and was highest for treated, serum-free constructs (9.46 +/- 1.51 microg GAG/mg wet weight), while there were no quantifiable GAGs in untreated serum-containing samples. Histology revealed uniform, interterritorial staining for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan throughout the treated, serum-free constructs. Type II collagen content was greater in both serum-free groups and highest in treated, serum-free constructs. The equilibrium Young's modulus was highest in serum-free samples supplemented with TGF-beta(3) (18.54 +/- 1.92 kPa), and the equilibrium weight swelling ratio of these constructs approached that of the native NP tissue (22.19 +/- 0.46 vs. 19.94 +/- 3.09, respectively). Taken together, these results demonstrate enhanced functional matrix development by NP cells when cultured in CMC hydrogels maintained in serum-free, TGF-beta(3) supplemented medium, indicating the importance of medium formulation in NP construct development.",M2
19777546,"MMP-mediated collagen breakdown induced by activated protein C in equine cartilage is reduced by corticosteroids.The plasma serine protease activated protein C (APC) is synthesized by human chondrocytes at sites of pathological cartilage fibrillation. APC levels are increased in osteoarthritis (OA) synovial fluid, and in vitro APC has been shown to synergize with interleukin-1beta (IL-1) to promote degradation from ovine cartilage. A model of equine cartilage degradation was established and used to explore corticosteroid activities. Intraarticular corticosteroids are a commonly prescribed treatment for joint disease, however their role in disease modification remains unclear. APC synergized with IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), promoting significant collagen degradation from equine cartilage explants within 4 days, but did not augment glycoaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) release. APC activated pro-matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 but not pro-MMP-9, as assessed by gelatin zymography. APC did not directly activate pro-MMP-13. Dexamethasone, triamcinolone, and methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) were evaluated at concentrations between 10(- 5)M and 10(-10)M. High concentrations significantly increased GAG release from IL-1+APC-treated explants. With the exception of MPA at 10(-10)M, all concentrations of corticosteroids caused significant decreases in IL-1+APC-driven hydroxyproline loss. Treatment with corticosteroids suppressed expression of MMP-1, -3, and -13 mRNA. The collagenolysis associated with IL-1+APC synergy, and the inhibition of this effect by corticosteroids may involve gelatinase activation and downregulation of MMP expression, respectively.",M2
19775510,"Beneficial storage effects of epigallocatechin-3-o-gallate on the articular cartilage of rabbit osteochondral allografts.A fresh osteochondral allograft is one of the most effective treatments for cartilage defects of the knee. Despite the clinical success, fresh osteochondral allografts have great limitations in relation to the short storage time that cartilage tissues can be well-preserved. Fresh osteochondral grafts are generally stored in culture medium at 4 degrees C. While the viability of articular cartilage stored in culture medium is significantly diminished within 1 week, appropriate serology testing to minimize the chances for the disease transmission requires a minimum of 2 weeks. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) has differential effects on the proliferation of cancer and normal cells, thus a cytotoxic effect on various cancer cells, but a cytopreservative effect on normal cells. Therefore, a storage solution containing EGCG might extend the storage duration of articular cartilages. Rabbit osteochondral allografts were performed with osteochondral grafts stored at 4 degrees C in culture medium containing EGCG for 2 weeks and then the clinical effects were examined with macroscopic and histological assessment after 4 weeks. The cartilaginous structure of an osteochondral graft stored with EGCG was well-preserved with high cell viability and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content of the extracellular matrix (ECM). After an osteochondral allograft, the implanted osteochondral grafts stored with EGCG also provided a significantly better retention of the articular cartilage with viability and metabolic activity. These data suggest that EGCG can be an effective storage agent that allows long-term preservation of articular cartilage under cold storage conditions.",M2
19757234,"Effects of chondrogenic microenvironment on construction of cartilage tissues using marrow stromal cells in vitro.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether it is feasible to use the chondrogenic microenvironment provided by cartilage cells to construct cartilage tissues in vitro with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We isolated and cultured BMSC and cartilage cells from Sprague Dawley rats (SD rats). The supernatant of cartilage culture was used as inducing solution to cause differentiation of BMSC from the second generation of cells cultured in vitro. Cells were examined seven days later, using immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of collagen specific to type II cartilage. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA. BMSC and cartilage cells were isolated from SD rats and cultured in vitro. The BMSC and cartilage cells in culture were mixed evenly in an 8:2 ratio and inoculated into a polyglycolic acid/polylactic acid (PGA/PLA) scaffold to a final concentration of 5.0x10(7) cells/ml. PGA/PLA preparations with pure cartilage cells or pure BMSC served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. The control group of low-concentration cartilage cells consisted of PGA/PLA preparations containing cartilage cells at 20% of the above mentioned concentration (1.0x10(7) cells/ml). Samples were collected eight weeks later, at which time general observations, wet weight, and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) levels were determined, and histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed the induction of BMSC type II collagen, and RT-PCR indicated the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA. In the mixed-cell group and the positive control group, pure mature cartilage cells were produced after eight weeks of culture in vitro, and the size and shape of the scaffold were maintained throughout the culture period. The two groups gave rise to newly generated cartilage cells essentially identical in appearance and histological properties. The immunohistochemical results showed that the cartilage cells of both groups expressed abundant cartilage-specific type II collagen. The average wet weight and GAG content were more than 70% of the values in the positive control group. Only an extremely small amount of immature cartilage tissue formed in local regions in the BMSC-only sample, and the scaffold was obviously shrunken and deformed. Although the wet weight of newly generated cartilage tissue in the low-concentration cartilage cell sample reached 30% of the value of the positive control group, the scaffold was obviously shrunken and deformed. Only regional and discontinuous cartilage tissues were formed, and the amount of newly generated cartilage was obviously less than in the co-culture and positive control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Cartilage cells can provide a microenvironment for cartilage formation to some extent, and also effectively induce BMSC to differentiate into cartilage cells and form tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro.",M2
19751987,"Characterization of an MPS I-H knock-in mouse that carries a nonsense mutation analogous to the human IDUA-W402X mutation.Here we report the characterization of a knock-in mouse model for the autosomal recessive disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler (MPS I-H), also known as Hurler syndrome. MPS I-H is the most severe form of alpha-l-iduronidase deficiency. alpha-l-iduronidase (encoded by the IDUA gene) is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in the degradation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Using gene replacement methodology, a nucleotide change was introduced into the mouse Idua locus that resulted in a nonsense mutation at codon W392. The Idua-W392X mutation is analogous to the human IDUA-W402X mutation commonly found in MPS I-H patients. We found that the phenotype in homozygous Idua-W392X mice closely correlated with the human MPS I-H disease. Homozygous W392X mice showed no detectable alpha-l-iduronidase activity. We observed a defect in <e>GAG</e> degradation as evidenced by an increase in sulfated GAGs excreted in the urine and stored in multiple tissues. Histology and electron microscopy also revealed evidence of GAG storage in all tissues examined. Additional assessment revealed bone abnormalities and altered metabolism within the Idua-W392X mouse. This new mouse will provide an important tool to investigate therapeutic approaches for MPS I-H that cannot be addressed using current MPS I-H animal models.",M2
19748976,"Hypoxic regulation of secreted proteoglycans in macrophages.Macrophages are prominent in hypoxic areas of atherosclerotic lesions, and their secreted proteoglycans (PG), such as versican, can modulate the retention of lipoproteins and the activity of enzymes, cytokines, and growth factors involved in atherogenesis. In this study, we report the effects of hypoxia on PG secreted by human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and the potential regulation by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha). We found that versican co-localized with HIF-1alpha in macrophage-rich areas in human advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Versican and perlecan mRNA expression increased after exposure to 0.5% O(2) (hypoxia) compared with 21% O(2) (control cells). Using precursors to <e>GAG</e> biosynthesis combined with immunoabsorption with a versican antibody an increased versican synthesis was detected at hypoxia. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in THP-1 cells showed that the hypoxic induction of versican and perlecan mRNA expression involved HIF signaling. Versican expression was co-regulated by HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha but expression of perlecan was influenced only by HIF-1alpha and not by HIF-2alpha knockdown. The results show that oxygen concentration is an important modulator of PG expression in macrophages. This may be a novel component of the complex role of macrophages in atherosclerosis.",M2
19729381,"Development of a microtiter plate-based glycosaminoglycan array for the investigation of glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions.The interactions of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) with proteins underlie a wide range of important biological processes. However, the study of such binding reactions has been hampered by the lack of a simple frontline analysis technique. Previously, we have reported that cold plasma polymerization can be used to coat microtiter plate surfaces with allyl amine to which GAGs (e.g., heparin) can be noncovalently immobilized retaining their ability to interact with proteins. Here, we have assessed the capabilities of surface coats derived from different ratios of allyl amine and octadiene (100:0 to 0:100) to support the binding of diverse GAGs (e.g., chondroitin-4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin preparations, and hyaluronan) in a functionally active state. The Link module from TSG-6 was used as a probe to determine the level of functional binding because of its broad (and unique) specificity for both sulfated and nonsulfated GAGs. All of the GAGs tested could bind this domain following their immobilization, although there were clear differences in their protein-binding activities depending on the surface chemistry to which they were adsorbed. On the basis of these experiments, 100% allyl amine was chosen for the generation of a microtiter plate-based  sugar array ; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that similar relative amounts of chondroitin-4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparin (including two selectively de-sulfated derivatives) were immobilized onto this surface. Analysis of four unrelated proteins (i.e., TSG-6, complement factor H, fibrillin-1, and versican) illustrated the utility of this array to determine the GAG-binding profile and specificity for a particular target protein.",M2
19729313,"Metabolic activity of osteoarthritic knees correlates with BMI.Osteoarthritis of the knee has consistently been linked to obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30kg/m(2). It has been hypothesized that obesity may lead to osteoarthritis through increased joint pressure, accumulated microtrauma, and disruption of normal chondrocyte metabolism. These changes in chondrocyte metabolism have not been thoroughly investigated, and it is the purpose of this study to identify a relationship between BMI and altered chondrocyte metabolism in osteoarthritic tissue. Articular cartilage was harvested from the femoral condyles of patients after total knee arthroplasty, and analyzed in explant and alginate models. Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content was measured using a dimethylmethylene blue assay and normalized to DNA content using a PicoGreen(R) assay. Studies have reported GAGs to be a reliable measurement of chondrocyte metabolism and osteoarthritis progression. Our results show a significant linear relationship of increasing BMI and increasing GAG content in both alginate and explant models (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.001). Obese (BMI&gt;/=30kg/m(2)) and non-obese (BMI&lt;30kg/m(2)) comparisons also demonstrated significant differences with higher GAG/DNA content in obese individuals compared to non-obese (p=0.001 and p=0.015). The study results reveal significant relationships between GAG content and BMI in this population of osteoarthritic patients. The significant difference in GAG content between the obese and non-obese patients supports the connection between osteoarthritis and obesity previously reported. Higher patient BMI (&gt;30kg/m(2)) may be similar to dynamic compression injuries which cause increased GAG synthesis in response to cartilage damage.",M2
19728169,"Preventive effect of low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan from Amussium pleuronectus (Linne) on oxidative injury and cellular abnormalities in isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats.The present work explores suspicious consequence of low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan (LMW-<e>GAG</e>) on oxidative stress and cellular abnormalities in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in an experimental model. Group-III male Wistar rats (140 +/- 10 g) were administrated by ISO (85 mg ISO/ml subcutaneously (SC) injected at the last two days of a 2-week period). Group-IV rats were treated LMW-GAG plus ISO (300 microg/day per rat SC for 1 week followed by 85 mg/kg ISO on the end last two days of the 2 - weeks). Untreated control (Group-I) and LMW-GAG drug control (Group-II) were also included. Serum and tissue lactate dehydrogenase, aminotransferases, and creatine kinase activities were increased in ISO group, which were normalized by LMW-GAG pretreatment rats. Antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and non-enzymatic enzyme reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased in the ISO induced rats, and this was increased by LMW-GAG pretreatment. Increased level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma and the heart of ISO treated rats; pre s.c. injected with LMW-GAG to ISO-induced rats decreased the levels of TBARS. Histological examination revealed that the ISO-induced deleterious changes in the heart tissues were offset by LMW-GAG treatment. LMW-GAG affords considerable protection to the tissues challenged by cardiotoxicity, evidenced by its correction and restoration of serum and tissue indices of injury, to normalcy.",M2
19723086,"Interleukin-1beta-induced extracellular matrix degradation and glycosaminoglycan release is inhibited by curcumin in an explant model of cartilage inflammation.Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative and inflammatory disease of synovial joints that is characterized by the loss of articular cartilage, for which there is increasing interest in natural remedies. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the main polyphenol in the spice turmeric, derived from rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa. Curcumin has potent chemopreventive properties and has been shown to inhibit nuclear factor kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling in many cell types, including chondrocytes. In this study, normal articular cartilage was harvested from metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints of eight horses, euthanized for reasons other than research purposes, to establish an explant model mimicking the inflammatory events that occur in OA. Initially, cartilage explants (N= 8) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta to select effective doses for inducing cartilage degeneration in the explant model. Separate cartilage explants were then cotreated with IL-1beta at either 10 ng/mL (n= 3) or 25 ng/mL (n= 3) and curcumin (0.1 micromol/L, 0.5 micromol/L, 1 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L, and 100 micromol/L). After 5 days, the percentage of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) release from the explants was assessed using a dimethylmethylene blue colorimetric assay. Curcumin (100 micromol/L) significantly reduced IL-1beta-stimulated GAG release in the explants by an average of 20% at 10 ng/mL and 27% at 25 ng/mL back to unstimulated control levels (P &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that this explant model effectively simulates the proinflammatory cytokine-mediated release of articular cartilage components seen in OA. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the inflammatory cartilage explant model is useful for studying the effects of curcumin on inflammatory pathways and gene expression in IL-1beta-stimulated chondrocytes.",M2
19717493,"Glycosaminoglycan mimetics inhibit SDF-1/CXCL12-mediated migration and invasion of human hepatoma cells.We have recently reported that the CXC-chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 induces proliferation, migration, and invasion of the Huh7 human hepatoma cells through its G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 and that glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) are involved in these events. Here, we demonstrate by surface plasmon resonance that the chemokine binds to GAG mimetics obtained by grafting carboxylate, sulfate or acetate groups onto a dextran backbone. We also demonstrate that chemically modified dextrans inhibit SDF-1/CXCL12-mediated in vitro chemotaxis and anchorage-independent cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The binding of GAG mimetics to the chemokine and their effects in modulating the SDF-1/CXCL12 biological activities are mainly related to the presence of sulfate groups. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, such as exostosin-1 and -2 or N-deacetylase N-sulfotransferases remained unchanged, but heparanase mRNA and protein expressions in Huh7 cells were decreased upon GAG mimetic treatment. Moreover, decreasing heparanase-1 mRNA levels by RNA interference significantly reduced SDF-1/CXCL12-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) phosphorylation. Therefore, we suggest that GAG mimetic effects on SDF-1/CXCL12-mediated hepatoma cell chemotaxis may rely on decreased heparanase expression, which impairs SDF-1/CXCL12's signaling. Altogether, these data suggest that GAG mimetics may compete with cellular heparan sulfate chains for the binding to SDF-1/CXCL12 and may affect heparanase expression, leading to reduced SDF-1/CXCL12 mediated in vitro chemotaxis and growth of hepatoma cells.",M2
19701788,"Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of biglycan in cardiac fibroblasts.Biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is essential for scar formation and preservation of hemodynamic function after myocardial infarction, as shown in biglycan-knockout mice. Because of this important role in cardiac pathophysiology, we aimed to identify regulators of biglycan expression and posttranslational modifications in cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal Wistar-Kyoto rats and used in the first passage. Expression of biglycan was analyzed after metabolic labeling with [(35)S]-sulfate by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular sieve chromatography; mRNA expression was examined by Northern analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Serum, thrombin, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta 1) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) strongly increased [(35)S]-labeled proteoglycan levels. Tumor necrosis factor alpha further increased the stimulatory effect of PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB increased glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) chain length as shown by molecular sieve chromatography after beta-elimination to release GAG chains. Nitric oxide was the only negative regulator of biglycan as evidenced by marked downregulation in response to DETA-NO ((Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate), a long acting nitric oxide donor and SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-l,l-penicillamine), which completely inhibited PDGF-BB-induced secretion of total [(35)S]-labeled proteoglycans and biglycan mRNA expression. Of note, the molecular weight of biglycan GAG chains was even further increased by NO donors compared to control and PDGF-BB stimulation. The current results suggest that in cardiac fibroblasts, biglycan is induced by a variety of stimuli including serum, thrombin and growth factors such as PDGF-BB and TGFbeta1. This response is counteracted by NO and enhanced by TNFalpha. Interestingly, both up- and downregulation were associated with posttranslational increase of GAG chain length.",M2
19700613,"Transforming growth factor beta3 regulates the versican variants in the extracellular matrix-rich uterine leiomyomas.Uterine leiomyoma are common, benign tumors that are enriched in extracellular matrix. The tumors are characterized by a disoriented and loosely packed collagen fibril structure similar to other diseases with disrupted Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling. Here we characterized TGF-beta3 signaling and the expression patterns of the critical extracellular matrix component versican in leiomyoma and myometrial tissue and cell culture. We also demonstrate the regulation of the versican variants by TGF-beta3. Using leiomyoma and matched myometrium from 15 patients, messenger RNA (mRNA) from leiomyoma and myometrium was analyzed by semiquantitative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while protein analysis was done by western blot. Transforming growth factor beta3 transcripts were increased 4-fold in leiomyoma versus matched myometrium. Phosphorylated-TGF-beta RII and phosphorylated-Smad 2/3 complex were greater in leiomyoma as documented by Western blot. The inhibitor Smad7 transcripts were decreased 0.44-fold. The glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>)-rich versican variants were elevated in leiomyoma versus myometrial tissue: specifically V0 (4.27 +/- 1.12) and V1 (2.01 +/- 0.27). Treatment of leiomyoma and myometrial cells with TGF-beta3 increased GAG-rich versican variant expression 7 to 12 fold. Neutralizing TGF-beta3 antibody decreased the expression of the GAG-rich versican variants 2 to 8 fold in leiomyoma cells. Taken together, the aberrant production of excessive and disorganized extracellular matrix that defines the leiomyoma phenotype involves the activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway and excessive production of GAG-rich versican variants.",M2
19698786,"Evidence against proteoglycan mediated collagen fibril load transmission and dynamic viscoelasticity in tendon.The glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate side-chains of small leucine-rich proteoglycans have been increasingly posited to act as molecular cross links between adjacent collagen fibrils and to directly contribute to tendon elasticity. GAGs have also been implicated in tendon viscoelasticity, supposedly affecting frictional loss during elongation or fluid flow through the extra cellular matrix. The current study sought to systematically test these theories of tendon structure-function by investigating the mechanical repercussions of enzymatic depletion of GAG complexes by chondroitinase ABC in a reproducible tendon structure-function model (rat tail tendon fascicles). The extent of GAG removal (at least 93%) was verified by relevant spectrophotometric assays and transmission electron microscopy. Dynamic viscoelastic tensile tests on GAG depleted rat tail tendon fascicle were not mechanically different from controls in storage modulus (elastic behavior) over a wide range of strain-rates (0.05, 0.5, and 5% change in length per second) in either the linear or nonlinear regions of the material curve. Loss modulus (viscoelastic behavior) was only affected in the nonlinear region at the highest strain-rate, and even this effect was marginal (19% increased loss modulus, p=0.035). Thus glycosaminoglycan chains of small leucine-rich proteoglycans do not appear to mediate dynamic elastic behavior nor do they appear to regulate the dynamic viscoelastic properties in rat tail tendon fascicles.",M2
19695080,"Changes in cultured endothelial cell glycosaminoglycans under hyperglycemic conditions and the effect of insulin and heparin.BACKGROUND: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) contain glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) chains made primarily of heparan sulfate (HS). Hyperglycemia in diabetes leads to endothelial injury and nephropathy, retinopathy and atherosclerosis. Decreased HSPG may contribute to diabetic endothelial injury. Decreased tissue HS in diabetes has been reported, however, endothelial HS changes are poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine total GAGs, including HS, in endothelium under hyperglycemic conditions and the protective effect of insulin and heparin. METHODS: Confluent primary porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) were divided into control, glucose (30 mM), insulin (0.01 unit/ml) and glucose plus insulin treatment groups for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Additionally, PAECs were treated with glucose, heparin (0.5 microg/ml) and glucose plus heparin for 72 hours. GAGs were isolated from cells and medium. GAG concentrations were determined by the carbazole assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: GAGs were significantly increased only in control and glucose plus insulin groups at 72 versus 24 hours. Glucose decreased cell GAGs and increased medium GAGs, and insulin alone decreased cell GAGs at all times compared to control. In the glucose plus insulin group, cell GAGs were less than control at 24 hours, and greater than glucose or insulin alone at 48 and 72 hours while GAGs in medium were greater than control at all times and glucose at 72 hours. Heparin increased GAGs in glucose treated cells and medium. CONCLUSION: High glucose and insulin alone reduces endothelial GAGs. In hyperglycemic conditions, heparin or insulin preserves GAGs which may protect cells from injury. Insulin is an effective diabetic therapy since it not only lowers blood glucose, but also protects endothelium.",M2
19690584,"Impairment of glycosaminoglycan synthesis in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA cells by using siRNA: a potential therapeutic approach for Sanfilippo disease.Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are severe inherited metabolic disorders from the group of lysosomal storage diseases. They are caused by deficiency in the activity of enzymes involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) and resultant accumulation of these compounds in the cells of patients. Although enzyme replacement therapy has become available for some MPS types (MPS I, MPS II and MPS VI), this treatment is not efficient when neurological symptoms occur, especially in MPS III (Sanfilippo disease). Recent studies indicated that substrate reduction therapy (SRT) may be an effective option for the treatment of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases, including MPS III. However, previous attempts to SRT for MPS III focused on the use of non-specific inhibitors of GAG synthesis. Thus, we aimed to use the small interfering RNA (siRNA) procedure to control expression of particular genes, whose products are involved in GAG synthesis. In this report we show that, in MPS IIIA fibroblasts, we were able to reduce mRNA levels of four genes, XYLT1, XYLT2, GALTI and GALTII, whose products are involved in GAG synthesis. This decrease in levels of transcripts corresponded to a decrease in levels of proteins encoded by them. Moreover, efficiency of GAG production in these fibroblasts was considerably reduced after treatment of the cells with siRNA. These results indicate that efficient reduction of GAG synthesis may be achieved by the use of siRNA.",M2
19679226,"IDS crossing of the blood-brain barrier corrects CNS defects in MPSII mice.Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPSII), or Hunter syndrome, arises from a deficiency in iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), and it is characterized by progressive somatic and neurological involvement. The MPSII mouse model reproduces the features of MPSII patients. Systemic administration of the AAV2/5CMV-hIDS vector in MPSII mouse pups results in the full correction of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) accumulation in visceral organs and in the rescue of the defects and GAG accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Remarkably, in treated MPSII animals, this CNS correction arises from the crossing of the blood-brain barrier by the IDS enzyme itself, not from the brain transduction. Thus, we show here that early treatment of MPSII mice with one systemic injection of AAV2/5CMV-hIDS results in prolonged and high levels of circulating IDS that can efficiently and simultaneously rescue both visceral and CNS defects for up to 18 months after therapy.",M2
19672054,"Enhanced chondrogenesis of adipose-derived stem cells by the controlled release of transforming growth factor-beta1 from hybrid microspheres.BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage has a limited self-regenerative capacity, and tissue engineering is a promising solution to the problem of cartilage damage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hybrid microspheres (MS) composed of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-loaded gelatin MS and chitosan MS on enhancement of the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) into chondrocytes in pellet culture. METHODS: In vitro TGF-beta1 release was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The content of DNA and glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) was tested by biochemical methods. In addition, quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression of collagen II and aggrecan. RESULTS: Increased proliferation of ASCs was observed in the hybrid TGF-beta1-loaded MS in comparison to the TGF-beta1-loaded gelatin MS. The chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs in both constructs was evaluated, and GAG content and the gene expression of collagen II and aggrecan were significantly higher in the hybrid TGF-beta1-loaded MS than in the TGF-beta1-loaded gelatin MS. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced differentiation of ASCs by hybrid TGF-beta1-loaded MS may provide an easy and effective way to construct tissue-engineered cartilage.",M2
19658151,"Effects of agarose mould compliance and surface roughness on self-assembled meniscus-shaped constructs.The meniscus is a fibrocartilaginous tissue that is critically important to the loading patterns within the knee joint. If the meniscus structure is compromised, there is little chance of healing, due to limited vascularity in the inner portions of the tissue. Several tissue-engineering techniques to mimic the complex geometry of the meniscus have been employed. Of these, a self-assembly, scaffoldless approach employing agarose moulds avoids drawbacks associated with scaffold use, while still allowing the formation of robust tissue. In this experiment two factors were examined, agarose percentage and mould surface roughness, in an effort to consistently obtain constructs with adequate geometric properties. Co-cultures of ACs and MCs (50:50 ratio) were cultured in smooth or rough moulds composed of 1% or 2% agarose for 4 weeks. Morphological results showed that constructs formed in 1% agarose moulds, particularly smooth moulds, were able to maintain their shape over the 4 week culture period. Significant increases were observed for the collagen II:collagen I ratio, total collagen, <e>GAG</e> and tensile and compressive properties in smooth wells. Cell number per construct was higher in the rough wells. Overall, it was observed that the topology of an agarose surface may be able to affect the phenotypic properties of cells that are on that surface, with smooth surfaces supporting a more chondrocytic phenotype. In addition, wells made from 1% agarose were able to prevent construct buckling potentially, due to their higher compliance.",M2
19656891,"Respiratory syncytial virus grown in Vero cells contains a truncated attachment protein that alters its infectivity and dependence on glycosaminoglycans.Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contains a heavily glycosylated 90-kDa attachment glycoprotein (G). Infection of HEp-2 and Vero cells in culture depends largely on virion G protein binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>). This GAG-dependent phenotype has been described for RSV grown in HEp-2 cells, but we have found that it is greatly reduced by a single passage in Vero cells. Virions produced from Vero cells primarily display a 55-kDa G glycoprotein. This smaller G protein represents a post-Golgi compartment form that is lacking its C terminus, indicating that the C terminus is required for GAG dependency. Vero cell-grown virus infected primary well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures 600-fold less efficiently than did HEp-2 cell-grown virus, indicating that the C terminus of the G protein is also required for virus attachment to this model of the in vivo target cells. This reduced infectivity for HAE cell cultures is not likely to be due to the loss of GAG attachment since heparan sulfate, the primary GAG used by RSV for attachment to HEp-2 cells, is not detectable at the apical surface of HAE cell cultures where RSV enters. Growing RSV stocks in Vero cells could dramatically reduce the initial infection of the respiratory tract in animal models or in volunteers receiving attenuated virus vaccines, thereby reducing the efficiency of infection or the efficacy of the vaccine.",M2
19654318,"Control of promatrilysin (MMP7) activation and substrate-specific activity by sulfated glycosaminoglycans.Matrix metalloproteinases are maintained in an inactive state by a bond between the thiol of a conserved cysteine in the prodomain and a zinc atom in the catalytic domain. Once this bond is disrupted, MMPs become active proteinases and can act on a variety of extracellular protein substrates. In vivo, matrilysin (MMP7) activates pro-alpha-defensins (procryptdins), but in vitro, processing of these peptides is slow, with about 50% conversion in 8-12 h. Similarly, autolytic activation of promatrilysin in vitro can take up to 12-24 h for 50% conversion. These inefficient reactions suggest that natural cofactors enhance the activation and activity of matrilysin. We determined that highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>), such as heparin, chondroitin-4,6-sulfate (CS-E), and dermatan sulfate, markedly enhanced (&gt;50-fold) the intermolecular autolytic activation of promatrilysin and the activity of fully active matrilysin to cleave specific physiologic substrates. In contrast, heparan sulfate and less sulfated forms of chondroitin sulfate did not augment matrilysin activation or activity. Chondroitin-2,6-sulfate (CS-D) also did not enhance matrilysin activity, suggesting that the presentation of sulfates is more important than the overall degree of sulfation. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that promatrilysin bound heparin (K(D), 400 nm) and CS-E (K(D), 630 nm). Active matrilysin bound heparin (K(D), 150 nm) but less so to CS-E (K(D), 60 microm). Neither form bound heparan sulfate. These observations demonstrate that sulfated GAGs regulate matrilysin activation and its activity against specific substrates.",M2
19649337,"Histological localization and analytical evaluation of heparin in the wedge clam Donax cuneatus (Linnaeus, 1758).Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) of the heparin family was localized in the tissues of the bivalve mollusk Donax cuneatus. Different histological staining procedures such as Alcian blue, azure-A, safranin and periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) were followed to test the presence of GAG in various tissues of this bivalve mollusk. GAG was found in the tissues of gill, palp, ctenidia, foot, mantle, inhalant and adductor muscle in order of decreasing importance. Palp, gill and ctenidia tissues showed high staining intensity with PAS (94.8%) processing and Alcian blue (92.4%) indicated the presence of sulfated polysaccharide. Crude GAG was isolated from these tissues using the cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation method. The product obtained was tested for its anticoagulant property along with standard heparin, which was partially purified by fractionation by anion exchange chromatography using a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column. The isolated GAG and fractionated GAG were also compared with standard heparin through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to find relevant functional groups. The bivalve GAG was subjected to DEAE-cellulose fractionation for further purification and its chemical components were analyzed. The subsequent comparison with commercial heparin showed that D. cuneatus could be a potent source of heparin for commercial use.",M2
19636108,"Comparison of three types of chondrocytes in collagen scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.The objective of this study was to compare the chondrogenesis in type I and II collagen scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes from three types of cartilage, after four weeks of culture: auricular (AU), articular (AR) and meniscal (ME). Related aims were to investigate the expression of a contractile muscle actin isoform, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), in the cells in the scaffold and to determine the presence of a lubricating glycoprotein, lubricin, in the constructs. Adult goat AU, AR and ME chondrocytes were seeded into two types of collagen scaffolds: type II collagen and type I/III collagen. After four weeks of culture, the constructs were prepared for histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>), types I and II collagen, elastin, SM and lubricin. AU constructs contained substantially more tissue than the AR and ME samples. The AU constructs exhibited neocartilage, but no elastin. There were no notable differences between the type I and II collagen scaffolds. Novel findings were the expression of SMA by the AU cells in the scaffolds and the presence of lubricin in the AR and AU constructs. AU cells have the capability to produce cartilage in collagen scaffolds under conditions in which there is little histogenesis by AR and ME cells.",M2
19630810,"Platelet and monocyte antigenic complexes in the pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an iatrogenic disorder that occurs in a small subset of patients receiving heparin. Twenty-five per cent (or higher) of affected patients develop limb or life-threatening thrombosis. The effectiveness of therapy is incomplete and may be complicated by bleeding. HIT is caused by antibodies that recognize the platelet chemokine, Platelet Factor 4 (PF4), complexed to heparin or to cellular glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>). However, antibodies with the same apparent specificity are found in many more patients without clinical disease and the reason why so few develop HIT is uncertain. We propose that HIT antibodies recognize cell surface PF4/GAG complexes on intravascular cells, including platelets and monocytes that are dynamic and mutable. Heparin removes cell surface-bound PF4 in most individuals, but removal is incomplete in those with high pre-exposure surface-bound PF4 levels. Such individuals retain critically localized cellular antigenic complexes at the time antibodies develop and are at risk to develop HIT. This article reviews the scientific basis for this model and its clinical implications.",M2
19628873,"Investigating the elusive mechanism of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) biosynthesis requires numerous biosynthetic enzymes and activated sulfate and sugar donors. Although the sequence of biosynthetic events is resolved using reconstituted systems, little is known about the emergence of cell-specific GAG chains (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate) with distinct sulfation patterns. We have utilized a library of click-xylosides that have various aglycones to decipher the mechanism of GAG biosynthesis in a cellular system. Earlier studies have shown that both the concentration of the primers and the structure of the aglycone moieties can affect the composition of the newly synthesized GAG chains. However, it is largely unknown whether structural features of aglycone affect the extent of sulfation, sulfation pattern, disaccharide composition, and chain length of GAG chains. In this study, we show that aglycones can switch not only the type of GAG chains, but also their fine structures. Our findings provide suggestive evidence for the presence of GAGOSOMES that have different combinations of enzymes and their isoforms regulating the synthesis of cell-specific combinatorial structures. We surmise that click-xylosides are differentially recognized by the GAGOSOMES to generate distinct GAG structures as observed in this study. These novel click-xylosides offer new avenues to profile the cell-specific GAG chains, elucidate the mechanism of GAG biosynthesis, and to decipher the biological actions of GAG chains in model organisms.",M2
19627824,"The effects of collagen concentration and crosslink density on the biological, structural and mechanical properties of collagen-<e>GAG</e> scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.In this study, we examined the effects of varying collagen concentration and crosslink density on the biological, structural and mechanical properties of collagen-GAG scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Three different collagen contents (0.25%, 0.5% and 1% collagen) and two different dehydrothermal (DHT) crosslinking processes [1] 105 degrees C for 24 h and [2] 150 degrees C for 48 h were investigated. These scaffolds were assessed for (1) pore size, (2) permeability (3) compressive strength and (4) cell viability. The largest pore size, permeability rate, compressive modulus, cell number and cell metabolic activity was all found to occur on the 1% collagen scaffold due to its increased collagen composition and the DHT treatment at 150 degrees C was found to significantly improve the mechanical properties and not to affect cellular number or metabolic activity. These results indicate that doubling the collagen content to 1% and dehydrothermally crosslinking the scaffold at 150 degrees C for 48 h has enhanced mechanical and biological properties of the scaffold making it highly attractive for use in bone tissue engineering.",M2
19601984,"Extrinsic ageing in the human skin is associated with alterations in the expression of hyaluronic acid and its metabolizing enzymes.Extrinsic skin ageing or 'photoageing', as opposed to intrinsic skin ageing, is the result of exposure to external factors, mainly ultraviolet irradiation. Glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) and particularly hyaluronic acid (HA) are major components of the cutaneous extracellular matrix involved in tissue repair. However, their involvement in extrinsic skin ageing remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the expression of HA and its metabolizing enzymes in photoexposed and photoprotected human skin tissue specimens, obtained from the same patient. Total GAG were isolated, characterized using specific GAG-degrading enzymes and separated by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes and polyacrylamide gels. Quantitation of HA in total GAG was performed using ELISA. Gene expression of hyaluronan synthases (HAS), hyaluronidases (HYAL) and HA receptors CD44 and receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM) was assessed by RT-PCR. We detected a significant increase in the expression of HA, of lower molecular mass, in photoexposed skin as compared with photoprotected skin. This increase was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of HAS1 and an increase in the expression of HYAL1-3. Furthermore, the expression of HA receptors CD44 and RHAMM was significantly downregulated in photoexposed as compared with photoprotected skin. These findings indicate that extrinsic skin ageing is characterized by distinct homoeostasis of HA. The elucidation of the role of HA homoeostasis in extrinsic skin ageing may offer an additional approach in handling cutaneous ageing.",M2

Bifidobacterium longum HY8004 and Lactobacillus plantarum AK8-4 exhibited the most potent inhibition. These LAB inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase production in 2,4,6- trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitic mice. These LAB also blocked the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, as well as of COX-2, in the colon. LAB also blocked activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, and expression of TLR-4 induced by TNBS. In addition, LAB reduced the TNBS-induced bacterial degradation activities of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid. These findings suggest that GAG degradation-inhibitory LAB may improve colitis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine expression via TLR-4-linked NF-kB activation and by inhibiting intestinal bacterial GAG degradation.",M2
19580379,"Growth factor-mediated hyper-elongation of glycosaminoglycan chains on biglycan requires transcription and translation.The mechanism through which growth factors cause glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) hyper-elongation is unclear.

To determine if the response involves specific signalling pathways or the process of GAG hyper-elongation we have also investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and thrombin. We report that both actinomycin D and cycloheximide completely abolished the ability of PDGF to stimulate radiosulphate incorporation and GAG elongation into secreted proteoglycans, and to increase the size of xyloside GAGs. Blocking de novo protein synthesis completely prevented the action of all growth factors tested to elongate GAG chains. These results lay a foundation for further investigation into the genes and proteins implicated in this response.",M2
19575410,"Chondrogenesis on BMP-6 loaded chitosan scaffolds in stationary and dynamic cultures.We originally investigated the suitability of chitosan scaffolds loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) in both stationary and dynamic conditions for cartilage tissue engineering. In the first part of the present study, ATDC5 murine chondrogenic cells were seeded in chitosan and BMP-6 loaded chitosan scaffolds and cultured for 28 days under static conditions. In the following part, we examined the influence of dynamic cultivation conditions over BMP-6 loaded chitosan scaffolds by using rotating bioreactor with perfusion (RCMW). Tissue engineered constructs were characterized by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and biochemical assays for glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and collagen Type II quantification. At the end of 4 weeks static incubation period high levels of GAG (21.22 mg/g dry weight), DNA amounts (1.37 mg/g dry weight) and collagen Type II amounts (1.94 microg/g dry weight) were achieved for BMP-6 loaded chitosan scaffolds compared to chitosan scaffolds. However, the results obtained from morphological observations suggested hypertrophic differentiation of ATDC5 cells in the presence of BMP-6 under stationary conditions. The influence of mechanical stimulation appeared significantly with differentiated cells, cultured under dynamic conditions, showing the effect of retaining their phenotypes without hypertrophy.",M2
19558298,"Biomechanical, biochemical, and histological characterization of canine lumbar facet joint cartilage.OBJECT: Tissue engineering appears to be a promising strategy for articular cartilage regeneration as a treatment for facet joint arthritis. Prior to the commencement of tissue engineering approaches, design criteria must be established to determine the required functional properties of the replacement tissue. As characterization of the functional properties of facet joint cartilage has not been performed previously, the objective of this study was to determine the biomechanical, biochemical, and histological properties of facet joint cartilage. METHODS: The in vitro testing was conducted using 4 lumbar spinal segments obtained from skeletally mature canines. In each specimen, articular cartilage was obtained from the superior surface of the L3-4 and L4-5 facet joints. Creep indentation was used to determine the compressive biomechanical properties, while uniaxial tensile testing yielded the Young modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the tissue. Additionally, biochemical assessments included determinations of cellularity, glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content, and collagen content, as well as enzymelinked immunosorbent assays for collagen I and II production. Finally, histological characterization included H &amp; E staining, as well as staining for collagen and GAG distributions. RESULTS: The means +/- standard deviation values were determined. There were no differences between the 2 spinal levels for any of the assessed properties. Averaged over both levels, the thickness was 0.49 +/- 0.10 mm and the hydration was 74.7 +/- 1.7%. Additionally, the cells/wet weight (WW) ratio was 6.26 +/- 2.66 x 10(4) cells/mg and the cells/dry weight (DW) ratio was 2.51 +/- 1.21 x 10(5) cells/mg. The GAG/WW was 0.038 +/- 0.013 and the GAG/ DW was 0.149 +/- 0.049 mg/mg, while the collagen/WW was 0.168 +/- 0.026 and collagen/DW was 0.681 +/- 0.154 mg/ mg. Finally, the aggregate modulus was 554 +/- 133 kPa, the Young modulus was 10.08 +/- 8.07 MPa, and the ultimate tensile strength was 4.44 +/- 2.40 MPa.

19551986,"Software tool for the structural determination of glycosaminoglycans by mass spectrometry.Structural elucidation of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) is one of the major challenges in biochemical analysis. This is mainly because of the diversity of GAG sulfation and N-acetylation patterns and variations in uronate isomers. ESI-MS and recently MALDI-MS methodologies are important strategies for investigating the molecular structure of GAGs. However, the interpretation of MS data produced by these strategies must take into account a large number of variables (including the number of monosaccharide residues, acetylations, sulfate groups, multiple charges, and exchanges between different cations). We have developed a bioinformatics tool to assist this complex interpretation task. The software is based on GlycoWorkbench, a tool for semiautomatic interpretation of glycan MS data. The tool generates the sugar backbones in all their variants (GAG family, composition, acetylation positions, and number of sulfates) and automatically matches them with the selected MS peaks. The backbones corresponding to a given peak are validated against the selected MS/MS peaks by generating all possible fragmentations. Native chondroitin sulfate and heparin oligosaccharides as well as chemically modified heparin oligomers have been successfully analyzed by MALDI- and ESI-MS and MS/MS, and the results of the semiautomated annotation of these mass spectra are presented here.",M2
19539688,"Glycosaminoglycan mimetics-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells into mouse peripheral blood: structure/function insights.OBJECTIVE: Glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) are major components of bone marrow extracellular matrix because they have the property to interact with cells and growth factors in hematopoietic niches. In this study, we investigated the effect of two different chemically defined GAG mimetics on mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in mice peripheral blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mobilization was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of GAG mimetics. Mobilized cells were characterized phenotypically by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and functionally by colony-forming cell, cobblestone area-forming cell and long-term culture-initiating cell assays in vitro. Radioprotection assays were performed to confirm the functionality of primitive hematopoietic cells in vivo. Involvement of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were investigated. RESULTS: GAG mimetics treatment induces hyperleukocytosis and mobilization of HSPC. They synergize with the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or AMD3100 on hematopoietic progenitors mobilization. Reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipient mice with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from GAG mimetic-treated donor mice improves engraftment and survival. BiAcore studies indicate that the mimetics interact directly with SDF-1. In addition, GAG mimetics-induced mobilization is associated with increased levels of pro- and active MMP-9 from bone marrow cells and increased level of SDF-1 in peripheral blood. Finally, mobilization is partially inhibited by co-injection with anti-SDF-1 antibody. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that GAG mimetics induce efficient mobilization of HSPCs, associated with an activation of pro-MMP-9 and a modification in the SDF-1 concentration gradient between bone marrow and peripheral blood. We suggest that structural features of GAGs can modify the nature of mobilized cells.",M2
19531291,"Raman spectroscopic investigation of peptide-glycosaminoglycan interactions.Protein-glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) interactions play a central role in tissue engineering and drug delivery. A rapid and efficacious method for screening these interactions is essential. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify chemical interactions and conformational changes occurring upon binding between a synthetic peptide (QRRFMQYSARRF) and two glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparin and chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S). The results identify three main chemical groups that are involved in the binding of the synthetic peptide with heparin and C6S. Tyrosine formed hydrogen bonds with the GAGs via its hydroxyl group. The amide I band demonstrated substantial shifts in Raman wavenumbers when bound to heparin and C6S (Deltaomega=-10.2+/-0.7 cm(-1) and Deltaomega=-11.9+/-0.3 cm(-1), respectively), suggesting that the peptide underwent planar conformational changes after binding occurred. Upon binding to the peptide, the sulfate peak of heparin displayed a substantially greater shift in the Raman wavenumber (-7.5+/-0.5 cm(-1)) than that of C6S (-2.6+/-0.5 cm(-1)). The greater amide I and sulfate band shifts seen during peptide-heparin interactions are indicative of a stronger association compared to that between the peptide and C6S. This observation was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis, which demonstrated a lower dissociation constant (KD) between the peptide and heparin (KD of 19.2+/-3.3 microM) than between the peptide and C6S (26.7+/-2.5 microM). We conclude that the shift in the Raman wavenumbers of amide I and sulfate groups can be used for high-throughput screening of interaction affinities between libraries of peptides and GAGs.",M2
19530259,"Characterization of engineered tissue construct mechanical function by magnetic resonance imaging.Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technology that enables the characterization of multiple physical phenomena in living and engineered tissues. The mechanical function of engineered tissues is a primary endpoint for the successful regeneration of many biological tissues, such as articular cartilage, spine and heart. Here we demonstrate the application of MRI to characterize the mechanical function of engineered tissue. Phase contrast-based methods were demonstrated to characterize detailed deformation fields throughout the interior of native and engineered tissue, using an articular cartilage defect model as a study system. MRI techniques revealed that strain fields varied non-uniformly, depending on spatial position. Strains were highest in the tissue constructs compared to surrounding native cartilage. Tissue surface geometry corresponded to strain fields observed within the tissue interior near the surface. Strain fields were further evaluated with respect to the spatial variation in the concentration of glycosaminoglycans ([<e>GAG</e>]), critical proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, as determined by gadolinium-enhanced imaging. [GAG] also varied non-uniformly, depending on spatial position and was lowest in the tissue constructs compared to the surrounding cartilage. The use of multiple MRI techniques to assess tissue mechanical function provides complementary data and suggests that deformation is related to tissue geometry, underlying extracellular matrix constituents and the lack of tissue integration in the model system studied. Specialized and advanced MRI phase contrast-based methods are valuable for the detailed characterization and evaluation of mechanical function of tissue-engineered constructs.",M2
19524301,"The basic residue cluster (55)KKWVR(59) in CCL5 is required for in vivo biologic function.Chemokine function in vivo depends on the presentation by structures of the extracellular matrix or on endothelial surfaces. CCL5 contains two clusters of basic amino acid residues ((44)RKNR(47) and (55)KKWVR(59)) implicated in presentation of the protein. While (44)RKNR(47) has been shown to moderate CCL5 binding to glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>), no direct role for the basic residues in the so called 50s loop ((55)KKWVR(59)) as a presentation structure has been published to date. In ex vivo studies both regions were found to be necessary for direct tissue binding suggesting a role for (55)KKWVR(59). In vitroT lymphocyte and monocyte induced firm adhesion under flow, as well as leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity in vivo was reduced in the 50s mutant. The binding of the 50s mutant to endothelial cells was significantly reduced as compared to the wild type protein demonstrated by ELISA. The 50s mutant had little impact on GAG binding in vitro. These data suggest that functional CCL5 presentation is mediated through both the 40s as well as the 50s loop with differential functions of the two loops of clusters of basic residues.",M2
19508395,"The 'sweet' and 'bitter' involvement of glycosaminoglycans in lung diseases: pharmacotherapeutic relevance.The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a significant role in the structure and function of the lung. The ECM is a three-dimensional fibre mesh, comprised of various interconnected and intercalated macromolecules, among which are the glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>). GAG are long, linear and highly charged, heterogeneous polysaccharides that are composed of a variable number of repeating disaccharide units (macromolecular sugars) and most of them, as their name implies, have a sweet taste. In the lung, GAG support the structure of the interstitium, the subepithelial tissue and the bronchial walls, and are secreted in the airway secretions. Besides maintaining lung tissue structure, GAG also play an important role in lung function as they regulate hydration and water homeostasis, modulate the inflammatory response and influence lung tissue repair and remodelling. However, depending on their size and/or degree of sulphation, and their immobilization or solubilization in the ECM, specific GAG in the lung either live up to their sweet taste/name, supporting normal lung physiology, or they are associated to 'bitter' effects, related to lung pathology. The present review discusses the biological role of GAG in the lung as well as the involvement of these molecules in various respiratory diseases. Given the great structural diversity of GAG, understanding the changes in GAG expression that occur in lung diseases may lead to novel targets for pharmacological intervention in order to prevent and/or to treat a range of lung diseases.",M2
19494482,"Human disk cells from degenerated disks and mesenchymal stem cells in co-culture result in increased matrix production.Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been suggested for disk degeneration, which is characterized by dysfunctional cells and low proteoglycan production. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a 3D co-culture system using human disk cells (DCs) and MSCs on collagen and proteoglycan production. DCs and MSCs were expanded in monolayer and grown in pellet cultures for 7, 14 and 28 days and analyzed for hydroxyproline (HP), reflecting total collagen production, and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) accumulation. DCs and MSCs co-cultured at different ratios (25/75, 50/50 and 75%/25%) were examined for GAG accumulation. Collagen type II expression was analyzed immunohistochemically. In a second series, conditioned media were added to pellet cultures of degenerated DCs or MSCs. DCs from degenerated disks and MSCs demonstrated lower total collagen production than non-degenerated DC pellets. GAG production was comparable in DCs and MSCs, except in the youngest donor, with MSC producing about 10 times higher GAG/DNA. Co-cultures resulted in approximately 1.5 times higher GAG/DNA production than DCs. Increased collagen type II expression was seen in co-cultures compared to DC or MSC culture alone, except in the case with highly active MSCs. No positive effect of conditioned media was seen. In conclusion, co-culture of MSCs with degenerated DCs increased proteoglycan and collagen-type ceII production, indicating that in future clinical therapy MSCs can be transplanted without pre-differentiation in vitro. The lack of effect of conditioned media suggests that the positive effect of co-culture on matrix production is not due to soluble factors.",M2
19488903,"Histochemical method for demonstrating quail mast cell types simultaneously.The development and application of selective staining methods for routine detection of mast cells are of considerable interest, because these cells play an important role in health and disease. The composition of cytoplasmic mast cell granules depends on the species and type of mast cell. The study reported here was conducted to investigate the combined use of aldehyde fuchsin (AF) and the Alcian blue-critical electrolyte concentration (AB-CEC) (pH 5.8, 0.3 M MgCl(2)) techniques for differentiating avian mast cell subtypes. Tissue samples from skin, intestines, and lungs of six healthy adult quail and two control rats were fixed in Carnoy's solution and 10% formolin for routine histological processing. To determine the staining properties of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>), a three-step staining technique was applied using berberine sulfate, AF, and AB-CEC. In quail, AF positivity following application of the AB-CEC technique was found only in the lungs, mostly in cells that gave a berberine sulfate-positive reaction, and this positivity was determined to be localized particularly in the nucleus and perinuclear cytoplasm. In other regions, the pale AF staining of cells that did not emit fluorescence when stained with berberine sulfate was determined to be replaced by a blue color after application of AB-CEC. The AF/AB-CEC (pH 5.8, 0.3 M MgCl(2)) technique demonstrated that rat and quail mast cells varied in both GAG types and their distribution within the cell. Especially in avian species, this technique can be applied to distinguish mast cells according to their GAG content. It can be used as an alternative to the AB/safranin O staining procedure for differentiating mast cells that contain and lack heparin.",M2
19486014,"Rapid prototyping of anatomically shaped, tissue-engineered implants for restoring congruent articulating surfaces in small joints.BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies investigated advanced scaffold design and tissue engineering approaches towards restoring congruent articulating surfaces in small joints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anatomical femoral and tibial cartilage constructs, fabricated by three-dimensional fibre deposition (3DF) or compression moulding/particulate leaching (CM), were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in an autologous rabbit model. Effects of scaffold pore architecture on rabbit chondrocyte differentiation and mechanical properties were evaluated following in vitro culture and subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. After femoral and tibial osteotomy and autologous implantation of tissue-engineered constructs in rabbit knee joints, implant fixation and joint articulation were evaluated. RESULTS: Rapid prototyping of 3DF architectures with 100% interconnecting pores promoted homogeneous distribution of viable cells, glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) and collagen type II; significantly greater GAG content and differentiation capacity (GAG/DNA) in vitro compared to CM architectures; and higher mechanical equilibrium modulus and dynamic stiffness (at 0.1 Hz). Six weeks after implantation, femoral and tibial constructs had integrated with rabbit bone and knee flexion/extension and partial load bearing were regained. Histology demonstrated articulating surfaces between femoral and tibial constructs for CM and 3DF architectures; however, repair tissue appeared fibrocartilage-like and did not resemble implanted cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomically shaped, tissue-engineered constructs with designed mechanical properties and internal pore architectures may offer alternatives for reconstruction or restoration of congruent articulating surfaces in small joints.",M2
19481254,"PHB/PHBHHx scaffolds and human adipose-derived stem cells for cartilage tissue engineering.The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)/poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) (PHB/PHBHHx) to produce neocartilage upon seeding with differentiated human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). hASCs were grown on a three-dimensional PHB/PHBHHx scaffold in vitro with or without chondrogenic media for 14 days. Scanning electron microscopy showed that differentiated cells produced abundant extracellular matrices with increasing culture time. No cytotoxicity was observed by the live/dead cell viability assay. <e>GAG</e> and total collagen content in the differentiated cells increased significantly with in vitro culture time. After 14 days of in vitro culture, the differentiated cells grown on the (PHB/PHBHHx) scaffold (differentiated cells/(PHB/PHBHHx)) were implanted into the subcutaneous layer nude mice for 12 or 24 weeks, non-differentiated cells/(PHB/PHBHHx) were implanted as the control group. The differentiated cells/(PHB/PHBHHx) implants formed cartilage-like tissue after 24 weeks of implantation, and stained positive for collagen type II, safranin O, and toluidine blue. In addition, typical cartilage lacuna was observed, and there were no remnants of PHB/PHBHHx. Collagen type II was detected by Western blot at 12 and 24 weeks of implantation. In the control group, no cartilage formation was observed. This study demonstrated that PHB/PHBHHx is a suitable material for cartilage tissue engineering.",M2
19480915,"Chapter 4. Interactions of chemokines with glycosaminoglycans.Many proteins require interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) to exert their biologic activity. The effect of GAG binding on protein function ranges from essential roles in development, organogenesis, cell growth, cell adhesion, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and interactions with pathogens. A classic example is the role of GAGs in the interaction of fibroblast growth factors with their receptors, where GAGs play a role in specificity determination and control of receptor-ligand engagement. The other well-studied example involves the binding of antithrombin to heparin/heparan sulfate, which results in the inactivation of the coagulation cascade. In view of their specialized activity in cellular recruitment, chemokines interact with GAGs, minimally as a mechanism for localization of chemokines to specific anatomical spaces enabling them to act as directional signals for migrating cells. The biological relevance of these interactions has been recently demonstrated by functional characterization of mutants that are deficient in GAG binding. These mutants bind receptor normally in vitro but are unable to recruit cells in vivo. Observations like this have motivated investigations to identify GAG-binding epitopes on chemokines, the specificity and affinity of chemokines for different GAGs, the oligomerization of chemokines on GAGs, and the efficacy of GAG-binding mutants in the context of in vivo cell recruitment and animal models of disease. To this end, several techniques have been developed to measure the interactions of chemokines with GAGs. In this chapter we describe these various assays with particular reference to those that have been used to assess the binding of chemokines to GAGs and to define their epitopes. In the end, we believe both in vitro and in vivo characterization are absolutely necessary for understanding these interactions and their biologic relevance in the context of the whole organism.",M2
19473558,"Intraarticular administration of platelet-rich plasma with biodegradable gelatin hydrogel microspheres prevents osteoarthritis progression in the rabbit knee.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic potential of administration of gelatin hydrogel microspheres containing platelet-rich plasma (PRP), by examining its effects on progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in a rabbit model. METHODS: PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were prepared from rabbit blood. Adult rabbit chondrocytes were cultured in the alginate beads with the presence of 3% PRP or 3% PPP. Glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) synthesis was quantified using dimethylmethylene blue assay. To confirm the anabolic effect of PRP in vivo, cartilage matrix gene expression was examined after intraarticular administration of PRP contained in gelatin hydrogel microspheres. The PRP contained in gelatin hydrogel microspheres was administered into the rabbit knee joint twice with an interval of 3 weeks, beginning 4 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Ten weeks after ACLT, gross morphological and histological examinations were performed. RESULTS: PRP significantly stimulated chondrocyte GAG synthesis in vitro. In the knee joint, expression of proteoglycan core protein mRNA in the articular cartilage increased after administration of PRP contained in microspheres. Intraarticular injections of PRP in gelatin hydrogel microspheres significantly suppressed progression of OA in the ACLT rabbit model morphologically and histologically. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that sustained release of growth factors contained in PRP has preventive effects against OA progression. These preventive effects appear to be due to stimulation of cartilage matrix metabolism, caused by the growth factors contained in PRP.",M2
19470416,"Synergistic effects of growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) and insulin on expanded chondrocytes in a 3-D environment.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) alone or in combination with insulin on engineered cartilage from primary or expanded chondrocytes during 3-dimensional in vitro culture. DESIGN: Juvenile bovine chondrocytes were seeded either as primary or as expanded (passage 2) cells onto polyglycolic acid fiber meshes and cultured for 3 weeks in vitro. Additionally, adult human chondrocytes were grown in pellet culture after expansion (passage 2). The culture medium was supplemented either with GDF-5 in varying concentrations or insulin alone, or with combinations thereof. RESULTS: For primary chondrocytes, the combination of GDF-5 and insulin led to increased proliferation and construct weight, as compared to either factor alone, however, the production of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAG</e>) and collagen per cell were not affected. With expanded bovine chondrocytes, the use of GDF-5 or insulin alone led to only very small constructs with no type II collagen detectable. However, the combination of GDF-5 (0.01 or 0.1 microg/ml) and insulin (2.5 microg/ml) yielded cartilaginous constructs and, in contrast to the primary cells, the observed redifferentiating effects were elicited on the cellular level independent of proliferation (increased production of GAG and collagen per cell, clear shift in collagen subtype expression with type II collagen observed throughout the construct). The synergistic redifferentiating effects of the GDF-5/insulin combination were confirmed with expanded adult human cells, also exhibiting a clear shift in collagen subtype expression on the mRNA and protein level. CONCLUSIONS: In combination with insulin, GDF-5 appears to enable the redifferentiation of expanded chondrocytes and the concurrent generation of cartilaginous constructs. The demonstration of these synergistic effects also for adult human chondrocytes supports the clinical relevance of the findings.",M2
19440735,"Glucosamine sulphate does not increase extracellular matrix production at low oxygen tension.Low oxygen tension may change the dependence of chondrocytes on exogenous carbohydrate sources. In this study, we have investigated whether glucosamine sulphate (GS) stimulates proteoglycan synthesis, the mRNA expression of aggrecan and of type II collagen, and UDP-sugar levels in bovine primary chondrocytes under a low oxygen (O(2)) atmosphere. Chondrocytes from bovine femoral condyles were cultivated with or without GS or sulphate at various concentrations in low- (5.5 mM) or high-glucose (25 mM) DMEM under either a 5% or 20% O(2) atmosphere for 2 or 8 days after isolation. The mRNA expression of aggrecan and type II collagen and the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription with polymerase chain reaction and a [(35)S]-sulphate incorporation assay, respectively. Aggrecan promoter activity was analysed by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Intracellular UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (UDP-HexN), UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-hexoses were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A low (5%) O(2) atmosphere significantly increased GAG synthesis, mRNA expression of aggrecan and of type II collagen and aggrecan promoter activity in bovine primary chondrocytes. A high (1 mM) concentration of GS was required to increase the level of UDP-HexN. However, GS did not increase GAG synthesis, aggrecan promoter activity or mRNA expression of aggrecan and of type II collagen. Interestingly, a 5% O(2) atmosphere increased the level of UDP-HexN in 8-day cultures without GS treatment. Thus, exogenous GS does not change chondrocyte metabolism, whereas a 5% O(2) atmosphere stimulates extracellular matrix production in bovine primary chondrocytes. The balance of UDP-sugars is changed under a 5% O(2) atmosphere for longer culture periods.",M2
19427387,"Quantitative determination and comparison of the glycosaminoglycan Delta-disaccharide composition in 22 different human cell lines.Changes in proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) content and distribution may play an important role in the development of many diseases, atherosclerosis, cancer and diabetes. Human cell lines act as models for the underlying pathomechanisms. Despite the importance of proteoglycans for cell functioning, information on the GAG composition of most human cell lines is limited. Comparative analysis of the GAG Deltadisaccharide amount in 22 human cell lines yielded a mean value of 94 +/- 58 pmol/10(6) cells (mean+/-SEM). Total GAG amount and heparan sulfate/heparin Deltadisaccharide composition, but not chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate Deltadisaccharide composition, differed significantly between the investigated adherent and suspension cell lines. We provide a novel overview of GAG Deltadisaccharide composition in 22 different human cell lines.",M2
19415495,"Catabolic responses of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel to dynamic compression.This study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteases and aggrecanases during dynamic compression-induced aggrecan catabolism in chondrocyte-seeded self-assembling peptide hydrogel. One- to two-week-old bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated into peptide hydrogel and cultured for 14 days prior to the application of an alternate day loading protocol. Dynamic compression-induced aggrecan catabolism was explored by evaluating <e>GAG</e> loss to the culture medium, zymography for matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), gene expression of MMPs and ADAMTS proteases, and Western blot analysis for aggrecan fragments. The application of loading over 4 days increased GAG loss to the medium three- to four-fold relative to free-swelling controls. Zymogram analysis detected increased concentrations of latent MMP-9 and MMP-3 in the culture medium relative to free-swelling culture. Real-time PCR showed expression levels of MMPs and ADAMTS proteases in loaded samples that ranged from 2.5- to 95-fold higher than free-swelling culture. Aggrecan fragment analysis did not detect small (50-80 kDa) molecular weight fragments in free-swelling culture; however, dynamic compression samples contained 60-80 kDa fragments that were detected by both anti-G1 and NITEGE probes, demonstrating ADAMTS but not MMP degradation. These data suggest that partially mature cartilage tissue engineering constructs may be susceptible to catabolic degradation.",M2
19414521,"Engineering the glycosaminoglycan-binding affinity, kinetics and oligomerization behavior of RANTES: a tool for generating chemokine-based glycosaminoglycan antagonists.Binding to glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) is a necessary prerequisite for the biological activity of the proinflammatory chemokine RANTES in vivo. We have applied protein engineering methods to modulate equilibrium-binding affinity as well as binding kinetics of RANTES towards its GAG ligand which also altered the chemokine's oligomerization behavior. Out of 10 mutants, A22K and H23K were chosen for further in vitro and in vivo characterization because their stability was comparable with wild-type (wt) RANTES. In chemical cross-linking experiments, A22K gave higher and H23K lower molecular weight aggregates compared with wtRANTES as shown on SDS-PAGE. All mutants contained an N-terminal methionine residue, a well-described G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonistic modification, which resulted in the mutants' inability to induce monocyte chemotaxis. In surface plasmon resonance experiments using immobilized heparan sulfate (HS) and physiological buffer conditions, Met-RANTES exhibited a significantly longer residual time on the GAG chip compared with the other RANTES variants. In Scatchard plot analysis, RANTES gave a bi-phasic, bell-shaped curve suggesting 'creation' of ligand-binding sites on the protein during HS interaction. This was not observed in the mutants' Scatchard plots which gave K(d) values of 317.5 and 44.5 nM for the A22K and H23K mutants, respectively. The mutants were subsequently tested for their inhibitory effect in a rat model of autoimmune uveitis where only H23K exhibited a transient improvement of the clinical disease score. H23K is therefore proposed to be a GPCR-inactive GAG antagonist which displaces the wt chemokine from its natural HS-proteoglycan co-receptor. The protein engineering approach presented here opens new ways for the treatment of RANTES-related diseases.",M2
19456238,"Effects of immobilized glycosaminoglycans on the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells with potential for multilineage differentiation. They represent an attractive cell source alternative to embryonic stem cells for therapeutic applications. Optimal utilization of MSCs for tissue engineering requires improved biomaterials that can enhance their growth and direct differentiation. The biological activity of glycosaminoglycans (<e>GAGs</e>) has been previously exploited for use in tissue engineering applications. In this study, MSC proliferation and differentiation was studied on GAG-derivatized chitosan membranes. The GAGs included heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. The covalent GAG immobilization method and amount of immobilized GAG were varied. It was found that MSC growth increased as much as fivefold on GAG-immobilized surfaces compared to tissue culture plastic and chitosan-only controls. The MSC growth rates increased significantly with increasing GAG density on the culture surfaces. The MSC proliferation rates on heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate exhibited nonlinear increases with the level of fibronectin binding on these surfaces. In contrast, MSC proliferation on hyaluronic acid and chondroitin 4-sulfate was found to be independent of fibronectin or vitronectin binding on the surfaces, suggesting that these GAGs influenced MSC proliferation through different mechanisms. In conclusion, the results indicate that GAG immobilization on chitosan scaffolds provides an effective means of manipulating MSC proliferation and has promising potential for directing MSC differentiation in tissue engineering applications employing chitosan.",M2
19449355,"TAT-mediated intracellular protein delivery to primary brain cells is dependent on glycosaminoglycan expression.Although some studies have shown that the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) TAT can enter a variety of cell lines with high efficiency, others have observed little or no transduction in vivo or in vitro under conditions mimicking the in vivo environment. The mechanisms underlying TAT-mediated transduction have been investigated in cell lines, but not in primary brain cells. In this study we demonstrate that transduction of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TAT fusion protein is dependent on glycosaminoglycan (<e>GAG</e>) expression in both the PC12 cell line and primary astrocytes. GFP-TAT transduced PC12 cells and did so with even higher efficiency following NGF differentiation. In cultures of primary brain cells, TAT significantly enhanced GFP delivery into astrocytes grown under different conditions: (1) monocultures grown in serum-containing medium; (2) monocultures grown in serum-free medium; (3) cocultures with neurons in serum-free medium. The efficiency of GFP-TAT transduction was significantly higher in the monocultures than in the cocultures. The GFP-TAT construct did not significantly enter neurons. Experimental modulation of GAG content correlated with alterations in TAT transduction in PC12 cells and astrocyte monocultures grown in the presence of serum. In addition, this correlation was predictive of TAT-mediated transduction in astrocyte monocultures grown in serum free medium and in coculture. We conclude that culture conditions affect cellular GAG expression, which in turn dictates TAT-mediated transduction efficiency, extending previous results from cell lines to primary cells. These results highlight the cell-type and phenotype-dependence of TAT-mediated transduction, and underscore the necessity of controlling the phenotype of the target cell in future protein engineering efforts aimed at creating more efficacious CPPs.",M2
