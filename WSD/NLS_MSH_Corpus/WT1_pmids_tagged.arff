20395243,"<e>WT1</e> (Wilms' tumor gene 1): biology and cancer immunotherapy.Wilms' tumor gene WT1 encodes a transcription factor and plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. The WT1 gene is highly expressed in leukemia and various types of solid tumors, whereas WT1 is a tumor marker convenient for the detection of minimal residual disease of leukemia. The WT1 gene was originally defined as a tumor suppressor gene, but we proposed that it was, on the contrary, an oncogene. Furthermore, the WT1 protein has proven to be a promising tumor-associated antigen, in which many human leukocyte antigen class I- or II-restricted WT1 epitopes have been identified. Clinical trials of WT1-targeted immunotherapy have confirmed its safety and clinical efficacy. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and WT1 antibodies are spontaneously induced in tumor-bearing patients, probably because of high immunogenicity of the WT1 protein. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes make a major contribution to the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogenic stem cell transplantation. When 75 cancer antigens including WT1 were prioritized according to several criteria such as therapeutic function and immunogenicity, WT1 was ranked as the top antigen. These findings suggest that a new era of WT1 immunotherapy is imminent.",M1
20368469,"<e>WT1</e> mutation in 470 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia: stability during disease evolution and implication of its incorporation into a survival scoring system.The impact of WT1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not completely settled. We aimed to determine the clinical implication of WT1 mutation in 470 de novo non-M3 AML patients and its stability during the clinical course. WT1 mutations were identified in 6.8% of total patients and 8.3% of younger patients with normal karyotype (CN-AML). The WT1 mutation was closely associated with younger age (P &lt; .001), French-American-British M6 subtype (P = .006), and t(7;11)(p15;p15) (P = .003). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the WT1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival among total patients and the CN-AML group. A scoring system incorporating WT1 mutation, NPM1/FLT3-ITD, CEBPA mutations, and age into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify CN-AML patients into different prognostic groups (P &lt; .001). Sequential analyses were performed on 133 patients. WT1 mutations disappeared at complete remission in all WT1-mutated patients studied. At relapse, 3 of the 16 WT1-mutated patients who had paired samples lost the mutation and 2 acquired additional mutations, whereas 3 of 110 WT1-wild patients acquired novel mutations. In conclusion, WT1 mutations are correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients. The mutation status may be changed in some patients during AML progression.",M1
20364021,"Effects of concomitant temozolomide and radiation therapies on <e>WT1</e>-specific T-cells in malignant glioma.OBJECTIVE: Immunotherapy targeting the Wilms' tumour 1 gene product has been proven safe and effective for treating malignant glioma in a phase II clinical study. Currently, radiation/temozolomide therapy is the standard treatment with only modest benefit. Whether combining radiation/temozolomide therapy with WT1 immunotherapy will have a negating effect on immunotherapy is still controversial because of the significant lymphocytopaenia induced by the former therapy. To address this issue, we investigated the changes in frequency and number of WT1-specific T-cells in patients with malignant gliomas. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma who received standard radiation/temozolomide therapy were recruited for the study. Blood samples were collected before treatment and on the sixth week of therapy. The frequencies and numbers of lymphocytes, CD8(+) T-cells, WT1-specific T-cells, regulatory T-cells, natural killer cells and natural killer T-cells were measured and analysed using T-tests. RESULTS: Analysis of the frequency of T lymphocytes and its subpopulation showed an increase in regulatory T-cells, but no significant change was noted in the populations of T-cells, WT1-specific T-cells, NK cells and NKT cells. Reductions in the total numbers of T-cells, WT1-specific T-cells, NK cells and NKT cells were mainly a consequence of the decrease in the total lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation/temozolomide therapy did not significantly affect the frequency of WT1-specific T-cells, suggesting that the combination with WT1 immunotherapy may be possible, although further assessment in the clinical setting is warranted.",M1
20237505,"Wilms' tumor gene 1 protein represses the expression of the tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor 8 in human hematopoietic progenitors and in leukemic cells.Wilms' tumor gene 1 (<e>WT1</e>) is a transcription factor involved in developmental processes. In adult hematopoiesis, only a small portion of early progenitor cells express WT1, whereas most leukemias show persistently high levels, suggesting an oncogenic role. We have previously characterized oncogenic BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase signaling pathways for increased WT1 expression. In this study, we show that overexpression of BCR/ABL1 in CD34+ progenitor cells leads to reduced expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), in addition to increased WT1 expression. Interestingly, IRF8 is known as a tumor suppressor in some leukemias and we investigated whether WT1 might repress IRF8 expression. When analyzed in four leukemia mRNA expression data sets, WT1 and IRF8 were anticorrelated. Upon overexpression in CD34+ progenitors, as well as in U937 cells, WT1 strongly downregulated IRF8 expression. All four major WT1 splice variants induced repression, but not the zinc-finger-deleted WT1 mutant, indicating dependence on DNA binding. A reporter construct with the IRF8 promoter was repressed by WT1, dependent on a putative WT1-response element. Binding of WT1 to the IRF8 promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our results identify IRF8 as a direct target gene for WT1 and provide a possible mechanism for oncogenic effects of WT1 in leukemia.",M1
20227018,"A new morphological variant of uterine PEComas with sex-cord-like pattern and <e>WT1</e> expression: more doubts about the existence of uterine PEComas.PEComas are rare neoplasms that are sometimes associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex. They typically contain perivascular epithelioid cells that coexpress muscle and melanocytic markers. However, apart from these classical features, considerable clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical variation has been reported. WT1, the Wilms tumor gene product, can be expressed in various tumors from different anatomical sites, including sex-cord and other ovarian tumors with a sertoliform pattern. Neither a sex-cord-like pattern nor WT1 expression has been described in PEComas. Here, we describe a case of uterine PEComa with a pattern of infiltration into the myometrium that is similar to stromal sarcomas, characterized by tongues and endovascular growing. The architecture and cellular morphology were similar to sex-cord tumors, and the PEComa was diffusely and strongly positive for WT1. We reviewed, from our files, an additional 9 cases of PEComa from different sites, and found WT1 expression in one more soft tissue tumor. We discuss the relationship between PEComas and other uterine sarcomas.",M1
20220130,"A novel Wilms tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) target gene negatively regulates the WNT signaling pathway.Mammalian kidney development requires the functions of the Wilms tumor gene WT1 and the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Recent studies have shown that WT1 negatively regulates WNT/beta-catenin signaling, but the molecular mechanisms by which WT1 inhibits WNT/beta-catenin signaling are not completely understood. In this study, we identified a gene, CXXC5, which we have renamed WID (WT1-induced Inhibitor of Dishevelled), as a novel WT1 transcriptional target that negatively regulates WNT/beta-catenin signaling. WT1 activates WID transcription through the upstream enhancer region. In the developing kidney, Wid and Wt1 are coexpressed in podocytes of maturing nephrons. Structure-function analysis demonstrated that WID interacts with Dishevelled via its C-terminal CXXC zinc finger and Dishevelled binding domains and potently inhibits WNT/beta-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. WID is evolutionarily conserved, and ablation of wid in zebrafish embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides perturbs embryonic kidney development. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the WT1 negatively regulates WNT/beta-catenin pathway via its target gene WID and further suggest a role for WID in nephrogenesis.",M1
20215353,"Genomic characterization of Wilms' tumor suppressor 1 targets in nephron progenitor cells during kidney development.The Wilms' tumor suppressor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) gene encodes a DNA- and RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in nephron progenitor differentiation during renal development. To identify WT1 target genes that might regulate nephron progenitor differentiation in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to mouse promoter microarray (ChIP-chip) using chromatin prepared from embryonic mouse kidney tissue. We identified 1663 genes bound by WT1, 86% of which contain a previously identified, conserved, high-affinity WT1 binding site. To investigate functional interactions between WT1 and candidate target genes in nephron progenitors, we used a novel, modified WT1 morpholino loss-of-function model in embryonic mouse kidney explants to knock down WT1 expression in nephron progenitors ex vivo. Low doses of WT1 morpholino resulted in reduced WT1 target gene expression specifically in nephron progenitors, whereas high doses of WT1 morpholino arrested kidney explant development and were associated with increased nephron progenitor cell apoptosis, reminiscent of the phenotype observed in Wt1(-/-) embryos. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive description of endogenous WT1 target genes in nephron progenitor cells in vivo, as well as insights into the transcriptional signaling networks controlled by WT1 that might direct nephron progenitor fate during renal development.",M1
20204298,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor <e>WT1</e> induces estrogen-independent growth and anti-estrogen insensitivity in ER-positive breast cancer MCF7 cells.A switch from estrogen-dependent to estrogen-independent growth is a critical step in malignant progression of breast cancer and is a major problem in endocrine therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly understood. The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, wt1, encodes a zinc finger protein WT1 that functions as a transcription regulator. High levels of the WT1 expression have been associated with malignancy of breast cancer. The goal of this study was to investigate the function of WT1 in malignant progression of breast cancer. We found that the high passage ER-positive breast cancer MCF7H cells expressed EGFR, HER2 and WT1 at higher levels compared to the low passage MCF7L cells. MCF7H cells responded weakly to estrogen stimulation, grew rapidly in the absence of estrogen and were insensitive to anti-estrogens such as ICI 182,780 and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OH-TAM). We also established stable cell lines from the low passage MCF7L cells to constitutively express exogenous WT1 and found elevated levels of EGFR and HER2 expression, estrogen-independent growth and anti-estrogen insensitivity in WT1-transfected MCF7L cells. These results suggested WT1 promotes estrogen-independent growth and anti-estrogen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells presumably through activation of the signaling pathways mediated by the members of EGFR family.",M1
20185795,"<e>Wt1</e> and retinoic acid signaling in the subcoelomic mesenchyme control the development of the pleuropericardial membranes and the sinus horns.RATIONALE: The cardiac venous pole is a common focus of congenital malformations and atrial arrhythmias, yet little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate its development. The systemic venous return myocardium (sinus node and sinus horns) forms only late in cardiogenesis from a pool of pericardial mesenchymal precursor cells. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms directing the formation of the fetal sinus horns. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed embryos deficient for the Wt1 (Wilms tumor 1) gene and observed a failure to form myocardialized sinus horns. Instead, the cardinal veins become embedded laterally in the pleuropericardial membranes that remain tethered to the lateral body wall by the persisting subcoelomic mesenchyme, a finding that correlates with decreased apoptosis in this region. We show by expression analysis and lineage tracing studies that Wt1 is expressed in the subcoelomic mesenchyme surrounding the cardinal veins, but that this Wt1-positive mesenchyme does not contribute cells to the sinus horn myocardium. Expression of the Raldh2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2) gene was lost from this mesenchyme in Wt1(-/-) embryos. Phenotypic analysis of Raldh2 mutant mice rescued from early cardiac defects by retinoic acid food supply revealed defects of the venous pole and pericardium highly similar to those of Wt1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Pericardium and sinus horn formation are coupled and depend on the expansion and correct temporal release of pleuropericardial membranes from the underlying subcoelomic mesenchyme. Wt1 and downstream Raldh2/retinoic acid signaling are crucial regulators of this process. Thus, our results provide novel insight into the genetic and cellular pathways regulating the posterior extension of the mammalian heart and the formation of its coelomic lining.",M1
20180815,"Sensitive immunohistochemical detection of <e>WT1</e> protein in tumors with anti-WT1 antibody against WT1 235 peptide.The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene is overexpressed in leukemia and various types of solid tumor, such as lung and colorectal cancer, and plays an oncogenic role in their tumorigenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of WT1-targeting cancer immunotherapy in clinical settings. As expression of WT1 protein in tumor cells is a prerequisite for WT1-targeting immunotherapy, immunohistochemical methods to detect WT1 protein with high sensitivity and specificity are required. In the present study, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody (WT1-R) against the 9-mer WT1 235 peptide, which is used for vaccination. The specificity of WT1-R was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting analysis, and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunocytochemistry showed the same reactivity against five cell lines (K562, Daudi, HT-180, SW480, and PC-14), whereas levels of WT1 mRNA expression determined by real-time qPCR (RT-PCR) analysis were not equivalent. Next, we examined the reactivity of WT1-R in tissue samples compared with a previously developed anti-WT1 antibody, 6F-H2. WT1-R showed greater sensitivity for detecting WT1 protein expression in samples from four different breast cancer patients than 6F-H2 antibody. The discrepancy in WT1 expression between these methods suggested that immunohistochemical detection of WT1 peptide may be advantageous for predicting the efficacy of WT1 vaccine compared to RT-PCR, and the highly sensitive WT1 antibody, WT1-R, may be useful to detect WT1 protein in tumors.",M1
20153744,"Estrogen represses SOX9 during sex determination in the red-eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta.Production of male offspring in viviparous eutherian mammals requires a sex-determining mechanism resistant to maternal hormones. This constraint is relaxed in egg-laying species, which are sensitive to hormones during sex determination and often use an increase in aromatase, the estrogen-synthesizing enzyme, as a key feminizing signal. In the turtle Trachemys scripta, sex is normally determined by temperature, but estrogen treatment overrides this cue and leads exclusively to female development. We assessed whether the expression of SOX9, a central male sex-determining gene in mammals, or three other conserved transcription factors (<e>WT1</e>, GATA4, and LHX9) was regulated by estrogen signaling in the turtle. As in mice, all somatic cell types in the immature turtle gonad initially expressed WT1 and GATA4, whereas SOX9 was restricted to the Sertoli precursors and LHX9 to the coelomic epithelium and interstitium. After the bipotential period, SOX9 was abruptly down-regulated at the female temperature. Strikingly, embryos treated with beta-estradiol at the male temperature lost SOX9 expression more than two stages earlier than controls, though WT1, GATA4, and LHX9 were unaffected. Conversely, inhibition of estrogen synthesis and signaling prevented or delayed SOX9 down-regulation at the female temperature. These results suggest that endogenous estrogen feminizes the medulla of the bipotential turtle gonad by inhibiting SOX9 expression. This mechanism may be involved in the male-to-female sex reversal in wild populations exposed to environmental estrogens, and is consistent with results showing that the estrogen receptor represses Sox9 to block transdifferentiation of granulosa cells into Sertoli-like cells in the adult mouse ovary.",M1
20150449,"A novel <e>WT1</e> gene mutation in a three-generation family with progressive isolated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilms tumor-suppressor gene-1 (WT1) plays a key role in kidney development and function. WT1 mutations usually occur in exons 8 and 9 and are associated with Denys-Drash, or in intron 9 and are associated with Frasier syndrome. However, overlapping clinical and molecular features have been reported. Few familial cases have been described, with intrafamilial variability. Sporadic cases of WT1 mutations in isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have also been reported. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: Molecular analysis of WT1 exons 8 and 9 was carried out in five members on three generations of a family with late-onset isolated proteinuria. The effect of the detected amino acid substitution on WT1 protein's structure was studied by bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Three family members reached end-stage renal disease in full adulthood. None had genital abnormalities or Wilms tumor. Histologic analysis in two subjects revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The novel sequence variant c.1208G&gt;A in WT1 exon 9 was identified in all of the affected members of the family. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of Wilms tumor or other related phenotypes suggests the expansion of WT1 gene analysis in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, regardless of age or presence of typical Denys-Drash or Frasier syndrome clinical features. Structural analysis of the mutated protein revealed that the mutation hampers zinc finger-DNA interactions, impairing target gene transcription. This finding opens up new issues about WT1 function in the maintenance of the complex gene network that regulates normal podocyte function.",M1
20132661,"Expression of <e>WT1</e> gene in multiple myeloma patients at diagnosis: is WT1 gene expression a useful marker in multiple myeloma?Monitoring patients with multiple myeloma during and after treatment for the presence of residual myeloma cells (minimal residual disease - MRD) has been shown to give a major insight into the effectiveness of treatment. It has been reported that Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) expression levels measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was useful as an indicator of minimal residual disease in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The aim of this study was to measure levels of WT1 expression, in order to find a possible association between the expression of this gene and multiple myeloma at diagnosis. If an association was found, the WT1 gene could be evaluated as an MRD marker by comparison with other prognostic factors. We investigated peripheral blood WT1 expression level measured by real-time light cycler quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 50 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. The normal WT1 gene copy number was found to be &lt;23/microl cDNA and all patients with myeloma were found to have normal WT1-mRNA levels. On this basis WT1 expression analyses is unlikely to be a useful genetic marker for routine clinical use in multiple myeloma patients at diagnosis.",M1
20132220,"Biased usage of BV gene families of T-cell receptors of <e>WT1</e> (Wilms' tumor gene)-specific CD8+ T cells in patients with myeloid malignancies.WT1 (Wilms' tumor gene 1) protein is a potent pan-tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells) are spontaneously induced in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We conducted a single-cell level comparative analysis of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCR-BV) gene families of a total of 1242 spontaneously induced WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in HLA-A*2402(+) patients with AML or MDS and those in healthy donors (HDs). This is the first report of direct usage analysis of TCR-BV gene families of individual TAA-specific CD8(+) T cells at single-cell level. Usage analysis using single-cell RT-PCR of TCR-BV gene families of individual FACS-sorted WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells showed for the first time (i) that BVs 5, 6, 20, and 27 were commonly biased in both HDs and patients; (ii) that BV4 was commonly biased in HDs and MDS patients; (iii) that BV19 was commonly biased in the patients; and (iv) that BVs 7 and 28, BVs 9 and 15, and BVs 12 and 29 were specifically biased in HDs, AML, and MDS patients, respectively. However, statistical analysis of similarity among HD, AML, and MDS of individual usage frequencies of 24 kinds of TCR-BV gene families indicated that the usage frequencies of TCR-BV gene families in AML and MDS patients reflect those in HDs. These findings represent a novel insight for a better understanding of WT1-specific immune response.",M1
20122399,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor protein <e>WT1</e> is processed by the serine protease HtrA2/Omi.The Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of genes controlling growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. It has become clear that WT1 can act as an oncogene in many tumors, primarily through the inhibition of apoptosis. Here, we identify the serine protease HtrA2 as a WT1 binding partner and find that it cleaves WT1 at multiple sites following the treatment of cells with cytotoxic drugs. Ablation of HtrA2 activity either by chemical inhibitor or by siRNA prevents the proteolysis of WT1 under apoptotic conditions. Moreover, the apoptosis-dependent cleavage of WT1 is defective in HtrA2 knockout cells. Proteolysis of WT1 by HtrA2 causes the removal of WT1 from its binding sites at gene promoters, leading to alterations in gene regulation that enhance apoptosis. Our findings provide insights into the function of HtrA2 in the regulation of apoptosis and the oncogenic activities of WT1.",M1

20080099,"Characterization and functional analyses of hepatic mesothelial cells in mouse liver development.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: At the onset of liver development, cardiac mesoderm, septum transversum mesenchyme, and endothelial cells are involved in the specification and/or proliferation of hepatoblasts. After this initial stage, however, it is unclear which cells support the proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes. Here we characterized the nature of mouse hepatic mesothelial cells (MCs) and investigated their role in organogenesis. METHODS: Using anti-podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PCLP1) and anti-mesothelin antibodies, we characterized MCs during liver development by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis. The possible role of MCs in hepatogenesis was investigated by in vitro culture and analysis of Wilms' tumor 1 homologue (<e>WT1</e>) knockout mice. RESULTS: PCLP1 was highly expressed in immature MCs, covering the surface of lobes. PCLP1 expression in MCs was down-regulated along with development, whereas mesothelin expression was up-regulated, indicating that these molecules distinguished developmental stages of MCs. The proliferation potential of MCs was high in the fetus and declined after birth. Fetal MCs expressed various growth factors and strongly enhanced the expansion of fetal hepatocytes in vitro, whereas differentiated MCs exhibited less growth factor expression, and differentiated MCs failed to enhance hepatocyte proliferation in vitro. In WT1-deficient embryos, hepatocyte proliferation was impaired due to defective MCs. CONCLUSIONS: The mesothelium is not only an inert protective sheet covering the parenchyma but also changes its characteristics dynamically during development and plays an active role in organogenesis by promoting expansion of parenchymal cells.",M1
20066433,"PPARbeta activation inhibits melanoma cell proliferation involving repression of the Wilms' tumour suppressor <e>WT1</e>.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that strongly influence molecular signalling in normal and cancer cells. Although increasing evidence suggests a role of PPARs in skin carcinogenesis, only expression of PPARgamma has been investigated in human melanoma tissues. Activation of PPARalpha has been shown to inhibit the metastatic potential, whereas stimulation of PPARgamma decreased melanoma cell proliferation. We show here that the third member of the PPAR family, PPARbeta/delta is expressed in human melanoma samples. Specific pharmacological activation of PPARbeta using GW0742 or GW501516 in low concentrations inhibits proliferation of human and murine melanoma cells. Inhibition of proliferation is accompanied by decreased expression of the Wilms' tumour suppressor 1 (WT1), which is implicated in melanoma proliferation. We demonstrate that PPARbeta directly represses WT1 as (1) PPARbeta activation represses WT1 promoter activity; (2) in chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified a binding element for PPARbeta in the WT1 promoter; (3) deletion of this binding element abolishes repression by PPARbeta and (4) the WT1 downstream molecules nestin and zyxin are down-regulated upon PPARbeta activation. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism of signalling by ligands of PPARbeta, which leads to suppression of melanoma cell growth through direct repression of WT1.",M1
20063154,"DNA-<e>WT1</e> protein interaction studied  by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.Interactions of proteins with DNA play an important role in regulating the biological functions of DNA. Here we propose and demonstrate the detection of protein-DNA binding using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). In this method, double-stranded DNA molecules with potential protein-binding sites are labeled with dye molecules and immobilized on metal nanoparticles. The binding of proteins protects the DNA from complete digestion by exonuclease and can be detected by measuring the SERS signals before and after the exonuclease digestion. As a proof of concept, this SERS-based protein-DNA interaction assay is validated by studying the binding of a zinc finger transcription factor WT1 with DNA sequences derived from the promoter of the human vascular endothelial growth factor.",M1
20038731,"Single nucleotide polymorphism in the mutational hotspot of <e>WT1</e> predicts a favorable outcome in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.PURPOSE: We assessed the prognostic impact of a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the mutational hotspot of WT1 in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) in the context of other prognostic markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: WT1 exons 7 and 9 from 249 CN-AML patients from multicenter treatment trials AML-SHG Hannover 0199 (Clinical Trials Identifier NCT00209833) and 0295, and 50 healthy volunteers were analyzed by direct sequencing. NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and MLL were assessed for mutations and WT1 expression was quantified. RESULTS: The minor allele of SNP rs16754 (WT1(AG/GG)) was found in 25.7% of CN-AML patients' blasts and germline DNA and in 36% of healthy volunteers. Patient characteristics, frequencies of mutations, or WT1 expression levels were similarly distributed between patients homozygous for the major allele compared with patients heterozygous or homozygous for the minor allele. SNP rs16754 status was an independent predictor of relapse-free survival (RFS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.81; P = .005) and overall survival (OS; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.74; P = .002) in multivariate analysis. The favorable effect of SNP rs16754 was stronger in NPM1/FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene) high-risk patients compared with NPM1/FLT3-ITD low-risk patients. Favorable prognosis could not be identified by any other known low-risk marker in half the patients with at least one minor allele (13% of all patients). No difference for complete remission rate, RFS, or OS was found between patients with or without acquired WT1 mutations. CONCLUSION: WT1 SNP rs16754 may be a novel independent favorable-risk marker in CN-AML patients that might improve risk and treatment stratification.",M1
20032452,"Correlation between <e>WT1</e> expression and cell proliferation in endometrial cancer.BACKGROUND: The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 is overexpressed in endometrial cancer. Although recent studies have revealed that WT1 is a new prognostic factor, it remains unclear whether WT1 plays a pathophysiological role including cell proliferation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 70 endometrial cancer patients who had undergone a curative resection was studied by immunohistochemistry to determine the correlation between WT1 expression and cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PCNA). RESULTS: WT1 expression was observed in 64 cases (91%). WT1 expression was associated with advanced FIGO stage (p=0.0228), myometrial invasion (p=0.0114) and high-grade histological differentiation (p=0.0004), indicating up-regulation of WT1 expression with tumor progression. A positive correlation between PCNA labeling index and score of WT1 expression was observed (p=0.0081, rho=0.319). CONCLUSION: These results showed that WT1 might regulate cell proliferation in endometrial cancer.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with WT1/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*2402-positive gynecological cancer were included in a Phase II clinical trial of WT1 vaccine therapy. In all the patients, the tumors were resistant to standard therapy. The patients received intradermal injections of a HLA-A*2402-restricted, modified 9-mer WT1 peptide every week for 12 weeks. Tumor size, which was measured by computed tomography (CT), was determined every 4 weeks. The responses were analyzed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). RESULTS: The protocol was well tolerated; only local erythema occurred at the WT1 vaccine injection site. The clinical responses were as follows: stable disease (SD) in 3 patients and progressive disease (PD) in 9 patients. No patients had a complete (CR) or partial response (PR). The disease control rate was 25.0%. CONCLUSION: Although a small, uncontrolled, nonrandomized trial, this study showed that WT1 vaccine therapy for patients with gynecological cancer was safe and produced a clinical response.",M1
20031209,"Prognostic significance of <e>WT1</e> mRNA and anti-WT1 antibody levels in peripheral blood in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.Wilms tumor gene (WT1) mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells was examined in 80 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MDS. Serum anti-WT1 antibody titers were also determined in 45 patients. Their long-term follow-up showed that the survival rate became worse as the WT1 mRNA level increased. In particular, a high WT1 mRNA level was a strong predictor of a short time to AML transformation even if adjusted by the International Prognostic Scoring System category. Moreover, high values of anti-WT1 antibody were an independent predictor of longer survival. These data may justify therapeutic strategies targeting WT1 molecules in MDS.",M1
20026798,"Favorable prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations in older patients with cytogenetically normal de novo acute myeloid leukemia and associated gene- and microRNA-expression signatures: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.PURPOSE: To analyze the prognostic significance of NPM1 mutations, and the associated gene- and microRNA-expression signatures in older patients with de novo, cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-eight adults age &gt;or= 60 years with de novo CN-AML, enrolled onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols 9720 and 10201, were studied at diagnosis for NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and <e>WT1</e> mutations, and gene- and microRNA-expression profiles. RESULTS: Patients with NPM1 mutations (56%) had higher complete remission (CR) rates (84% v 48%; P &lt; .001) and longer disease-free survival (DFS; P = .047; 3-year rates, 23% v 10%) and overall survival (OS; P &lt; .001; 3-year rates, 35% v 8%) than NPM1 wild-type patients. In multivariable analyses, NPM1 mutations remained independent predictors for higher CR rates (P &lt; .001) and longer DFS (P = .004) and OS (P &lt; .001), after adjustment for other prognostic clinical and molecular variables. Unexpectedly, the prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations was mainly observed in patients &gt;or= 70 years. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles associated with NPM1 mutations were similar across older patient age groups and similar to those in younger (&lt; 60 years) patients with CN-AML. These profiles were characterized by upregulation of HOX genes and their embedded microRNAs and downregulation of the prognostically adverse MN1, BAALC, and ERG genes. CONCLUSION: NPM1 mutations have favorable prognostic impact in older patients with CN-AML, especially those age &gt;or= 70 years. The gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggest that NPM1 mutations constitute a marker defining a biologically homogeneous entity in CN-AML that might be treated with specific and/or targeted therapies across age groups.",M1
20023660,"<e>Wt1</e> is required for cardiovascular progenitor cell formation through transcriptional control of Snail and E-cadherin.The epicardial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is hypothesized to generate cardiovascular progenitor cells that differentiate into various cell types, including coronary smooth muscle and endothelial cells, perivascular and cardiac interstitial fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Here we show that an epicardial-specific knockout of the gene encoding Wilms' tumor-1 (Wt1) leads to a reduction in mesenchymal progenitor cells and their derivatives. We show that Wt1 is essential for repression of the epithelial phenotype in epicardial cells and during embryonic stem cell differentiation through direct transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding Snail (Snai1) and E-cadherin (Cdh1), two of the major mediators of EMT. Some mesodermal lineages do not form in Wt1-null embryoid bodies, but this effect is rescued by the expression of Snai1, underscoring the importance of EMT in generating these differentiated cells. These new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cardiovascular progenitor cells and EMT will shed light on the pathogenesis of heart diseases and may help the development of cell-based therapies.",M1

Numerous novel molecular abnormalities have been identified and investigated in recent years adding to the risk stratification and prognostication of conventional karyotyping. Mutations in the Wilms Tumour 1 (WT1) gene were first described more than a decade ago but their clinical significance has only recently been evaluated. WT1 mutations occur in approximately 10% of adult AML patients at diagnosis and are most frequent in the cytogenetically normal (CN) AML subgroup. These mutations appear to confer a negative prognostic outcome by increasing the risk of relapse and death. Mutation frequency is higher in pediatric patients and also appears to confer a negative impact on relapse and survival. Herein, we discuss the importance of WT1 mutations in AML.",M1
19969384,"Evaluation of podocyte lesion in patients with diabetic nephropathy: Wilms' tumor-1 protein used as a podocyte marker.INTRODUCTION: The reduction of podocyte number and density per glomerulus has been linked to the development of proteinuria and the progression of disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, it has been recognized that measurement of podocyte number by light microscope is quite difficult because of the complexity of both podocyte and glomerular structure, which is not suitable for clinical research. In our research institute, we used <e>WT1</e> as podocyte marker to evaluate the podocyte lesion. METHODS: In our experiment, we selected the C-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the nuclei and the N-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes. Forty patients were enrolled with type 2 diabetes and proven to have DN by renal biopsy analysis. DN patients were classified into three groups based on the degree of proteinuria: microalbuminuria (n=10, 30-300mg/24h), overt proteinuria (n=15, 0.5-3.5g/24h), and heavy proteinuria (n=15, &gt;3.5g/24h). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the podocyte number was markedly decreased in patients with DN (30-51% reduction). There was a significant negative correlation between the proteinuria and both podocyte density and number. The cover area density of podocyte cytoplasma in glomerulus was also significantly decreased in all DN patients (39-80% reduction). A significant inverse correlation was observed between the cover area density and the degree of proteinuria. The correlation coefficient (r=-0.85) was much higher than that between proteinuria and podocyte density (r=-0.56) or podocyte number (r=-0.36). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, podocyte damage occurred in patients with DN, even in the early stage and became more dramatic during the course of proteinuria progression. WT1 staining, using the polyclonal antibody to stain the nuclei and monoclonal antibody to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes together, is a valuable alternative technique in the study of podocyte injury.",M1
19967725,"Characterization of the molecular differences between ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and ovarian serous carcinoma.The histopathological diagnosis of high-grade endometrioid and serous carcinoma of the ovary is poorly reproducible under the current morphology based classification system, especially for anaplastic, high-grade tumours. The transcription factor Wilms' tumour-1 (<e>WT1</e>) is differentially expressed among the gynaecological epithelia from which epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) are believed to originate. In EOCs, WT1 protein is observed in the majority of serous carcinomas and in up to 30% of endometrioid carcinomas. It is unclear whether the latter is a reflection of the actual incidence of WT1 protein expression in endometrioid carcinomas, or whether a significant number of high-grade serous carcinomas have been misclassified as endometrioid carcinoma. Several genetic aberrations are reported to occur in EOCs. These include mutation of the TP53 gene, aberrant activation of beta-catenin signalling and loss of PTEN protein expression, among others. It is unclear whether these aberrations are histotype-specific. The aim of this study was to better define the molecular characteristics of serous and endometrioid carcinomas in an attempt to address the problems with the current histopathological classification methods. Gene expression profiles were analysed to identify reproducible gene expression phenotypes for endometrioid and serous carcinomas. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were used to assess the incidence of TP53, beta-catenin and PTEN aberrations in order to correlate their occurrence with WT1 as an immunohistochemistry based biomarker of serous histotype. It was found that nuclear WT1 protein expression can identify misclassified high-grade endometrioid carcinomas and these tumours should be reassigned to serous histotype. Although low-grade endometrioid carcinomas rarely progress to high-grade carcinomas, a combined WT1-negative, TP53-positive immunophenotype may identify an uncommon high-grade subtype of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma.

19966868,"Actin: a novel interaction partner of <e>WT1</e> influencing its cell dynamic properties.The Wilms' tumour suppressor, WT1, is a zinc finger protein with key roles in normal development of the genitourinary system and tumourigenesis. Mutations or deletion of WT1 result in a spectrum of developmental disorders and susceptibility to Wilms' tumour in children. Ectopic expression of Wt1 associated with oncogenic functions has been observed in a large number of malignancies, including haematological and solid cancers. Although Wt1 is predominantly a nuclear protein in normal tissues, it is mostly cytoplasmic in the majority of Wt1-expressing tumours. Actin was identified in this study as a new WT1 interaction partner both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. We confirmed this interaction both in vitro and in vivo and started to explore its functional significance. Perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton moved Wt1 off the polysome fraction in the cytoplasm, cancelled its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and altered Wt1 DNA- and RNA-binding abilities. These data have implications for Wt1 functions in relation to RNA metabolism and response to cytoskeletal alterations in cancer cells. Thus, our findings could shed more light on the functions of both these proteins and possibly pave way for the development of new cancer therapies.",M1
19921279,"Frasier syndrome, a potential cause of end-stage renal failure in childhood.The diagnosis of Frasier syndrome is based on the association of male pseudohermaphroditism (as a result of gonadal dysgenesis), with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), which progresses to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) during adolescence or adulthood. Frasier syndrome results from mutations in the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene <e>WT1</e>, which is responsible for alterations in male genital development and podocyte dysfunction. We describe the case of a 7-year-old girl who was referred to the paediatric emergency department with ESRF. Haemodialysis was started immediately because of severe hypertension and hyperkalaemia. In view of the fact that our patient had a past medical history of pseudohermaphroditism, we suspected that the acute presentation in ESRF may be related to a new diagnosis of Frasier syndrome. Our hypothesis was confirmed on examination of the medical records. There had been no medical follow-up for several years and, in particular, no renal imaging or functional assessment had ever been performed. This lack of surveillance explains why our patient presented with ESRF much earlier in this disease than expected and subsequently had to undergo kidney transplantation at a very young age.",M1
19903853,"Improved expression and reactivity of transduced tumor-specific TCRs in human lymphocytes by specific silencing of endogenous TCR.Adoptive T-cell therapy using lymphocytes genetically engineered to express tumor antigen-specific TCRs is an attractive strategy for treating patients with malignancies. However, there are potential drawbacks to this strategy: mispairing of the introduced TCR alpha/beta chains with the endogenous TCR subunits and competition of CD3 molecules between the introduced and endogenous TCRs can impair cell surface expression of the transduced TCR, resulting in insufficient function and potential generation of autoreactive T cells. In addition, the risk of tumor development following the infusion of cells with aberrant vector insertion sites increases with the vector copy number in the transduced cells. In this study, we developed retroviral vectors encoding both small interfering RNA constructs that specifically down-regulate endogenous TCR and a codon-optimized, small interfering RNA-resistant TCR specific for the human tumor antigens MAGE-A4 or <e>WT1</e>. At low copy numbers of the integrated vector, the transduced human lymphocytes exhibited high surface expression of the introduced tumor-specific TCR and reduced expression of endogenous TCRs. In consequence, the vector-transduced lymphocytes showed enhanced cytotoxic activity against antigen-expressing tumor cells. Therefore, our novel TCR gene therapy may open a new gate for effective immunotherapy in cancer patients.",M1
19876656,"Adequate use of allele frequencies in Hispanics--a problem elucidated in nephrotic syndrome.Previous studies in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and nephrotic syndrome (NS) in the USA have revealed inter-ethnic differences in their clinical presentation and outcome. However, ethnicity was based on self-identification rather than on molecular genetic data. Here, we show that genetic heterogeneity exists in self-identified Hispanic (Spanish-American) patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), as patients may be either of Caucasian or Mesoamerican (Native-American) genetic background. Twenty-one self-identified Hispanic patients with SRNS from 18 families were initially evaluated for mutations in the NPHS2 and <e>WT1</e> genes. All patients resided and were cared for in the USA. We performed a total genome search for linkage in all Hispanic patients using 250K single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, comparing Caucasian with Mesoamerican allele frequencies to determine regions of homozygosity by descent and to establish the correct allele frequency for each family. We found that only ten families (56%) of the 18 self-identified Hispanic families are genetically of Mesoamerican descent, whereas the other eight families (44%) are of Caucasian descent. Due to the small number of families examined, we were unable to draw any conclusion on the prevalence of NPHS2 and WT1 in this ethnic group, but the data do suggest that self-identification of ethnicity in Hispanic-American patients is not an adequate basis for genetic studies, as this cohort may represent not only patients of Mesoamerican origin but also patients of Caucasian origin. Thus, one needs to critically review previous studies of FSGS/SRNS patients that involved Hispanic patients as a group. Future larger studies may employ a total genome search for linkage to test self-identified Hispanic ethnicity for true Mesoamerican versus Caucasian ethnicity in order to generate valid genetic data.",M1
19874722,"Characterisation of ATRX, DMRT1, DMRT7 and <e>WT1</e> in the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus).One of the most puzzling aspects of monotreme reproductive biology is how they determine sex in the absence of the SRY gene that triggers testis development in most other mammals. Although monotremes share a XX female/XY male sex chromosome system with other mammals, their sex chromosomes show homology to the chicken Z chromosome, including the DMRT1 gene, which is a dosage-dependent sex determination gene in birds. In addition, monotremes feature an extraordinary multiple sex chromosome system. However, no sex determination gene has been identified as yet on any of the five X or five Y chromosomes and there is very little knowledge about the conservation and function of other known genes in the monotreme sex determination and differentiation pathway. We have analysed the expression pattern of four evolutionarily conserved genes that are important at different stages of sexual development in therian mammals. DMRT1 is a conserved sex-determination gene that is upregulated in the male developing gonad in vertebrates, while DMRT7 is a mammal-specific spermatogenesis gene. ATRX, a chromatin remodelling protein, lies on the therian X but there is a testis-expressed Y-copy in marsupials. However, in monotremes, the ATRX orthologue is autosomal. WT1 is an evolutionarily conserved gene essential for early gonadal formation in both sexes and later in testis development. We show that these four genes in the adult platypus have the same expression pattern as in other mammals, suggesting that they have a conserved role in sexual development independent of genomic location.",M1

Pancreas and ovary are among the organs that are usually evaluated as a source of primary. The purpose of this study is to investigate a panel of immunohistochemical stains to help differentiate pancreatic from ovarian carcinoma. We evaluated the immunohistochemical staining of eight commercially available antibodies MUC1, MUC2, MUC5ac, Wilm's tumor susceptibility gene 1 (<e>WT1</e>), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, CA125, and CA19.9 in 25 effusion specimens with evidence of metastatic carcinoma including 14 ovarian serous carcinomas, 9 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and 2 unknown primaries.

19853363,"New insights into DNA-binding behavior of Wilms tumor protein (<e>WT1</e>)--a dual study.Wilms Tumor suppressor protein (WT1) is a transcription factor that is involved in a variety of developmental functions during organ development. It is also implicated in the pathology of several different cancer forms. The protein contains four C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers and it specifically binds GC-rich sequences in the promoter regions of its target genes, which are either up or down regulated. Two properties make WT1 a more unusual transcription factor - an unconventional amino acid composition for zinc finger 1, and the insertion of a tri-peptide KTS in some of the splice isoforms of WT1. Using six WT1 constructs in which zinc fingers are systematically deleted, a dual study based on a bacterial 1-hybrid system and surface plasmon resonance measurements is performed. The experiments show that the effect of zinc finger 1 is not significant in terms of overall DNA-binding kinetics, however it influences both the specificity of target recognition and stability of interaction in presence of KTS. The KTS insertion, however, only mildly retards binding affinity, mainly by affecting the on-rate. We suggest that the insertion disturbs zinc finger 4 from its binding frame, thus weakening the rate of target recognition. Finally, for the construct in which both zinc fingers 1 and 4 were deleted, the two middle fingers 2-3 still could function as a 'minimal DNA-recognition domain' for WT1, however the formation of a stable protein-DNA complex is impaired since the overall affinity was dramatically reduced mainly since the off-rate was severely affected.",M1

We examined the expression and regulation of Smoc1 and Smoc2 in fetal gonad/mesonephros complexes to discover possible roles for these genes in gonad and mesonephros development. Smoc1 was upregulated at approximately E10.75 in a center-to-poles wave in pre-Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells and its expression was greatly reduced in <e>Wt1</e>, Sf1, and Fog2 mutants. After E13.5, Smoc1 was downregulated in an anterior-to-posterior wave in granulosa cells but persisted in Sertoli cells, suggesting a sexually dimorphic requirement in supporting cell lineage differentiation. Smoc2 was expressed in Leydig cells, mesonephroi, and Wnt4 mutant ovaries, but not wildtype ovaries. Using organ culture, we determined that Smoc2 expression was dependent on Hedgehog signaling in testes, mesonephroi, and kidneys. Overall, these results demonstrate that SMOC1 and SMOC2 may mediate intercellular signaling and cell type-specific differentiation during gonad and reproductive tract development.",M1

19808230,"Dystroglycan in the diagnosis of FSGS.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: alpha- and beta-dystroglycan (DG), which link the actin cytoskeleton of the podocyte to the glomerular basement membrane, are maintained in FSGS but decreased in minimal change disease (MCD). Fibrosis has been linked to increased fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We studied DG, FSP1, and podocyte differentiation in FSGS variants and cases of suspected FSGS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We studied renal biopsies with FSGS, not otherwise specified (NOS), tip lesion, or collapsing variants (COLL), versus secondary FSGS or cases without segmental sclerotic lesions where a diagnosis of MCD versus FSGS could not be established (undefined [UNDEF]) and compared the expression of DG, FSP1, and podocyte Wilms' tumor antigen (<e>WT1</e>). RESULTS: WT1 is markedly decreased in NOS versus normal and correlates with the extent of sclerosis. alpha- and beta-DG are maintained in most primary and secondary FSGS cases. In contrast, alpha-DG is significantly decreased in UNDEF, supporting a diagnosis of MCD. Furthermore, follow-up shows remission or decreased proteinuria in four of six of these UNDEF cases in response to therapy. Interstitial FSP1 is numerically highest in COLL but is only rarely found in tubules or podocytes in any other forms of FSGS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased FSP1 may be a marker of the aggressive course of collapsing FSGS. Furthermore, DG staining is a useful adjunct to assist in distinction of FSGS versus MCD in biopsies without defining lesions.",M1
19797313,"A murine model of Denys-Drash syndrome reveals novel transcriptional targets of <e>WT1</e> in podocytes.The Wilms tumor-suppressor gene WT1, a key player in renal development, also has a crucial role in maintenance of the glomerulus in the mature kidney. However, molecular pathways orchestrated by WT1 in podocytes, where it is highly expressed, remain unknown. Their defects are thought to modify the cross-talk between podocytes and other glomerular cells and ultimately lead to glomerular sclerosis, as observed in diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) a nephropathy associated with WT1 mutations. To identify podocyte WT1 targets, we generated a novel DMS mouse line, performed gene expression profiling in isolated glomeruli and identified excellent candidates that may modify podocyte differentiation and growth factor signaling in glomeruli. Scel, encoding sciellin, a protein of the cornified envelope in the skin, and Sulf1, encoding a 6-O endosulfatase, are shown to be expressed in wild-type podocytes and to be strongly down-regulated in mutants. Co-expression of Wt1, Scel and Sulf1 was also found in a mesonephric cell line, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of WT1 decreased Scel and Sulf1 mRNAs and proteins. By ChIP we show that Scel and Sulf1 are direct WT1 targets. Cyp26a1, encoding an enzyme involved in the degradation of retinoic acid, is shown to be up-regulated in mutant podocytes. Cyp26a1 may play a role in the development of glomerular lesions but does not seem to be regulated by WT1. These results provide novel clues in our understanding of normal glomerular function and early events involved in glomerulosclerosis.",M1
19781628,"Serine threonine receptor-associated protein (STRAP) plays a role in the maintenance of mesenchymal morphology.The stromal tissue, made of extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells, is vital for the functional design of all complex tissues. Fibroblasts are key components of stromal tissue and play a crucial role during organ development, wound repair, angiogenesis and fibrosis. We have previously reported the identification of a novel WD-domain protein, STRAP(1) that inhibits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling and enhances tumorigenicity via TGF-beta-dependent and TGF-beta-independent mechanisms. Here, we report, for the first time, that deletion of STRAP from Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) results in a loss of mesenchymal morphology. These cells lose their spindle shape and exhibit features of an epithelial morphology. Gene expression profiling has confirmed that deletion of STRAP affects expression of sets of genes important for diverse functions including cell-cell adhesion and cell polarization, and upregulates E-cadherin expression leading to the formation of adherens junctions, subsequent localization of beta-catenin to the cell membrane and downregulation of the mesenchymal markers like LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1). Upregulation of <e>WT1</e> (Wilms tumor homolog 1) in STRAP null MEFs plays a role in E-cadherin induction. Finally, stable expression of STRAP in these cells results in a loss of WT1 and E-cadherin expressions, and a reversal from epithelial to the mesenchymal morphology. Thus, these results provide a novel TGF-beta-independent function of STRAP and describe a mechanism for the role of STRAP in the maintenance of mesenchymal morphology.",M1
19776535,"<e>WT1</e> mRNA level in peripheral blood is a sensitive biomarker for monitoring minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia.The Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) encodes a transcription factor that is involved in normal cellular development and cell survival. WT1 mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with hematopoietic malignancy patients, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MRD represents the condition with the low levels of leukemia cells in the bone marrow and is known as a sign of recurrence. In hematopoietic malignancies, definition of remission is based on the lack of MRD at submicroscopic level. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we started to measure WT1 mRNA levels in the peripheral blood (PB) from patients by quantitative real-time PCR in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. Three hundreds and eight samples from 95 patients were evaluated. The patients included AML (55 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (11), myelodysplastic syndrome (20), malignant lymphoma (5), chronic myeloid leukemia (1), prostatic carcinoma (1), and leukopenia (2). Among the 55 AML patients, 21 patients were pretreated with remission induction therapy. In the clinical course of 21 patients, timely therapeutic approaches could be started for relapse by the early detection of WT1 mRNA overexpression before the morphological findings were apparent. Monitoring WT1 mRNA is helpful to identify patients at high-risk relapse. High overall survival rate (71.2%, 15/21, median: 24.6 months, range 1.1-35.6 months) was achieved in 3 years. The overall survival rate of 34 post-treatment patients was 61.7% (median: 23.5 months, range 0.13-126.5 months after treatment start). In conclusion, the WT1 mRNA level is a sensitive biomarker for monitoring MRD.",M1

Although structural changes such as podocyte hypertrophy are considered to be associated with podocyte loss, the relationship has not been thoroughly investigated using human DN renal tissues. METHODS: The subjects were 17 patients with DN diagnosed histopathologically by renal biopsy. Immunostaining was performed with antibodies for Wilm's tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) and synaptopodin (SPD), which are markers of podocytes, to determine the number of podocytes and assess podocyte hypertrophy. RESULTS: The number of podocytes was decreased in DN patients compared with the controls. An inverse correlation was observed between the number of podocytes and both the urinary protein excretion and the extent of mesangial expansion. Podocyte hypertrophy was also more marked in DN patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, podocyte loss and hypertrophy were suggested to be involved in the development and progression of human DN.",M1

The aim of this study is to extend these observations to a self-protein and clinically relevant tumor antigen associated with most types of adult leukemia: Wilms tumor gene 1 (<e>WT1</e>). We demonstrate that an E. coli coexpressing LLO and WT1 is capable of inducing a strong antitumor effect against WT1-expressing tumors in vivo through its ability to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and inhibit the function of Foxp3 T-regulatory cells. Furthermore, we have characterized the immunodominant epitope involved in this effect (NAPYLPSCL) and demonstrated that coinjection of NAPYLPSCL with E. coli-LLO resulted in an antitumor effect largely equivalent to that obtained with E. coli-LLO/WT1. Our data demonstrate that the results obtained with a clinically irrelevant model tumor antigen remain valid with a  real  tumor antigen and that the adjuvant properties of the E. coli-LLO vaccine can be exploited in conjunction with peptides. The results obtained in this study will facilitate the translation of this work to human studies by combining antigenic motifs relevant to specific human leukocyte antigen haplotypes with the adjuvant effect of E. coli-LLO.",M1

In humans, it signals through the TPalpha and TPbeta isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters Prm1 and Prm3, respectively. Herein, the consequence of megakaryocytic differentiation on Prm1-directed TPalpha expression was investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment substantially increased TPalpha mRNA and Prm1-directed gene expression in human erythroleukemia and K562 cells. Deletional analyses localized the major responsive element(s) to the upstream -8500 to -7504 region while mutation of four WT1/Egr1/Sp1 cis elements therein established that each contributes to the induction. Moreover, PMA increased Egr1, but not WT1 or Sp1, expression while the NGFI-A-binding protein 1 co-repressor impaired PMA induction of Egr1- and Prm1-directed gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitations established that WT1 is predominantly bound in vivo to the 5' Prm1 region in non-differentiated human erythroleukemia cells. In response to PMA, there was initial induction in Egr1 and associated reduction in WT1 binding to Prm1 in vivo, which was displaced by Sp1 following sustained treatment. Collectively, data establish that regulated WT1 followed by sequential Egr1 and Sp1 binding to elements within Prm1 mediate repression and subsequent induction of TPalpha during differentiation into the megakaryocytic phenotype, shedding significant insights into factors regulating TPalpha expression therein.",M1

In addition, the distinction between malignant and benign gynecologic tract smooth muscle tumors on morphologic grounds can be challenging. Using a series of tissue microarrays that contain 245 cases of leiomyosarcomas (102 gynecologic) with survival data, and 49 cases of uterine leiomyoma, we examined the ability of selected immune-markers (estrogen receptor (ER) and <e>WT1</e>) to distinguish between leiomyosarcomas of gynecologic and nongynecologic origin. In addition, we examined whether immunostains for p16, p53 and Ki-67 could distinguish between malignant and benign gynecologic smooth muscle tumors. ER nuclear positivity was observed in 3 and 50% of the nongynecologic and gynecologic leiomyosarcomas, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Nuclear WT1 positivity was seen in 0 and 8% of the nongynecologic and gynecologic leiomyosarcomas, respectively (P&lt;0.001). 87% of primary gynecologic leiomyosarcomas and 2% of uterine leiomyomas showed diffuse (&gt;or=50% of cells) p16 staining (P&lt;0.001). 23% of gynecologic leiomyosarcomas showed p53 immunopositivity (&gt;or=50% of cells) whereas none of the leiomyomas were positive for p53 (P&lt;0.001). 65% of the gynecologic leiomyosarcomas and 0% of the leiomyomas exhibited &gt;10% Ki-67 proliferation index (P&lt;0.001). Diffuse p16 and p53 immunopositivity and high Ki-67 proliferation index, singly or in combination, yielded an overall sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98% for distinguishing between gynecologic leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas and can be used as indicators of malignancy for gynecologic smooth muscle tumors. Although ER positivity can be used to support the gynecologic origin of a leiomyosarcomas, nuclear WT1 immunostaining is of little use.",M1

19667332,"<e>WT1</e> and Bcl2 expression in melanocytic lesions of the conjunctiva: an immunohistochemical study of 123 cases.OBJECTIVE: Recent studies indicate that WT1 and Bcl2 protein are detected in melanocytic lesions of the skin. We examined, for the first time, WT1 and Bcl2 expression in a variety of conjunctival melanocytic lesions to evaluate their diagnostic utility compared with other melanocytic markers. METHODS: Protein expression and localization of WT1 and Bcl2 were studied by means of immunolabeling and semiquantification in 123 conjunctival melanocytic lesions (71 benign nevi, 21 atypical nevi, 11 primary acquired melanosis, and 20 malignant melanomas). Ancillary immunohistochemical studies were performed with Bcl2, S100, HMB45, and Melan A antibodies. RESULTS: WT1 showed a graded increase in expression in lesions with increasing atypia. Higher mean numbers of WT1-positive cells correlated with increasing atypia in melanocytes. In all cases, Bcl2 expression was positive and more robust than was S100, HMB45, or Melan A expression. WT1 and HMB45 frequently showed diffuse and strong staining in atypical nevi, primary acquired melanosis with atypia, and malignant melanomas compared with benign lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl2 is a highly sensitive immunohistochemical marker for melanocytic tumors of the conjunctiva; HMB45 and WT1 staining distinguishes benign from malignant lesions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results show that HMB45 and WT1 immunolabeling is helpful in the evaluation of conjunctival melanocytic lesions. Accordingly, we recommend the development of an immunohistochemical panel to classify these lesions.",M1
19666820,"A highly conserved retinoic acid responsive element controls wt1a expression in the zebrafish pronephros.The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene <e>Wt1</e> encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in organ development, most notably of the kidney. Despite its importance for organogenesis, knowledge of the regulation of Wt1 expression is scarce. Here, we have used transgenesis in zebrafish harboring two wt1 genes, wt1a and wt1b, in order to define regulatory elements that drive wt1 expression in the kidney. Stable transgenic lines with approximately 30 kb of the upstream genomic regions of wt1a or wt1b almost exactly recapitulated endogenous expression of the wt1 paralogs. In the case of wt1b, we have identified an enhancer that is located in the far upstream region that is necessary and sufficient for reporter gene expression in the pronephric glomeruli. Regarding wt1a, we could also identify an enhancer that is located approximately 4 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site that is required for expression in the intermediate mesoderm. Interestingly, this intermediate mesoderm enhancer is highly conserved between fish and mammals, is bound by members of the retinoic acid receptor family of transcription factors in gel shift experiments and mediates responsiveness to retinoic acid both in vivo and in cell culture. To our knowledge, this is the first functional demonstration of defined regulatory elements controlling Wt1 expression in vivo. The identification of kidney-specific enhancer elements will help us to better understand the integration of extracellular signals into intracellular networks in nephrogenesis.",M1
19650884,"High <e>WT1</e> gene expression before haematopoietic stem cell transplant in children with acute myeloid leukaemia predicts poor event-free survival.WT1 gene expression has been proposed as a useful marker of minimal residual disease in leukaemia. Its utility in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been studied. We studied the prognostic value of WT1 expression in peripheral blood prior to HSCT in 36 children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Samples were obtained 2 weeks pre-transplant to determine the level of WT1 expression. WT1 expression was normalized using K562 cells as a control and a relative value of 0.5 was chosen as the cut-off point between high and low WT1 expression. The median level of pre-transplant WT1 expression in the 36 patients was 0.09 (range 0.0001-11.0), with 11 patients having WT1 &gt;or= 0.5 and 25, WT1 &lt; 0.5. After HSCT, 76% of patients with high pre-transplant WT1 expression relapsed, in contrast to 0% of the patients with low WT1 expression. Those with high WT1 expression had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (18%, 95% CI 0-40%) as compared to those with low WT1 expression (68%, 95% CI 50-86%, P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that pre-transplant WT1 level is the only significant prognostic factor for the difference in EFS. Our finding suggests that elevated WT1 gene expression before HSCT in paediatric AML predicts relapse and poor long-term EFS. A larger prospective study is warranted to compare the value of high WT1 expression and other markers of minimal residue disease in predicting clinical outcomes after HSCT.",M1
19643169,"Testicular gene expression profiling following 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol exposure in male rats reveals abnormal expression of the actin binding protein cortactin in degenerating spermatocytes.The glycol ether solvents 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) and 2-ethoxyethanol (2-EE) produce testicular toxicity characterized by spermatocyte degeneration, while a similar glycol ether, 2-butoxyethanol (2-BE), has no testicular effects. The goal of the current study was to better understand the mechanism of glycol ether testicular toxicity through gene expression profiling and functional classification of differentially expressed genes. Male rats were administered 2-ME (150 and 50mg/kg/day), 2-EE (500 mg/kg/day), 2-BE (125 mg/kg/day), or vehicle for 3 days, and testes were collected for histopathological and gene expression analysis. Histopathological changes in the testes were observed only in animals given 150 mg/kg/day 2-ME, consisting of degeneration and necrosis of spermatocytes and reductions in spermatocyte numbers. Microarray analysis of testicular samples from these animals revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes from animals exposed to 2-EE or to 50mg/kg or 150 mg/kg 2-ME (&gt;900 each at &gt;1.5-fold changed), compared to 28 genes from 2-BE treated animals. Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) analysis of these genes demonstrated statistical enrichment in genes in categories including protein transport, endocytosis, protein kinase activity, cell cycle, and meiosis. Quantitative PCR confirmation of select genes confirmed increased expression of the actin binding protein cortactin and the transcription factor Wilm's tumor 1 (<e>Wt1</e>) following 2-ME exposure. Increased localization of cortactin in abnormal spermatocytes was also observed by immunohistochemistry, consistent with a possible role for this protein in the mechanism of toxicity.",M1
19626649,"Cluster analysis of immunohistochemical markers in leiomyosarcoma delineates specific anatomic and gender subgroups.BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can be categorized into uterine, retroperitoneal, nonretroperitoneal soft tissue, cutaneous, visceral, and osseous anatomic subtypes. The differential expression of smooth muscle markers, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Wilms tumor-1 protein (<e>WT1</e>) by anatomic subtype and gender was explored. METHODS: A total of 78 LMS comprised of 30 uterine and 48 nonuterine tumors were studied. Nonuterine tumors were comprised of 17 soft tissue, 16 retroperitoneal, 7 cutaneous, 5 visceral, and 3 osseous subtypes. Immunohistochemical staining intensity on tissue microarray slides was scored as 0, 1+, or 2+, and cluster analysis was performed on the data. RESULTS: Smooth muscle actin was the most sensitive antibody (95%), followed by muscle-specific actin (91%), calponin (88%), desmin (73%), caldesmon (66%), and myosin (64%). Caldesmon and myosin were usually coexpressed, and were highest in retroperitoneal tumors (94%). There was no discernable correlation noted between histologic differentiation and smooth muscle marker expression. ER was much more common in women, with the highest frequencies noted in female retroperitoneal (86%) and uterine (63%) tumors. Nuclear WT1 was expressed in 11% of all tumors, and was limited to ER-positive uterine and female retroperitoneal tumors. Cluster analysis segregated 4 groups, most notably 1 driven by ER and PR, with the vast majority being uterine and female retroperitoneal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Smooth muscle markers demonstrated variable sensitivities in LMS, with a tendency for anatomic subtypes to segregate based on expression patterns of these markers. ER defined a subgroup of uterine and female retroperitoneal tumors, and WT1 was limited to such tumors, suggesting a common line of differentiation as well as potential therapeutic targets.",M1
19624538,"RQ-PCR based <e>WT1</e> expression in comparison to BCR-ABL quantification can predict Philadelphia negative clonal evolution in patients with imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukaemia.A retrospective comparison of WT1 and BCR-ABL1 expression was performed in 40 imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. The overall correlation of WT1 and BCR-ABL1 was low. In two patients WT1 expression was increasing despite very low BCR-ABL1 levels. As both revealed Ph-negative aberrant clones, a second independent cohort of 20 cases, all with Ph-negative clonal evolution, was analysed. High WT1 expression (5.0-177.0%) was detected in a case with +11 and in four of eight cases with +8, but not in cases with del(20q) or -Y. Thus, increasing WT1 levels in molecular responders may indicate Ph-negative clonal cytogenetic evolution during imatinib treatment.",M1
19618858,"[Immunotherapy targeting the Wilms' tumor 1 gene product for patients with malignant brain tumors]In this paper, we review the current status of immunotherapy targeting Wilms' tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) peptide in malignant brain tumors as well as in other hematological and solid malignancies. WT1 is expressed in various kinds of malignancies, and is involved in oncogenesis. The titers of antibodies against WT1 and the frequency of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were higher in cancer patients than in healthy donors, indicating that WT1 protein has immunogenic function. These findings provided us with a rationale for developing cancer immunotherapy that targets the WT1 peptide. Clinical trials of the WT1 peptide vaccination were initiated, and definite immunological and clinical responses were observed. The disease control rate of 57.1% was obtained especially in the case of recurrent glioblastomas, with a median progression-free survival period of 20.0 weeks and progression-free survival rate at 6 months of 33.3%. The trial showed that WT1 vaccination for malignant gliomas, which is generally believed to be an intractable disease, was safe and elicited a favorable clinical response. Further clinical studies of WT1 vaccination in patients with malignant gliomas as well as other cancers are warranted. An enhancement of the efficacy of WT1 vaccination can be expected with a combined treatment using the WT1-specific helper peptide or anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Administration of WT1 vaccination along with other therapeutic modalities during initial treatment or in the case showing minimal residual disease may prolong the survival time of the cancer patients.",M1

19615003,"<e>WT1</e> marker is not sufficient for distinguishing between melanoma and melanocytic nevi.BACKGROUND: The heterogeneous histological features of melanoma may often overlap with melanocytic nevi. For this reason, pathologists have sought after immunohistochemistry to assist with difficult cases. Recently, Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) has been suggested to differentiate between melanoma and melanocytic nevi. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether immunohistochemistry analysis of WT1 expression is a reliable tool in differentiating cutaneous melanoma from melanocytic nevi. METHODS: Forty-five melanoma and 43 melanocytic nevi were immunostained with anti-WT1 monoclonal antibody (clone 6F-H2). RESULTS: Forty of the 45 cutaneous melanoma (89%) and 22 of the 43 melanocytic nevi (51%) stained (&gt; 10% cells) for WT1. The highest sensitivity for WT1 was expressed by nodular melanoma (19/20), superficial spreading melanoma (8/10) and Spitz nevi (9/11). At the threshold of above 75% WT1-stained cells, the specificity for melanoma was 95% but the sensitivity was only 31%. At the threshold of 10%, the sensitivity increased to 89% but the specificity decreased to only 49%. Finally, at the threshold of 25% and 50%, the sensitivity and specificity were 71%, 61% and 64%, 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that melanoma is associated with increased WT1 expression. However, as a single immunostaining marker, WT1 is not sufficient for distinguishing melanoma from melanocytic nevi.",M1
19605546,"Impaired transcription factor interplay in addition to advanced glycation end products suppress podocalyxin expression in high glucose-treated human podocytes.Podocalyxin represents a Wilms' tumor suppressor protein (<e>WT1</e>)-regulated differentiation marker for glomerular epithelium. We provide evidence concerning mechanisms involved in the regulation of podocalyxin expression following long-term exposure to increased (25 mM) glucose levels. Prolonged culture of conditionally immortalized human podocytes in 25 mM glucose induced suppression of podocalyxin expression both at the protein and mRNA levels, whereas WT1 protein levels remained unaltered. WT1 interacted with another transcription factor, CRE-binding protein (CBP). This association was decreased by 40% in the presence of 25 mM glucose. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on chromatin from podocytes cultured in 25 mM glucose revealed reduced WT1 binding to podocalyxin promoter sequences, probably resulting from impaired WT1-CBP interactions. We explored the possible role of glucose-induced adducts (advanced glycation end products; AGEs) in impairing interactions between WT1 and CBP, with the use of aminoguanindine, an inhibitor of AGE formation. Podocytes were cultured in the simultaneous presence of 20 mM aminoguanidine and 25 mM glucose, and podocalyxin protein levels were examined. Aminoguanidine effectively prevented downregulation of podocalyxin protein levels but could not restore podocalyxin levels once expression was suppressed. Thus increased glucose apparently impaired the ability of WT1 to initiate transcription in part by decreased association of WT1 with CBP. Administration of aminoguanidine concomitant with increasing glucose levels in our in vitro model system protected from glucose-induced  silencing  of the podocalyxin gene, suggesting that AGEs play an important role in suppressing its expression in diabetic conditions.",M1

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the responsiveness of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients to Imatinib therapy was predictable from WT1 gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. To examine the resistance we implemented an in vitro cultivation of the primary cells of 48 CML patients with Imatinib. The effect of Imatinib was characterized not only by the expression of WT1 but also by BCR-ABL, and proliferative factor Ki-67. &lt;br /&gt;Our results showed that leukocytes of CML patients, clinically responsive to Imatinib treatment, significantly decreased WT1 expression after in vitro incubation with Imatinib. It was accompanied by an inhibition of expression of Ki-67 but not BCR-ABL. In leukocytes of CML patients clinically resistant to Imatinib, the expression of WT1, Ki-67, and BCR-ABL remained unaffected. The presented results showed that in vitro testing using peripheral blood cells enabled clinicians to predict responsiveness of CML patients to Imatinib.",M1
19562370,"Molecular genetic analysis of podocyte genes in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis--a review.This review deals with podocyte proteins that play a significant role in the structure and function of the glomerular filter. Genetic linkage studies has identified several genes involved in the development of nephrotic syndrome and contributed to the understanding of the pathophysiology of glomerular proteinuria and/or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Here, we describe already well-characterized genetic diseases due to mutations in nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, alpha-actinin-4, <e>WT1</e>, and laminin beta2 chain, as well as more recently identified genetic abnormalities in TRPC6, phospholipase C epsilon, and the proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome. In addition, the role of the proteins which have shown to be important for the structure and functions by gene knockout studies in mice, are also discussed. Furthermore, some rare syndromes with glomerular involvement, in which molecular defects have been recently identified, are briefly described. In summary, this review updates the current knowledge of genetic causes of congenital and childhood nephrotic syndrome and provides new insights into mechanisms of glomerular dysfunction.",M1
19549856,"An integrated genome screen identifies the Wnt signaling pathway as a major target of <e>WT1</e>.WT1, a critical regulator of kidney development, is a tumor suppressor for nephroblastoma but in some contexts functions as an oncogene. A limited number of direct transcriptional targets of WT1 have been identified to explain its complex roles in tumorigenesis and organogenesis. In this study we performed genome-wide screening for direct WT1 targets, using a combination of ChIP-ChIP and expression arrays. Promoter regions bound by WT1 were highly G-rich and resembled the sites for a number of other widely expressed transcription factors such as SP1, MAZ, and ZNF219. Genes directly regulated by WT1 were implicated in MAPK signaling, axon guidance, and Wnt pathways. Among directly bound and regulated genes by WT1, nine were identified in the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting that WT1 modulates a subset of Wnt components and responsive genes by direct binding. To prove the biological importance of the interplay between WT1 and Wnt signaling, we showed that WT1 blocked the ability of Wnt8 to induce a secondary body axis during Xenopus embryonic development. WT1 inhibited TCF-mediated transcription activated by Wnt ligand, wild type and mutant, stabilized beta-catenin by preventing TCF4 loading onto a promoter. This was neither due to direct binding of WT1 to the TCF binding site nor to interaction between WT1 and TCF4, but by competition of WT1 and TCF4 for CBP. WT1 interference with Wnt signaling represents an important mode of its action relevant to the suppression of tumor growth and guidance of development.",M1
19549635,"A cell-autonomous role for <e>WT1</e> in regulating Sry in vivo.Human patients with Frasier syndrome express reduced levels of the +KTS isoforms of the developmental regulator WT1 and exhibit complete XY gonadal dysgenesis and male-to-female sex reversal. Mice with a targeted mutation that blocks production of these isoforms show a reduction in Sry mRNA in the gonad, but the molecular and cellular basis of this reduction has not been established. Using immunofluorescence analysis, we found a significantly lower level of SRY protein per cell in XY Wt1(+KTS)-null mouse gonads. We also found a reduced number of SRY-expressing cells, correlating with a decrease in cell proliferation at and near the coelomic epithelium at 11.5 dpc. No reduction in somatic cell numbers was seen in XX Wt1(+KTS)-null gonads, indicating that the effect of WT1 on cell proliferation is mediated by Sry. Sertoli cell differentiation was blocked in XY Wt1(+KTS)-null mouse gonads, as indicated by the loss of SOX9 and Fgf9 expression, but the addition of recombinant FGF9 to ex vivo gonad cultures rescued the mutant phenotype, as indicated by the induction of the Sertoli-cell specific marker anti-Müllerian hormone. Our data suggest that WT1(+KTS) is involved in the cell-autonomous regulation of Sry expression, which in turn influences cell proliferation and Sertoli cell differentiation via FGF9. Thus, sex reversal in Wt1(+KTS)-null mice and Frasier syndrome patients results from a failure of Sertoli cells both to fully differentiate and to reach sufficient numbers to direct testis development.",M1
19538172,"<e>WT1</e> peptide vaccine as a paradigm for  cancer antigen-derived peptide -based immunotherapy for malignancies: successful induction of anti-cancer effect by vaccination with a single kind of WT1 peptide.Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) possesses oncogenic functions and is expressed in various kinds of malignancies, which suggests that the gene's product, the WT1 protein, should be one of the most promising cancer antigens. In fact, the WT1 protein was shown to be highly immunogenic in cancer patients. WT1 peptides that could induce WT1-specific CTLs (WT1 CTL peptides) were identified, and vaccination of cancer patients with these WT1 CTL peptides induced immunological responses, which were assessed by ex vivo immuno-monitoring, such as the tetramer assay, and in vivo immuno-monitoring, such as the peptide-specific delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. The induced immunological responses then led to clinical responses such as solid tumor shrinkage, a decrease in leukemia cells, and reduction of M-protein (multiple myeloma). Long-term stabilization of disease with good quality of life, which might be characteristic of cancer vaccine therapy, was also reported. It is noteworthy that injection with a  single  kind of WT1 peptide elicited an immunological response strong enough to induce a clinical response, indicating that the WT1 peptide vaccine has therapeutic potential. The number of reports of the successful treatment of cancer patients (not only adult but also childhood malignancies) with WT1 vaccination is increasing. Strategies for further improvement in the efficacy of therapy, including combined use of chemotherapy drugs, molecular-target-based drugs, or WT1 helper peptides, are being proposed. WT1 peptide vaccination in an  adjuvant setting  should be considered a promising treatment to protect against progression or relapse of malignancies in cases with minimal residual disease.",M1

19494353,"<e>WT1</e> mutations in T-ALL.The molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression and relapse in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are poorly understood. We used single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis to analyze paired diagnostic and relapsed T-ALL samples to identify recurrent genetic alterations in T-ALL. This analysis showed that diagnosis and relapsed cases have common genetic alterations, but also that relapsed samples frequently lose chromosomal markers present at diagnosis, suggesting that relapsed T-ALL emerges from an ancestral clone different from the major leukemic population at diagnosis. In addition, we identified deletions and associated mutations in the WT1 tumor suppressor gene in 2 of 9 samples. Subsequent analysis showed WT1 mutations in 28 of 211 (13.2%) of pediatric and 10 of 85 (11.7%) of adult T-ALL cases. WT1 mutations present in T-ALL are predominantly heterozygous frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminal zinc finger domains of this transcription factor. WT1 mutations are most prominently found in T-ALL cases with aberrant rearrangements of the oncogenic TLX1, TLX3, and HOXA transcription factor oncogenes. Survival analysis demonstrated that WT1 mutations do not confer adverse prognosis in pediatric and adult T-ALL. Overall, these results identify the presence of WT1 mutations as a recurrent genetic alteration in T-ALL.",M1
19491203,"Malignant cells are not found in ovarian cortex from breast cancer patients undergoing ovarian cortex cryopreservation.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a frequent indication for ovarian cortex cryopreservation due to its high incidence. The main concern of this procedure is the possibility of reintroducing metastatic cells within the implant, an issue that has not been addressed systematically. Thus, a study was designed to analyse the presence of ovarian metastases in breast cancer patients undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation. METHODS: Morphological and immunohistochemical studies following the concept of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) were performed on 100 cortical ovarian biopsies obtained from 63 patients and on six frozen-thawed entire cortex from patients with the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma undergoing ovarian cortex extraction and cryopreservation. The antibody panel included Cytokeratin CAM 5.2, Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein-15 (GCDFP15), Wilms' tumour antigen-1 (<e>WT1</e>) and Mammaglobin 1. RESULTS: Employing only morphologic criteria, suspicious neoplastic cells were detected in five biopsies, but in none of the six entire cortex analysed. These five cases were reclassified as hyperplasic surface epithelium-inclusion cysts (CAM 5.2+, WT1+) or apoptotic granulosa cells (CAM 5.2-, GCDFP15+, WT1-). CONCLUSIONS: Using the methodology of the SLN our data suggest the absence of tumour cells in biopsies obtained from patients undergoing ovarian cortex cryopreservation to preserve their fertility potential, although future methods of cancer screening may change our perception of this procedure.",M1

19463768,"Detection and treatment of molecular relapse in acute myeloid leukemia with RUNX1 (AML1), CBFB, or MLL gene translocations: frequent quantitative monitoring of molecular markers in different compartments and correlation with <e>WT1</e> gene expression.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the value of frequent minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a robust marker of impending relapse, and whether treatment benefits patients during the MRD-positive phase of their disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frequent MRD monitoring was performed in all AML treatment phases using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for fusion transcripts (CBFB/MYH11; RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts of MLL gene) and for the Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene. A total of 2,664 samples, taken from 79 AML patients and 6 healthy volunteers, were examined. Presence of fusion gene was detected in 25 of 79 examined patients. RESULTS: Vast correlation was discovered for fusion transcripts as well as for the WT1 gene between levels in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, CD34(+) BM cells, and CD34(-) BM cells. WT1 expression, however, was usually positive for cases showing fusion transcripts negativity and in healthy volunteers. Moreover, no universal value of the WT1 expression could unequivocally discriminate between remission and relapse. Therefore, detection of molecular relapses relied on fusion transcripts only and was characterized by strong expression in CD34(+) cells. Considering relapsed patients, duration from molecular to hematological relapse was 8 to 79 days (median: 25.5 days). Twelve patients were treated (chemotherapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or immunomodulation after allogeneic transplantation) for 21 molecular relapses and 14 responses to treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent quantitative monitoring of fusion transcripts is useful for reliably predicting hematological relapse in AML patients. Treatment for molecular relapse of AML can be successful.",M1

Earlier, we reported the in vitro efficacy of WT1 RNAi in the inhibition of B16F10 murine melanoma cell line growth. In this study, we used an aerosol system to deliver WT1 RNAi complexes, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-WT1-1 or PEI-WT1-2, to the lungs of mice with B16F10 lung metastasis. This treatment produced a statistically significant (P=0.020) reduction in the number and size of lung tumor foci, resulting in decreased lung weight and tumor index in treated mice compared with controls. The WT1 RNAi treatment also reduced the number and size of tumor blood vessels, suggesting decreased angiogenesis. Furthermore, the treated lung tissue showed cells in the tumor infiltrations undergoing apoptosis and elevated expression of the proapoptotic genes Bcl-xS and Bax, suggesting an activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Overall, WT1-1 treatment prolonged the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice in comparison with the control and WT1-2-treated mice. Our data show that WT1 gene silencing in vivo by aerosol delivery of PEI-WT1 RNAi complexes is an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung metastases.",M1
19457926,"The transcription co-factor CITED2 functions during sex determination and early gonad development.The early bi-potential mammalian gonad requires the expression of a Y-linked gene, Sry, during a brief window of time to ensure proper testis development. <e>WT1</e> and its direct target gene Sf1 function during sex determination as well as in the specified testes and ovaries. We have previously shown that the transcription co-factor CITED2 interacts with WT1 to stimulate the expression of Sf1 in the adrenogonadal primordium to ensure adrenal development. We now show through genetic interactions and expression analyses that Cited2 acts in the gonad with Wt1 and Sf1 to increase the expression of Sry levels to attain a critical threshold to efficiently initiate testis development. Reducing the gene dosage of Wt1 or Sf1 in Cited2 mutant gonads was sufficient to produce partial XY sex reversal while full sex reversal was attained in mutants containing a hypomorphic Sry(POS) allele. A direct correlation was observed between XY sex reversal and reduced expression levels of Sry and Sf1 during sex determination, which indicated that Sry is a downstream target of the CITED2/WT1/SF1 regulatory pathway. Our results provide in vivo evidence for the identification of the first transcription co-factor to function during mammalian sex determination, as part of the WT1/SF1 regulatory mechanism. This highlights the gene dosage sensitivity of the pathway's effect on Sry levels and embryonic gonad development.",M1
19443388,"Immunohistochemical detection of <e>WT1</e> protein in endometrial cancer.BACKGROUND: The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 is overexpressed in various kinds of solid tumors. However, it remains unclear whether WT1 plays a pathophysiological role in endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 70 endometrial cancer patients who had undergone a curative resection was studied to determine the correlation between WT1 expression, clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. Tissue specimens were evaluated for WT1 expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of WT1 was strong in 31 patients (44%) and weak in 39 patients (56%). WT1 overexpression was associated with advanced FIGO stage (p=0.0266), myometrial invasion (p=0.0477) and high-grade histological differentiation (p=0.0049). The expression level of WT1 was found to be a significant predictor of disease relapse in univariate analysis (p=0.0233), but not in multivariate analysis (p=0.4757). CONCLUSION: These results suggested that tumor-produced WT1 provided additional prognostic information in endometrial cancer patients.",M1
19437143,"No evidence for <e>WT1</e> involvement in a beta-catenin-independent activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in pituitary adenomas.The overexpression of Wilms' tumor gene product WT1, which acts as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, has been reported in various malignancies. Recent studies have shown that the interaction partner Wnt-4 is upregulated in pituitary adenomas dependent on the Pit-1 lineage (somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs). However, no data on WT1 expression in nontumorous pituitary tissue or pituitary adenomas is available to date. We investigated WT1 expression in 90 paraffin-embedded pituitary adenomas, including eight atypical adenomas, and in 28 nontumorous pituitary glands by immunohistochemistry. WT1 is absent in epithelial cells of all nontumorous pituitary glands and in 87 out of 90 pituitary adenomas. Only two GHomas (including one atypical adenoma) and one gonadotropin-producing adenoma expressed WT1 in the cytoplasm of single tumor cells without nuclear staining. There is no evidence that WT1 does regulate the Wnt-4/beta-catenin-independent pathway which is activated in the Pit-1-expressing subset of pituitary adenomas.",M1
19416806,"The tumor suppressor WTX shuttles to the nucleus and modulates <e>WT1</e> activity.WTX encodes a tumor suppressor gene inactivated in Wilms tumor and recently implicated in WNT signaling through enhancement of cytoplasmic beta-catenin (CTNNB1) degradation. Here, we report that WTX translocates to the nucleus, a property that is modified by an endogenous splicing variant and is modulated by a nuclear export inhibitor. WTX is present in distinct subnuclear structures and co-localizes with the paraspeckle marker p54NRB/NONO, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. Notably, WTX binds WT1, another Wilms tumor suppressor and stem cell marker that encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor, and enhances WT1-mediated transcription of Amphiregulin, an endogenous target gene. Together, these observations suggest a role for WTX in nuclear pathways implicated in the transcriptional regulation of cellular differentiation programs.",M1
19404640,"Wilms' tumor gene 1 (<e>WT1</e>) expression in subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of adults and impact on clinical outcome.Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) is gaining increasing attention as a therapeutic target molecule due to its common expression in acute leukemias and its involvement in cell proliferation. Here, we reported on WT1 messenger RNA expression levels at diagnosis in a series of 238 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples of various subtypes and clinical outcome. WT1 expression was found in 219 out of 238 ALL samples (92%). Compared to a cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients, the median WT1 expression level in ALL was significantly lower with large variations among different ALL subgroups. Specifically, WT1 expression levels were low in mature B-ALL and highest in ALL cases with co-expression of myeloid markers, making it a useful therapeutic target molecule in adult ALL with the exception of mature B-ALL. Cox regression analysis, considering ALL phenotype as well as molecular-cytogenetic subsets, revealed no independent prognostic role of WT1 expression level for disease-free and overall survival.",M1
19392599,"Effect of <e>WT1</e> gene silencing on the tumorigenicity of human glioblastoma multiforme cells.OBJECT: Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is overexpressed in many human cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In another study, the authors showed that transient WT1 silencing increases the radiosensitivity of glioma cells. Studies of nonglioma cell lines have demonstrated that WT1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, this ability has not been rigorously analyzed in human GBM. METHODS: The authors tested the efficacy of 2 sequences of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against WT1 in U251MG human GBM cells and found that 1 sequence was capable of stably silencing WT1 expression. They then evaluated the effect of WT1 silencing on cellular proliferation, invasion, and in vivo tumor formation. RESULTS: Stable WT1-shRNA expression significantly decreased the proliferation of U251MG cells in vitro as demonstrated by both an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-based viability assay and tritiated thymidine uptake. Furthermore, stable WT1 silencing caused significantly slower growth after the subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells in the flanks of athymic nude mice and was associated with an increased latency period. CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study provide proof of the principle that downregulation of WT1 causes decreased tumorigenicity of a GBM cell line in vitro and in vivo and suggest that WT1 is a promising target for novel molecular GBM therapies, perhaps in combination with standard treatment modalities.",M1

Vaccination consisted of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor subcutaneously days 1 to 4, and WT1.126-134 peptide and 1 mg keyhole limpet hemocyanin on day 3. The initial 9 patients received 4 vaccinations biweekly, then monthly, and the subsequent 10 patients received continual biweekly vaccination. Seventeen AML patients and 2 refractory anemia with excess blasts patients received a median of 11 vaccinations. Treatment was well tolerated. Objective responses in AML patients were 10 stable diseases (SDs) including 4 SDs with more than 50% blast reduction and 2 with hematologic improvement. An additional 4 patients had clinical benefit after initial progression, including 1 complete remission and 3 SDs. WT1 mRNA levels decreased at least 3-fold from baseline in 35% of patients. In 8 of 18 patients, WT1-tetramer(+) T cells increased in blood and in 8 of 17 patients in bone marrow, with a median frequency in bone marrow of 0.18% at baseline and 0.41% in week 18. This WT1 vaccination study provides immunologic, molecular, and preliminary evidence of potential clinical efficacy in AML patients, warranting further investigations.",M1
19384943,"<e>WT1</e> IgG antibody for early detection of nonsmall cell lung cancer and as its prognostic factor.There are urgent needs to develop methods for early detection of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) because of its increasing incidence and poor prognosis. Here, we analyzed the production of IgG antibody (WT1 Ab) against WT1 (Wilms' tumor gene) protein that was overexpressed in the majority of NSCLC. Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay showed that WT1 Ab was produced in all of 91 NSCLC patients and 70 healthy individuals and that WT1 Ab titers were significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with healthy individuals. When the cut-off level of WT1 Ab titers were fixed at mean + 3SD of those in healthy individuals, 26.4% of NSCLC patients had WT1 Ab titers over the cut-off level, and positive rates of WT1 Ab at each clinical stage were 25.0, 30.8 and 38.4% in stage I, II and III NSCLC, respectively. When WT1 Ab was combined with CEA or CYFRA for detection of NSCLC, positive detection rates increased from 25.0 to 34.1 and 31.8%, respectively, in stage I and from 38.4 to 69.2 and 46.1%, respectively, in stage III, but not changed in stage II. Western blot analysis showed that dominant subclass of WT1 Ab was Th1-type IgG2. Interestingly, elevation of WT1 Ab titers was significantly associated with longer disease-free survival in patients with stages I-III NSCLC. These results showed that WT1 Ab could be a useful marker for early detection of NSCLC and its prognostic prediction. These results also suggested that WT1-specific immune responses played an important role in anti-cancer immunity in NSCLC.",M1
19359523,"Genetic podocyte lineage reveals progressive podocytopenia with parietal cell hyperplasia in a murine model of cellular/collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a progressive renal disease, and the glomerular visceral cell hyperplasia typically observed in cellular/collapsing FSGS is an important pathological factor in disease progression. However, the cellular features that promote FSGS currently remain obscure. To determine both the origin and phenotypic alterations in hyperplastic cells in cellular/collapsing FSGS, the present study used a previously described FSGS model in p21-deficient mice with visceral cell hyperplasia and identified the podocyte lineage by genetic tagging. The p21-deficient mice with nephropathy showed significantly higher urinary protein levels, extracapillary hyperplastic indices on day 5, and glomerular sclerosis indices on day 14 than wild-type controls. X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry for podocyte and parietal epithelial cell (PEC) markers revealed progressive podocytopenia with capillary collapse accompanied by PEC hyperplasia leading to FSGS. In our investigation, non-tagged cells expressed neither <e>WT1</e> nor nestin. Ki-67, a proliferation marker, was rarely associated with podocytes but was expressed at high levels in PECs. Both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining and electron microscopy failed to show evidence of significant podocyte apoptosis on days 5 and 14. These findings suggest that extensive podocyte loss and simultaneous PEC hyperplasia is an actual pathology that may contribute to the progression of cellular/collapsing FSGS in this mouse model. Additionally, this is the first study to demonstrate the regulatory role of p21 in the PEC cell cycle.",M1

The WT1 protein has been found to be highly immunogenic, and spontaneous humoral and cytotoxic T-cell responses have been detected in patients suffering from leukemia. Furthermore, major histocompatibility complexes class I- and II-restricted WT1 peptide epitopes have been shown to elicit immune responses in patients with WT1-expressing tumors. As a consequence, WT1 has become an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of generating WT1-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We analyzed the incidence of T cells specific for WT1 peptide epitopes in cancer patients and healthy volunteers. It is noted that we could generate WT1-specific responses in nine of ten healthy volunteer donors and established T-cell clones specific for two WT1-derived peptide epitopes. These in vitro expanded WT1-specific T cells effectively lysed WT1-expressing tumor cell lines, indicating the potential clinical impact of ex vivo expanded donor-derived WT1-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",M1
19351755,"Induction of Wilms' tumor protein (<e>WT1</e>)-specific antitumor immunity using a truncated WT1-expressing adenovirus vaccine.PURPOSE: Wilms' tumor protein (WT1) is overexpressed in most leukemias and many solid tumors and is a promising target for tumor immunotherapy. WT1 peptide-based cancer vaccines have been reported but have limited application due to HLA restriction of the peptides. We sought to vaccinate using adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding tumor-associated antigens such as WT1 that can stimulate tumor-associated antigen-specific immunity across a broad array of HLA types and multiple class I and class II epitopes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a novel Ad vector encoding a truncated version of WT1 (Ad-tWT1) lacking the highly conserved COOH terminus zinc finger domains and tested its ability to stimulate WT1-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in two murine models of WT1-expressing tumors. RESULTS: Despite encoding a transcription factor, we found that Ad-tWT1-transduced murine and human dendritic cells showed cytoplasmic expression of the truncated WT1 protein. In addition, vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with Ad-tWT1 generated WT1-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and conferred protection against challenge with the leukemia cell line, mWT1-C1498. Moreover, in a tumor therapy model, Ad-tWT1 vaccination of TRAMP-C2 tumor-bearing mice significantly suppressed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a WT1-encoding Ad vector that is capable of inducing effective immunity against WT1-expressing malignancies. Based on these findings, Ad-tWT1 warrants investigation in human clinical trials to evaluate its applications as a vaccine for patients with WT1-expressing cancers.",M1

Although hyperexpression of Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene transcript has been frequently proposed as an MRD marker in AML, wide comparability of the various methods used for evaluating WT1 expression has not been given. We established and standardized a multicenter approach for quantifying WT1 expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), on the basis of a primer/probe set combination at exons 6 and 7. In a series of quality-control rounds, we analyzed 69 childhood AML samples and 47 normal bone marrow (BM) samples from 4 participating centers. Differences in the individual WT1 expressions levels ranged within &lt;0.5 log of the mean in 82% of the cases. In AML samples, the median WT1/1E+04 Abelson (ABL) expression was 3.5E+03 compared with that of 2.3E+01 in healthy BM samples. As 11.5% of childhood AML samples in this cohort harbored WT1 mutations in exon 7, the effect of mutations on WT1 expression has been investigated, showing that mutated cases expressed significantly higher WT1 levels than wild-type cases. Hence, our approach showed high reproducibility and applicability, even in patients with WT1 mutations; therefore, it can be widely used for the quantitation of WT1 expression in future clinical trials.",M1

We have examined the mechanisms by which HCMV mediates downregulation of EGFR expression and show that virus infection results in the profound upregulation of Wilms' Tumour 1 (<e>WT1</e>) protein, a transcription factor associated with the negative regulation of a number of growth factors and growth factor receptors, including EGFR. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also show that HCMV infection results in increased binding of WT1 to the EGFR promoter. Finally, we show that depleting the cell of WT1 using small interfering RNA abrogates virus-mediated downregulation of EGFR. Taken together, our observations suggest that HCMV-mediated repression of EGFR expression results from a virus-mediated increase in cellular WT1, a known pleiotropic regulator of mitogenesis, apoptosis and differentiation.",M1

This study aimed to investigate WT1 expression in prostate cancer, and to determine the number and function of WT1-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess WT1 expression in cancer tissues. Human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2) tetramers served to detect WT1-specific T cells, and peptide-specific stimulation was used to assess T-cell function in vitro. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of tissue arrays comprising 36 cancer and 8 normal prostate samples revealed nuclear WT1 staining in 39% of cancer samples, but not in normal prostate tissues. Tetramer analysis revealed a low frequency of WT1-specific T cells in 20 of 38 HLA-A2-positive patients. In vitro stimulation with WT1 peptide plus interleukin 2(IL2) and interleukin 7 (IL7) did not lead to an accumulation of WT1-specific T cells in any of the patient samples, although all patients were able to generate T-cell responses against Melan-A/MART1 control peptide. Stimulation with WT1 peptide in the presence of interleukin 15 (IL15), a cytokine that was shown to reverse tolerance of murine tumor-specific T cells, was able to restore the expansion and IFNgamma production of WT1-specific T cells in a subgroup of prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The observation that IL15 can restore the function of WT1-specific T cells that were unresponsive to IL2 has implications for vaccination and immunotherapeutic strategies that aim to enhance WT1-specific T cell immunity in patients.",M1

WT1 mutations were identified in 78 (12.6%) of the 617 patients; mutations clustered in exon 7 (54 of 78) and exon 9 (13 of 78), but also occurred in exons 1, 2, 3, and 8. WT1 mutations were significantly associated with younger age, higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, higher blood blast counts, and the additional presence of FLT3-ITD (P &lt; .001) and CEBPA mutations (P = .004). There was no difference in relapse-free survival and overall survival between patients with (WT1(mut)) or without WT1 mutations. Subset analysis showed that patients with the genotype WT1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(pos) had a lower complete remission rate (P = .003) and an inferior relapse-free survival (P = .006) and overall survival (P &lt; .001) compared with those with the genotype WT1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg). In conclusion, in our large cohort of younger adults with CN-AML, WT1 mutation as a single molecular marker did not impact on outcome.

Developing nephrons are positive for <e>wt1</e> expression during the first three of these stages. In the present study, we examined the regenerative response to renal injury, artificially induced by the administration of sublethal amounts of gentamicin in adult medaka. Similar to previous reports in other animals, the renal tubular epithelium and the glomerulus of the medaka kidney exhibited severe damage after exposure to this agent. However, kidneys showed substantial recovery after gentamicin administration, and a significant number of developing nephrons appeared 14 days after gentamicin administration (P &lt; 0.01). Similarly, the expression of wt1 in developing nephrons also indicated the early stages of nephrogenesis.

19196508,"Wilms' tumour gene 1 (<e>WT1</e>) as a target in curcumin treatment of pancreatic cancer cells.The transcription factor WT1 plays an important role in cellular proliferation and survival of various cancer cells, and is frequently expressed in pancreatic cancer. Curcumin has been shown to be a potentially effective agent in pancreatic cancer. In this context, the purpose of this study was to determine the role of WT1 in a curcumin-treated pancreatic cancer cell line. To study the effect of curcumin on the expression of WT1, we incubated the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 with different amounts of curcumin. The expression of WT1 on mRNA and protein level was measured with real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The incubation of the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 with curcumin resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation as measured with MTT assay. The expression of WT1 on mRNA and protein level was significantly down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with curcumin. The WT1 mRNA levels were decreased by 20%, 25%, 40%, 78% and 88% in response to 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 microM curcumin. The use of small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) targeting WT1 down-regulated the expression of WT1 about 90%. Combined treatment with curcumin and siRNA targeting WT1 resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation compared to curcumin-treated cells alone. In conclusion, WT1 is involved in cellular proliferation of PANC-1 cells. Targeting WT1 gene expression with siRNA may enhance the efficacy of curcumin to inhibit cell proliferation.",M1

It has been shown that p16 is overexpressed in high-grade serous carcinoma but there has been little detailed comparison of p16 expression in the common types of ovarian carcinoma. The aim of this study was to compare p16 expression in ovarian carcinomas of serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous type with a view to ascertaining whether high expression in a primary ovarian carcinoma is specific for a serous neoplasm. We included problematic cases, which are difficult to type, such as poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas and serous carcinomas with clear cells. In these problematic groups, we compared p16 expression with that of <e>WT1</e>, which is known to be relatively specific for a serous phenotype. Cases of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (n=38), endometrioid carcinoma (n=15), clear cell carcinoma (n=12), and mucinous carcinoma (n=10) were stained with p16. Cases were scored both with respect to distribution of immunoreactivity (0-5) and intensity (0-3). An immunohistochemical composite score was also calculated (0-15) by multiplying the distribution and intensity scores. Serous carcinomas typically exhibited high p16 expression; there was statistically significant higher p16 expression in serous carcinomas compared with the other morphologic types. There was high p16 and WT1 expression in most undifferentiated carcinomas and in serous carcinomas with clear cells, suggesting that these represent variants of serous carcinoma. We have demonstrated that p16 is highly expressed in high-grade serous and undifferentiated carcinomas compared with other morphologic types of ovarian carcinoma. This may be useful, in conjunction with WT1, in the classification of problematic neoplasms. p16 may be involved in the pathogenesis of high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas, possibly through inactivation of retinoblastoma protein.",M1

Using array-based comparative genome hybridization in pediatric CN-AML samples, we detected a WT1 deletion in one sample. The other WT1 allele was mutated. This prompted us to further investigate the role of WT1 aberrations in childhood AML. Mutations were found in 35 of 298 (12%) diagnostic pediatric AML samples. In 19 of 35 (54%) samples, more than one WT1 aberration was found: 15 samples had 2 different mutations, 2 had a homozygous mutation, and 2 had a mutation plus a WT1 deletion. WT1 mutations clustered significantly in the CN-AML subgroup (22%; P &lt; .001) and were associated with FLT3/ITD (43 vs 17%; P &lt; .001).

Although the <e>WT1</e> gene, located at 11p13, has been proven to be implicated in the development of Wilms tumor, other genes such as MYCN are also involved. The purpose of this study is to genetically characterize a Wilms tumor metastasis xenotransplanted in nude mice. Immunogenotype evolution of the xenografts material was monitored for 29 months using molecular techniques, fluorescent in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, in addition to immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays. Genetic alterations present in the original tumor and retained in the xenotransplanted tumor were located in +1q, +3, +6, -7p, +7q, +8, -9p, +9q, +12. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification detected a nondeleted status of genes located close to WT genes, except for a deletion of the EGFR gene (located at 7p11.2) and the GHRHR gene (located at 7p15), both flanking the WT5 gene. The MYCN gene (2p24 exon 3) and DDX1 gene (2p24 exons 2, 7, 15, and 24) were gained in passage 4 and the following passages. MYCN expression was positive from the beginning, without evidence of MYCN gain by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Histopathologic and growth rate changes were observed at those passages where low extra copy number of MYCN was present. In addition to other genetic abnormalities, the WT5 gene located at 7p13-14 is deleted and the MYCN gene gain began after 16 months in vivo evolution in athymic nude mice.

This review focuses on salient cytological features in specific paediatric renal tumours, the approach to resolving a differential diagnosis and the role of ancillary methods in diagnosis of paediatric renal tumours. Crucial differential diagnoses include distinguishing: Wilms' tumour from benign tumours in the kidney like multicystic nephroma or congenital mesoblastic nephroma; aggressive non-Wilms' tumours of kidney like rhabdoid tumour of kidney; and Wilms' tumour from other paediatric round cell sarcomas like neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma etc. An approach based on classifying smears according to their cellular patterns as triphasic, round cell, spindle cell or epithelioid cell type assists in classifying paediatric renal tumours on cytology. Immunocytochemistry for <e>WT1</e>, cytokeratin, synaptophysin, leucocyte common antigen and MIC2 will aid in evaluating round cell tumours in the renal region, while WT1, bcl2, vimentin and desmin will be useful for spindle cell tumours in that region.

A checklist of common tumours in a particular age group, relevant clinical information, awareness of distinctive and overlapping cytological features, and appropriate use of immunocytochemistry with cytogenetics go a long way in ensuring an accurate cytological diagnosis. Used judiciously, FNAC is as effective a tool as a core biopsy for preoperative diagnosis of paediatric renal tumours, and with experience a 92% accuracy rate can be achieved.",M2
19348510,"Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein indicates activation of wnt signaling in chemically induced rat nephroblastomas.Aberrant wnt signaling caused by mutations in CTNNB1 occurs in about 15% of Wilms tumors, and these mutations appear to be dependent on the concomitant mutational inactivation of the zinc-finger protein <e>WT1</e>. Nuclear beta-catenin protein, a substitute marker of active wnt signaling, has been detected in an even higher proportion (&gt;50%) of Wilms tumors, suggesting alternative genetic pathways leading to beta-catenin activation. Thus, targeting wnt signaling may become an important future therapeutic strategy in Wilms tumor patients. Currently, chemically induced rat nephroblastomas provide the only available rodent model for this tumor. To determine the contribution of active wnt signaling in this model, we investigated 24 chemically induced rat nephroblastomas for beta-catenin protein expression and for Ctnnb1 and WT1 mutations. Immunohistochemistry showed focal strong nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein in 18 of 24 tumors, although in a heterogenous pattern. Blastemal and mesenchymal compartments displayed nuclear-positive cells more frequently than areas of epithelial differentiation. Interestingly, we found no mutation of exon 3 of Ctnnb1 and no mutation within the zinc-finger region of WT1 in any of the 24 tumors analyzed. In conclusion, our findings suggest activation of wnt signaling in the majority (63%) of chemically induced rat nephroblastomas. Nuclear expression of beta-catenin in the absence of Ctnnb1 mutations implies, however, alternate mutational targets in rat nephroblastomas.",M2
19294427,"Wilms tumor arising in a child with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.We report on a child with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) who developed Wilms tumor (WT). Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations of the arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR2) or aquaporin-II (AQP2) genes. Wilms tumor is also genetically heterogeneous and is associated with mutations of <e>WT1</e> (15-20%), WTX (20-30%) and other loci. The boy presented at 5 months with failure to thrive, polyuria, hypernatremia and abdominal mass. Analysis of leukocyte DNA showed a novel missense mutation (Q174H) of the AVPR2 gene, which was not present in his mother. In cells (WitS) isolated from the tumor, WTX mRNA expression and coding sequence were intact. However, we identified a 44-kb homozygous deletion of the WT1 gene spanning exons 4 to 10. The WT1 deletion was not present in leukocyte DNA from the patient or his mother. We also noted strong beta-catenin (CTNNB1) expression in the tumor cells and identified a heterozygote missense Ser45Cys mutation of exon 3 of CTNNB1. However, the mutation was absent both in the constitutional DNA of the patient and his mother. The concurrence of WT and NDI has not been previously reported and may be unrelated. Nevertheless, this case nicely illustrates the sequence of events leading to sporadic Wilms tumor.",M2

In the kidney, mutations in WT1 can cause diffuse mesangial sclerosis or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Here, we report on a girl with a mutation in WT1, who developed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) 3 years after completion of treatment for Wilms' tumour.

Germline WT1 alterations have been described in a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, including kidney diseases, genital abnormalities and Wilms tumor (WT), frequently occurring in combination. We report on a novel WT1 nonsense mutation (c.1105C&gt;T), introducing a premature stop codon in exon 8 (p.Q369X), in a young XY male patient who presented with bilateral cryptorchidism, nystagmus, mild proteinuria and WT, but no sign of severe nephropathy. Although the majority of congenital urogenital abnormalities are not due to constitutional defects of the WT1 gene, our findings provide a rational for considering WT1 mutational analysis as one of the screening options in newborns with congenital defects of the urogenital tract due to the associated high risk of WT.",M2
18816692,"Management of Wilms tumors in Drash and Frasier syndromes.BACKGROUND: Children with <e>WT1</e> gene-related disorders such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) and Frasier syndrome (FS) are at increased risk of Wilms tumor and end-stage renal disease. We investigated whether Wilms tumors in these patients displayed a specific phenotype or behavior and whether nephron-sparing surgery was beneficial. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively studied all patients with DDS, FS, or other WT1 mutations treated at our institutions between 1980 and 2007. RESULTS: We identified 20 patients, of whom 18 had benign or malignant tumors. Wilms tumors occurred in 15 patients, being unilateral in 10 and bilateral in 5 (20 tumors). Median age at Wilms tumor diagnosis was 9 months. No patients had metastases. According to the International Society of Pediatric Oncology Working Classification, there were 19 intermediate-risk tumors and one high-risk tumor; no tumor was anaplastic. In patients with nephropathy who underwent unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms tumor or nephron-sparing surgery for bilateral Wilms tumor, mean time to dialysis was 11 or 9 months, respectively. Other tumors included three gonadoblastomas (in two patients), one retroperitoneal soft-tissue tumor, and one transitional cell papilloma of the bladder. Two patients, both with stage I Wilms tumor, died from end-stage renal disease-related complications. The median follow-up time for the 18 survivors was 136 months (range, 17-224 months). CONCLUSION: Most Wilms tumors in children with WT1-related disorders were early-stage and intermediate-risk tumors, with a young age at diagnosis. In patients without end-stage renal disease, nephron-sparing surgery should be considered for delaying the onset of renal failure.",M2
18676860,"The Wilms' tumor antigen is a novel target for human CD4+ regulatory T cells: implications for immunotherapy.Compelling evidences indicate a key role for regulatory T cells (T(reg)) on the host response to cancer. The Wilms' tumor antigen (<e>WT1</e>) is overexpressed in several human leukemias and thus considered as promising target for development of leukemia vaccine. However, recent studies indicated that the generation of effective WT1-specific cytotoxic T cells can be largely affected by the presence of T(regs). We have generated T-cell lines and clones that specifically recognized a WT1-84 (RYFKLSHLQMHSRKH) peptide in an HLA-DRB1*0402-restricted manner. Importantly, they recognized HLA-DRB1*04-matched fresh leukemic cells expressing the WT1 antigen. These clones exerted a T helper 2 cytokine profile, had a CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)GITR(+)CD127(-) T(reg) phenotype, and significantly inhibited the proliferative activity of allogeneic T cells independently of cell contact. Priming of alloreactive T cells in the presence of T(regs) strongly inhibited the expansion of natural killer (NK), NK T, and CD8(+) T cells and had an inhibitory effect on NK/NK T cytotoxic activity but not on CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, priming of T cells with the WT1-126 HLA-A0201-restricted peptide in the presence of T(regs) strongly inhibited the induction of anti-WT1-126 CD8(+) CTL responses as evidenced by both very low cytotoxic activity and IFN-gamma production. Moreover, these T(reg) clones specifically produced granzyme B and selectively induced apoptosis in WT1-84-pulsed autologous antigen-presenting cells but not in apoptotic-resistant DR4-matched leukemic cells. Importantly, we have also detected anti-WT1-84 interleukin-5(+)/granzyme B(+)/Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T(regs) in five of eight HLA-DR4(+) acute myeloid leukemia patients. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo findings strongly suggest important implications for the clinical manipulation of T(regs) in cancer patients.",M2
18666806,"PAX3 is expressed in the stromal compartment of the developing kidney and in Wilms tumors with myogenic phenotype.Wilms tumor (WT) is the most frequent renal neoplasm of childhood; a myogenic component is observed in 5% to 10% of tumors. We demonstrate for the first time that myogenic WTs are associated with expression of PAX3, a transcription factor known to specify myoblast cell fate during muscle development. In a panel of 20 WTs, PAX3 was identified in 13 of 13 tumor samples with myogenic histopathology but was absent in 7 of 7 tumors lacking a myogenic component. Furthermore, we show that PAX3 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme and stromal compartment of developing mouse kidney. Modulation of endogenous PAX3 expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells influenced cell migration in in vitro assays. Mutations of <e>WT1</e> were consistently associated with PAX3 expression in WTs, and modulation of WT1 expression in HEK293 cells was inversely correlated with the level of endogenous PAX3 protein. We demonstrate abundant PAX3 and absence of PAX2 expression in a novel cell line (WitP3) isolated from the stromal portion of a WT bearing a homozygous deletion of the WT1 gene. We hypothesize that PAX3 sets stromal cell fate in developing kidney but is normally suppressed by WT1 during the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition leading to nephrogenesis. Loss of WT1 permits aberrant PAX3 expression in a subset of WTs with myogenic phenotype.",M2
18644976,"Frequency and timing of loss of imprinting at 11p13 and 11p15 in Wilms' tumor development.Epigenetic changes occur frequently in Wilms' tumor (WT), especially loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2/H19 at 11p15. Our previous results have identified imprinted transcripts (<e>WT1</e>-AS and AWT1) from the WT1 locus at 11p13 and showed LOI of these in some WTs. In this article, we set out to test the relationship between LOI at 11p13 and 11p15 and their timing in WT progression relative to other genetic changes. We found a higher level (83%) of 11p13 LOI in WT than of 11p15 LOI (71%). There was no correlation between methylation levels at the 11p13 and 11p15 differentially methylated regions or between allelic expression of WT1-AS/AWT1 and IGF2. Interestingly, retention of normal imprinting at 11p13 was associated with a small group of relatively late-onset, high-stage WTs. An examination of genetic and epigenetic alterations in nephrogenic rests, which are premalignant WT precursors, showed that LOI at both 11p13 and 11p15 occurred before either 16q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or 7p LOH. This suggests that these LOH events are very unlikely to be a cause of LOI but that LOH may act by potentiating the effects of overexpression of IGF2 and/or WT1-AS/AWT1 that result from LOI.",M2
18618575,"Clinical relevance of mutations in the Wilms tumor suppressor 1 gene <e>WT1</e> and the cadherin-associated protein beta1 gene CTNNB1 for patients with Wilms tumors: results of long-term surveillance of 71 patients from International Society of Pediatric Oncology Study 9/Society for Pediatric Oncology.BACKGROUND: Mutations in the Wilms tumor (WT) suppressor 1 gene (WT1) and the cadherin-associated protein beta1 gene (CTNNB1) are found predominantly in stromal type WT, defining a genetic subgroup. The clinical relevance of these mutations remains to be determined. METHODS: A long-term follow-up study was performed for 71 patients (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Study 9/Society for Pediatric Oncology; n = 77 tumors) with known molecular genetic status. Eight patients had bilateral disease, including 2 patients with a WT in both kidneys and 5 patients with a WT in 1 kidney and nephrogenic rests (NRs) in the other kidney. The response to preoperative chemotherapy, relapses, metastases, metachronous tumor development, and deaths were evaluated with a median follow-up of 12 years and 4 months. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (n = 24 tumors) had WT1 mutations, and 16 were constitutional mutations. Three patients with germline mutations had second tumor events: Two patients developed a WT in the kidney with NRs 3 years and 11 years after the first tumor; and 1 patient developed second tumors after 2 years, 1 in the kidney with a previous WT and 1 in the kidney with a previous NR. Eighteen of the WT1 mutant tumors were analyzed for CTNNB1 mutations, and all had mutations. A poor volumetric response (progression and &lt;50% reduction) was observed in all patients who had tumors with a WT1 mutation and in 23 of 52 nonmutant tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WT1 germline mutations had an increased risk for bilateral disease and second tumor events. Therefore, the authors concluded that tumor surveillance until adulthood should be considered. Although tumors with both WT1 and CTNNB1 mutations had a poor volumetric response, there was no significant difference in overall survival in this cohort of patients with and without WT1 mutations.",M2

18516627,"A novel Wilms' tumor 1 gene mutation in a child with severe renal dysfunction and persistent renal blastema.The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene <e>WT1</e> is an important regulator of development. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Wilms' tumor, Frasier syndrome, and Denys-Drash syndrome, as well as isolated glomerular disease. Here we report the case of a 4-month-old girl, who presented with end-stage renal disease, thrombopenia, anemia, and cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by severe hypertension. Histological analysis of kidney biopsies revealed a massive and diffuse nephroblastomatosis with a dramatic reduction in the number of glomeruli. Although no normal cortical nephrons could be detected, medullary organization was nearly normal. Sequence analysis demonstrated a heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 9 of WT1, which leads to a truncation of the WT1 protein at the beginning of zinc finger 3. Given the requirement of WT1 for normal development of the kidney and heart, these data raise the hypothesis that the mutation identified was responsible for the severe phenotype observed in our patient.",M2
18467665,"Accumulation of malignant renal stem cells is associated with epigenetic changes in normal renal progenitor genes.Recent studies indicate a dual epigenetic role of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins in self-renewal of stem cells and oncogenesis. Their elevation in our previous human kidney microarray screen led us examine whether they participate in processes involving normal and malignant renal progenitors. We therefore analyzed the expression of the PcG genes (EZH2, BMI-1, EED, SUZ12) in relation to that of the nephric-progenitor genes (<e>WT1</e>, PAX2, SALL1, SIX2, CITED1) using real-time polymerase chain reaction and methylation assays during renal development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Although all of the nephric-progenitor genes were shown to be developmentally regulated, analysis of polycomb gene expression during murine nephrogenesis and in an in vitro induction model of the nephrogenic mesenchyme indicated dynamic regulation only for EZH2 in the normal renal progenitor population. In contrast, induction of adult kidney regeneration by ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted primarily in rapid elevation of BMI-1, whereas EZH2 was silenced. Analysis of renal tumorigenesis in stem cell-like tumor xenografts established by serial passage of Wilms' tumor (WT) in immunodeficient mice showed cooperative upregulation of all PcG genes. This was accompanied by upregulation of WT1, PAX2, and SALL1 but downregulation of SIX2. Accordingly, methylation-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated promoter hypomethylation of WT1, PAX2, and SIX2 in primary WT and fetal kidneys, whereas progressive WT xenografts showed hypermethylation of SIX2, possibly leading to loss of renal differentiation. PcG genes vary in expression during renal development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. We suggest a link between polycomb activation and epigenetic alterations of the renal progenitor population in initiation and progression of renal cancer.",M2
18402324,"[Two neonates with congenital aniridia: the necessity of genetic investigation]Two female neonates were diagnosed post partum with bilateral aniridia. The first patient had the familial form, caused by a point mutation in the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene. The second patient had a sporadic aniridia caused by a de novo microdeletion involving both the PAX6 gene as well as the Wilms tumour suppressor-I (<e>WT1</e>) gene. This made screening for the presence of a Wilms tumour necessary. The second patient died several months after birth, due to respiratory insufficiency. Aniridia is a rare developmental disorder of the eye, with absence of most of the iris tissue, caused by an abnormality in the PAX6 gene on chromosome 11p13. Familial aniridia is usually due to a point mutation of the PAX6 gene, which causes solely ocular abnormalities. Sporadic aniridia is caused by a de novo deletion or microdeletion of chromosome 11p13, which affects not only the PAX6 gene but also the adjacent WT1 gene. In these patients, the Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome can be present, and screening for a Wilms tumour is indicated. Unless previous investigation of a family member has demonstrated the WT1 gene to be normal, chromosome studies should always be performed in patients with aniridia.",M2
18311776,"Wilms tumor genetics: mutations in <e>WT1</e>, WTX, and CTNNB1 account for only about one-third of tumors.Wilms tumor is genetically heterogeneous, and until recently only one Wilms tumor gene was known, WT1 at 11p13. However, WT1 is altered in only approximately 20% of Wilms tumors. Recently a novel gene, WTX at Xq11.1, was reported to be mutated in Wilms tumors. No overlap between tumors with mutations in WTX and WT1 was noted, suggesting that WT1 and WTX mutations could account for the genetic basis of roughly half of Wilms tumors. To assess the frequency of WTX mutations and their relationship to WT1 mutations in a larger (n = 125) panel of Wilms tumors which had been thoroughly assessed for mutations in WT1, we conducted a complete mutational analysis of WTX that included sequencing of the entire coding region and quantitative PCR to identify deletions of the WTX gene. Twenty-three (18.4%) tumors carried a total of 24 WTX mutations, a lower WTX mutation frequency than that previously observed. Surprisingly, we observed an equivalent frequency of WTX mutations in tumors with mutations in either or both WT1 and CTNNB1 (20.0%) and tumors with no mutation in either WT1 or CTNNB1 (17.5%). WTX has been reported to play a role in the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and, interestingly, WTX deletion/truncation mutations appeared to be rare in tumors carrying exon 3 mutations of CTNNB1, encoding beta-catenin. Our findings indicate that WT1 and WTX mutations occur with similar frequency, that they partially overlap in Wilms tumors, and that mutations in WT1, WTX, and CTNNB1 underlie the genetic basis of about one-third of Wilms tumors.",M2

For optimal cure rates stage V WT patients benefit from adjuvant treatment; however, there are limited data available on chemotherapy pharmacokinetics in anephric children. In this report, we describe a 10-month old girl with bilateral Wilms tumor and a novel germline WT1 gene mutation. This patient hardly showed any response on preoperative chemotherapy, and ultimately, underwent sequential bilateral tumor-nephrectomy. Subsequently, during peritoneal dialysis, she received topotecan as adjuvant chemotherapy based on plasma levels, indicating that this is a reasonable option as adjuvant treatment in therapy-resistant Wilms tumor patients after bilateral nephrectomy. This case showed a novel germline WT1 gene mutation of which the correlation with resistant phenotype has to be confirmed in larger cohorts of WT patients.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHOD: MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which express a high level of WT1, were transfected with synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting WT1 (siRNA(WT1)) resulting in inhibition of WTI expression, as well as growth, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. RESULT: The minimum concentration of siRNA(WT1) for growth inhibition and WT1 silencing was 25 nM and 50 nM respectively. WT1 expression was completely abolished at 200 nM siRNA,.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case note review of 3 siblings, 2 of which presented with extrarenal Wilms tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis for <e>WT1</e> gene product was performed together with molecular genetic linkage studies. RESULTS: A 3-year-old boy had excision of a right-sided extrarenal retroperitoneal Wilms tumor and nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy. At follow-up of 4 years, the boy was well and thriving. Aged 2 years, his sister developed a left-sided retroperitoneal extrarenal Wilms tumor. She had a tumor excision and nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy. She was well on follow-up more than a year after completion of treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis identified WT1 gene product within the tumor for both cases. Molecular genetic linkage studies showed no linkage between the index cases at FWT1 locus. Although possible linkage was demonstrated at WT1 locus, no mutation was found in the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of WT1 gene in index patient 1. A possible linkage between the index cases was also found at FWT2 locus. This could be a chance event because of the close relationship of the 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We could identify extrarenal Wilms tumor in a family for the first time. Immunohistochemical analysis showed WT1 gene products in both cases. Linkage studies for Wilms tumor genes within the family were inconclusive. The possible linkage between the 2 index cases may be a chance event.",M2

Molecular studies in these types of cancers have highlighted novel components upstream and downstream of this central oncogenic pathway. Beta-catenin gain-of-function mutations are strongly linked to <e>WT1</e> loss-of-function mutations in syndromic Wilms tumors, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling increases androgen receptor mRNA expression and blocks apoptosis in prostate cancers. Novel downstream target genes activated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are emerging from expression profiling in genetically defined classes of Wilms tumors, and similar analyses are expected to reveal additional downstream genes of this pathway specific to prostate cancers.

17630404,"Raised risk of Wilms tumour in patients with aniridia and submicroscopic <e>WT1</e> deletion.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference in the risk of developing Wilms tumour between patients with submicroscopic and those with visible deletions of the WT1 tumour suppressor gene. METHODS: To determine which subjects had WT1 deletions, high-resolution chromosomal deletion analysis of the 11p13 region was carried out in 193 people with aniridia. The rationale for this was that aniridia is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX6 gene, and although most patients with aniridia have intragenic mutations, a proportion has deletions that also include the nearby WT1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of patients with aniridia identifies people with WT1 deletions regardless of whether they have Wilms tumour, allowing the deletion size to be correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Wilms tumour was not observed in any case without a WT1 deletion. Of subjects in whom WT1 was deleted, 77% with submicroscopic deletions (detectable only by high-resolution FISH analysis) presented with Wilms tumour compared with 42.5% with visible deletions (detectable by microscopy). This difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution deletion analysis is a useful tool for assessing the risk of Wilms tumour in neonates with aniridia. People with submicroscopic WT1 deletions have a significantly increased risk of Wilms tumour, and a high level of vigilance should be maintained in such cases.",M2

Long-term results of a study in Erlangen]BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumors are highly malignant tumors of the kidneys and are among the most frequent solid tumors of childhood, which are diagnosed for the most part before the 5th year. Various congenital anomalies are associated with a genetic predisposition and thus an increased risk of developing a Wilms' tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a retrospective analysis, the records from 1965 to 2003 of 66 patients with histologically confirmed Wilms' tumor were reviewed. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and type of different urogenital malformations as well as the genetic mutations and overall survival in this patient group. RESULTS: The patient cohort comprised 66 patients with histologically confirmed Wilms' tumor: 35 male patients (53%) and 31 female patients (47%). The overall survival after 10 years was 89.4%. All patients underwent radical nephrectomy: transperitoneal approach in 63 and lumbar approach in 3 patients. Eleven (16.7%) patients had diverse urogenital anomalies. A cytogenetic investigation was performed in 38 patients that revealed no pathological findings. The results of molecular genetic testing of tumor specimens were available for seven patients: a genetic mutation was detected in one case (heterozygous mutation R394 in exon 9 of the <e>WT1</e> gene) which had already been described in the literature in conjunction with Denys-Drash syndrome. Hemihypertrophy with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was present in two (3%) patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with urogenital malformations and Wilms' tumor, it would be important to carry out further molecular genetic testing to identify possible WT1 gene mutations. Close interdisciplinary cooperation between urologists, specialists in human genetics, and pediatricians is imperative.",M2
17210670,"A CTCF-binding silencer regulates the imprinted genes AWT1 and <e>WT1</e>-AS and exhibits sequential epigenetic defects during Wilms' tumourigenesis.We have shown previously that AWT1 and WT1-AS are functionally imprinted in human kidney. In the adult kidney, expression of both transcripts is restricted to the paternal allele, with the silent maternal allele retaining methylation at the WT1 antisense regulatory region (WT1 ARR). Here, we report characterization of the WT1 ARR differentially methylated region and show that it contains a transcriptional silencer element acting on both the AWT1 and WT1-AS promoters. DNA methylation of the silencer results in increased transcriptional repression, and the silencer is also shown to be an in vitro and in vivo target site for the imprinting regulator protein CTCF. Binding of CTCF is methylation-sensitive and limited to the unmethylated silencer. Potentiation of the silencer activity is demonstrated after CTCF protein is knocked down, suggesting a novel silencer-blocking activity for CTCF. We also report assessment of WT1 ARR methylation in developmental and tumour tissues, including the first analysis of Wilms' tumour precursor lesions, nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests show increases in methylation levels relative to foetal kidney and reductions relative to the adult kidney, together with biallelic expression of AWT1 and WT1-AS. Notably, the methylation status of CpG residues within the CTCF target site appears to distinguish monoallelic and biallelic expression states. Our data suggest that failure of methylation spreading at the WT1 ARR early in renal development, followed by imprint erasure, occurs during Wilms' tumourigenesis. We propose a model wherein imprinting defects at chromosome 11p13 may contribute to Wilms' tumourigenesis.",M2

Twenty-three years after the surgery, the tumour relapsed: the lesion was exclusively composed of mature skeletal muscle elements (diffuse and intense desmin reactivity) derived from the primary tumour as confirmed by <e>WT1</e> immunoreactivity. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been reported previously to ablate the immature components of WT; especially, chemotherapy can modify the histological type, reducing the immature elements while leaving mature cells unaffected. We can hypothesise that both morphological and molecular features of the tumour as well as the effect of therapy can influence a tumour relapse in WT. The latter results in a high degree of differentiation and a long disease-free interval after the first diagnosis.",M2
17103382,"Analysis by array CGH of genomic changes associated with the progression or relapse of Wilms' tumour.Despite aggressive salvage regimens, approximately half of all children who suffer a Wilms' tumour recurrence will die of their disease. Although there are increasing data on molecular genetic prognostic factors present in the tumour at diagnosis, there is little information regarding the molecular events that occur with Wilms' tumour progression and relapse. In the present study, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis has been carried out on 58 Wilms' tumour samples, which included 38 untreated primary and 20 recurrent tumours. A higher degree of copy number changes was observed in the recurrent tumours (33.0% genomic clones) than in the primary tumour (21.2%). Paired analysis highlighted the acquisition of 15q gain with high levels of IGF1R expression in the tumour recurrence in two cases. The most statistically significant abnormality acquired between diagnosis and relapse was loss of 17p. One case that experienced 17p loss was classified as favourable histology at diagnosis, but exhibited diffuse anaplasia at recurrence and had a homozygous TP53 deletion. Another instructive case with a constitutional 11p13 deletion presented with bilateral tumours and suffered two subsequent recurrences in the left kidney. A somatic <e>WT1</e> mutation was found only in the right kidney tumour, while the constitutional 11p13 deletion was the only abnormality detected in the initial left kidney tumour by aCGH. The two subsequent relapses in the left kidney contained an accumulation of additional genetic alterations, including an independent WT1 mutation.",M2

Patients with Denys-Drash syndrome present with early nephrotic syndrome with diffuse mesangial sclerosis progressing rapidly to end-stage renal failure, male pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms' tumor. Incomplete forms of the syndrome have been described. Germline WT1 missense mutations located in exons 8 or 9 coding for zinc fingers 2 or 3 have been detected in nearly all patients with Denys-Drash syndrome and in some patients with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Patients with Frasier syndrome present with normal female external genitalia, streak gonads, XY karyotype and progressive nephropathy with proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome with focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis progressing to end-stage renal disease in adolescence or young adulthood. They frequently develop gonadoblastoma. Germline intronic mutations leading to the loss of the +KTS isoforms have been observed in all patients with Frasier syndrome. The same mutations have been observed in genetically female patients with isolated FSGS. Transmission of the mutation is possible. Frasier mutations have also been reported in children with Denys-Drash syndrome.",M2
16912181,"Wilms' tumor 1 and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 synergistically promote cell proliferation: a possible mechanism in sporadic Wilms' tumor.Transcription factor Wilms' tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) was originally identified as a tumor suppressor for Wilms' tumor, but it is also overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells, suggesting a potential oncogenic function of WT1. It is important to understand molecular mechanisms underlying these dual functions of WT1 in tumorigenesis. In the current study, we report a synergistic role for signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and WT1 in tumor development, including Wilms' tumor. STAT3 interacts with WT1 through its conserved domains both in vitro and in vivo. When STAT3 is activated, expression of WT1 enhances STAT3 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of WT1 and STAT3CA in NIH 3T3 increases the expression level of STAT3 target genes, including cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL, which results in an advantage of cell proliferation. Our results suggest that in the presence of activated STAT3, WT1 promotes cell proliferation instead of suppressing cell proliferation. Strikingly, STAT3 translocates to the nucleus and interacts with WT1 in a variety of primary Wilms' tumor cells, raising the hypothesis that WT1 and activated STAT3 in Wilms' tumor accelerate tumorigenesis.",M2
16909133,"Genetic and epigenetic alterations on the short arm of chromosome 11 are involved in a majority of sporadic Wilms' tumours.Wilms' tumour is one of the most common solid tumours of childhood. 11p13 (<e>WT1</e> locus) and 11p15.5 (WT2 locus) are known to have genetic or epigenetic aberrations in these tumours. In Wilms' tumours, mutation of the Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) gene at the WT1 locus has been reported, and the WT2 locus, comprising the two independent imprinted domains IGF2/H19 and KIP2/LIT1, can undergo maternal deletion or alterations associated with imprinting. Although these alterations have been identified in many studies, it is still not clear how frequently combined genetic and epigenetic alterations of these loci are involved in Wilms' tumours or how these alterations occur. To answer both questions, we performed genetic and epigenetic analyses of these loci, together with an additional gene, CTNNB1, in 35 sporadic Wilms' tumours. Loss of heterozygosity of 11p15.5 and loss of imprinting of IGF2 were the most frequent genetic (29%) and epigenetic (40%) alterations in Wilms' tumours, respectively. In total, 83% of the tumours had at least one alteration at 11p15.5 and/or 11p13. One-third of the tumours had alterations at multiple loci. Our results suggest that chromosome 11p is not only genetically but also epigenetically critical for the majority of Wilms' tumours.",M2

Effusions are not uncommon and may suggest an unfavorable prognosis when containing anaplastic tumor cells. In the present case, we report the cytological appearance of a Wilms' tumor metastatic to the pleura. The effusion consisted primarily of tumor cells demonstrating epithelial differentiation. The tumor cells mostly presented as three-dimensional aggregates in an inflammatory background. Many cystic and tubular structures were identified. The tumor cells demonstrated strong CD56 and <e>WT1</e> immunoreactivity. The histology of a subsequent surgical specimen reflected the features seen in cytology.",M2
16690728,"Syndromes and constitutional chromosomal abnormalities associated with Wilms tumour.Wilms tumour has been reported in association with over 50 different clinical conditions and several abnormal constitutional karyotypes. Conclusive evidence of an increased risk of Wilms tumour exists for only a minority of these conditions, including <e>WT1</e> associated syndromes, familial Wilms tumour, and certain overgrowth conditions such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. In many reported conditions the rare co-occurrence of Wilms tumour is probably due to chance. However, for several conditions the available evidence cannot either confirm or exclude an increased risk, usually because of the rarity of the syndrome. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that an increased risk of Wilms tumour occurs only in a subset of individuals for some syndromes. The complex clinical and molecular heterogeneity of disorders associated with Wilms tumour, together with the apparent absence of functional links between most of the known predisposition genes, suggests that abrogation of a variety of pathways can promote Wilms tumorigenesis.",M2
16196523,"Passive seeding in metanephric adenoma: a review of pseudometastatic lesions in perinephric lymph nodes.Lymph node involvement derived from a discrete neoplastic process fundamentally implies tumor malignancy. However, rarely, inconsequential passive transport of benign neoplastic cells to the lymph node can occur and may cause confusion as to the nature of the neoplasm (ie, malignant vs benign). We describe a 10-cm right renal metanephric adenoma incidentally discovered in a 30-year-old woman during cesarean section for a triplet pregnancy. Subsequent nephrectomy following an equivocal needle biopsy diagnosis showed histologic features classic for metanephric adenoma, including the lack of cytologic atypia and mitoses. Necrosis present in this lesion appeared to be secondary to tumor physical disruption. The tumor cells were positive for Wilms tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) antigen, pankeratin, and CD57, focally positive for epithelial membrane antigen, and negative for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 34betaE12, and CD56. Electron microscopy confirmed the tumor's epithelial nature, and cytogenetics revealed a diploid 46XX karyotype. The tumor proliferation index with Ki-67 was only 3% to 5% and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen index was 0%. A single, concurrently resected hilar lymph node contained scattered subcapsular, sinusoidal, and focally intralymphovascular psammoma bodies along with occasional adherent epithelial cells. These cells were highlighted by pankeratin but were nonreactive to WT1 antigen, similar to the nonviable cells in the primary tumor. Clinical surveillance and follow-up showed no disease recurrence 4 years after nephrectomy. We postulate that the lymph node inclusions found in this case represent passive transport of neoplastic cells to the lymph node following manipulation of the renal mass. We conclude that this phenomenon is understudied and underrecognized and can easily be mistaken for metastasis.",M2
16110318,"Wilms' tumour: connecting tumorigenesis and organ development in the kidney.Wilms' tumour, or nephroblastoma, is a common childhood tumour that is intimately linked to early kidney development and is often associated with persistent embryonic renal tissue and other kidney abnormalities. <e>WT1</e>, the first gene found to be inactivated in Wilms' tumour, encodes a transcription factor that functions as both a tumour suppressor and a critical regulator of renal organogenesis.

16106426,"Decrease in LDL receptor-related protein expression and function correlates with advanced stages of Wilms tumors.BACKGROUND: The molecular processes responsible for the invasive phenotype of pediatric Wilms tumors (WT) are poorly understood. A candidate WT suppressor gene (<e>WT1</e>) has been found mutated in a number of these pediatric kidney tumors. However, the disruption of normal WT1 protein function cannot solely explain WT growth. The aim of the present study is to identify new molecular players that regulate the invasive character of WT. PROCEDURE: Fresh frozen samples from 45 renal tumors of Wilms were obtained from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group's Biological Samples Bank. Gelatin zymography, Western blotting, and immunodetection were used to compare tissue biopsies originating from the infiltrating (stage III), metastatic (stage IV), and anaplastic phenotype of Wilms tumors (WT). RESULTS: The expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) diminished in stage IV and anaplastic WT. Moreover, the expression of RAP, an LRP intracellular chaperone, was also decreased. The diminished expression of LRP and RAP correlated with increased levels of several known extracellular ligands that LRP usually recycles from the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, including PAI-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1. The proteolytic processing of MT1-MMP, a functional regulator of LRP, also correlated with the WT invasive phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The low expression of LRP, whose function is regulated by MT1-MMP and whose activity in recycling ECM-associated proteolytic enzymes becomes drastically diminished in advanced stages of WT, may in part explain the acquired invasive potential of the developing WT pediatric cancer.",M2
15999116,"Molecular subtypes and phenotypic expression of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) results from mutations or epigenetic events involving imprinted genes at 11p15.5. Most BWS cases are sporadic and uniparental disomy (UPD) or putative imprinting errors predominate in this group. Sporadic cases with putative imprinting defects may be subdivided into (a) those with loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 and H19 hypermethylation and silencing due to a defect in a distal 11p15.5 imprinting control element (IC1) and (b) those with loss of methylation at KvDMR1, LOI of KCNQ1OT1 (LIT1) and variable LOI of IGF2 in whom there is a defect at a more proximal imprinting control element (IC2). We investigated genotype/epigenotype-phenotype correlations in 200 cases with a confirmed molecular genetic diagnosis of BWS (16 with CDKN1C mutations, 116 with imprinting centre 2 defects, 14 with imprinting centre 1 defects and 54 with UPD). Hemihypertrophy was strongly associated with UPD (P&lt;0.0001) and exomphalos was associated with an IC2 defect or CDKN1C mutation but not UPD or IC1 defect (P&lt;0.0001). When comparing birth weight centile, IC1 defect cases were significantly heavier than the patients with CDKN1C mutations or IC2 defect (P=0.018). The risk of neoplasia was significantly higher in UPD and IC1 defect cases than in IC2 defect and CDKN1C mutation cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a risk of neoplasia for all patients of 9% at age 5 years, but 24% in the UPD subgroup. The risk of Wilms' tumour in the IC2 defect subgroup appears to be minimal and intensive screening for Wilms' tumour appears not to be indicated. In UPD patients, UPD extending to <e>WT1</e> was associated with renal neoplasia (P=0.054). These findings demonstrate that BWS represents a spectrum of disorders. Identification of the molecular subtype allows more accurate prognostic predictions and enhances the management and surveillance of BWS children such that screening for Wilms' tumour and hepatoblastoma can be focused on those at highest risk.",M2
15848740,"Nephroblastic neoplasms.Nephroblastoma, or Wilms tumor, is a malignant embryonal neoplasm that is derived from nephrogenic blastemal cells, with variable recapitulation of renal embryogenesis. The pathogenesis of nephroblastoma is complex and has been linked to alterations of several genomic loci, including <e>WT1</e>, WT2, FWT1, and FWT2. Generally, nephroblastoma is composed of variable proportions of blastema, epithelium, and stroma, each of which may exhibit a wide spectrum of morphologic variations. Distinguishing nephroblastoma with favorable histology from tumors that exhibit anaplasia is an integral component of histologic assessment because of its prognostic and therapeutic implications. Nephrogenic rests and a special variant of nephroblastoma, cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, also are discussed.",M2
15761866,"Genome-wide loss of heterozygosity analysis of <e>WT1</e>-wild-type and WT1-mutant Wilms tumors.Wilms tumor (WT) is genetically heterogeneous, and the one known WT gene, WT1 at 11p13, is altered in only a subset of WTs. Previous loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses have revealed the existence of additional putative WT genes at 11p15, 16q, and 1p, but these analyses examined only one or a handful of chromosomes or looked at LOH at only a few markers per chromosome. We conducted a genome-wide scan for LOH in WT by using 420 markers spaced at an average of 10 cM throughout the genome and analyzed the data for two genetically defined subsets of WTs: those with mutations in WT1 and those with no detectable WT1 alteration. Our findings indicated that the incidence of LOH throughout the genome was significantly lower in our group of WTs with WT1 mutations. In WT1-wild-type tumors, we observed the expected LOH at 11p, 16q, and 1p, and, in addition, we localized a previously unobserved region of LOH at 9q. Using additional 9q markers within this region of interest, we sublocalized the region of 9q LOH to the 12.2 Mb between D9S283 and a simple tandem repeat in BAC RP11-177I8, a region containing several potential tumor-suppressor genes. As a result, we have established for the first time that WT1-mutant and WT1-wild-type WTs differ significantly in their patterns of LOH throughout the genome, suggesting that the genomic regions showing LOH in WT1-wild-type tumors harbor genes whose expression is regulated by the pleiotropic effects of WT1. Our results implicate 9q22.2-q31.1 as a region containing such a gene.",M2
15677533,"Imprinting, expression, and localisation of DLK1 in Wilms tumours.BACKGROUND: Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the H19/IGF2 domain is a common feature of Wilms tumour. The GTL2/DLK1 domain is also imprinted and is structurally similar to H19/IGF2. The question arises as to whether DLK1 also undergoes LOI in Wilms tumour, or whether the LOI mechanism is restricted to the H19/IGF2 domain. AIM: To investigate the imprinting status of DLK1 in Wilms tumours with IGF2 LOI. The cellular localisation of DLK1 in the tumours was also examined. METHODS: DLK1 expression was measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in 30 Wilms tumours that had previously been classified according to whether they had IGF2 LOI, <e>WT1</e> mutations, or 11p15.5 loss of heterozygosity. Allele specific expression of DLK1 was examined by direct sequencing using a DLK1 exon 5 polymorphism (rs1802710). Immunohistochemical analysis of DLK1 was performed on 13 tumours and two intralobar nephrogenic rests, in addition to two fetal kidneys and one fetal skeletal muscle sample. RESULTS: Ten of 30 tumours were heterozygous for rs1802710 and all tumours showed retention of imprinting of DLK1. Moderate to high expression of DLK1 was detected by Q-PCR in nine of 13 tumours with myogenic differentiation. Immunohistochemical expression of DLK1 was detected in the myogenic elements. CONCLUSION: LOI does not occur at the GTL2/DLK1 domain in Wilms tumour. This finding suggests that LOI at 11p15.5 does not reflect non-specific disruption of a shared imprinting mechanism. DLK1 expression in Wilms tumour might reflect the presence of myogenic differentiation, rather than an alteration of its imprinting status.",M2
15648285,"Immunohistochemical expression of Wilms' tumor 1 protein in nephroblastoma.BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of nephroblastomas (Wilms' tumors) carry mutations in the Wilms' tumor 1 (<e>WT1</e>) gene. Recently, a WT1 antibody raised against N-terminal 1-181 amino acids of human WT1 became commercially available for immunohistochemical use on paraffin-embedded tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of WT1 N-terminal antibody in nephroblastomas. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with nephroblastoma were studied. Four clear cell sarcomas of the kidney (CCSK) and 15 neuroblastomas were included for comparative study. WT1 immunostaining was performed on paraffin material using the WT1(6F-H2) antibody. The patients were staged according to the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) staging system. RESULTS: Eleven tumors (44%) showed blastemal nuclear staining with or without epithelial nuclear staining. Three of the 13 low-stage tumors (stages I and II) showed WT1 blastemal nuclear staining, while 8 of the 12 high stage (stage III and IV) tumors revealed blastemal nuclear staining. The blastemal nuclear expressions of WT1 were statistically significantly correlated with clinical stage (p = 0.036). All the neuroblastomas and CCSK showed no nuclear immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of WT1 nuclear immunoreactivity may be helpful to distinguish blastemal predominant nephroblastomas from CCSK and neuroblastomas.",M2
15591903,"Effective use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue for relapsed adult Wilms' tumor and a novel alteration in intron 1 of the <e>WT1</e> gene.Adult Wilms' tumor (AWT) is a very rare and aggressive malignancy, and little information is available on effective therapy in adults. Although mutations in WT1 have been found in 10% to 15% of childhood Wilms' tumor patients, to date WT1 mutations in AWT patients have not been described. The authors describe a 47-year-old man with relapsed AWT and a novel germline alteration in intron 1 of WT1: IVS1-6 C--&gt;A. This alteration may reduce the splicing efficiency for exon 2 and possibly results in exon skipping. The effective salvage chemotherapy contained ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and was followed by a high-dose chemotherapy that contained melphalan, carboplatin, and etoposide. Both chemotherapy regimens showed moderate treatment-related toxicity. This report is the first that indicates that adult nephroblastoma patients also may carry WT1 germline mutations.",M2
15264270,"Familial Wilms tumor.Wilms tumor (WT), an embryonic tumor arising from undifferentiated renal mesenchyme, has been a productive model for understanding the role of genes in both tumorigenesis and normal organogenesis. Approximately 2% of WT patients have a family history of WT, and even sporadic WT is thought to have a strong genetic component to its etiology. Familial WT cases generally have an earlier age of onset and an increased frequency of bilateral disease, although there is variability among WT families, with some families displaying later than average ages at diagnosis. One WT gene, <e>WT1</e> at 11p13, has been cloned, but only a minority of tumors carry detectable mutations at that locus, and it can be excluded as the predisposition gene in most WT families. Two familial WT genes have been localized, FWT1 at 17q12-q21 and FWT2 at 19q13.4; lack of linkage in some WT families to either of these loci implies the existence of at least one additional familial WT gene. Originally modeled as the inheritance of a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, molecular analysis of familial tumors not linked to 11p13 have provided data suggesting that this model may be overly simplistic and/or not applicable to all WT families. Identification of the FWT1 and FWT2 genes will help clarify this and will also likely aid in our understanding in general of the roles of the various WT genes and their genetic interactions in the development of WT.",M2

This combined database contains 282 patients, 117 patients with and 165 without WT1 germline alterations. Using this information we have determined the median age of tumor-onset for patients with (12.5 months) and without WT1 gene alterations (36 months). The earliest onset was in patients with truncation (12 mo, 66 patients), followed by missense mutations (18 mo, 30 patients) and deletions (22 mo, 21 patients). Patients with the two most frequent nonsense mutations R362X and R390X and the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) hot spot mutation R394W/Q/L had a very early onset (9, 12, and 18 mo, respectively). The highest number of bilateral tumors was observed in the group of truncation mutations, with a higher percentage of bilateral tumors when truncations occurred in the 5' half of the WT1 gene. In addition to genital tract anomalies (GU), early onset nephrotic syndrome with diffuse mesangial sclerosis and stromal-predominant histology, tumor bilaterality, and early age of onset can now be added to the list of risk factors for carrying a germline WT1 mutation.",M2
15105660,"Nephroblastoma arising in a germ cell tumor of testicular origin.We report a nephroblastoma arising in a germ cell tumor of testicular origin occurring in a 22-year-old man. Orchiectomy demonstrated a malignant mixed germ cell tumor composed of mature and immature teratoma with nephroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Following chemotherapy, the patient developed supraclavicular and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Excision demonstrated metastatic teratoma at both sites. No recurrence was noted with 21 months of additional follow-up. Using tissue microdissection and loss of heterozygosity analysis, we investigated the clonality of the mature teratoma, immature teratoma, nephroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma components of the primary tumor and of the metastatic mature teratoma at the two separate distant sites. Nine microsatellite polymorphic makers were used to examine the pattern of allelic loss in both primary and metastatic tumors. Loss of heterozygosity was found in 4 DNA loci, and the same pattern of allelic loss was demonstrated at all 4 loci in all of the different components of the primary tumor and the metastatic mature teratomas, supporting the germ cell tumor origin of the nephroblastoma component. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p13 (TP53) was detected in metastatic mature teratoma, but not in the primary tumor. Loss of heterozygosity was observed at 11p13, the locus of <e>WT1</e> inactivation in patients genetically predisposed to nephroblastoma, and this loss may be an important genetic mechanism in nephroblastomatous differentiation of germ cell tumors. These data support a common clonal origin for nephroblastoma and the other germ cell tumor components.",M2
14994125,"Myogenesis in Wilms' tumors is associated with mutations of the <e>WT1</e> gene and activation of Bcl-2 and the Wnt signaling pathway.Wilms tumors with WT1 mutations [ WT1(-)] have a stromal-predominant histology with varying extents of rhabdomyogenesis. These tumors also frequently have mutations in the beta-catenin gene ( CTNNB1). We have investigated the molecular events that may explain the origins of rhabdomyogenesis in WT1(-) tumors. Of 35 Wilms tumors, we identified 12 with WT1 mutations, of which 9 carried CTNNB1 mutations. We compared WT1 wild-type tumors [ WT1(+)] with WT1(-) tumors for histological features, localization of beta-catenin, Bcl-2 expression, and apoptosis using an in-situ end-labeling technique. WT1(+) tumors showed triphasic and blastemal- and epithelial predominant-histology. Expression of WT1, beta-catenin, and Bcl-2 recapitulated those of normal kidney epithelial development. Localization of beta-catenin was observed in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membrane of early glomerular epithelial structures. Bcl-2 is also expressed in condensing blastema and early glomerular epithelial structures which had little apoptosis. WT1(-) tumors, regardless of whether CTNNB1 mutations were detected or not, showed a stromal-rich phenotype with abundant expression of beta-catenin in the nucleus of the rhabdomyoblasts. Bcl-2 was expressed in rhabdomyoblasts, but not in blastemal cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that WT1 regulates Bcl-2 positively in the epithelial pathway, but negatively in the myogenic pathway. These data indicate that mutations in WT1 might alter the Wnt signaling pathway and Bcl-2 related-apoptosis. In WT1(-) tumors, the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and Bcl-2 expression are associated with rhabdomyogenesis, and dysregulation of Bcl-2 may be a mechanism by which the histogenesis (loss of blastemal component, muscle differentiation) may be explained.",M2
14671061,"Prophylactic bilateral nephrectomies in two paediatric patients with missense mutations in the <e>WT1</e> gene.BACKGROUND: Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is associated with mutations of the Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) gene, and is characterized by pseudohermaphroditism, a progressive glomerulopathy, and the development of Wilms' tumour. More than 90% of patients with DDS who carry constitutional intragenic WT1 mutations are at high risk (90%) for the development of Wilms' tumour. WT1 is a signalling protein with 90% of WT1 mutations occurring in the WT1 zinc finger region as single nucleotide polymorphisms, the majority of which are missense mutations. METHODS: Constitutional DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Direct sequencing and restriction enzymes were employed to analyse mutations. RESULTS: Two children, 46XY males who had evidence of pseudohermaphroditism, hypogonadism and renal failure with a glomerulopathy atypical for DDS, but no Wilms' tumour or nephroblastomatosis, on investigation, prior to transplant, were identified with missense mutations in the WT1 gene, in exons 8 and 9, respectively. The decision to do prophylactic nephrectomies was based on the genetic identification of WT1 mutations supporting a diagnosis of incomplete DDS, with the potential for increased risk of malignancy with the development of Wilms' tumour. The nephrectomy specimens demonstrated nephrogenic rests (nephroblastomatosis), which have a potential for malignant transformation. CONCLUSIONS: WT1 missense mutations in exons 8 and 9 can be regarded as having the potential for malignant change supporting prophylactic nephrectomy in apparent incomplete DDS patients with end-stage renal disease.",M2
14506735,"Derivation and characterization of a Wilms' tumour cell line, WiT 49.Wilms' tumour is a pediatric neoplasm exhibiting histologic features of developing kidney. Although the majority of Wilms' tumour patients are treated effectively, approximately 15% develop metastases and of these, 30% succumb to their disease. The biologic factors governing Wilms' tumour metastasis are largely unknown. Attempts at deriving representative Wilms' tumour cell lines, which could facilitate functional studies, have only been partially successful thus far. We now report on derivation and characterization of a Wilms' tumour cell line, WiT 49, from a first-generation xenograft of a human Wilms' tumour lung metastasis. WiT 49 recapitulates the phenotype of the parent tumours (primary and lung metastasis) and expresses normal <e>WT1</e>, overexpresses IGFII and carries a frequently identified p53 mutation. We recently reported overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor(HGF) and its receptor met in a series of Wilms' tumours with higher levels in homotypic metastatic cases. We therefore examined WiT 49 for expression of HGF/met and for met signaling targets associated with cell adhesion and cytoplasmic mediators of transcription using Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence labeling and zymography. Our results show co-expression of HGF and met protein, absence of E-cadherin, high levels of beta-catenin co-immunolocalized to met at the cell membrane and moderate levels of gamma-catenin and ezrin protein expression. After cell fractionation, beta-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of WiT 49 with relatively higher levels in the cytoplasm as compared to nuclei. Examination of MMP expression in WiT 49 showed constitutive activation of MMP 9 and latent MMP 2 supporting possible beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. The WiT 49 cell line responded to recombinant human HGF by an increase in the expression of the met receptor, recruitment of the Gab-1 adapter protein to met and release of bound beta-catenin from met. Our studies therefore establish WiT 49 as a representative Wilms' tumour cell line derived from a lung metastasis that co-expresses HGF/met and shows absence of the cadherin-catenin complex supporting a role for these factors in regulation of the invasive and metastatic phenotype in Wilms' tumour.",M2
12949968,"The Simpson-Golabi-Behmel gene, GPC3, is not involved in sporadic Wilms tumorigenesis.Many genes have been implicated in Wilms tumor; however, only one gene, <e>WT1</e>, has a proven role in the development of this embryonal tumor. Wilms tumor occurs in a number of congenital syndromes including the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) which has phenotypic overlap with another Wilms tumor-predisposing syndrome Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. The putative function and expression pattern of the SGBS gene, glypican 3 (GPC3), makes it an attractive candidate Wilms tumor gene. We, therefore, hypothesized that Wilms tumors from non-SGBS patients may harbor somatic mutations of GPC3. Mutation analysis of 64 Wilms tumors was performed. One case of a tumor-specific deletion of the entire GPC3 gene and several polymorphisms were identified. GPC3 expression was evaluated in 36 Wilms tumors and 29/36 expressed GPC3. Surprisingly, we did not find evidence of functional mutations of GPC3 in sporadic Wilms tumor suggesting that GPC3 is not often directly involved in Wilms tumorigenesis.",M2

Review of the literature revealed that most patients with trisomy 18 who develop Wilms tumor, do so at a later than expected age for a tumor related to NB, and are females. In this case, no chromosome 11 <e>WT1</e> mutation was detected by PCR/SSCP analysis, but the tumor had in addition to the trisomy, an isochromosome 7q and loss of heterozygosity at 16q, two mutations that have been linked independently to Wilms tumorigenesis.",M2
12673563,"Clonality and loss of heterozygosity of WT genes are early events in the pathogenesis of nephroblastomas.Nephrogenic rests (NRs), putative precursor lesions of nephroblastomas (Wilms' tumors), are found in 25% to 40% of kidneys presenting with nephroblastomas. Nephroblastomas are clonal tumors that, according to a genetic multistep model, are thought to arise as subclonal proliferations from NRs by accumulating genetic alterations. Different candidate genes for the pathogenesis of nephroblastomas have been identified, including those at chromosomes 11p13 (<e>WT1</e> gene), 11p15 (WT2 gene), and 16q (WT3 gene). We investigated clonality and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at these loci in different subtypes of NR. After microdissection under microscopic control, we analyzed a highly polymorphic locus of the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) for nonrandom X-inactivation of genomic DNA using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme to investigate clonality. Out of 14 patients, we found that 1 case each of adenomatous and hyperplastic NR and 2 of 7 cases of sclerosing NR were monoclonal. Five patients were noninformative. We assessed LOH at chromosomes 11p13, 11p15, and 16q by analyzing polymorphic gene loci at these regions. One hyperplastic NR and the corresponding tumor showed LOH at 11p13 and 11p15; 1 sclerosing NR and the corresponding tumor exhibited LOH at chromosome 16q. We demonstrate for the first time that sclerosing NRs can exhibit genetic alterations found in nephroblastomas, namely monoclonality and LOH at the WT gene loci. The histological morphology is no different between NRs with these genetic alterations and NRs without them. We conclude that these genetic changes are early events in the multistep genetic pathogenesis of nephroblastomas; however, they do not seem to fully determine a malignant potential of NR.",M2
12613515,"Rapid screening of leukemia fusion transcripts in acute leukemia by real-time PCR.We established a real-time PCR method that can simultaneously detect 10 different fusion transcripts (major, minor and micro BCR/ABL, AML1/MTG8, PML/RARalpha, CBFbeta/MYH11, TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1, MLL/AF4, and MLL/AF9) together with Wilms' tumor gene (<e>WT1</e>) transcripts. This screening method allowed the processing of six specimens concomitantly and required only one working day from RNA extraction to final results. Fifty-seven bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with acute leukemia were retrospectively screened for the presence of fusion and WT1 transcripts without knowledge of the cytogenetic data, and the fusion transcripts were detected in 20 of 57 samples (35.1%). The concordance between the present method and cytogenetic analysis was examined in 38 samples in which the cytogenetic data were available. In 12 of 38 samples, the PCR results agreed with the cytogenetic data, whereas in 4 of the remaining 26 samples, the translocations were detected by real-time PCR alone because of the insufficient number of metaphases obtained and presumably the submicroscopic or masked translocations. The WT1 levels ranged from 400 to 690,000 copies/microg RNA in BM from leukemia patients, whereas 0-470 copies/microg RNA were found in BM cells from BMT donors. This real-time PCR method enables rapid and efficient characterization of acute leukemia in addition to subsequent evaluation of minimal residual diseases.",M2

12370819,"Frequent RASSF1A tumour suppressor gene promoter methylation in Wilms' tumour and colorectal cancer.The 3p21.3 tumour suppressor gene (TSG) RASSF1A is inactivated predominantly by promoter methylation and rarely by somatic mutations. Recently we demonstrated that epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A is frequent in both clear cell and papillary adult renal cell carcinomas (even though 3p21.3 allele loss is rare in papillary tumours). Wilms' tumour is the most common childhood kidney tumour, but relatively little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. Thus TSGs such as <e>WT1</e>, p16(CDKN2a) and p53 are inactivated in only a minority of cases. In view of the involvement of RASSF1A in adult renal cancers we investigated RASSF1A as a candidate Wilms' TSG. We detected RASSF1A hypermethylation in 21 of 39 (54%) primary Wilms' tumours. 3p21.3 allele loss was not detected in nine informative Wilms' tumours (five with RASSF1A methylation). In contrast to RASSF1A, only a minority (10.3%) of Wilms' tumours demonstrated p16 promoter methylation. As chromosome 3p allele loss is frequent in colorectal cancer, we proceeded to investigate RASSF1A promoter methylation in colorectal cancer and detected RASSF1A methylation in 80% (4/5) colorectal cancer cell lines and 45% (13/29) primary colorectal cancers. There was no correlation between RASSF1A and p16 methylation in colorectal cancer. We have demonstrated that RASSF1A inactivation is the most frequent genetic or epigenetic event yet reported in Wilms' tumourigenesis and that allelotyping studies may fail to identify regions containing important TSGs.",M2
12239584,"Codon 45 of the beta-catenin gene, a specific mutational target site of Wilms' tumor.Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common childhood renal malignancy. Although several genetic loci such as the <e>WT1</e> gene have been known to relate to the biology of WT, the cause of the tumor is complex and the implicated molecular pathways are largely unknown. The beta-catenin gene encodes a protein playing an important role in the Wnt signaling pathway, and its mutations that abrogate specific serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and express oncogenic effect have been found in a variety of tumors. Implication of beta-catenin mutations in WT was investigated in 24 tumors collected from 20 WT patients. One patient had a total of five multiple tumors simultaneously in the bilateral kidneys. Exon 3 and its flanking regions encompassing mutational hot spots of the gene were examined by PCR-based methods. Samples indicating to harbor mutations were further analyzed by sequencing. Six tumors (6/24, 25%) from 4 patients (4/20, 20%) were confirmed to have mutations in heterozygous status. All the mutations, including five different types, were uniformly observed at codon 45 (Ser). Three mutations, Ser45Phe (TCT --&gt; TTT), Ser45Tyr (TCT --&gt; TAT), and Delta45 (deletion of TCT), were found in 3 of 19 unilateral WTs. Other three mutations were detected in three of five multiple tumors developed in the bilateral WT patient; a mutation of Delta45 in one of two tumors in the right kidney, and Ser45Cys (TCT --&gt; TGT) and Ser45Pro (TCT --&gt; CCT) in two of three tumors in the left kidney. Frequent beta-catenin mutations preferentially occurring at codon 45 most likely indicate special importance of this codon for the development of WT and existence of an underlying mechanism causing such a tissue-specific mutational pattern.",M2
11880727,"Recent advances in Wilms tumor genetics.The past decade has witnessed substantial growth in our knowledge of the genes and loci that are altered in Wilms tumor. Although Wilms tumor was one of the original paradigms of Knudson's two-hit model of cancer formation, it has become apparent that several genetic events contribute to Wilms tumorigenesis. Recent research has identified targets and regulators of the first Wilms tumor gene, <e>WT1</e>, has uncovered several candidate genes at the second Wilms tumor locus, WT2, and has identified two familial Wilms tumor loci, FWT1 and FWT2. The recent discovery of activating beta-catenin mutations in some Wilms tumors has also implicated the Wnt signaling pathway in this neoplasm. Recurrent abnormalities of other loci, including 16q, 1p, and 7p, have indicated that these sites may harbor Wilms tumor genes. An enhanced understanding of these and other genetic lesions will provide the foundation for novel targeted Wilms tumor therapies.",M2
11754052,"Case of interstitial 12q deletion in association with Wilms tumor.A 14-month-old boy presenting with Wilms tumor (WT) was found to have a small de novo deletion of the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q11-12q13.11). Microsatellite analysis of this region from constitutional DNA showed that the paternal allele was absent between the markers D12S331 and D12S1713 (inclusive). In the WT there was no evidence of loss of the maternal chromosome. Constitutional chromosome abnormalities can often point to the presence of genes that are important in disease, and the deletion of chromosome 12 in this patient may indicate a gene involved in WT. To determine whether a WT predisposition locus exists at 12q we examined the region in two familial Wilms tumor (FWT) pedigrees unlinked to the known FWT genes on chromosomes 17q (FWT1), 19q (FWT2), and 11p (<e>WT1</e>). In both families WT did not segregate with chromosome 12q markers located within the deletion boundaries.",M2
11479730,"Population-based risk estimates of Wilms tumor in sporadic aniridia. A comprehensive mutation screening procedure of PAX6 identifies 80% of mutations in aniridia.Aniridia is a severe eye disease characterized by iris hypoplasia; both sporadic cases and familial cases with an autosomal dominant inheritance exist. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been shown to be the genetic cause of the disease. Some of the sporadic cases are caused by large chromosomal deletions, some of which also include the Wilms tumor gene (WAGR syndrome), resulting in an increased risk of developing Wilms tumor. Based on the unique registration of both cancer and aniridia cases in Denmark, we have made the most accurate risk estimate to date for Wilms tumor in sporadic aniridia. We have found that patients with sporadic aniridia have a relative risk of 67 (confidence interval: 8.1-241) of developing Wilms tumor. Among patients investigated for mutations, Wilms tumor developed in only two patients out of 5 with the Wilms tumor gene (<e>WT1</e>) deleted. None of the patients with smaller chromosomal deletions or intragenic mutations were found to develop Wilms tumor. Our observations suggest a smaller risk for Wilms tumor than previous estimates, and that tumor development requires deletion of WT1. We report a strategy for the mutational analysis of aniridia cases resulting in the detection of mutations in 68% of sporadic cases and 89% of familial cases. We also report four novel mutations in PAX6, and furthermore, we have discovered a new alternatively spliced form of PAX6.",M2

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is one of the rare animal models that readily form nephroblastomas, yet trout express three distinct WT1 genes, one of which is duplicated and inherited tetrasomically. Sequence analyses suggest an ancient gene duplication in the common ancestor of bony fishes resulted in the formation of two WT1 gene families, that conserve the splicing variations of tetrapod WT1, and a second duplication event occurred in the trout lineage. The WT1 genes of one family map to linkage groups 6 and 27 in the trout genome map. Reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression analysis demonstrated little difference in W",M2
11431850,"[Molecular genetics of Wilms' tumor]Molecular genetics of the Wilms' tumor plays an important role in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of the tumor disease generally. Contrary to the genesis of retinoblastoma, where a single gene is inactivated by two hits, the biological signalling pathways determining the origin of the Wilms' tumor are more complex and several genes in several loci may participate. Formation of the Wilms' tumor is accompanied with the most frequent genetic alteration, which is the loss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 11. It indicates inactivation of one or several tumor suppressor genes located at 11p region. The most studied gene of the Wilms' tumor is <e>WT1</e> gene, which has been cloned and sequenced. Biological function of WT1 protein is complex one and it requires probably an interaction with other proteins, DNA and also RNA. The development of the tumor determines not only the genetic changes, but also epigenetic changes, e.g., hypermethylation of promoter and genome imprinting.",M2
11373341,"Activation of vitamin D receptor by the Wilms' tumor gene product mediates apoptosis of renal cells.The Wilms' tumor transcription factor <e>WT1</e> is required for kidney development, but little is known about WT1 downstream signaling in renal cells. This study reported an approximately fivefold upregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA and protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that stably expressed WT1 at a level comparable to the developing kidney in vivo. Co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with expression plasmids encoding four different WT1 splicing variants stimulated mouse vdr promoter activity more than fourfold. A 201-bp fragment was identified in the proximal vdr promoter that was required for transactivation by WT1. This critical sequence contained a predicted WT1 consensus site, which bound to recombinant WT1 protein. Temporal changes of vdr and wt1 mRNA levels in developing rat kidneys were correlated closely. The active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) strongly inhibited the proliferation of wt1-transfected HEK 293 cells. Exposure to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) caused apoptosis of cultured wt1 immunopositive cells from mouse embryonic kidney cortex. These findings suggest that transcriptional activation of the VDR by WT1 can mediate programmed death of renal embryonic cells in response to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). The results provide the first evidence for a role of the vitamin D endocrine system in renal cell growth and differentiation during development.",M2
11360189,"Absence of PPP2R1A mutations in Wilms tumor.Evidence from genetic linkage analysis indicates that a gene located at 19q13.4, FWT2, is responsible for predisposition to Wilms tumor in many Wilms tumor families. This region has also been implicated in the etiology of sporadic Wilms tumor through loss of heterozygosity analyses. The PPP2R1A gene, encoding the alpha isoform of the heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is located within the FWT2 candidate region and is altered in breast and lung carcinomas. PPP2R1B, encoding the beta isoform, is mutated in lung, colon, and breast cancers. These findings suggested that both PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B may be tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, PP2A is important in fetal kidney growth and differentiation and has an expression pattern similar to that of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene <e>WT1</e>. Since PPP2R1A was therefore a compelling candidate for the FWT2 gene, we analysed the coding region of PPP2R1A in DNA and RNA samples from affected members of four Wilms tumor families and 30 sporadic tumors and identified no mutations in PPP2R1A in any of these 34 samples. We conclude that PPP2R1A is not the 19q familial Wilms tumor gene and that mutation of PPP2R1A is not a common event in the etiology of sporadic Wilms tumor.",M2
11322369,"Pulmonary dysplasia, Denys-Drash syndrome and Wilms tumor 1 gene mutation in twins.While a genetic basis for the association of developmental lung and kidney defects has been suspected, the involvement of specific genes in this process is under active investigation. We report such a possible genetic linkage present in identical twins with a mutant Wilms tumor (<e>WT1</e>) gene. Twin girls, born at 35 weeks gestation, manifested symptoms of congenital nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, and severe respiratory abnormalities refractory to assisted ventilation. Both died at 1 month of age. Renal biopsies and autopsy kidney tissue from both the girls revealed diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). Autopsy lung tissue revealed pulmonary dysplasia and hypoplasia in both twins. The WT1 gene from renal tissue in both twins was analyzed for mutations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Both twins possessed an identical missense mutation in exon 8 of the WT1 gene, resulting in replacement of arginine by histidine at amino acid 366 (arg366his) in the WTI protein. This mutation has previously been described in Denys-Drash syndrome. The WT1 gene plays a role in mesenchymal epithelial (ME) interactions in the developing urogenital system, and possibly has a similar role during lung morphogenesis. We propose that this WT1 gene mutation contributes to both DMS and developmental pulmonary abnormalities by altering ME interactions in both organs.",M2

11311489,"Methylation changes in promoter and enhancer regions of the <e>WT1</e> gene in Wilms' tumours.Although the WT1 gene has been implicated in the aetiology of Wilms' tumour, mutations in WT1 are found only in minority of the tumours. DNA methylation of regulatory elements represents another possibility of modulation of gene expression. We studied methylation in the promoter and enhancer regions of the WT1 gene in 34 Wilms' tumour patients by the polymerase chain reaction on HpaII-digested DNA and by the bisulphite method. No methylation was detected in the promoter region in either tumour or normal kidney or blood DNA samples. In contrast, a HpaII site in the enhancer region was at least partially methylated in normal kidney and blood DNA samples and in about one-third of the tumours, while the majority of tumours showed no methylation. The differential methylation in the enhancer region of the WT1 gene may indicate that methylation of this element can play a role in the regulation of this gene.",M2
11268451,"Expression of apoptosis, cell proliferation, and drug resistance genes in pediatric Wilms' tumors.The expression of genes associated with apoptosis, cell proliferation and drug resistance in tumor cells was investigated in two pediatric Wilms' tumor patients (MCH-WT-1 and MCH-WT-3) for their association with cell cycle, daunorubicin accumulation and clinical data. DNA content, cell cycle and drug accumulation were analyzed immediately after surgery by flow cytometry and mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Primary cell cultures were established from tumor specimens and tumor cells in both cases showed epithelial morphology. Although cell proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) were expressed in both cases, MCH-WT-3 showed higher levels of mRNA expression, which corresponded, with metastatic behavior of the tumor in the patient. While p53 and p21 mRNAs were expressed at low levels in MCH-<e>WT1</e>, MCH-WT-3 showed high levels of p21 mRNA only. The increased expression of cyclin kinase inhibitor (p21) in MCH-WT-3 compared to MCH-WT-1 correlated with a higher percentage of G0/G1 cell population in the tumor specimen. Despite the expression of multidrug resistance markers (MDR1 and LRP) in MCH-WT-1, flow cytometric analysis showed tumor cell populations with very low and high daunorubicin accumulation and with the absence of any effect for verapamil and dipyridamole on daunorubicin accumulation of tumor cells.",M2

We analyzed these two exons of the WT1 gene in genomic DNA from two female patients with DDS by using polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The patients were accompanied with normal external genitalia, early onset renal failure between 6 and 12 months of age, and unilateral Wilms' tumor. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes of the patients. Amplification of exons 8 and 9 of the WT1 gene by PCR was performed, and direct sequencing of the PCR product was performed using an automatic DNA sequencer. Two heterozygous missense mutations were found in these patients, including a missense mutation in exon 9 at codon 388 replacing the wild-type Cys with Phe, and a previously described mutation in exon 9 at codon 398 replacing the wild-type Leu with Pro. Cys388Phe is a novel mutation in the WT1 gene in the DDS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The NWTSG database was reviewed for cases of secondary AML and for <e>WT1</e> status of the affected patients. Referring institutions were contacted by a confidential letter requesting pathology reports, results of immunophenotyping, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses, and details concerning treatment of AML. RESULTS: Of the 5,278 patients treated during the study period, 43 had second malignant neoplasms, and 7 of these 43 had AML. At the time of diagnosis of Wilms tumor, the median age of the seven patients (4 boys) was 3.2 years. Five of the seven renal neoplasms had favorable histologic characteristics. The most common French-American-British morphology was M5. One patient had bilateral tumors, and two were treated for recurrent Wilms tumor. All patients received chemotherapy regimens that included doxorubicin (6) or etoposide (1), and six were treated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation. The median latency period from initial diagnosis of the renal neoplasm to development of secondary AML was 3 years (range, 1.2-4 yrs). One patient had the translocation t(9:11)(p22;q23); WT1 status was not noted for any of the seven patients. CONCLUSIONS: The development of secondary AML in this subset of patients after treatment of renal neoplasms may reflect the interaction of the effects of treatment and possible genetic predisposition toward cancer.",M2
10935424,"Wilms tumour: diagnosis and treatment.Wilms tumour is the most common intra-abdominal solid tumour of childhood. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy for virtually all affected children and additional radiotherapy for those with advanced disease or adverse prognostic features. This approach leads to cure rates exceeding 80%. During the last decade there have been a number of advances which have increased our understanding of the biology of Wilms tumour. The development of Wilms tumour, for example, involves several genes, including <e>WT1</e>, the Wilms tumour suppressor gene at 11p13, and WT2, the putative Wilms tumour suppressor gene at 11p15. In addition, certain chromosomal regions, most notably 16q and 1p, might predict outcome and hence serve as a prognostic factor, useful for determining the intensity of therapy. This novel information is now being incorporated into current therapeutic protocols. We reviewed the medical literature and present a summary of the advances made, outlining the current treatment of Wilms tumour. Future protocols will continue incorporating biological markers. The goal is to identify patients at low risk for relapse, which will allow a reduction in treatment intensity and subsequent toxicity.

10921316,"[Wilms' tumors and malformation complexes]Wilms' tumor is an embryonal tumor which is derived from metanephric metanephric blastema. The occurrence of both sporadic and hereditary forms, along with various congenital abnormalities of Wilms' tumor suggest that the tumors develop when a predisposing germ line mutation is accompanied by a second mutation. The existence of both gross chromosomal abnormalities has led to the genetic characterization of a number of loci involved in the development of Wilms' tumor. A tumor suppressor gene for Wilms' tumor, <e>WT1</e>, has been isolated from the 11p13 region. The product of this gene is a transcription factor with four zinc fingers. Because of expression of WT1 is limited to the developing glomeruli of the kidneys and the genital ridge, it is thought to have a functional role in renal and gonadal organogesis. Thus dysfunction of WT1 causes loss of normal regulation of proliferation and leads to tumor formation and occurrence of Wilms' tumor anomaly complexes. The role of the imprinting genes, H19 and IGF2 in oncogenesis of Wilms' tumors are also discussed.",M2

The authors evaluated 15 DSRCTs and 71 other tumors often considered in the differential diagnosis for immunoreactivity using a polyclonal antibody directed against the WT1 part of the chimeric protein resulting from this translocation. WT1 immunostaining was performed on paraffin material using the WT(C-19) antibody after heat-antigen retrieval. All the DSRCTs (15 of 15, 100%) demonstrated strong WT1 nuclear immunoreactivity. Ten of 14 nephroblastomas (71%) disclosed WT1-positive nuclei in accordance with the staining reported by others, and rare and focal nuclear positivity was detected in two of 17 rhabdomyosarcomas. WT1 immunoreactivity was not observed in Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (zero of 21, 0%), neuroblastomas (zero of 17, 0%), or rhabdoid tumors of the kidney (zero of two, 0%). In nephroblastoma, differential diagnosis with DSRCT was not difficult: Clinical and morphologic data are not similar for these two entities. The current study validates WT1 immunoreactivity as a useful marker to separate DSRCT from other small round cell tumors.",M2

In pediatric oncology, however, they have seldom been identified. Wilms' tumor is a renal neoplasia commonly occurring in children and is associated with mutations of the <e>WT1</e> gene. The correlation between Wilms' tumor and alterations of the p53 gene has not been well established, with a low frequency of mutations having been reported in this type of tumor. Mutation may be associated with advanced stage disease and unfavorable histology. OBJECTIVE: To screen for mutations of the p53 gene by the PCR-SSCP method and DNA sequencing in cases of Wilms' tumor sug-gestive of mutation. DESIGN: Case Report. CASE REPORT: Evaluations of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in DNA samples extracted by PCR-SSCP from 10 Wilms' tumors in children at different stages, and DNA sequencing. Changes in SSCP analy-sis were observed in exon 8 in two samples. The probable muta-tions were not confirmed by DNA sequencing. The absence of point mutations in p53 gene observed in the 10 samples of Wilms' tumor studied agrees with literature data, with DNA sequencing being of fundamental importance for the confirmation of possible mutations.",M2
10646884,"Loss of heterozygosity at 7p in Wilms' tumour development.Chromosome 7p alterations have been implicated in the development of Wilms' tumour (WT) by previous studies of tumour cytogenetics, and by our analysis of a constitutional translocation (t(1;7)(q42;p15)) in a child with WT and radial aplasia. We therefore used polymorphic microsatellite markers on 7p for a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) study, and found LOH in seven out of 77 informative WTs (9%). The common region of LOH was 7p15-7p22, which contains the region disrupted by the t(1;7) breakpoint. Four WTs with 7p LOH had other genetic changes; a germline <e>WT1</e> mutation with 11p LOH, LOH at 11p, LOH at 16q, and loss of imprinting of IGF2. Analysis of three tumour-associated lesions from 7p LOH cases revealed a cystic nephroma-like area also having 7p LOH. However, a nephrogenic rest and a contralateral WT from the two other cases showed no 7p LOH. No particular clinical phenotype was associated with the WTs which showed 7p LOH. The frequency and pattern of 7p LOH demonstrated in our studies indicate the presence of a tumour suppressor gene at 7p involved in the development of Wilms' tumour.",M2
10597258,"Regulation of the Wilms' tumour suppressor protein transcriptional activation domain.The Wilms' tumour suppressor protein <e>WT1</e> contains a transcriptional regulatory domain that can either activate or repress transcription depending upon its cellular environment. The mechanistic basis for this dichotomy is unclear however. Here, we dissect the transcriptional regulatory domains of WT1. We find that a region within the domain of WT1 attributed to transcriptional repression is a potent suppressor of the activation domain at several promoters and in different cell types. In vitro transcription analysis suggests that the mechanism of suppression of the activation domain occurs at the level of transcription initiation. Furthermore we find that the WT1 suppression domain is able to inhibit a heterologous activation domain when fused in cis. Dissection of this domain resulted in the delineation of a 30 amino acid region that was sufficient to confer suppression of a transcriptional activation domain both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we find that the WT1 transcriptional activation domain interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIB and that this interaction is not affected by the suppression domain. Taken together, these studies suggest that the suppression domain of WT1 interacts with a cosuppressor protein to mediate inhibition of the WT1 transcriptional activation domain.",M2
10586431,"Transcriptional regulation of PDGF-A and TGF-beta by +KTS <e>WT1</e> deletion mutants and a mutant mimicking Denys-Drash syndrome.Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) and Frasier syndrome (FS) are rare diseases caused by the mutations of Wilms tumor gene, WT1. The common denominator in these syndromes is a nephropathy which is manifested by early-onset proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and end stage renal failure. Although these syndromes are genetic models of nephropathy and the mutations of WT1 gene are characterized in these patients the mechanism how mutations of WT1 gene affect the embryonic kidney adversely has not been elucidated. Recently, there was a report that FS is caused by mutations in the donor splice site of WT1. These mutations predicted loss of +KTS isoform, which is one of the four splicing variants of WT1. In this study, two +KTS deletion mutants of WT1 were made as well as a WT1 mutant mimicking a mutation found in a patient who had diffuse mesangial sclerosis, end stage renal failure and Wilms tumor. Mutant embryonic kidney cell lines were established by transfection of 293 embryonic kidney cells with WT1 mutants. We investigated the transcription regulation of mutant WT1 among these cell lines using the reporter vectors containing PDGF-A and TGF-beta promoter sequence. Our results showed that the promoter activity of PDGF-A and TGF-beta, which are related to the progression of glomerular diseases, was modestly increased in the mutant cell mimicking the patent, while those activities were markedly increased in other two deletion mutant cell lines.

From these results, we suggest that the alteration of +KTS WT1 expression be responsible for the rapid progression of renal diseases in DDS and FS.",M2

In DDS there is a predisposition to Wilms' tumor. Heterozygous point mutations in the Wilms' tumor, type1 gene (WT1), particularly those altering the zinc finger (ZF) encoding exons, have been reported in most DDS patients, while mutations in intron 9 of the same gene cause FS. This paper describes two cases of DDS, one FS and one patient with Wilm's tumor and intersex genitalia, in which mutations were searched by sequencing the exons 8 and 9 of WT1 gene. Patient 1 carried a missense point mutation in exon 8 (ZF2), converting a CGA-Arg codon to a TGA-stop codon. Patient 2 presented a single nucleotide deletion within exon 9 (ZF3) introducing a premature chain termination at codon 398. Patients 3 and 4 had a C--&gt;T transition at position +4 of the second alternative splice donor site of exon 9 (this mutation was detected in peripheral blood and in tumor derived DNA of patient 3). However, patient 3 had previously developed a Wilms' tumor. This is the first case of Wilms' tumor development in a phenotypically and genetically confirmed case of FS.",M2

Patients often present with abdominal pain, an abdominal mass, ascites or signs of intestinal obstruction. Cytogenetic and molecular studies have identified a characteristic t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation within the tumor cells. The fused gene product apparently aligns the NH2-terminal domain (NTD) of the EWS gene to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of the <e>WT1</e> gene. This product could lead to loss of the tumor suppressor effect of the WT1 gene as well as to an increase in EWS driven expression of growth factors normally repressed by WT1. We investigated this latter possibility by performing immunohistochemical studies on formalin fixed tissue from 10 cases of DSRCT and five Wilms' tumors using antibodies to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II, the latency associated peptide of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB chain and PDGF-alpha receptor, respectively. In general, tumor cells were strongly positive for these growth factors in DSRCT, while stromal cells were negative for IGF-II and positive for the other growth factors in parallel with the tumor cells. Wilms' tumor cells were essentially negative for PDGF-AB chains, but positive for IGF-II, and the latency associated peptide of TGF-beta1 and variably positive for PDGF-alpha receptor. These findings support the proposed molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis for DSRCT and may help explain this tumor's poor prognosis.",M2
10073400,"Genetics of Wilms' tumor.The molecular genetic characterization of Wilms' tumor has played a prominent role in advancing our knowledge of the genetic aspects underlying the development of cancer in general. Unlike the genetic mechanism leading to the development of retinoblastoma, an embryonal tumor of childhood affecting the retina, which only requires the inactivation of one single gene, the biological pathways leading to the development of Wilms' tumor are complex and likely involve several genetic loci. These include two genes on chromosome 11p; one on chromosome 11p13 (the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene <e>WT1</e>) and the other on chromosome 11p15 (the putative Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT2). In addition to these two genes, loci at 1p, 7p, 16q, 17p (the p53 tumor suppressor gene), and 19q (the putative familial Wilms' tumor gene FWT2) are also believed to harbor genes involved in the biology of Wilms' tumor. Herein these loci are reviewed and their clinical significance is summarized.",M2

NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing WT1 were less proliferative, larger in size and more firmly attached to tissue culture plastic, suggesting an alteration of their state of differentiation. These cells were studied in vivo by subcutaneous injection into nude mice. The resulting tumors exhibited epithelioid histopathology and formed desmosome-like structures. Molecular analyses of these WT1 expressing fibroblasts grown in culture and in nude mice revealed significant alterations in the expression of many kidney epithelial markers. These studies indicate that WT1 expression can initiate features of a program of epithelial differentiation consistent with a prominent role for WT1 in the mesenchymal epithelial transition that occurs during renal development. Through this work we identified a number of novel target genes for the WT1 transcription factor, including uvomorulin, integrin alpha8 and perlecan, and suggest that WTI may activate the IGF-II gene, also implicated in the development of Wilms' tumor.",M2
9860296,"Confirmation of FWT1 as a Wilms' tumour susceptibility gene and phenotypic characteristics of Wilms' tumour attributable to FWT1.A susceptibility gene for Wilms' tumour (WT), designated FWT1, was previously mapped to chromosome 17q12-q21 by linkage analysis of a single family. We now confirm the existence of this gene by analysis of additional cases in the original family (3-point LOD score=5.69), and by detecting strong evidence of linkage to this region in an unrelated pedigree with seven cases of WT (3-point LOD score=2.56). Analysis of 11 smaller WT families confirms that there is genetic heterogeneity in familial WT, as three families exhibit strong evidence against linkage to FWT1. One of these was subsequently found to have a predisposing <e>WT1</e> mutation. However, the other two families show evidence against both FWT1 and WT1, suggesting that at least one further familial WT gene exists. Analysis of the phenotype of 16 WT cases from the families linked to FWT1 demonstrates that they present at a significantly older age and a significantly later stage than both sporadic WT and the six cases from two families unlinked to either FWT1 or WT1. The results confirm the role of FWT1 in susceptibility to WT, provide strong evidence for genetic heterogeneity in familial WT and suggest there are phenotypic differences between familial WT due to FWT1, familial WT due to other genes and non-familial WT.",M2

Though NR are best known as precursors of Wilms tumor (WT), many alternative fates are observed, and most rests are destined for eventual atresia. Biological and clinical distinctions between the two major NR categories, perilobar and intralobar rests (PLNR and ILNR) are emphasized. PLNR occur in fetal overgrowth and with certain overgrowth syndromes. ILNR are frequently associated with deletions or mutations of <e>WT1</e>. Data are presented concerning the prevalence of NR in general pediatric autopsy populations, and in selected syndromes. The age at diagnosis of WT was determined for the largest series of patients with WT-associated syndromes reported to date.

9781905,"Wilms tumor genetics.Wilms tumor (WT), a sporadic and familial childhood kidney tumor, is genetically heterogeneous. One WT gene, <e>WT1</e> at 11p13, has been cloned, but only a minority of WTs carry detectable mutations at that locus. WT1 can also be excluded as the predisposition gene in most WT families, implying the existence of other WT genes. Studies of WT families have demonstrated that familial predisposition is also heterogeneous and involves at least two other loci besides WT1. In addition to WT1 and the familial predisposition genes, a role for other genes in the development of WTs is implied by the somatic occurrence of genetic and epigenetic alterations such as loss of heterozygosity and loss of imprinting in tumors and, rarely, the observation of nonchromosome-11 constitutional aberrations in WT patients. Determining the pattern of presence or absence of these various genetic alterations in tumors and elucidating the function of the genes involved will provide a better understanding of the cellular processes that are critical for normal cell growth and differentiation, but are abrogated in the course of tumorigenesis.",M2
9751632,"A point mutation within exon 5 of the <e>WT1</e> gene of a sporadic unilateral Wilms' tumor alters gene function.The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, wt1, encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor, WT1, that represses transcription of a number of growth-promoting genes and inhibits cell growth. The transcripts of wt1 undergo two alternative splicing events, giving rise to four isoforms of mRNA in constant ratios. The first alternative splice introduces an extra exon 5, which encodes 17 amino acid residues inserted between the transcription regulatory domain and the DNA binding domain of WT1. Previously, we demonstrated that the 17-amino acid domain functioned as a transcription repressor when it was fused with the DNA binding domain of WT1. We have now identified a point mutation within exon 5 of wt1 in a sporadic unilateral Wilms' tumor patient. The mutation changes the last of the 17 amino acids from asparagine to serine. The protein isoform of WT1 carrying this mutation exhibited a 2-3-fold lower transcription-repressing activity than wild-type WT1 in transient cotransfection assays. The mutation also decreased growth-inhibiting activity of WT1 in two osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS and Saos-2. By diminishing transcription-repressing and growth-inhibiting activities of WT1, this naturally occurring mutation within exon 5 of wt1 may disturb the normal function of the protein and lead to the uncontrolled cell growth characteristic of Wilms' tumor.",M2

LOH analysis at 11p15.5 and at the 16q13-16q24.3 regions indicated retention of heterozygosity in the tumour DNA for the markers analysed.

9674708,"Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 11p15 in Wilms tumors: identification of two independent regions.Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 11 is the most frequent genetic alteration in Wilms tumors, indicating that one or more tumor suppressor genes that map to this chromosomal region are involved in the development of the disease. The <e>WT1</e> gene located on 11p13 has been characterized but mutations in this gene occur in only about 10% of Wilms tumors. A second locus (WT2) at chromosome 11p15 has also been described in Wilms tumors but thus far efforts to clone the WT2 gene(s) have been frustrated by the large size (approximately 10 Mb) of this region. Using a high-density marker LOH analysis of 11p15.5-15.4, we have refined the location of a Wilms tumor suppressor gene between the markers D11S1318-D11S1288 (approximately 800 kb) within 11p15.5. We have also identified a second, novel region of LOH that spans the markers D11S1338-D11S1323 (approximately 336 kb) at 11p15.5-p115.4. Thus a second distinct locus, in addition to the previously defined WT2, on chromosome 11p15.5, appears to play a role in the development of Wilms tumors.",M2
9666053,"Genetics of kidney tumours.In recent years major research findings have revealed a strong correlation between the genes involved in the pathogenesis of renal tumours and the histopathological and clinical behavioural features. This new genetic information has provided the basis for the recent Heidelberg and Mayo Clinical Classifications for renal tumours. WilmsO tumour has been shown to arise from abnormalities in one of at least three genes. The first WilmsO tumour gene identified <e>WT1</e>, located on chromosome 11p13, encodes a zinc finger binding protein which is important in regulating the formation of the early nephron. Although the second WilmsO tumour gene, WT2, has not been formally identified it is known to be involved in the Beckwith Weideman Syndrome and in the WilmsO tumours which arise from that disease. Other WilmsO tumour genes have been implied from cytogenetic and familial data but their precise location and identification remains. In adult renal tumours there have also been considerable advances. The majority of conventional or clear cell renal carcinomas are associated with losses of chromosome 3p and mutation in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene which is located on that portion of the genome. These mutations affect familial renal cancers arising as part of the VHL syndrome and the majority of sporadic renal carcinomas. There has been an energetic search for genetic abnormalities which may be involved in the progression of these tumours and data revealing the importance of chromosome 14q and other chromosomal sites have been generated. Papillary renal cancer is associated with different genetic abnormalities, in particular mutations of the c-met proto-oncogene and abnormalities of chromosome 7 with a small subgroup of familial papillary renal carcinomas showing evidence of abnormalities of the X chromosome. The less common renal carcinomas have shown cytogenetic abnormalities although the precise genes involved in their formation remain to be identified. These genetic advances have allowed a more accurate classification of renal carcinoma and WilmsO tumour and it is envisaged that they will lead to a better understanding of the biological behaviour with opportunities for therapeutic intervention in this large group of important human neoplasms.",M2
9626060,"novH: differential expression in developing kidney and Wilm's tumors.We previously established that the expression of the human nov gene (novH) was altered in Wilms' tumors and that levels of novH and <e>WT1</e> mRNA were inversely correlated in individual Wilms' tumors. Insofar as novH has been shown to be a target for WT1 regulation, novH might play an important role during normal nephrogenesis and in the development of Wilms' tumors. We now show that during normal nephrogenesis novH protein is tightly associated with differentiation of glomerular podocytes. NovH expression is not restricted to renal differentiation but is also detected in endothelium and neural tissue of the kidney. Our results establish that alteration of novH expression in sporadic and heritable Wilms' tumors is associated with dysregulated expression of both novH mRNA and protein. In general, the highest novH expression was noted in the Wilms' tumor, genitourinary anomalies, aniridia, and mental retardation (WAGR)-associated Wilms' tumors. Expression in the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS)-associated Wilms' tumors fell within the variable spectrum observed in sporadic Wilms' tumor cases. As in developing kidney podocytes, novH protein was also prominent in the abnormal hypoplastic podocytes from DDS cases and in kidney podocytes adjoining Wilms' tumors. In Wilms' tumors exhibiting heterotypic differentiation, novH protein was expressed at high levels in tumor-derived striated muscle and at lower levels in tumor-derived cartilage. These observations taken together indicate that novH may represent both a marker of podocytic differentiation in kidney and a marker of heterotypic mesenchymal differentiation in Wilms' tumors. In addition, absence or very low levels of WT1 are correlated with higher novH expression, and its variable expression in cases with mutant WT1 (sporadic and DDS) suggests that the potential activation and repression transcriptional functions possessed by WT1 are likely dependent on the specific mutation incurred.",M2
9537236,"Linkage of familial Wilms' tumor predisposition to chromosome 19 and a two-locus model for the etiology of familial tumors.Familial predisposition to Wilms' tumor (WT), a childhood kidney tumor, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. For most WT families studied, the 11p13 gene <e>WT1</e> and genomic regions implicated in tumorigenesis in a subset of tumors can be ruled out as the site of the familial predisposition gene. Following a genome-wide genetic linkage scan, we have obtained strong evidence (log of the odds ratio = 4.0) in five families for an inherited WT predisposition gene (FWT2) at 19q13.3-q13.4. In addition, we observed loss of heterozygosity at 19q in tumors from individuals from two families in which 19q can be ruled out as the site of the inherited predisposing mutation. From these data, we hypothesize that alterations at two distinct loci are critical rate-limiting steps in the etiology of familial WTs.",M2
9291179,"Regulation of renal EGF receptor expression is normal in Denys-Drash syndrome.In patients with Denys-Drash syndrome, mutations of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene are associated with nephroblastomas and developmental abnormalities of the genital tract and renal glomerulus. Normally, the Wilms' tumor gene product (<e>WT1</e>) is expressed at high levels in visceral glomerular epithelial cells (VGEC) of the emerging fetal glomerulus. We demonstrate that WT1 could normally serve to suppress EGF receptor expression in VGEC, since immunoreactive EGF receptor is strikingly absent compared to epithelial cells of the emerging proximal and distal tubule, which lack WT1. When HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing EGFR enhancer/promoter elements linked to a CAT reporter and plasmids containing WT1 cDNA, EGFR enhancer/promoter activity was suppressed by all wild-type WT1 isoforms, but not by deletion mutants of WT1 lacking normal zinc-finger or N-terminal domains. Surprisingly, plasmids expressing a Denys-Drash WT1 mutant (R394W) retained the ability to suppress EGFR promoter activity in this system. Furthermore, we found that immunoreactive EGFR was appropriately undetectable in glomeruli from a three-year-old girl with Denys-Drash syndrome and in sections of her Wilm's tumor. These data suggest that faulty suppression of EGFR cannot account for the abnormalities of glomerulogenesis seen in Denys-Drash patients.",M2
9262253,"Identical genetic changes in different histologic components of Wilms' tumors.BACKGROUND: In young children and infants, Wilms' tumor is the most common cancer of the kidney. Wilms' tumor exhibits heterogeneous histopathologic features, consisting of rapidly proliferating blastemal and epithelial cells and a stromal component that has heterologous elements (e.g., cartilage, bone, and striated muscle). It is unclear whether the stromal and heterologous components of sporadic Wilms' tumor are neoplastic or should be considered non-neoplastic. PURPOSE: Our purpose was twofold: 1) to selectively analyze the different histologic tissue components of sporadic Wilms' tumors, including blastemal, epithelial, stromal, and heterologous elements, for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the <e>WT1</e> gene and for expression of the WT1 gene and 2) to determine the role of WT1 gene expression in the development of these tissues. METHODS: By use of tissue microdissection techniques, various histologic elements (blastema, stroma, epithelium, and striated muscle) of sporadic Wilms' tumor were obtained from specimens taken from 18 patients. DNA was extracted from the dissected tissue fragments, and DNA solutions were amplified by use of the polymerase chain reaction and the polymorphic genomic markers D11S1392 and D11S904 to detect LOH at the WT1 gene locus (11p13). Three selected specimens with heterologous elements and LOH at 11p13 were analyzed for expression of the WT1 gene by means of the in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Nine (50%) of the 18 specimens showed LOH at the WT1 locus. Although identical WT1 gene deletion was consistently observed in all of the various histologic components of these nine specimens, WT1 gene expression was high in the blastemal and epithelial elements and low in the stromal and heterologous elements. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Identical allelic deletion at 11p13 in all components of the sporadic Wilms' tumors examined suggests that the stromal tissue components are neoplastic rather than non-neoplastic. In conjunction with variable WT1 gene expression in the different histologic components, the results raise the possibility that undifferentiated blastemal cells are the precursors of the stromal and heterologous elements. Morphologically benign stromal and heterologous elements may therefore be derived from neoplastic cells. The developmental state of the various tissue components of Wilms' tumor may be attributed to an altered residual WT1 gene that is required for the maturation of blastemal and epithelial cells but that is not required for the maturation of stromal and heterologous elements.",M2
9288908,"Determination of functional domains of the human transcription factor PAX8 responsible for its nuclear localization and transactivating potential.The conserved structure of the transcription factors of the Pax gene family may reflect functional conservation. We have demonstrated that the human Pax8 transcription factor is organized in several functional domains and contains two regions responsible for its nuclear localization, in addition to an activating region at the carboxy terminus of the protein and an inhibitory region encoded by the exon 9 present only in a splice variant PAX8a. Regions of PAX8 determining the nuclear localization of the PAX8A/lacZ fusions contain short amino acid sequences similar to several described nuclear localization sites (NLS). These NLS were identified in the paired domain and between the octapeptide and the residual homeodomain, respectively. The activating domain is encoded by the exons 10 and 11 and its function is modulated by the adjacent domains encoded by the exons 9 and 12. The domain encoded by exon 9 significantly inhibits the function of the activating domain. Pax8 is expressed in thyroid cells and its product binds promoters of the thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase genes through its paired domain. Thyroid cell growth and differentiation depend on thyrotropin which, by stimulating cAMP synthesis, activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). We have investigated a link between thyrotropin stimulation and gene activation by Pax8. Stimulation of cAMP synthesis augments Pax8-specific transcription in thyroid cells, indicating that PKA is involved in Pax8 activation. Cotransfection of GAL4/PAX8 fusions and the catalytic subunit of PKA in A126, a PKA-deficient derivative of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line, synergistically activates the GAL4-specific reporter, suggesting the activating domain of PAX8 is dependent upon the catalytic subunit of the PKA. We propose that this dependence is due to a hypothetical adaptor which forms a target for PKA and interacts with the activating domain of PAX8. We show that PAX8 isolated from the thyroid cell line FTRL5 is a phosphoprotein in which phosphorylation is not dependant on cAMP pathway activation. Our results suggest that Pax8 is part of the cAMP signaling pathway and mediates thyrotropin-dependent gene activation in thyroid cells. Investigation of the PAX8 expression in a panel of Wilms' tumors shows a striking correlation between the expression of PAX8 and another transcription factor, <e>WT1</e>, indicating that these two genes may interact in vivo.",M2
9242218,"Allelic imbalance at chromosome 1q21 in Wilms tumor.The Wilms tumor suppressor gene 1, <e>WT1</e>, located on chromosome 11p13 is mutated in only a subset of Wilms tumors. Cytogenetic studies of Wilms tumors show that the most frequent structural anomalies after those affecting chromosome 11p are rearrangements of 1q, suggesting that there is a gene involved in Wilms tumor etiology in this region. The WT1 target sequence +P5 (D1S3309E), isolated using whole-genome polymerase chain reaction (PCR), binds all WT1 isoforms in vitro and has been mapped to 1q21-22. As +P5 may mark a 1q Wilms tumor gene, constitutional and tumor DNA from 33 Wilms tumor patients (36 tumors) was screened for allele imbalance using microsatellite markers from 1p21 to 1q44. Although no gross rearrangements of the +P5 region were found, this study demonstrates allele imbalance for 1q in 12% of patients (5/36 tumors), defining a smallest region of overlap at 1q21. This finding supports a role for 1q21 in Wilms tumorigenesis.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical literature was reviewed with an emphasis on the molecular biology of Wilms tumor. RESULTS: The development of Wilms tumor involves several genes, including <e>WT1</e>, the Wilms tumor suppressor gene at 11p13. In addition, certain chromosomal regions (16q and 1p) might be used as prognostic factors for determining the intensity of therapy.

Three separate genes (<e>WT1</e>, WT2, and WT3) have been implicated in Wilms' tumour development. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome develop renal cell carcinoma and it has been shown that VHL protein inhibits elongin, a cellular transcription factor which controls RNA elongation. Use of molecular markers to identify superficial bladder tumours likely to progress to muscle invasive disease has met with some success. Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53 expression, and decreased E-cadherin expression all correlate with tumour progression. Tumours in patients with carcinoma in situ have distinct molecular features. Androgen ablation delays disease progression in men with prostate cancer, but relapse is inevitable. Research has been directed towards elucidating the mechanisms by which prostate cancer 'escapes' hormonal control. Mutations in the androgen receptor have been identified. It is apparent that locally produced growth factors mediate androgen-dependent processes and these too have been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis.",M2
