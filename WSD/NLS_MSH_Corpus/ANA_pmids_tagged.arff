19331301,"Practical use of the nursing code of ethics: part I.The Code (<e>ANA</e>, 2001) provides the nurse guidance for legal and ethical responsibilities to patients and, in the broader sense, to society. The first provision calls for honoring the human dignity in all patients and colleagues. It lays the groundwork for the importance of the essential ethical principle of autonomy, the right to self-determination. The second provision describes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and significance of appropriate nurse-patient boundaries. The importance of privacy and confidentiality in the nurse-patient relationship is the focus of the third provision. Without the nurse's honoring of privacy, the patient would be hesitant to share important information necessary to design an effective plan of care. The fourth provision primarily focuses on the importance of accountability for personal actions and for the actions of those to whom the nurse has delegated. By meeting these obligations, the nurse will remain the most trusted health care professional.",M1
19258853,"The role of the American Nurses Association Code in ethical decision making.Ethical decision making is complex and difficult. For this reason, many professions compose ethical codes to aid their practitioners, to aid those in the profession in dealing with perplexing situations that inevitably arise. The American Nurses Association (<e>ANA</e>) Code of Ethics is of course one such code. It outlines the important general values, duties, and responsibilities that flow from the specific role of being a nurse. The relationship of the individual practitioner to the code, however, is an aspect of professional moral life that requires interpretation and may not always be well understood. A historical and theoretical analysis of the ANA Code can provide for an understanding as to how it is to be used not as a substitute for moral thinking but as an aid to moral thinking.",M1

The American Public Health Association and the American Nurses Association (<e>ANA</e>) have issued policy statements that invoke the Precautionary Principle, and the Principle has been incorporated into statements that describe the practice of public health nursing.

Patient handling, such as lifting, repositioning, and transferring, has conventionally been performed by nurses. The performance of these tasks exposes nurses to increased risk for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. With the development of assistive equipment, such as lift and transfer devices, the risk of musculoskeletal injury can be significantly reduced. Effective use of assistive equipment and devices for patient handling creates a safe healthcare environment by separating the physical burden from the nurse and ensuring the safety, comfort, and dignity of the patient.",M1

This focus on providing quality care is commendable. However, nurses must also focus on taking care of themselves so they are able both to continue providing quality care for their patients and to maintain the profession's ability to recruit and retain new nurses. In nursing textbooks from the late 1980s and early 1990s, risks to health care workers were listed only as sub headings in sections such as infectious agents and musculoskeletal injuries, or in general chapters on  women's work.  It is a remarkable sign of progress that there is now a discrete focus on the health and safety of health care workers. This article provides a general introduction to the topic of nurse safety. First the major areas of health and safety concerns and the Hierarchy of Controls framework for risk reduction will be outlined. Next, findings from American Nurses Association (<e>ANA</e>) surveys which helped to crystallize the issue of safety and challenged the profession to focus on nurse safety will be presented. Following this, the linkages between patient safety and nurse safety will be discussed.

DATA SOURCES: Reviews of three generally accepted ethical themes (deontological, teleological, and areteological), the ethical triangle by Potter, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) standards of practice for NPs, and codes of ethics from the American Nurses Association (<e>ANA</e>) and the American Medical Association (AMA). CONCLUSIONS: A proposal for a code of ethics for NPs is presented. This code was determined by basic ethical themes and established codes for nursing, formulated by the ANA, and for physicians, formulated by the AMA. The proposal was also developed in consideration of the AANP standards of practice for NPs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The role of the NP is unique in its ethical demands. The authors believe that the expanded practice of NPs presents ethical concerns that are not addressed by the ANA code and yet are relevant to nursing and therefore different than the ethical concerns of physicians. This proposal attempts to broaden NPs' perspective of the role that ethics should hold in their professional lives.",M1

The biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy. Since last winter Raynaud's phenomenon and changes of hands and lips were recognised. INVESTIGATIONS: Initial immunological tests revealed anti-nuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) but neither anti-centromere nor anti-Scl70 antibodies. The positive analysis of anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies confirmed the clinical suspicion of scleroderma renal crisis in the setting of first diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. TREATMENT AND COURSE: After diagnosis therapy with lisinopril, candesartan and amlodipin was established. Four months after discharge dialysis dependency persisted. CONCLUSION: Scleroderma renal crisis is an important differential diagnosis in the setting of acute kidney failure. Medical history, clinical examination and immunological test confirm the diagnosis. The mainstay of therapy is aggressive blood pressure control with ACE-inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blocking agents).",M2
20438730,"Comparison between multiplex assays for autoantibody detection in systemic lupus erythematosus.The performance of immunoassays for the detection of autoantibodies is of critical importance to the diagnosis and assessment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our objective was to compare 3 multiplexed assays for measurement of multiple autoantibodies and their association with global disease activity, active nephritis and cumulative organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Stored sera, clinical and laboratory data from the enrollment visit of a long-term lupus registry were used. Autoantibodies were measured using the BioPlex 2200 <e>ANA</e> screen (Bio-Rad), QuantaPlex ENA8 (INOVA Diagnostics) and recomLine ANA/ENA (Mikrogen). The analytes included dsDNA, chromatin, ribosomal P protein, SS-A/Ro60, Ro52, SS-B/La, Sm, U1-RNP, centromere B, topoisomerase 1 and Jo-1 (histidyl tRNA synthetase). Global SLE disease activity was measured by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and cumulative organ damage by the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI). One hundred ninety two patients (87% female; 91% Caucasian; mean disease duration 8.8years) were studied. Agreement between the 3 assays varied from 70% to 99% (Cohen's kappa: 0.04-0.88). There were significant associations between SLEDAI scores (excluding anti-dsDNA) and ANA (INOVA, Mikrogen), anti-dsDNA (Bio-Rad, Mikrogen), anti-chromatin (Bio-Rad, INOVA), anti-Ro (Mikrogen), anti-Sm and anti-U1-RNP (all 3 immunoassays) (p=0.002-0.05). Concurrent lupus nephritis was associated with anti-dsDNA (Bio-Rad (p=0.017) or Bio-Rad and Mikrogen together (p=0.015)). There was no significant association between autoantibodies and SDI scores. The overall agreement between assays for the detection of autoantibodies was reasonable. The greatest discordance (70-83%) occurred with those autoantibodies most strongly associated with global SLE disease activity (ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-chromatin and anti-Sm). Furthermore, there were differences between assays in their associations with global SLE disease activity and lupus nephritis.",M2
20374383,"Predictive and prognostic value of antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor in primary Sjogren's syndrome.AIMS: To assess the predictive and prognostic value of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). METHODS: This retrospective study includes 201 patients that fulfilled the 1993 European preliminary classification criteria for pSS. The patients were further categorized by the 2002 revised criteria, with or without the inclusion of ANA and RF as classification criteria, and were further subgrouped by the presence of ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, and anti-SS-B, and different ANA titers. The clinical manifestations, serological markers, and results of lip biopsies among these subgroups were compared. RESULTS: Our results showed pSS patients who are seropositive for one of the following markers: ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, or anti-SS-B are younger, predominantly female, and had more serological abnormalities than those with seronegativity of ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, or anti-SS-B. Higher ANA titers (&gt; or = 1:640) correlated with higher frequency of serum anti-SS-A+ and anti-SS-B+, and elevations of serum immunoglobulin G and A in all three different classification criteria groups. The clinical manifestations and laboratory results in the 2002 revised criteria groups with or without the inclusion of ANA and RF as classification criteria items were highly concordant. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the classification criteria for pSS, patients who are seropositive for one of the ANA, RF, anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B biomarkers are more likely to have autoimmune-related Sjögren's syndrome. ANA and RF have shown to possess the predictive and prognostic values for those who do not fulfill the higher stringent 2002 revised criteria but are indicated for immunomodulatory therapy. Thus we suggest that ANA and RF should be reconsidered as items of classification criteria for pSS.",M2
20357501,"Significance of antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor in patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not elevated titers of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and/or rheumatoid factor (RF) are associated with patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done between September 2005 and December 2006. Fifty-eight patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of PAD and 41 controls were studied. Controls had no documented history of peripheral, coronary or cerebral vascular disease. All subjects were screened for metabolic syndrome and C-reactive protein (CRP) as risk factors for peripheral vascular disease. Additionally, all were tested for anti-mitochondrial, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic and anti-smooth muscle antibodies; those with positive results were excluded. ANA and RF were measured in sera from cases and controls. RESULTS: One case and 3 controls had positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies and were therefore excluded from statistical analysis. Metabolic syndrome was significantly more prevalent in patients than controls (p&lt;0.05). Mean CRP level was 4.78+/-7.70 and 2.65+/-3.86 mg/dl in cases and controls, respectively (p=0.021). ANA were detected at a titer of &gt;or=1:40 in 6 (10.5%) of the advanced PAD patients but none of the controls; the difference was not statistically significant. RF was less prevalent in cases than controls (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: RF and ANA do not appear to be associated with PAD in a Kuwaiti population.",M2
20346237,"Adult onset Still's disease: clinical presentation in a large cohort of Italian patients.OBJECTIVES: To characterise the clinical phenotype of Italian patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). METHODS: Sixty-six subjects who received a definite diagnosis of AOSD were seen and followed-up at our institution from 1991 to 2009. The diagnosis was made by a senior rheumatologist and confirmed by Yamaguchi's criteria for AOSD. Data regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiographic features, and disease course were collected and compared with those reported in other published series of different ethnicity. RESULTS: The most frequent features were: articular pain (100%), acute phase reactants elevation (100%), elevated serum ferritin (97%), high fever (95%), negative RF and <e>ANA</e> (92%), neutrophilia (82%), skin rash (79%), and overt arthritis (79%). Forty-percent of patients showed a chronic articular disease. Five subjects (8%) experienced severe, life-threatening complications, and 1 patient died. As compared to other North American, North European, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern cohorts, Italian patients showed significant differences in several epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that AOSD is rare in the Italian population, and that its clinical presentation appears to be significantly influenced by the ethnicity of the affected patients. Given its broad differential diagnosis, early recognition of this condition is challenging, but it could become crucial in the setting of severe complications. Beyond the protean manifestations of this disease, a clinical picture of seronegative febrile arthritis and skin rash, concurrent with a marked elevation in serum ferritin should always be mindful of AOSD.",M2
20229811,"[MBL quality control survey of autoantibodies--25 years of activity and its achievement--mainly antinuclear antibodies]Annual MBL Quality Control Survey of Autoantibodies has continued to this day since it started in 1983 as the only quality control survey of autoantibodies in Japan. The survey has aimed at unification and standardization of measurement value, as well as finding out between-laboratory differences in results through reporting the results of tabulation to the participating laboratories. For carrying out the survey, we intend to make our efforts to promote assurance and standardization of the quality control of the autoantibodies. The number of participant on this survey has been increasing every year and more than 500 laboratories participate not only in Japan but also from Asia and European countries. The laboratories that participated in this survey are the ones that usually perform <e>ANA</e> test, anti-DNA antibodies test, anti-ENA antibodies test, AMA test, ASMA test, anti-cardiolipin antibodies test and anti-CCP antibodies test. The purpose of the survey is to standardize antinuclear antibodies testing value in semi quantitative assay using ANA control serum or our titer control HEPASERA-1. We got 12% increase from 79% to 91% in 1986 using ANA control serum. Additionally, we reached 97% (86% to 97%) of convergence in 2001 by using HEPASERA-1, which contains 4 major pattern titer controls from 1993. In 2007, coefficient of variation (CV) for anti-dsDNA antibodies was 13%, showing better result than 25% of the first survey in 1993. We started secondary survey for laboratories which reported a result far apart. In the secondary survey, we made investigation for cause and improvement action. We conclude quality control survey is useful for autoantibodies testing for its result convergence.",M2
20178126,"Risk factors for development of uveitis differ between girls and boys with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Uveitis is the most common extraarticular manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and is associated with considerable morbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors associated with uveitis in JIA. METHODS: We conducted a chart review of 1,047 patients with JIA from a single tertiary care pediatric rheumatology center for factors associated with the development of uveitis. Special emphasis was put on the following known risk factors: oligoarthritis, antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) status, sex, and age at the time of onset of JIA. RESULTS: The risk of uveitis developing was age dependent in girls but not in boys. Among girls, the risk was maximal (47%) in those who were ANA positive and were ages 1-2 years at the time of the onset of JIA; this risk decreased to &lt;10% in those in whom the age at onset was &gt;7 years. Only girls had an age-dependent and ANA-associated increased risk of uveitis. The time interval from the diagnosis of JIA to the diagnosis of uveitis was statistically significantly longer in patients in whom the onset of JIA occurred at a younger age (P = 0.04). This effect was even more pronounced in ANA-positive patients (P = 0.004). The JIA subtype did not influence a patient's risk of the development of uveitis. CONCLUSION: An age-associated risk of uveitis was observed only in girls who were younger than 7 years of age at the time of the onset of JIA. The duration of time between the diagnosis of JIA and the onset of uveitis was longer in patients in whom JIA was diagnosed at a younger age, especially in those who were ANA positive. We suggest that our findings have implications for uveitis screening in patients with JIA.",M2
20176347,"Mercury exposure, serum antinuclear/antinucleolar antibodies, and serum cytokine levels in mining populations in Amazonian Brazil: a cross-sectional study.Mercury is an immunotoxic substance that has been shown to induce autoimmune disease in rodent models, characterized by lymphoproliferation, overproduction of immunoglobulin (IgG and IgE), and high circulating levels of auto-antibodies directed at antigens located in the nucleus (antinuclear auto-antibodies, or <e>ANA</e>) or the nucleolus (antinucleolar auto-antibodies, or ANoA). We have reported elevated levels of ANA and ANoA in human populations exposed to mercury in artisanal gold mining, though other confounding variables that may also modulate ANA/ANoA levels were not well controlled. The goal of this study is to specifically test whether occupational and environmental conditions (other than mercury exposure) that are associated with artisanal gold mining affect the prevalence of markers of autoimmune dysfunction. We measured ANA, ANoA, and cytokine concentrations in serum and compared results from mercury-exposed artisanal gold miners to those from diamond and emerald miners working under similar conditions and with similar socio-economic status and risks of infectious disease. Mercury-exposed gold miners had higher prevalence of detectable ANA and ANoA and higher titers of ANA and ANoA as compared to diamond and emerald miners with no occupational mercury exposure. Also, mercury-exposed gold miners with detectable ANA or ANoA in serum had significantly higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in serum as compared to the diamond and emerald miners. This study provides further evidence that mercury exposure may lead to autoimmune dysfunction and systemic inflammation in affected populations.",M2
20149314,"Validation of a new screening strategy for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies.OBJECTIVE: Although indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is the most widely applied screening test for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), it lacks specificity for the identification of specific diseases or antigen reactivities. The aim of the present study was to validate an anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screening strategy encompassing a three-step cascade whereby an ELISA with pooled specific ENA is positioned between the IIF and the final anti-ENA identification. METHODS: Sera from 4 populations were tested for anti-ENA using an automated ELISA (EliA Symphony) and a line immunoassay (INNO-LIA ANA update). RESULTS: At the manufacturer's cut-off, a 96% sensitivity (95% CI 94%-98%) and 96% specificity (95% CI 94%-98%) of EliA Symphony for anti-ENA was obtained in a consecutive selection of 328 IIF positive serum samples referred for ANA testing. In addition, a high sensitivity was demonstrated for anti-ENA reactivities in patients with SLE (99%, 95% CI 97%-101%) and SSc (100%), and for anti-ENA monoreactivities. CONCLUSION: The EliA Symphony test was shown to be a sensitive second-line screening test for anti-ENA antibodies. In the context of a high clinical suspicion of connective tissue disease or autoreactivities not included in the EliA Symphony assay, third-line testing may be useful, even if the anti-ENA screening is negative.",M2
20128042,"Differences in individual efficacy of two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on recurrent spontaneous abortions of autoimmune etiologies evaluated by antinuclear antibody and anticardiolipin antibody titers.The differences in individual efficacy of two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) and anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA) positive recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) was analyzed in 52 patients (a total of 61 treatment sessions). Patients who failed to respond to initial treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to were additionally treated with Byakujyutu- Sairei-to, and the time course of ANA and ACLA titers in these patients was analyzed. ACLA titers were decreased significantly by the treatment of Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, however, the percentage of successfully prevented abortion cases did not differ significantly between the Sojyutu-Sairei-to treatment group and the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to treatment group. ACLA titer was decreased in all 10 cases where abortion was successfully prevented by the treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to. In the cases where both ANA and ACLA were decreased following treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, the percentage of cases rated as  Kyo  and  Rikan  were significantly higher in the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to group. These results indicate that Byakujyutu-Sairei-to is effective against ACLA positive RSA through the antibody-reducing activity, which differs from that of Sojyutu-Sairei-to in individual cases. On the basis of these results, Sairei-to therapy, which is superior to aspirin and heparin in terms of efficacy and safety, is recommended as the first-line therapy for RSA of autoimmune etiologies. Furthermore, to elevate the percentage of successfully prevented abortions, it is advisable to select one of the two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on the basis of differential diagnosis using the methods of Oriental medicine.",M2
20110527,"Prevalence of autoantibodies in SAPHO syndrome: a single-center study of 90 patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the most often tested autoantibodies in synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. METHODS: We identified 90 patients seen in our unit between June 2002 and June 2009, and diagnosed according to the proposed criteria for SAPHO syndrome. Demographic and clinical data were collected as well as immunological results, including antinuclear, antithyroid peroxydase (TPO), antithyroid globulin (Tg), antigastric parietal cell, antismooth muscle, antimitochondria, and anti-liver-kidney microsome (LKM) antibodies. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were analyzed in 69 patients, antibodies to soluble extractable nuclear antigens in 43, anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies in 22 [depending on the type of fluorescence of antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>)], and antiendomysium antibodies in 55. RESULTS: Autoantibodies were found in 20 patients (22.2%): 14 patients (15.5%) had positive ANA (titer &gt;/= 1/160); among them, 10 (11%) patients never took a lupus-inducing drug. Antithyroid antibodies (anti-TPO and/or anti-Tg antibodies) were found in only 3 patients (3.3%). Three patients (3.3%) were positive for antigastric parietal cell antibodies and 4 (4.4%) were weakly positive for antismooth muscle antibodies. Antimitochondria and LKM antibodies were negative in all 90 patients. Anti-CCP and anti-dsDNA antibodies were negative in the 69 and 22 patients tested, respectively. One out of 43 patients (2.3%) had anti-SSA antibodies. Antiendomysium antibodies were negative in the 55 patients tested. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates an increased prevalence of autoantibodies in SAPHO syndrome, with no specific profile. We failed to confirm the reports of an increased prevalence of antithyroid antibodies. These results tend to support a link between autoimmunity and SAPHO syndrome.",M2
20110170,"Autoantibody profiles in two patients with non-autoimmune muscle disease implicate a role for gliadin autoreactivity.The objective of this case study was to characterize autoreactivity in two patients with non-autoimmune forms of muscle disease who had positivity for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and Ro (SSA) autoantibodies. Serum samples from these two patients were applied to an autoantigen protein array with more than 70 specificities and were compared to samples from healthy controls and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Both myopathy patients had high levels of gliadin autoreactivity in serum and one patient had an overall autoantibody profile with lupus-like features. The findings suggest that some disorders of muscle that are considered non-autoimmune, may in fact have autoimmune features. Further examination of the role of subclinical gluten autoreactivity in the pathogenesis of myopathy syndromes has the potential to suggest improved approaches to diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.",M2

METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 360 patients with CHC (case group), 69 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 69 patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (control group). Serum ANA and anti-LKM1 were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (HF) technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Multi-factor analysis was performed to explore the correlations of the production of autoantibodies with some factors such as age, sex, viral loads, HCV genotype, biochemical parameters and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Fifty-four (15%) of 360 patients infected with HCV were positive in autoantibodies. The prevalence of ANA and anti-LKM1 were 12.5% (45/360) and 2.5% (9/ 360), respectively. The positive rate of autoantibodies in patients with CHC was significantly higher than that in patients with CHB (15% vs 2.9%, P = 0.006), but significantly lower than that in patients with AIH (15% vs 47.9%, P &lt; 0.001). Twenty-one (11.35%) of 185 male patients and 33 (18.86%) of 175 female patients were positive in autoantibodies, the difference in positive rate was significant (P &lt; 0.05). HCV virus loads in the autoantibodies negative group were higher than that in the autoantibodies positive group (7.2 x 10(7) copies/L vs 1.23 x 10(7) copies/L, P &lt; 0.05). There were not significant differences in age and genotype between the autoantibody positive group and the autoantibody negative group. The serum biochemical parameters of the autoantibody positive group were similar to those of the autoantibody negative group. The differences were not significant for the course of disease, clinical symptom, the incidence of cirrhosis between the autoantibody positive group and the autoantibody negative group. The prevalence of autoantibodies was not different for patients with or without interferon treatment (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies related to AIH can be detected in CHC patients; interferon may not induce the production of autoantibodies; it is very likely that HCV infection induces the autoimmune reaction and the production of autoantibodies.",M2
20101241,"Genome-wide association mapping identifies multiple loci for a canine SLE-related disease complex.The unique canine breed structure makes dogs an excellent model for studying genetic diseases. Within a dog breed, linkage disequilibrium is extensive, enabling genome-wide association (GWA) with only around 15,000 SNPs and fewer individuals than in human studies. Incidences of specific diseases are elevated in different breeds, indicating that a few genetic risk factors might have accumulated through drift or selective breeding. In this study, a GWA study with 81 affected dogs (cases) and 57 controls from the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever breed identified five loci associated with a canine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related disease complex that includes both antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>)-positive immune-mediated rheumatic disease (IMRD) and steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis (SRMA). Fine mapping with twice as many dogs validated these loci. Our results indicate that the homogeneity of strong genetic risk factors within dog breeds allows multigenic disorders to be mapped with fewer than 100 cases and 100 controls, making dogs an excellent model in which to identify pathways involved in human complex diseases.",M2
20062896,"Anti-double stranded antibody. Association with titers and fluorescence patterns of anti-nuclear antibody in systemic lupus erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: Many laboratories do not test antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) by indirect immune-fluorescence (IIF) in parallel with anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibodies. This study attempts to investigate the legitimacy of such practice. METHODS: A retrospective laboratory data analysis of simultaneous assessment of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody results of 106 patients with either diagnosed or suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was performed at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The ANA was detected by IIF on HEp2 cells and anti-dsDNA antibodies were assessed by specific ELISA test. RESULTS: Among the patients, female preponderance (96.3%) was evident and a coarse speckled fluorescence pattern was commonly observed (60.4%). There was almost no detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies up to an ANA titer of 1:320. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were often detected at ANA titers of 1:640 and beyond. Other patterns of fluorescence observed at ANA titers as low as 1:40 and at higher dilutions were, fine speckled (14.15%), homogeneous (9.4%), anti-mitochondrial (7.5%), ribosomal (4.7%), and nucleolar (3.8%). Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship (p=0.02) between ANA titers and anti-dsDNA antibodies only in the presence of a coarse speckled pattern. CONCLUSION: The rare occurrence of anti-dsDNA antibodies at clinically significant ANA titers associated with the coarse speckled pattern may mask the diagnosis of SLE. Similarly, the diagnosis of SLE may be overlooked if anti-dsDNA antibodies are not checked in the presence of clinically insignificant ANA titers associated with other patterns of fluorescence.",M2
20035096,"Clinical features of antinuclear antibody-positive patients with atopic dermatitis.Twenty to thirty percent of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are positive for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANAs</e>). In this study we investigated the prevalence of ANA in 100 patients with AD and examined the difference between ANA-positive (ANA+) and ANA-negative (ANA(-)) patients with AD. ANAs were identified with indirect immunofluorescence on Hep-2 cells. Nineteen patients (19%) with AD were found to be positive for ANAs at titers ranging from 1 : 40 to 1 : 640. The rate of ANA positivity in male patients (20.4%) was higher than that in female patients (17.6%). The rate of ANA positivity differed significantly between patients with AD and healthy control subjects (p=0.0001, odds ratio: 2.8). There was also a relationship between ANA+ AD and photosensitivity in male subjects (p=0.0346). The ANA+ patients with AD showed higher levels of cedar pollen-specific IgE than did ANA(-) patients (p=0.0232). In ANA+ patients disease severity was correlated with basophil counts (r=0.513, p=0.0344) and serum LDH levels (r=0.741, p=0.0056). The results indicate that patients with AD who are positive for ANA are a subpopulation of patients with AD.",M2

Scleromyositis, the most common overlap syndrome, is usually observed in adults, and has rarely been documented in childhood. Here, the case of a 10-year-old African American female with scleromyositis is reported. This disease has features of both dermatomyositis and systemic scleroderma. Her disease process began with signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis and slowly changed clinically to features of systemic scleroderma.

20012869,"Gender differences in the relationship of anti-parvovirus B19 IgG with antinuclear antibody and C-reactive protein in clinical adult serum samples.Human parvovirus B19 (B19) infection is often suspected as an etiologic agent in a variety of rheumatologic diseases. It has been hypothesized that this virus potentially induces immune dysregulation by abnormal cytokine expression in susceptible hosts. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between anti-parvovirus B19 IgG antibody (B19 IgG) and two common markers of immune dysregulation-antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in clinical sera. Qualitative B19 IgG antibody and levels of high-sensitivity CRP were determined in adult serum samples submitted to a university hospital clinical laboratory for ANA testing. Prevalence of B19 IgG was compared among groups by ANA status and CRP tertile. B19 IgG was detected in 72.3% of 318 samples. Among women above the first quartile of age (&gt;38 years), presence of B19 IgG was associated with CRP tertile rank (P = 0.008) and CRP levels &gt; or =1 mg/L (P = 0.001) independent of age and ANA status. B19 IgG was less frequent in ANA-positive than ANA-negative women &lt; or =38 years of age (P = 0.009). Viral antibody was not associated with either biomarker in men.

20009966,"Prevalence of antinuclear antibodies in 3 groups of healthy individuals: blood donors, hospital personnel, and relatives of patients with autoimmune diseases.Antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) are frequently found in healthy populations. To define the prevalence, pattern, and titer of ANA in different groups of the healthy Mexican population, we studied 304 individuals, classified into 3 groups: 104 blood donors, 100 hospital personnel working at The State General Hospital, which included doctors, laboratory technicians, and nurses; and 100 relatives of patient diagnosed either with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, all of them apparently healthy at the time of study. We determined ANA using immunofluorescence microscopy performed on HEp-2 cells. Fluorescence was detected in 165 serum samples (54.3%). The most frequent pattern was the speckled (50.3%). The most frequent dilution was 1:40 (35.4%), followed by 1:80 (13.4%), 1:160 (3.2%), and 1:320 (1.3%).Regarding the results by study group, we found a trend toward higher ANA levels in group 2 (hospital personnel), compared with group 1 (blood donors) and group 3 (relatives of patients), a trend also reflected by the increasing frequency of serum titers of 1:80 and higher (P = 0.074). According to occupation, medical doctors showed a higher incidence of speckled pattern when compared with other occupations (P = 0.022). Medical doctors (n = 75) showed also higher titers of this particular pattern (P = 0.03). In group 3, relatives of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus showed the speckled pattern more frequently than relatives of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in low titers (P = 0.017). We suggest that ANA tests showing speckled pattern should be at a 1:160 titer or higher to be considered positive; other patterns such as homogeneous, peripheral, or centromeric might be considered positive even at low titers (&lt;/=1:40) although this needs investigation.ANA should generally not be tested without clinical indication. Positive ANA finding in the absence of physical signs and symptoms has limited diagnostic utility and should always be interpreted by a rheumatologist, in the context of clinical symptoms and results of laboratory tests for specific autoantibodies. Populations such as doctors and relatives of patients with autoimmune disease tend to presents increased ANA titers.",M2
20009397,"Autoimmune pancreatitis without a response to steroid therapy: a case which met criteria after withdrawal of steroid.Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) sometimes forms a pancreatic mass lesion, which is often difficult to distinguish from pancreatobiliary malignancy, however it generally responds to steroid therapy. A 70-year-old man was referred to our institute with the suspected diagnosis of pancreatic cancer due to a mass lesion detected at the pancreatic head. Various images demonstrated an ill-defined mass at the enlarged pancreatic head with focal narrowing of the main pancreatic duct. Serum antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) was negative (x40 dilution) on the onset. Forceps biopsy from the narrowed pancreaticobiliary duct and fine-needle aspiration biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS-FNAB) ruled out pancreatobiliary malignancy. Steroid therapy was started at 40 mg per day but was not effective according to subsequent image analyses. Repeated EUS-FNA from the pancreatic mass was performed but was again negative for carcinoma. Seven months later, under steroid-off condition, still no response was recognized in the clinical image but the titer of serum ANA was increased to be positive (x80), satisfying the criteria of AIP in Japan (2006). Although very rare, this is a case meeting Japanese criteria of AIP after withdrawal of steroid without response to steroid in the clinical images, suggesting the necessity of careful follow-up.",M2
20008444,"Induction of autoimmunity in brown Norway rats by oral and parenteral administration of nickel chloride.Nickel intolerance owing to sensitization is a growing problem. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between nickel chloride and induction of autoimmunity in genetically susceptible rats. Thirty brown Norway rats were randomized into four treatment groups; the first and second groups received nickel chloride 4.5 mg in 0.2 ml normal saline either orally or subcutaneously, and the third and fourth groups (controls) received normal saline (0.9%) 0.2 ml through the same routes. A significant number of rats (P &lt; 0.05) that received nickel chloride by the subcutaneous or oral routes showed a high level of serum antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) compared with controls. A significant number of rats (P &lt; 0.05) that received nickel chloride by the subcutaneous route showed high serum anti-SSA, but the number of rats with anti-SSA was insignificant in the group that received nickel by the oral route. Other autoantibodies found in both groups (anti-double-stranded (ds)DNA, anti-Smith, anti-SSB) showed a gradual increase, but the number of rats with positive titers post exposure was not significant statistically. Nickel chloride exposure in the rats appeared to induce the development of autoimmunity. A longer duration following exposure to nickel chloride seems to be associated with greater risks.",M2
20003822,"A pilot study of the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of artesunate in the MRL/lpr murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus.Recent evidence indicates that artesunate has immunomodulatory properties that might be useful for treating autoimmune disease. In this study, we conducted a pilot study and explored the effect and mechanism of artesunate on the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus using an MRL/lpr murine model. MRL/lpr mice were divided into control, cyclophosphamide (CTX) and artesunate treatment groups. Blood was collected to measure serum levels of creatinine, antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected to measure levels of proteinuria. The concentration of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in serum and urine was measured. The expression of MCP-1 in kidney was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry assay, respectively. The expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF) in spleen was determined by real time-PCR and immunoblotting. We found that artesunate significantly increased the survival rate, body weight and blood leukocyte counts, and reduced the serum levels of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody titer, 24 h urinary protein, and serum creatinine. Our results indicated that artesunate could decrease MCP-1, major pro-inflammation cytokine, in serum, urine and kidney. We also found that the level of BAFF, the major B cell activation factor, was decreased in artesunate treated MRL/lpr mice. Its efficacy was comparable with that of CTX in this study. Taken together, we have demonstrated that artesunate can inhibit the progression of disease and reverse the pathologic lesion of lupus nephritis.",M2
19928490,"[Evaluation of simultaneous detection of specific antinuclear antibodies using multiplexed technology]BioPlex2200 is a fully automated analyzer using multiplexed technology and BioPlex2200 <e>ANA</e> Screen can analyze 11 antinuclear antibodies (ANA). We evaluated simultaneous detection of 11 ANA and clinical utility as ANA screening test. We collected sera from 317 connective tissue disease (CTD) patients, 166 healthy subjects, and 105 sera in which anti dsDNA antibody(RIA) is requested. Detection of 11 ANA were measured by BioPlex2200 ANA Screen using BioPlex2200 along with conventional methods. We evaluated positive ratio for healthy subjects and CTD patients and concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and IF. The prevalence of disease specific ANA in CTD patients were comparable with general occurrence rate except anti dsDNA antibody (39.3%) in SLE. Concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and conventional methods were high(89.0-99.7%) except anti dsDNA antibody(ELISA: 68.8%, RIA: 58.1%). Discordant sera of Bioplex2200+/DID- for anti SS-A antibodies were observed in 30 sera, and 20 sera were positive only for anti 52kD SS-A/Ro antibody. As ANA screening test, positive ratio was low (7.2%) in healthy subjects, and comparable with that of IF(1:160). Concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and IF was low (75.1%). However, 44 sera of BioPlex2200+/IF- contained 6 samples positive for anti Jo-1 antibodies and 29 samples positive for anti-52kD SS-A/Ro antibodies. Diagnostic accuracy of the Medical Decision Support Software (MDSS) by BioPlex2200 as compared to clinical diagnosis is good for specificity. Taken together, BioPlex2200 can appropriately perform simultaneous detection of 11 ANA and detect independently anti-52kD SS-A/Ro antibody. However, detection for anti dsDNA antibody of low titers is needed to be improved.",M2
19897433,"[Antinuclear antibodies, patterns and characteristics obtained by immunofluorescence. The importance of the IgA, IgM and IgG isotypes]The indirect immunofluorescence with epitelial cell line from human laryngeal carcinoma as substrate (IIF-HEp2) and anti-IgG or anti-total Ig as antisera, is the technique currently used for the detection of antinuclear antibodies. The most important antibodies for the diagnosis and follow-up of connective tissue diseases (CTD) are the IgG-<e>ANA</e>, while the IgM-ANA have no clinical relevance. However the IgA-ANA have not been thoroughly investigated so far. The aim of this work was to study the prevalence of different ANA isotypes of Ig antibodies in CTD patients and to evaluate the convenience of the use of monovalent or polyvalent conjugate. We examined the sera of 100 patients with different CTD by IIF-HEp2 and detected a prevalence of 38% IgA-ANA (titles &gt; or = 1:80) and 12% IgM-ANA (titles &lt; or = 1:160). In twenty nine cases we detected IgA-ANA in absence of IgM-ANA, and in 3 cases IgM-ANA in absence of IgA-ANA. In all the cases IgG-ANA were present. In 6 sera a change in the immunofluorescence pattern was observed while using anti-IgA conjugate, whereas in 3 the change was observed with the use of anti-IgM conjugate. Because of the high prevalence of ANA-IgA detected by IIF-HEp2, we emphasize the convenience of employing anti-total Ig in spite of anti-IgG conjugated until the role of ANA-IgA is dilucidated in CTD patients, in order to establish its relevance in the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of systemic rheumatic diseases.",M2
19897339,"A comprehensive evaluation of serum autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis.In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) serum markers other than anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are promising in terms of disease severity and comorbidities, as well represented by anti-nuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>). The aim of the present study was thus to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of a large profile of serum autoantibodies in PBC sera. We utilized 69 sera from European patients with PBC (including 20 AMA-negative) and 297 sera from geographically and sex-matched healthy controls. All sera were tested for the presence of ANA and autoantibodies associated with thrombophilia, vasculitis, and gastrointestinal disease. Autoantibodies other than AMA were detected in 53/69 (76%) PBC sera vs. 105/297 (35%) among controls. The prevalence of ANA (targeting dsDNA, Sm, chromatin, ribosomal-P, RNP, SmRNP, SSA, SSB, and centromere) and thrombophilia-associated autoantibodies (i.e. anti-beta2GPI, phosphatydilserine, prothrombin) was common among patients with PBC. When clinical features were compared, the presence of anti-prothrombin IgM was associated with a worse prognosis as represented by a higher Mayo score. We demonstrate an increased prevalence of ANA and thrombophilia-associated autoantibodies in PBC sera and an association between the latter autoantibodies and PBC stage. The role of thrombophilia-associated antibodies will warrant further studies, based in particular on the incidence of portal hypertension at early stages of PBC.",M2
19863304,"Utility of immunologic parameters in the evaluation of Meniere's disease.CONCLUSION: Because of the lack of association between a positive test and response to corticosteroid treatment, at present, detection of anti-HSP 70 antibody, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), does not offer clinically useful information in the treatment of Meniere's disease (MD). OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to investigate the performance of various laboratory tests, including anti-HSP 70, TNF-alpha, ESR, ANA, and anti-phospholipid antibodies, in the diagnosis and treatment response of patients with MD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who presented with MD and 30 healthy people were selected as study and control groups, respectively. The laboratory panel included the following tests: anti-HSP 70 antibody immunoassay, TNF-alpha, ESR, ANA, and anti-phospholipid antibodies. The study group was given corticosteroid therapy and separated into two groups: the corticosteroid responders and the corticosteroid non-responders. In the follow-up, repeat audiograms were evaluated to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: TNF-alpha was found at significantly lower titers in the study group when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). Anti-HSP 70 was not found in high titers in the study group. ANA positivity in patients with MD was not statistically different from the control group. There was no significant difference in the treatment response for any of the parameters tested.",M2
19860592,"Comparative study of antinuclear antibody detection by indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay in lupus patients.To evaluate the value of immunofluorescent and ELISA techniques in early diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to find out whether there is a correlation between Antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) pattern and prognosis by observing clinical score changes using British Isles Lupus Assessment Group score. The study included 75 SLE patients, 11 disease control group, and 18 healthy control group. ANA and ds-DNA antibodies detection were done by ELISA and Immunofluorescence for all groups. Immunofluorescence technique is more sensitive for ANA and ds-DNA detection than ELISA technique (100% versus 90.7%,and 93% versus 89.3% respectively); ELISA showed 89.7 % specificity for ANA detection compared to 86.2% for Immunofluorescence, and both have 100% specificity for ds-DNA detection ;homogenous ANA pattern, showed statistically significant higher BILAG score compared to speckled pattern either at the start of the study or after the follow up period (p = 0.000); and ds-DNA titer showed statistically significant decrease in titer after therapy (p = 0.01). ANA detection by Immunofluorescence is more sensitive and effective screening assay in patients with clinical features of SLE and both ds-DNA titer by ELISA and BILAG score for severity index are considered the best markers for follow-up.",M2
19856712,"Increased prevalence and coincidence of antinuclear and antithyroid antibodies in the population exposed to high levels of polychlorinated pollutants cocktail.OBJECTIVES: Because of well known association between the exposure to persistent organochlorinated pollutants (POPs) and impaired immune system, it was attempted to check possible coincidence of nuclear and thyroperoxidase antibodies with the levels of major POPs. METHODS: Antinuclear antibodies. (<e>ANA</e>) were estimated by indirect immunofluorescence test using Hep2- cells and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) by electrochemiluminiscent immunoassay in the cohort of 253 adults (82 males and 171 females) aged 21-75 years, among them 144 (46 males and 98 females) from the area polluted (POLL) by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and 109 (36 males and 73 females) from the area of background pollutrion (BCGR). In the same cohort fifteen congeners of PCB and also total DDE (2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were estimated by high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Prevalence of ANA only was significantly higher in POLL than in BCGR in males (p &lt; 0.001) and females (p &lt; 0.001) and the same was true for the prevalence of TPOab in males (p &lt; 0.05) and females (p &lt; 0.01) from POLL. In addition, also the prevalence of coincident ANA+TPOab in males (p &lt; 0.001) and females (p &lt; 0.05) was significantly higher in POLL. In a total of 253 pooled males and females from both areas and stratified in terms of PCB level quintiles. The prevalence of ANA in the 4th and 5th quintile of each among three pollutants (PCB, DDE and HCB) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.001) and showed the parallel increase with the level of all pollutants. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly increased prevalence of ANA either only or in coincidence with TPOab was found related to increasing level of PCB, DDE and HCB.",M2
19833748,"Autoantibodies and the risk of cardiovascular events.OBJECTIVE: Inflammation and autoimmunity are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This association may also be present in those without rheumatic diseases. Our purpose was to determine whether rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP) positivity are associated with increased risk of CV events and overall mortality in those with and without rheumatic diseases. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study of all subjects who had a RF and/or ANA test performed between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2000, and/or CCP test performed between September 1, 2003, and January 1, 2005, with followup until April 1, 2007. Outcomes were ascertained using diagnostic indices from complete medical records, including CV events [myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD)] and mortality. Cox models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: There were 6783 subjects with RF, 7852 with ANA, and 299 with CCP testing. Of these, 10.4%, 23.9%, and 14.7% were positive for RF, ANA, and CCP, respectively. Adjusting for age, sex, calendar year, comorbidity, and rheumatic disease, RF and ANA positivity were significant predictors of CV events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.24 and 1.26] and death (HR 1.43 and 1.18). Adjusting for age, CCP positivity was associated with CV events, but this association was not statistically significant (HR 3.1; 95% CI 0.8, 12.3). CONCLUSION: RF and ANA positivity are significant predictors of CV events and mortality in both those with and those without rheumatic diseases. These results support the role of immune dysregulation in the etiology of CV disease.",M2
19810418,"Detection and identification of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) in a large community hospital.OBJECTIVE: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and their identification are important diagnostic tools in rheumatic diseases. We aimed to determine their prevalence in samples referred for ANA testing and to identify factors predicting more specific reactivities. METHODS: We analyzed the first sample of 6422 consecutive patients for ANA. Positive samples were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on Crithidia luciliae and by line immunoassay. We used multivariate logistic regression to detect predicting variables. RESULTS: 42.6% of all patients were ANA positive of which 13.0% showed &gt; or = one extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) reactivity with anti-SSA/Ro (5.5%), anti-SSB/La (2.9%), anti-Cenp-B (2.5%) and anti-histones (2.2%) as the most prevalent antibodies. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNA) were present in 1.0%. The strongest overall predictor was ANA intensity regardless of pattern. Cenp-B however was best predicted by pattern. Anti-dsDNA and anti-histone were more frequent in samples with a homogenous as compared with a speckled pattern. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB were more frequent in females and anti-Sm in patients &lt; or = 30 years. CONCLUSIONS: The best overall predictor of antibodies to ENA or dsDNA is ANA intensity. Anti-Cenp-B is however best predicted by pattern. Samples with low ANA intensity (1+) may not need further testing unless a high clinical suspicion of ANA-associated disease.",M2
19789936,"Antinucleosome antibodies in juvenile chronic arthritis.A broad range of autoantibodies have been detected in juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) patients, although, none of them can be considered specific for this entity. Antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) is routinely searched in these patients mainly because it is associated with uveitis, a comorbidity that is particularly frequent in the oligoarticular form. Nevertheless, the ANA specific antigen target in JCA is unknown. In this study, we aimed to search for antinucleosome antibodies in 30 adult JCA patients and to study possible associations with clinical profile. Ten individuals (33.3%) were positive for antinucleosome antibodies and seven (70%) were simultaneously ANA positive (p = 0.01). We did not find any significant association among antinucleosome and JCA form, uveitis, age of onset, gender, or functional index. We conclude that in JCA, there is a prevalence of 33.3% of antinucleosome antibodies. Further investigations are needed to understand the ANA positivity found in this disease as far as the clinical impact of this finding.",M2

19779028,"Autoimmunity and atherosclerosis: the presence of antinuclear antibodies is associated with decreased carotid elasticity in young women. The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.OBJECTIVE: There is ample evidence demonstrating that accelerated atherosclerosis prevails in autoimmune rheumatic diseases, particularly in SLE, and that the risk is due not only to traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also to the disease itself. <e>ANAs</e> are a hallmark of SLE and are known even to antedate the development of SLE. Our aim was to investigate whether positive ANAs in young adults are associated with risk factors for atherosclerosis or subclinical markers of atherosclerosis. METHODS: ANAs were examined by IIF using HEp-2 cells as substrate in 2278 participants in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study for whom detailed data on cardiovascular risk factors and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis (including brachial flow-mediated dilatation, carotid compliance and carotid intima-media thickness) were available. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, adjusted for age, BMI, serum concentrations of CRP, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking habits, ANA positivity (titre &gt; 160) was inversely associated (beta = -0.145; P = 0.034) with carotid compliance in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ANA positivity is associated with decreased carotid elasticity in women, suggesting that mechanisms resulting in ANA production may be involved in the development of early atherosclerosis.",M2
19758153,"Autoimmune thyroid disease and autoimmune rheumatic disorders: a two-sided analysis.Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (ATD) frequently overlaps with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of various non-organ-specific autoantibodies in patients with ATD, as well as the presence of ATD in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Group 1 comprised 80 patients with ATD, and group 2 contained 80 patients with SLE or RA. A control group consisted of 34 healthy subjects. Group 1 was examined for the presence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Serum fT3, fT4, TSH, and antibodies against thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, as well as ultrasound of thyroid gland, were determined in group 2. RESULTS: Patients with ATD had a significantly higher prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) than control subjects (45% vs. 14.7%, P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of other antibodies between the groups. ANA-positive patients were younger than ANA-negative ones and had significantly higher anti-TG values (P &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of ATD in group 2 was significantly higher than in the control subjects (24% vs. 8%, P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences in the prevalence of ATD were detected between SLE and RA. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that ANA is the most frequent non-organ-specific antibody associated with ATD, while the other antibodies occur rarely. The prevalence of ATD in SLE and RA patients was 24%. These results indicate that it is clinically important to screen patients with SLE and RA for the coexistence of thyroid autoimmune disease.",M2
19758140,"An italian multicenter study for application of a diagnostic algorithm in autoantibody testing.The presence in the serum of specific autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and antiextractable nuclear antigens (anti-ENA), is one of the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune rheumatic disease, and the requests for these tests in the last few years have grown remarkably. A guideline for reducing clinically inappropriate requests in autoantibody testing (ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) has been applied in the Parma Hospital since 2007. The results for the period January-December 2007 were compared to those of the previous period January-December 2006, and a significant reduction in the number of anti-dsDNA (23.9%) and anti-ENA (20.7%) was found. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of a similar guideline in a wide area (Parma, Modena, Piacenza, Reggio-Emilia) with reference to the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease. This project, supported by a regional grant for innovative research projects, was started in January 2008 and consists of three different steps: (1) a study group of clinicians and laboratory physicians to evaluate the diagnostic criteria, the analytical procedures, and the number of tests performed in different hospitals; (2) developing common guidelines for autoantibody testing that takes into account the different clinical needs with the aim of improving efficiency and clinical effectiveness of diagnosis and monitoring; and (3) assessing compliance with the guidelines in the different hospitals that are evaluating the second-level test (anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) decrease. We think that the validation of guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease can represent a tool for improving patients' outcomes and economic efficiency.",M2
19720064,"Novel method for quantitative <e>ANA</e> measurement using near-infrared imaging.Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) have been detected in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and are used in the screening and/or diagnosis of autoimmunity in patients as well as mouse models of systemic autoimmunity. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cells is the gold standard for ANA screening. However, its usefulness is limited in diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease activity due to the lack of standardization in performing the technique, subjectivity in interpreting the results and the fact that it is only semi-quantitative. Various immunological techniques have been developed in an attempt to improve upon the method to quantify ANA, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), line immunoassays (LIAs), multiplexed bead immunoassays and IIF on substrates other than HEp-2 cells. Yet IIF on HEp-2 cells remains the most common screening method for ANA. In this study, we describe a simple quantitative method to detect ANA which combines IIF on HEp-2 coated slides with analysis using a near-infrared imaging (NII) system. Using NII to determine ANA titer, 86.5% (32 of 37) of the titers for human patient samples were within 2 dilutions of those determined by IIF, which is the acceptable range for proficiency testing. Combining an initial screening for nuclear staining using microscopy with titration by NII resulted in 97.3% (36 of 37) of the titers detected to be within two dilutions of those determined by IIF. The NII method for quantitative ANA measurements using serum from both patients and mice with autoimmunity provides a fast, relatively simple, objective, sensitive and reproducible assay, which could easily be standardized for comparison between laboratories.",M2

19699528,"Anti-nuclear antibody reactivity in lupus may be partly hard-wired into the primary B-cell repertoire.When monoclonal <e>ANAs</e> and non-ANAs generated from a genetically simplified mouse model of lupus, B6.Sle1, were recently compared, the ANAs exhibited three sequence motifs in their immunoglobulin heavy chains, including increased cationicity in CDR3 ( motif A ), reduced anionicity in CDR2 ( motif B ) and increased aspartate at H50 ( motif C ). The present study was designed to elucidate the extent to which these ANA-associated sequence motifs might be hard-wired into the primary B-cell repertoire in lupus. The immunoglobulin heavy chain sequence of total splenic B-cells, follicular B-cells and marginal zone B-cells from B6.Sle1 congenic mice and C57BL/6 controls were amplified by single-cell PCR and compared. Analysis of the primary immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire indicated that the first two sequence motifs  A  and  B  were already encoded in the naïve repertoire of B6.Sle1(z) mice, whereas the third motif  C  was introduced in part by somatic mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that non-anionic CDR2 and cationic CDR3 residues in the immunoglobulin heavy chain facilitated nuclear antigen binding in concert, whereas aspartate at H50 strongly vetoed DNA-binding, while preserving nucleosome reactivity. Hence, anti-nuclear antibodies appear to arise as a consequence of two distinct processes-genetically programmed selection of specific CDR charge motifs into the primary immunoglobulin repertoire, with secondary contribution from somatic mutation. Polymorphisms in the lupus susceptibility gene Ly108 that impair central B-cell tolerance may be mechanistically responsible for these early repertoire differences in lupus.",M2
19676002,"Autoimmune hepatitis in children: what is different from adult AIH?Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by inflammatory liver histology, circulating non-organ-specific autoantibodies, and increased levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G in the absence of a known etiology. Two types of childhood AIH are recognized according to seropositivity: smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and/or antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), which is AIH type 1; and antibodies to liver-kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), which is AIH type 2. There is a female predominance in both. Autoimmune hepatitis type 2 presents more acutely, at a younger age, and commonly with IgA deficiency; however, duration of symptoms before diagnosis, clinical signs, family history of autoimmunity, presence of associated autoimmune disorders, response to treatment, and long-term prognosis are similar in the two groups. Immunosuppressive treatment with steroids and azathioprine, which should be instituted promptly to avoid progression to cirrhosis, induces remission in 80% of cases. Relapses are common, often due to nonadherence. Drugs effective in refractory cases include cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Long-term treatment is usually required, with only some 20% of AIH type 1 patients able to discontinue therapy successfully. In childhood, sclerosing cholangitis with strong autoimmune features, including interface hepatitis and serological features identical to AIH type 1, is as prevalent as AIH, but it affects boys and girls equally. The differential diagnosis relies on cholangiographic studies. In autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis, liver parenchymal damage responds satisfactorily to immunosuppressive treatment, whereas bile duct disease tends to progress.",M2

Detection of atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) and anti-soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibodies can act as an additional pointer toward the diagnosis of AIH, particularly in the absence of the conventional autoantibodies. Routine autoantibody testing by indirect immunofluorescence has been recently complemented by molecular assays based on purified or recombinant antigens. Although the AIH-1-specific ANA and SMA targets need better definition, those of anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 in AIH-2 have been clearly identified; the fine specificity of antibody reactivity and its clinical relevance to disease pathogenesis are the focus of ongoing investigation. This article critically discusses the current knowledge of the diagnostic and clinical significance of AIH-related autoantibody reactivities, focusing on key issues that the physician needs to be aware of to be able to request the appropriate testing and to interpret correctly the laboratory results within the clinical context of the patient.",M2
19657776,"Autoantibodies to lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription co-activator P75 (LEDGF/P75) in children with chronic nonspecific complaints and with positive antinuclear antibodies.Autoimmune fatigue syndrome (AIFS) is characterized by chronic nonspecific complaints, consistently positive antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), and lack of alternate medical explanations. A newly recognized antibody, named anti-Sa, was detected in approximately 40% of the patients by Western blot (WB) using HeLa extract. Some patients with AIFS later develop chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and most of them are positive for anti-Sa. On the other hand, Muro et al. reported anti-DFS70 in patients with CFS. Anti-Sa and anti-DFS70 were turned out to be same specificities by exchanging studies of blind sera. The target antigen of anti-DFS70 was identified as lens epithelium derived growth factor/transcription co-activator p75 (LEDGF/p75). The objectives of this study are to confirm whether the target antigen of anti-Sa is also LEDGF/p75, and to develop ELISA system by using recombinant protein. Recombinant protein of LEDGF/p75 was purchased from Protein One (Bethesda, MD, USA). We developed an ELISA system to detect anti-LEDGF/p75 by coating this recombinant protein. 226 sera of AIFS patients (including 36 CFS patients) were applied to this ELISA assay and Western immunoblot, and it was revealed that anti-Sa-positive sera defined by WB and sera positive for anti-LEDGF/p75 on ELISA were identical. Moreover, reactivities of anti-Sa on WB were inhibited by pre-incubating with recombinant LEDGF/p75, and eluted antibodies from the nitrocellulose membrane could react on the ELISA. These results confirm that the Sa antigen is LEDGF/p75. The ELISA assay using recombinant LEDGF/p75 could be a promising tool for measuring anti-Sa and consequently for diagnosing CFS.",M2
19614623,"Comparison of serum markers for thrombophilia and autoimmune disease in reproductive age women with and without false positive rapid plasma reagin tests.PROBLEM: The rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) is performed frequently in clinical practice, particularly among reproductive age women. The phenomenon of the biologic false positive RPR is well-recognized, but its clinical significance is poorly characterized. Our objective was to assess the relationship between the false positive RPR and several established clinical and biological markers for thrombophilia and/or autoimmune disease. METHOD OF STUDY: We conducted a clinic-based, case-control study of 41 healthy, reproductive age women with history of a biologic false positive RPR and 30 control women with a negative RPR to assess the relationship between the false positive RPR and several established clinical and biological markers for thrombophilia and/or autoimmune disease. We used t-tests and constructed frequency tables for case-control comparisons. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely than controls to have lupus anticoagulant present in serum, have a positive <e>ANA</e>, and a positive ANA with a titer of 1:320 or greater. Cases were also more likely to be positive for anticardiolipin antibodies and have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, but the CIs for those point estimates included the null value. Eight participants tested positive for both lupus anticoagulant and ANA. All eight were in the case group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RPR test might be used to identify a subset of women who warrant further testing for autoimmune and/or thromboembolic disease.",M2
19593224,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis: the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic presentation.Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is an inflammatory disorder that affects the infrarenal great vessels and surrounding structures. Although first described in 1948 by Ormond, much of the information currently available on this disease is conflicting and results from multiple definitions used by different investigators. We conducted the current study to describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic presentation of RPF from a single center using data collected in a prospective fashion.Data on all patients who were referred to our RPF clinic were prospectively collected. We obtained information on presenting signs and symptoms, and on the presence or absence of  traditional risk factors,  comorbidities, and family histories. All patients underwent the same battery of laboratory testing, including complete blood count, renal function profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>). All patients had contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis. The extent of disease was classified based on the anatomic location of the soft-tissue density.Forty-eight patients (26 male and 22 female) met the criteria for RPF and were included in the study. The mean age was 54.25 years. Few patients had traditional risk factors for RPF. Pain and weight loss were the most common presenting symptoms. The mean hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL. The mean ESR was 40.5 mm/h. Nine patients had positive ANA, all with negative antibodies to dsDNA. CT or MRI revealed the presence of a periaortic soft-tissue density in all (100%) patients; 69% had pericaval involvement, 62% had obstruction of 1 or both ureters, and 35% of patients had involvement of the renal artery or renal vein.In the current report we present the demographics and laboratory and radiographic presentation of a homogenous group of patients with RPF. We attempt to solidify a proper scheme of classification for the disease, and suggest an anatomic classification system that may be used for future studies.",M2

Various alterations in humoral immune function have been reported in silicosis patients and workers exposed to silica dust. The aim of this study was to measure antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) and rheumatoid factor (RF) levels in foundry workers exposed to silica and to compare them with a control group without such exposure. ANA and RF were measured in 78 exposed and 73 non-exposed workers, and standard statistical methods were used to compare them. The two groups did not significantly differ in age and smoking. Mean work duration of the exposed and non-exposed workers was (14.9+/-4.72) years and (12.41+/-6.3) years, respectively. Ten exposed workers had silicosis. ANA was negative in all workers in either group. Its mean titer did not differ significantly between the exposed and control workers [(0.39+/-0.15) IU mL(-1) vs. (0.36+/-0.17) IU mL(-1), respectively]. RF was positive in two workers of each group. Other studies have reported an increase in ANA and RF associated with exposure to silica dust and silicosis.In contrast, our study suggests that exposure to silica dust does not increase the level of ANA and RF in exposed workers.",M2

METHODS: ANA by indirect immunofluorescence using HEp-2 cells (IF-ANA), ELISA for ANA (E-ANA), and AHA were analyzed in sera of 100 children with recent-onset JIA and in 58 control sera. Clinical features, including age at onset, JIA subgroup, and presence of uveitis, were recorded in this prospective population-based cohort study. RESULTS: E-ANA was positive in 4 of the 100 sera, and was not associated with uveitis. Chronic uveitis developed in 16 children with JIA: in 14 of 68 positive for IF-ANA &gt;/= 80, and in 13 of 44 positive for AHA &gt;/= 8 U/ml. IgM/IgG AHA were found in higher proportions in children with uveitis (mean 12.4 U/ml) than in those with JIA and no uveitis (mean 6.9 U/ml) or in healthy controls (mean 4.3 U/ml). CONCLUSION: No association was found between E-ANA and uveitis, and most IF-ANA-positive sera were E-ANA-negative. E-ANA is not clinically relevant in this setting and should never be used to determine frequencies of eye examinations to detect new uveitis in JIA.

19530912,"Detecting clinical activity in systemic lupus erythematosus with an archaeal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like thermozyme: a pivotal study.The clinical usefulness of an immunotest was evaluated by using purified poly(adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (PARPSso) as an antigen to detect the presence of abnormal anti-PARP antibodies in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at different clinical stages. Sera from 44 patients with SLE, subgrouped on the basis of disease activity (16 with inactive disease, 28 with active disease) were analysed with a new immunotest to detect anti-PARP antibodies, and with an immunofluorescent (IIF) assay for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) detection. ANA detection by IIF revealed that sera of healthy subjects were negative, whereas sera from patients with SLE were positive in all cases (13 positive at 1:80, 15 at 1:160, 15 at 1:320, 1 at 1:640, v/v). Anti-PARP activity was higher in ANA-positive patients than in controls (p = 0.005). Within the group of SLE sera, disease and anti-PARP activity was increased more significantly in patients with active than in those with inactive disease (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Correlation between anti-PARP and disease activity in SLE patients was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). PARPSso seems to be suitable for detecting anti-PARP antibodies and could play a role as a serological marker of disease activity in patients with SLE.",M2
19524489,"Upregulated BclG(L) expression enhances apoptosis of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.Increased lymphocyte apoptosis has been suggested to contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the critical factors involved in the apoptotic pathways are still unknown. By long serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE) profiles and microarray analyses, a novel apoptosis-related gene BclG(L) expression was found significantly increased in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of SLE patients, which was correlated with the enhanced CD4+ T cells apoptosis, anti-nuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) titer and proteinuria. In vitro, BclG(L) expression could be specially upregulated by SLE serum stimulation and positively correlated with induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis. Enforcing BclG(L) overexpression by lentivirus could directly enhance CD4+ T cell apoptosis, but these apoptosis-inducing effects could be partially inhibited by knockdown of BclG(L) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that increased BclG(L) expression may contribute to the aberrant CD4+ T cell apoptosis which causes an inappropriate immune response and impaired homeostasis in SLE.",M2

19487262,"Serologic profile and mortality rates of scleroderma renal crisis in Italy.OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and serological characteristics of subjects with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) in Italian patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records from 9 Italian rheumatologic referral centers was carried out. All patients with SRC and an available serum sample at the time of crisis were included. Antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) by indirect immunofluorescence, anti-topoisomerase (topo) I by enzyme-linked assay (ELISA), anti-RNA polymerases (RNAP) by ELISA for the subunit III, and immunoprecipitation (IP) were performed. RESULTS: Forty-six cases (38 female; 40 diffuse cutaneous SSc) were identified. Mean age at SSc and SRC onset was 52.8 years +/- 13.2 and 55.4 years +/- 11.8, respectively. ANA were present in 44 patients (96%). Anti-topo I antibodies were detected in 30 (65%), anti-RNAP I-III in 7 (15%). No differences emerged between these 2 groups for their main clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients in the anti-RNAP I-III group developing SRC early (&lt; 18 mo) in the course of SSc was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Cumulative survival rates were 64%, 53%, and 35% at 1, 2, and 10 years of followup, respectively. Survival rates of SSc patients significantly differed according to their autoantibody profile, being lower in the anti-topo I than in the anti-RNAP I-III group (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: SRC is a rare manifestation of SSc in Italy but it is still associated with severe prognosis. Anti-topo I reactivity was more frequent than anti-RNAP I-III in our patients with SRC and was associated with delayed onset and high mortality rates.",M2
19441748,"[Use of autoantibodies in clinical practice]Autoantibodies are frequently determined in unclear clinical situations and in the context of an inflammatory syndrome. The aim of this article is not to review all autoantibodies in details, but to discuss those used in clinical practice by describing their methods of detection and interpretation. Thus we will focus on antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), which are typically associated with connective tissue diseases, as well as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which are useful in the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitides. Due to its high sensitivity indirect immunofluorescence is used as a screening test; when positive, ELISA is performed to search for antibodies more specifically associated with certain auto-immune diseases.",M2
19411782,"[Clinical significance of dense fine speckled pattern in anti-nuclear antibody test using indirect immunofluorescence method]BACKGROUND: Dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern in antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) test using indirect immunofluorescence method became to be known recently and it is detected in patients with various chronic inflammatory diseases as well as in healthy individuals. We investigated the relation between DFS pattern and various diseases. METHODS: ANA tests by indirect immunofluorescence method using HEp-2 cell line slide (Kallestad; Bio-Rad, USA) were performed in 2,654 patients for screening of systemic autoimmune diseases. The frequencies of ANA and DFS positivity were analyzed according to sex, age, clinical department and disease. RESULTS: ANA was positive in 13.3% (352/2,654) of the total patients, and the frequency of DFS pattern was observed in 3.8% (101/2,654) of the total patients and in 28.7% (101/352) of the patients with ANA positivity. Higher frequency of DFS positivity was observed in patients referred from Departments of Rheumatology and Nephrology, but there was no difference in the frequencies of DFS positivity among the patients with ANA positivity. The frequency of DFS pattern was higher in seborrheic dermatitis (14.3%), herpes zoster (11.1%), rheumatoid arthritis (16.9%), systemic lupus erythematosus (15.4%) and Sjogren syndrome (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The DFS pattern is a frequent finding (about 28% of ANA positivity) in ANA test using indirect immunofluorescence method. Relatively high frequency of DFS pattern was observed in autoimmune diseases, contrary to the previous observations that DFS pattern is not related with autoimmune diseases. Further studies including the confirmation tests of anti-DFS70 are needed for the identification of relation between DFS pattern and particular diseases.",M2
19411229,"[Autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis: clinical interest and diagnosis approach]PURPOS: This review describes different autoantibodies that are associated to systemic sclerosis disease, in presenting their interest for the diagnosis and prognosis, and suggests an immunologic diagnosis approach. The systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by variant specific autoantibodies (autoAbs). More than 90% of SSc cases have antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>). Anti-centromere and anti-Th/To antibodies are often associated to the limited SSc and to the CREST syndrome. The anti-topo-isomerase I, anti-RNA polymerases and anti-fibrillarin/U3-RNP Abs are diffuse SSc markers with several organ involvements. The anti-PM/Scl and anti-U1-RNP Abs rather mark overlap shapes with polymyositis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. The anti-Ku, anti-B23 and anti-NOR90 Abs are a new generation of less frequent autoAbs that show a relationship with specific subsets of SSc. Another heterogeneous group of Abs, topic of research, is described in SSc as well as anti-fibrillin 1, anti-endothelial cells, anti-annexin V and anti-collagen Abs. Despite the diagnosis of scleroderma is mainly clinical, these different autoAbs constitute a diagnosis and prognosis tools by defining immuno-clinical substes of the disease. Identifying those autoAbs requires a diagnostic strategy with two steps: the indirect immunofluorescence remains the better means of ANA tracking, leading thereafter to other identification specific methods, such immunoprecipitation, ELISA or immunoblotting.",M2
19390908,"Undifferentiated connective tissue disease: a seven-center cross-sectional study of 184 patients.The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical and serological features of a large cohort of patients with antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) positive undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). Consecutive patients with UCTD, followed up at the Rheumatology Clinic of the participating centers, were included. Data from these patients were obtained by clinical evaluation and chart review. All patients were diagnosed as having UCTD on basis of the following criteria: positive ANA plus at least one clinical feature of connective tissue disease, but not fulfilling classification criteria for any differentiated connective tissue disease. One hundred eighty-four patients were studied (female patients-94.5%; mean age at time of evaluation-47 years). The most prevalent manifestations were arthralgia (66%), arthritis (32%), Raynaud's phenomenon (30%), sicca symptoms (30%), and leukopenia (19%). The prevalence of ANA was 100%, anti-SSA 20%, anti-dsDNA 14%, and anti-SSB 7%. Patients with anti-dsDNA/anti-Sm, anticentromere/anti-Scl70, or anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies more frequently presented a set of manifestations close to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, or Sjögren syndrome, respectively. We analyze a large cohort of UCTD. Seventy-two percent of these UCTD patients present lupus-, scleroderma-, or Sjögren-like features but do not fulfill classification criteria and mostly present a mild disease.",M2
19382301,"Antinuclear antibody positivity in patients with chronic hepatitis C: clinically relevant or an epiphenomenon?BACKGROUND: Serum autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) are frequently detected in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but its relevance is a matter of discussion. AIM: To assess the association of ANA positivity with clinical and histological features, and with the outcome of antiviral therapy in patients with HCV infection. METHODS: Baseline samples from patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon and ribavirin were tested for ANA positivity by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.3+/-11.1 years and 56% were men. Among 234 included patients, 22 patients (9.4%) were positive for ANA. These patients showed significantly higher median alanine aminotransferase level (3.52 vs. 2.39 x upper limit of normal, P=0.009) when compared with ANA-negative patients. Fibrosis stage and necroinflammatory grading were not influenced by ANA positivity. Sustained virological response (SVR) rates were similar between ANA-positive and ANA-negative patients (27 vs. 29%, P=0.882). Alanine aminotransferase flares (&gt; or =1.5-fold the baseline) during treatment were observed in 28 patients (12%), irrespective of the presence of ANA and without any clinical significance. CONCLUSION: Among HCV patients, ANA positivity seems to represent an immunological epiphenomenon. It neither influences clinical, biochemical, and histological features of chronic hepatitis C nor predicts response to antiviral treatment.",M2
19369460,"Systemic autoimmune diseases in patients with hepatitis C virus infection: characterization of 1020 cases (The HISPAMEC Registry).OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and immunologic characteristics of a large series of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: The HISPAMEC Registry is a multicenter international study group dedicated to collecting data on patients diagnosed with SAD with serological evidence of chronic HCV infection. The information sources are cases reported by physicians of the HISPAMEC Study Group and periodic surveillance of reported cases by a Medline search updated up to December 31, 2007. RESULTS: One thousand twenty HCV patients with SAD were included in the registry. Patients were reported from Southern Europe (60%), North America (15%), Asia (14%), Northern Europe (9%), South America (1%), and Australia (1%). Countries reporting the most cases were Spain (236 cases), France (222 cases), Italy (144 cases), USA (120 cases), and Japan (95 cases). The most frequently reported SAD were Sjögren's syndrome (SS; 483 cases), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 150 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 129 cases), polyarteritis nodosa (78 cases), antiphospholipid syndrome (59 cases), inflammatory myopathies (39 cases), and sarcoidosis (28 cases). Twenty patients had 2 or more SAD. Epidemiological data were available in 677 cases. Four hundred eighty-seven (72%) patients were female and 186 (28%) male, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 1.0 years at SAD diagnosis and 50.5 +/- 1.1 years at diagnosis of HCV infection. The main immunologic features were antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) in 61% of patients, rheumatoid factor (RF) in 57%, hypocomplementemia in 52%, and cryoglobulins in 52%. The main differential aspect between primary and HCV-related SAD was the predominance of cryoglobulinemic-related markers (cryoglobulins, RF, hypocomplementemia) over specific SAD-related markers (anti-ENA antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) in patients with HCV. CONCLUSION: In the selected cohort, the SAD most commonly reported in association with chronic HCV infection were SS (nearly half the cases), RA and SLE. Nearly two thirds of SAD-HCV cases were reported from the Mediterranean area. In these patients, ANA, RF and cryoglobulins are the predominant immunological features.",M2
19333200,"Prevalence of antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies in children with epilepsy.BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis or arterial occlusive events and fetal losses associated with elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). MATERIAL/METHODS: The presence of antinuclear, anti-beta2-glycoprotein I, and anticardiolipin antibodies were investigated in 60 consecutive children with epilepsy who were followed up in a single Hungarian center. RESULTS: Almost 50% (28/60) of the patients were <e>ANA</e> positive. Twelve (20%) patients had moderate titer (1:160) of ANA. Anti-C1q antibody was positive in 4 cases, all of them symptom free considering renal manifestation of lupus. Interestingly, only 1 child had aCL antibody, while 6/43 patients were LAC positive. Five were also ANA positive among the LAC positive patients (4 children with moderate titer). Anti-beta2GPI antibody positivity was not detected in this cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical relevance of aPL tests in childhood are difficult to explain. In the present study, obviously lower total prevalence of aPLs (aCL and anti-beta2GPI) was observed in children with epilepsy than in previously reported investigations (20-30%). The higher amount of LAC-positive patients indicates that coagulation studies (LAC) should be included in the neuroimmunological assessment of suspected APS patients with epileptic disorders. The difference between the results of serological and LAC studies could be explained by the possible positivity of other, uninvestigated antibodies. The wide spectrum of detected immunological alterations highlight the importance of the participation of pediatric rheumatologists in the management of patients with idiopathic epilepsy or with secondary induced autoimmune disease due to antiepileptic medications.",M2
19332626,"Autoantibody and biopsy grading are associated with expression of ICAM-1, MMP-3, and TRAIL in salivary gland mononuclear cells of Chinese patients with Sjogren's syndrome.OBJECTIVE: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease. We investigated important factors associated with the expression of inflammation-related molecules in minor salivary gland (MSG) mononuclear cells in patients with SS. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with SS with a MSG biopsy grading of either grade III (10 patients) or grade IV (24 patients) were enrolled. The age, sex, autoantibodies, cell infiltration, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), or CXCR3 expression were also analyzed. RESULTS: Ten of the 34 patients with SS were diagnosed with secondary SS; in these patients, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was confirmed in 8 and systemic lupus erythematosus in 2. TRAIL and ICAM-1 were overexpressed in patients with antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) &gt; 1:160, compared to those with titer &lt; 1:160 (45.1 +/- 4.4 vs 41.2 +/- 3.9, p = 0.021, and 15.2 +/- 5.7 vs 10.8 +/- 3.3, p = 0.018, respectively). Higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; &gt;OR= 20) was associated with higher TRAIL expression and CD20 cell infiltration in contrast to lower ESR (&lt; 20; p &lt; 0.05). ICAM-1, TRAIL, and MMP-3 were expressed more predominantly in anti-SSA-positive than in anti-SSA-negative patients with SS. There was a significant difference in CD20 cell infiltration and MMP-3 expression between primary SS and secondary SS. Biopsy of a grade IV showed a significantly increased expression of TRAIL (44.9 +/- 4.5 vs 40.8 +/- 3.6, p = 0.013) and MMP-3 (62.7 +/- 6.3 vs 54.4 +/- 7.3, p = 0.003) in mononuclear cells as compared to those of grade III. CONCLUSION: In our study, pathologic grading with a higher grade (grade IV) and the presence of SSA or a higher titer of ANA were significantly associated with the overexpression of TRAIL, MMP-3, or ICAM-1 in the salivary gland mononuclear cells in patients with SS.",M2
19331658,"A possible systemic rheumatic disorder in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever.BACKGROUND: A disease complex with chronic musculoskeletal signs, including stiffness and joint pain, and to which there is a strong predisposition in the canine breed Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever (Toller) has been recognized in Sweden. The aim of this first clinical description of the disorder in Tollers was to describe the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, as well as to try to identify a possible immune-mediated background of the disease and to show the outcome of treatment in 33 Tollers. METHODS: The study included 33 Tollers with musculoskeletal signs and 20 healthy controls. All the dogs were thoroughly examined and followed for a period of 2 months - 4 years. An IIF-<e>ANA</e> (antinuclear antibody) test and an assay for the presence of antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were performed, as well as some haematology, serum biochemistry and urine tests. Routine radiographic examinations were performed on 11 dogs. RESULTS: All the Toller patients showed stiffness and lameness that had lasted for at least 14 days and displayed pain from several joints of extremities on manipulation. Twenty-seven per cent of the dogs also showed muscle pain and 18% different skin symptoms. Seventy per cent of the Tollers with signs of disease displayed a positive IIF-ANA test. Most of the dogs were treated with corticosteroids, with the majority of the dogs (65%) showing good responses. There was no association between the IIF-ANA results and the clinical signs or results of treatment. CONCLUSION: This paper describes a disorder in Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers where the clinical signs, ANA reactivity and response to corticosteroids strongly suggest that the disorder is immune-mediated. The findings of this research may indicate a chronic systemic rheumatic disorder.",M2

Cysteamine was considered the most likely cause. Antinuclear (<e>ANA</e>) and antihistone antibodies disappeared after stopping cysteamine. ANA became positive after reintroduction of cysteamine. The patient's post-transplant course was complicated by severe thrombosis, with histological findings in her native nephrectomy consistent with APS. This is the first reported case of DIL and APS secondary to cysteamine therapy. Clinicians should exclude autoimmune abnormalities in patients with cystinosis, especially if patients report non-specific, unusual or unexplained symptoms.",M2
19318393,"Induction of autoimmunity in Brown Norway rats by oral and parenteral administration of sodium silicate.Silica and silicate may disturb immune function such as autoimmunity and tumour immunity. The main objective of this study was to examine the relation between sodium silicate and induction of autoimmunity in genetically susceptible rats. In this study, thirty Brown Norway rats were randomised into four treatment groups, the first and second group receiving 3 mg of sodium silicate (NaSiO(4)) (equivalent to 2 mg silica) in 0.2 mL of normal saline either per oral or subcutaneously, and the third and fourth group (control) receiving 0.2 mL of normal saline (0.9%) through the same corresponding route. A significant number of rats (80%) (P &lt; 0.05) which received sodium silicate by the subcutaneous route showed a high level of serum <e>ANA</e> compared with controls. In the oral, sodium silicate group showed high serum ANA in an insignificant number of rats. Other autoantibodies in both groups (anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-SSA, anti-SSB) showed gradual increased post exposure, but the numbers of rats with positive titres post exposure was statistically not significant. Silica exposure in rats appears to induce the development of autoimmunity. A longer duration post exposure to silicate seems to be associated with greater risks.",M2
19304528,"[Comparison of indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA for detecting antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies]OBJECTIVE: To compare indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA). METHODS: A total of 125 serum samples were obtained from patients with established or suspected autoimmune disease, and 82 samples were used for ANA detection and 57 for anti-dsDNA detection using both IIFA and ELISA. Fourteen samples were examined for both ANA and anti-dsDNA. In cases where discrepancy occurred in the results by the two methods, extractable nuclear antigens were detected using immunoblotting. RESULTS: The positivity rate of ANA detected by IIFA and ELISA was significantly different (87.8% and 73.17%, respectively, P&lt;0.01), but the positivity rate of anti-dsDNA was similar between IIFA and ELISA (77.19% and 71.93%, respectively, P&gt;0.05). The percent agreement between the two testing methods with different cutoff values of ANA and anti-dsDNA showed significant differences (P&lt;0.01), and for some uncommon patterns, the percent agreement of the two methods was lowered in ANA detection but remained unchanged for anti-dsDNA with different ANA patterns. High percent agreements of the two methods were obtained with the cutoff ANA titer of 1:100 and the cutoff anti-dsDNA value of weak positivity, but they demonstrated a significant difference in testing low-titer ANA and anti-dsDNA. CONCLUSION: IIFA is more sensitive than ELISA in detecting the total ANA and anti-dsDNA. ELISA prescreening combined with IIFA can obtain the information of the nuclear pattern and allow the observation of the titer alterations. The combination of two or more testing methods can greatly enhance the accuracy of the results.",M2
19302340,"Autoantibodies in chronic hepatitis C virus infection and their association with disease profile.Autoantibodies are commonly detected in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) but their significance remains uncertain. We assessed the prevalence of anti-nuclear (<e>ANA</e>) and anti-smooth muscle (ASM) antibodies within a cohort of 963 treatment-naïve HCV patients. We also assessed for differences between autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients in demographics, markers of disease activity and response to anti-viral treatment. One hundred and seventy-two patients (17.9%) had at least one autoantibody, of which were 104 (10.8%) ASM, 54 (5.6%) ANA and 14 (1.5%) positive for both. Autoantibody-positive patients were older (43 vs 39 years, P = 0.001) caused by an age-related increase in ANA (but not ASM). There were no differences in gender, alcohol intake, ethnicity or viral genotype. The presence of autoantibodies, and specifically ASM, was associated with an increase in interface hepatitis score amongst men (1.1 vs 0.8, P = 0.005) but no difference in other necroinflammatory measures, liver function tests or immunoglobulins (Ig). There was no difference in initial fibrosis stage or rate of fibrosis progression. Autoantibodies did not affect response to anti-viral treatment. We conclude that autoantibodies are frequent in HCV infection. Anti-nuclear antibodies increase with age, whereas ASM antibodies are associated with interface hepatitis in men. Neither autoantibody carries increased risk of fibrosis progression or failure of therapy.",M2

To evaluate frequency and clinical significance of MND and RL/M in PBC patients when investigated at the level of immunoglobulin G isotypes. MND and RL/M pattern have been tested in 141 PBC sera and 230 pathological controls using HEp-2 cells as substrate and anti- total IgG and individual IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) as specific antisera. One hundred and fourteen of 141 (80%) PBC patients had RL/M or MND pattern when IgG subclasses were used as revealing reagents (vs. 34% when anti total IgG were used, p &lt; 0.0001). The prevalent isotype was IgG1 for RL/M, and IgG2 for MND pattern. None of controls was positive. No clinical differences in terms of severity and outcome of disease have been observed in PBC patients positive for MND and RL/M when investigated with IgG isotypes. The research for RL/M and MND pattern at level of IgG isotype determines a wide gain in terms of sensitivity without a loss of specificity. In Italian PBC patients MND and RL/M pattern did not seem to characterize any subgroup of patients with a poorer prognosis.",M2
19298776,"Prevalence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies in patients with pemphigus vulgaris.BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially life-threatening, organ-specific, autoimmune, blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes. Although several reports suggest an association between pemphigus and other autoimmune connective tissue disorders, studies that measure non-organ-specific autoantibodies are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) in PV patients. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 59 PV patients and 50 healthy controls. Indirect immunofluorescence assays containing human epithelial cell substrates (HEp-2) and Crithidia luciliae were used to detect ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies, respectively. A multiplexed addressable laser bead immunoassay was employed to measure autoantibodies to: Smith (Sm), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), Sjögren syndrome B (SSB/La), Sjögren syndrome A (SSA/Ro), histidyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase (Jo-1), topoisomerase I (Scl-70), and ribosome-P (Ribo-P) antigens. RESULTS: Positive ANAs were obtained in 22 of 59 (37.3%) PV patients compared with 4 of 50 (8.0%) healthy controls (p &lt;or= .01). In both the patient and control populations, anti-dsDNA antibodies were absent. Antibodies against the ENAs were present in 1 of 59 (1.7%) PV patients compared with 0 of 50 (0%) controls. In the single ENA-positive PV patient, antibodies to SSB/La (1.7%) and SSA/Ro (1.7%) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Non-organ-specific autoantibodies are prevalent in the PV population. As ANAs are detected in over one-third of PV patients, clinicians should screen for signs and symptoms of other connective tissue disease. Correlative clinical studies are warranted to determine the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance of these findings.",M2

One hundred asthmatic patients were observed for one year evolution with death, severe exacerbations, intake of &gt; 1000 micrograms of beclometasone or equivalent (high ICS) and FEV1 decline &gt;100 ml, in relation with <e>ANA</e> (ELISA), sputum and blood eosinophilia (EO), NSAID intolerance, BMI &gt;25, chronic rhinosinusitis, smoking status and FEV1 &lt;30% predicted (low FEV1). After 1 year of observation, there were 5 deaths, 28 severe asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalisations, 24 cases requiring high inhaled corticosteroid intake, and 19 patients with fast FEV1 decline (&gt;100 ml/year). Multiple regression analysis pointed out several different independent risk factors for severe asthma evolution: for death presence of ANA (P=0.037), NSAID intolerance (P&lt;0.001) and low FEV1 (P=0.021); for evolution with severe exacerbations ANA (p=0.011), sputum EO (P&lt;0.001), smoking (P=0.044) and NSAID intolerance (P=0.022); for high ICS intake ANA (P=0.036), sputum EO (P=0.026) and low FEV1 (P=0.006); for FEV1 decline &gt;100 ml ANA (P=0.006), sputum EO (P=0.037), BMI&gt;25 (P=0.046) and NSAID intolerance (P=0.017).

19278370,"Anti DNA antibodies are not restricted to a specific pattern of fluorescence on HEp2 cells.BACKGROUND: Antinuclear autoantibody determination relies on an initial screening step using immunofluorescence on HEp2 cells. This may be followed by anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) determination, if the fluorescence of nuclei is homogeneous. We assessed the validity of a restricted algorithm and compared this to a more comprehensive algorithm that accepted any nuclear pattern as a positive indicator. METHODS: Our retrospective study analyzed routine results for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and their anti-DNA identification [double stranded nuclear DNA (ds-DNA), membrane associated DNA (mDNA), nucleosomes] for 58 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (690 sera). We included 158 patients with systemic or organ-specific autoimmune diseases (888 sera), 44 with viral disease (88 sera), 34 cancer patients (89 sera) and 111 patients with inflammation that served as controls (122 sera) for a total of 1187 samples. RESULTS: 1) Anti DNA antibodies are not associated only with a homogeneous pattern, but can also be seen with a speckled or nucleolar pattern. 2) The observed pattern is typical for a particular patient rather than for a specific pathology. 3) A homogeneous pattern does not necessarily indicate SLE, nor does the presence of circulating anti DNA antibodies. 4) Determination of various specificities of anti DNA antibodies, whatever the immunofluorescent pattern, increases the sensitivity and specificity for SLE. CONCLUSIONS: If diagnosis is based exclusively on a homogenous pattern, preselection would have missed identification of SLE as high levels of anti DNA antibodies were also associated with speckled or nucleolar pattern.",M2
19270487,"An antinuclear antibody-negative patient with lupus nephritis.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a typical autoimmune disease that's characterized by various autoantibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. The presence of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) in serum is generally considered a decisive diagnostic sign of SLE. However, a small subset of SLE patients who had the typical clinical features of SLE was reported to show persistently negative ANA tests. Our report describes a 16-yr-old female who presented with the clinical manifestations of SLE such as malar rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, lymphopenia, pericarditis and proteinuria. The serum autoantibodies were all negative and renal biopsy showed that the histopathological changes of immune complex mediated the focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation. She was treated with monthly pulse cyclophosphamide along with corticosteroids. During the 2-yr follow-up period, the proteinuria was markedly decreased and all of the ANA and anti-double stranded DNA antibody tests were negative. This case suggests that ANA may not be required in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.",M2
19266202,"Characteristics of interstitial lung disease in SS-A positive/Jo-1 positive inflammatory myopathy patients.The strongest predictive factor for the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in myositis (IIM) patients is the presence of different antisynthetase antibodies. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, radiological findings and therapeutic response between the anti-SS-A positive and negative antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) patients. A prospective study of 315 IIM patients was conducted including 27 anti-Jo-1 positive ASS patients. Mean disease duration was 46.6 (range 4-198) months. All patients fulfilled the classification criteria for IIM. All patients underwent chest radiography, pulmonary function tests and HRCT at he time of diagnosis and 6 months after the immunosuppressive therapy. Routine laboratory tests, RF, <e>ANA</e>, anti-ENA, anti-SS-A, anti-histidyl-transfer RNA antibody (Jo-1) measurements were performed in all patients. ILD was found to be present in 70.4% of ASS patients. The anti-SS-A negative ASS group had a more frequent association with alveolitis and responded well to immunosuppressive therapy (p &lt; 0.05). HRCT scan showed more fibrosis in the SS-A positive group. 15.8% of patients died due to pulmonary or cardiac complications. In conclusion, coexistence of anti-SS-A and anti-Jo-1 antibody may be a good predictor for a more coarse and severe ILD in IIM patients who require a more aggressive approach in therapy.",M2
19227188,"[Nationwide survey for autoantibodies and proposal of a new method for standardization of rheumatoid factors]There exist inter-laboratory differences in measurements of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), leading to a misdiagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other collagen diseases. This study was carried out to bring the positivity of RF and ANA of different reagents into accord by standardizing their data. The titer and cutoff value was inconsistent among the 17 different kits. We found a possibility in standardization of RF by a new concept in cooperation with Japanese Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (JCCLS). Sera from 1300 healthy subjects and 79 RA patients were measured for RF by 17 different RF kits, and sera with a little deviation among the kits were selected. Panels for detection of RF positive rate in healthy subjects were made from the pooled sera. The cutoff value in 5% positive in the panel was defined tentatively as 15 IU/ml. The 100 IU/ml was also able to become in general accord by adjusting the individual data using pooled RF-positive reference sera. The nationwide survey of immunofluorescence ANA (IF-ANA) was performed in 41 laboratories using 6 pooled sera. The reported titer was fairly different among laboratories, and a striking discrepancy was found for low-titer samples. When the titer was corrected by simultaneously measured reference serum, inconsistency of ANA titer among different laboratories was mostly compensated. Here, we propose a new method for standardization of RF and also try to standardize the positivity of RF and IF-ANA by providing pooled reference sera.",M2
19208451,"Prospective cohort study of effects of infliximab on rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and antinuclear antibodies in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) are well-established serological markers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Lupus-like disease with antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) has been reported during TNFalpha antagonist therapy. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of infliximab therapy on these three autoantibodies in patients with established RA and to look for correlations linking IgM-RF and anti-CCP titres to a treatment response (defined as a good or moderate EULAR response) after 48 weeks of infliximab therapy. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with long-standing RA not responding to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) received intravenous infliximab (starting dose: 3mg/kg) at 0, 2, and 6 weeks then at 8-week intervals, in combination with a DMARD. At baseline, week 24, and week 48, C-reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined and the disease activity score (DAS28) was calculated. Serum samples collected at the same time points were used to measure anti-CCP (commercial second-generation ELISA), IgM-RF (quantitative nephelometric assay), and ANA (indirect immunofluorescence in HEp2 cells). Correlations linking baseline autoantibody titres to changes in autoantibody levels were examined. RESULTS: At baseline, tests were positive for anti-CCP in 31/36 (94.6%) patients, IgM-RF in 29/36 (80.5%) patients, and ANA in 16/36 (44%) patients. IgM-RF titres decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001), whereas anti-CCP showed little change (p=0.053). ANA titres increased significantly (p&lt;0.001). The treatment response was not associated with changes in anti-CCP or IgM-RF titres during infliximab therapy (OR for a response in patients with a 50% anti-CCP decrease, 0.77 [95%CI, 0.16-3.58]; OR for a response in patients with a 50% IgM-RF decrease, 0.82 [95%CI, 0.16-4.13]). CONCLUSIONS: During infliximab therapy used to treat established RA, IgM-RF titres showed larger decreases than anti-CCP titres. Changes in IgM-RF and anti-CCP failed to correlate with the 48-week treatment response.",M2
19187609,"Prevalence of antinuclear and anti-liver-kidney-microsome type-1 antibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis C in China.BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may induce autoimmune response and autoantibodies can be detected in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. However, the reported positive rate of autoantibodies in CHC patients in China varies considerably. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) and anti-liver-kidney-microsome type 1 autoantibodies (anti-LKM-1) in a large cohort of CHC patients, and analyzed the factors related to the presence of the autoantibodies. METHODS: A total of 360 CHC patients were enrolled in this study. Serum ANA and anti-LKM-1 were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Clinical analysis was performed to disclose the related factors to autoantibody production. RESULTS: The prevalence of ANA and anti-LKM-1 in CHC patients was 12.5% (45/360) and 2.5% (9/360), respectively. Women had a higher prevalence than men (18.9% vs 11.4%, P = 0.046). Patients with positive autoantibodies had lower HCV RNA levels (1.2 x 10(7) copies/L vs 7.2 x 10(7) copies/L, P &lt; 0.05). Positive ANA was associated with higher serum globulin (P &lt; 0.05). Stratified analysis showed that there were no significant differences in age, HCV genotype, disease course, clinical stage, prevalence of cirrhosis and interferon therapy between autoantibody-positive and -negative subgroups. CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies can be induced in the course of CHC, and some CHC patients can even develop autoimmune hepatitis.",M2
19171521,"Aggregation of classifiers for staining pattern recognition in antinuclear autoantibodies analysis.Indirect immunofluorescence is currently the recommended method for the detection of antinuclear autoantibodies (<e>ANA</e>). The diagnosis consists of both estimating the fluorescence intensity and reporting the staining pattern for positive wells only. Since resources and adequately trained personnel are not always available for these tasks, an evident medical demand is the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools that can support the physician decisions. In this paper, we present a system that classifies the staining pattern of positive wells on the strength of the recognition of their cells. The core of the CAD is a multiple expert system (MES) based on the one-per-class approach devised to label the pattern of single cells. It employs a hybrid approach since each composing binary module is constituted by an ensemble of classifiers combined by a fusion rule. Each expert uses a set of stable and effective features selected from a wide pool of statistical and spectral measurements. In this framework, we present a novel parameter that measures the reliability of the final classification provided by the MES. This feature is used to introduce a reject option that allows to reduce the error rate in the recognition of the staining pattern of the whole well. The approach has been evaluated on 37 wells, for a total of 573 cells. The measured performance shows a low overall error rate ( 2.7%-5.8%), which is below the observed intralaboratory variability.",M2
19160386,"Utility of anti-HSP 70, TNF-alpha, ESR, antinuclear antibody, and antiphospholipid antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the performance of various laboratory tests used for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. METHODS: Thirty patients who presented with SSNHL and 30 healthy people with no cochleovestibular disorders were selected as study and control groups. The laboratory panel includes the following tests: anti-HSP 70 antibody immunoassay, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), and antiphospholipid antibodies. The study group was given corticosteroid therapy and separated into two groups: the corticosteroid responders and the corticosteroid nonresponders. In the follow-up, repeat audiograms were evaluated to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: TNF-alpha was found at lower titers in the study group when compared with the control group in contrast to other studies. Also, anti-HSP 70 was not found in high titers in the study group. ANA and ESR were the two parameters that were significantly more positive in the study group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the lack of association between a positive test and response to corticosteroid treatment, detection of the anti-HSP 70 antibody, TNF-alpha, ESR, and ANA, at present, do not offer clinically useful information in the treatment of SSNHL. Also, because of the lower titers of TNF-alpha documented in patients with SSNHL, we do not recommend the use of specific TNF-alpha inhibitors in SSNHL.",M2
19127458,"Increased percentages of autoantibodies in immunoglobulin A-deficient children do not correlate with clinical manifestations.IgA deficiency (IgAD) is frequently associated with autoimmune phenomena. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of 22 different autoantibodies in 60 patients with IgAD and to examine the physical and other laboratory findings of the suspected cases for autoimmune diseases. The evaluated autoantibodies were Anti-nuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) profile (autoantibodies against RNP/Sm, SS-A, Ro-52, SS-B, Scl-70, Pm-Scl, Jo-1, centromere B, PCNA, dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribozomal P-protein, AMA-M2), anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-T) and anti-thyroid microsomal antigen (anti-M) and direct cooms test. Forty-one healthy children were included as a control group. ANA titers &lt; or = 1:80 were accepted as normal and titers &gt; or = 1:80 are accepted as positive. In ANA screening, 14 patients showed positivity in different titres. Seven of them were equal to or below 1:80. The other seven patients (11.6%) had positive ANA titers (&gt;1:160) whereas three of them had anti-dsDNA, anti-histon and anti-centromer antibodies. These patients did not have any clinical and laboratory signs of autoimmune diseases. ANA positivity was found higher in IgA deficient children (p &lt; 0.05) compared to controls. RF and pANCA were found positive during follow-up of two different selective IgAD patients. IgG and IgM antibodies against cardiolipin, direct coombs, anti-T and anti-M tests were not found positive in any subjects. In conclusion, increased frequency of autoantibodies in IgAD patients may often be observed. However, the detection of autoantibodies do not show or predict whether this patient will develop an autoimmune disease.",M2
20380108,"ELISA subtypization of anti-ENA autoantibodies in clinical management of autoimmune diseases in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The basis of autoimmune diseases such as SLE (Systemic Lupus Eritematodes), Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymiositis is the creation of auto-antibodies to the following specific extractable nuclear antigens (ENA):Jo-1, Ssl-70, SS-A, SS-B, Sm and Sm/RNPs. Some of these antigens are in fact enzymes (Jo-1-histidil-tRNA synthetase, Scl-70-topoisomerase) which are inhibited by specific autoantibodies--this leads to disturbance in the metabolism of DNA and protein biosynthesis. During 2009, we analyzed total of 87 serum samples of patients suspected for autoimmune disorder using <e>ANA</e>-IFA and ELISA-ENA-6 methods. After establishing IFA-ANA positivity (83.9%), all serum specimens; ANA positive and negative, were subtypized by ELISA ENA-6 test. Analysis showed the highest incidence of anti-SS-A (56%), and incidence of anti-SS-B (29.8%), anti-Sm/ RNP (11.5%), anti-Jo-1 (2.3%) and anti-Scl-70 (1,1%) auto-antibodies. Also, 78.5% of IFA-ANA negative serum specimens showed high level of positivity (212.50 and 277.0 IU/ml) to SS-A (78.5%) and SS-B (21.4%) antigenes using ELISA-ENA-6 subtypization. Following these results, we conclude that it is necessary to introduce Western blot confirmation testing. After comparing with other clinical findings, we diagnosed the following autoimmune diseases: SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and dermatomiosytis.",M2
19107779,"Antinuclear antibodies: a marker associated with steroid dependence in patients with ulcerative colitis.BACKGROUND: The autoimmune phenomena and the autoantibody profile have acquired great importance in ulcerative colitis (UC). Few studies have explored antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANAs</e>) prevalence, but not its association with steroid dependence. We hypothesized that ANAs could be a factor associated to steroid dependence. METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients with UC were included. ANA titers and staining patterns were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Gender, age, follow-up time, C-reactive protein (CRP), disease extent, Mayo Score Activity Index, extraintestinal manifestations, and steroid dependence were analyzed in univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included and 49 (50.5%) were females; mean age was 41.7 +/- 22.2 years. Positivity for ANAs was encountered in 52 (53.5%) patients, and none for anti-dsDNA. The prevalence of ANAs was higher in steroid-dependent than in nonsteroid-dependent patients (77.8% versus 48.1%, P = 0.020; odds ratio [OR] = 3.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-12.5), and in those with uveitis (100% versus 51.1%; P = 0.040) or pyoderma gangrenosum (100% versus 51.6%; P = 0.078). No association was observed with gender, age, CRP, disease extent, and Mayo Score Activity Index. The multiple regression analysis model showed an association between steroid dependence and ANAs (P = 0.033, OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-14.9). CONCLUSIONS: ANAs are associated with steroid dependence in UC patients. Further studies are required to determine the role of ANAs as serological markers for prediction of steroid dependence in order to perform early therapeutic interventions with biological agents.",M2
19072028,"Current practices in antinuclear antibody testing: results from the Belgian External Quality Assessment Scheme.BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the state-of-the-art of antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) testing as practiced in the Belgian and Luxembourg laboratories, using the results obtained in the Belgian National External Quality Assessment Scheme from 2000 to 2005. METHODS: During this period, nine samples with different specificities were sent for analysis. Participants were surveyed for methodology used and were asked to report staining pattern and titer of ANAs. In 2002, an attempt was made to improve the comparability of quantitative ANA results by the provision of a commercial reference material and to relate observed differences to methodology. RESULTS: With one exception, all participants employed a microscope-based indirect immunofluorescence assay with human epithelial cell line 2 cells. Most laboratories were accurate in describing the pattern. The percentage of unacceptable answers was greater for samples with borderline levels of antibody and for samples showing a cytoplasmic pattern. An improvement in the detection of anticentromere antibodies was observed. For all samples, a wide range of titers was reported. The provision of the secondary reference preparation led to improved inter-laboratory concordance. Comparison of methodology variables revealed a correlation between unstandardized titers and the power of the lamp of the microscope and the use of a dark room. CONCLUSIONS: The EQAS results presented in this work provide valuable insights into the state of the art of ANA testing as practiced in the Belgian and Luxembourg Laboratories and illustrate the important value of a national EQAS for ANA testing as a tool to improve performance and interlaboratory comparability of laboratory results.",M2
19040522,"Clinicopathological evaluation of in vivo epidermal nuclear fluorescence.BACKGROUND: Nuclear fluorescence in keratinocytes is an occasional phenomenon, often present in autoimmune diseases, especially in connective-tissue disease (CTD); however, its clinical significance remains unclear. AIM: To investigate the profile of patients with positive nuclear staining on direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of skin samples. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 28 patient records from our immunodermatology laboratory was performed between May 2003 and June 2006. Inclusion criteria were the presence of autoantibodies (IgG, IgA or IgM) or complement (C3) binding keratinocyte nuclei on DIF. RESULTS: The most prevalent diseases related to the nuclear keratinocyte DIF staining were systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 9), mixed CTD (n = 3), overlap syndrome (n = 3), Sjögren's syndrome (n = 1), and CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia) syndrome (n = 1). Serum antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) was positive in 20 of 28 patients, with titres varying from 1 : 160 to 1 : 1280. Of the 20 patients with positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), 17 were positive for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, 12 had anti-SSA/Ro, 11 had anti-SSB/La and 8 had anti-ribonucleoprotein. Eight patients were negative for ANA. Positive predictive value of in vivo ANA for systemic CTDs was 75%. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that in vivo ANA evaluation is an additional and feasible auxiliary tool for diagnosing CTDs.",M2
18942022,"IgA rheumatoid factor in primary Sjogren's syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To assess the serum level of immunoglobulin A rheumatoid factor (IgA-RF) in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and study the association with immunological and clinical factors. METHODS: Sera from 97 pSS patients diagnosed according to the preliminary European criteria and 100 controls were analysed for IgA-RF in a cross-sectional study design. RESULTS: IgA-RF was detected in serum of 25.8% of the pSS patients and in 1% of the controls. In patients with positive vs. negative IgA-RF, the focus scores in biopsy of the minor salivary glands were 4.41 and 1.43 (p&lt;0.0001), respectively. There was a correlation between positive IgA-RF and positive antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) (r = 0.263, p&lt;0.009), IgM-RF (r = 0.70, p&lt;0.0001), anti-SSA/SSB (r = 0.73, p&lt;0.0001), and a high serum level of IgG (r = 0.59, p&lt;0.0001). The presence of renal disease was higher in IgA-RF-positive vs. negative pSS patients (20.0% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.047). The serum level of the hormone prolactin (PRL) correlated to the serum level of IgA-RF (r = 0.31, p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IgA-RF in patients with pSS is closely associated with the presence of autoantibodies, and with focus scoring in biopsies of the salivary glands. IgA-RF is associated with renal disease in pSS but we found no correlation to other extraglandular manifestations.",M2

METHODS: Clinical and serological data of 56 patients with juvenile-onset SLE were compared with data of 194 patients with adult-onset SLE. ANA were determined by line immunoassay and by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae. RESULTS: Renal involvement, encephalopathy and haemolytic anaemia were seen, and anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P and antihistone antibodies found, significantly more often in juvenile-onset SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were directly associated, and anti-ribosomal P antibodies inversely associated, with renal involvement in juvenile-onset SLE. In juvenile patients with SLE and anti-dsDNA and without anti-ribosomal P antibodies the odds ratio for glomerulonephritis was 9.00; no patients with anti-ribosomal P but without anti-dsDNA had renal involvement. CONCLUSION: Patients with juvenile-onset SLE more often have renal involvement and encephalopathy than patients with adult-onset SLE. Anti-ribosomal P, anti-dsDNA and antihistone antibodies are more often found in patients with juvenile-onset SLE.",M2
18845419,"Antigen-specific responses and <e>ANA</e> production in B6.Sle1b mice: a role for SAP.B6.Sle1b mice, which contain the Sle1b gene interval derived from lupus prone NZM2410 mice on a C57BL/6 background, present with gender-biased, highly penetrant anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) production. To obtain some insight into the possible induction mechanism of autoantibodies in these mice we compared antigen-specific T dependent (TD) and T independent (TI-II) responses between B6.Sle1b and B6 mice before the development of high ANA titers. Our results show that B6.Sle1b mice mount enhanced responses to a TI-II antigen. Additionally, the memory T cell response generated by a TD antigen also increased. This enhancement correlates with the greater ability of B cells from B6.Sle1b mice to present antigen to T cells. The SLAM Associated Protein (SAP) is critical for signaling of many of the molecules encoded by the SLAM/CD2 gene cluster, candidates for mediating the Sle1b phenotype; therefore, we also investigated the effect of sap deletion in these strains on the TD and TI-II responses as well as on ANA production. The results of these studies of responses to non-self-antigens provide further insight into the mechanism by which responses to self-antigens might be initiated in the context of specific genetic alterations.",M2
18843953,"[A clinical analysis of primary Sjögren's syndrome with anticentromere antibodies]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestations, immunological features and prognosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) with anticentromere antibodies (ACA). METHODS: Sixty pSS patients with ACA in our hospital between 1985 and 2006 were screened retrospectively and compared with those without ACA. RESULTS: The mean age at the onset of pSS with ACA was higher than that of those without ACA [(48 +/- 11) yr vs (41 +/- 12) yr, P =0.000]. There was no difference in sex ratio, dry mouth, dry eyes and positive salivary gland biopsy between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Compared with those without ACA, patients with ACA presented a higher prevalence of liver involvement (68.3% vs 37.0%, P = 0.000), while a lower prevalence of renal involvement (13.3% vs 30.9%, P = 0.009), neuropathy (1.7% vs 11.5%, P = 0.025) and hypergammaglobulinemia (20.8% vs 45.7%, P = 0.002). The difference was not significant between the two groups in Raynaud's phenomenon, articular involvement, myositis, hematologic involvement, lung involvement, and thyroiditis. While both groups showed the same prevalence of antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), the patterns of ANA-IF were different and the discrete speckled pattern was the most frequent in patients with ACA and occurred in 61.7%. Different from those without ACA, patients with ACA presented a lower prevalence of anti-SSA, anti-SSB, rheumatoid factor, and anti-U1RNP, while showed a higher prevalence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and AMA-M2. The most frequent cause of death was the complications associated with cirrhosis, notably bleeding varices (3/5 cases). CONCLUSION: Patients with ACA present a high risk of liver involvement. Because of the remarkable difference in the mean age of disease onset and also differences in systemic damage, immunological and antibody features, pSS with ACA may be a special subtype of pSS.",M2
20298335,"Determination of rickettsial and antinuclear antibodies in Danish patients with sarcoidosis.INTRODUCTION: Rickettsia helvetica has been proposed as an aetiological agent in sarcoidosis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of plasma anti-Rickettsia antibodies in a Danish population of patients with sarcoidosis and control subjects. In addition, we evaluated the presence of plasma antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANAs</e>). METHODS: Plasma samples from 49 consecutive patients (27 male, 22 female, median age 38 years, interquartile range 32-51 years) were compared with plasma from 51 age- and sex-matched controls (28 male, 23 female, median age 40 years, interquartile range 33-49 years), using a commercially available immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies towards spotted fever group and typhus group Rickettsia as well as an assay for ANA. We obtained information regarding tick exposure and sarcoid disease manifestations from the medical records. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies to Rickettsia in patients with sarcoidosis 1/49 (2%) was not significantly different from the prevalence in the controls 4/51 (8%). The prevalence of ANA was 2/49 (4%) in the patients and 3/51 (6%) in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the hypothesis that Rickettsia or ANAs should be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Seventy-one per cent of the patients were under treatment with prednisolone in the 3 months leading up to the blood sample. We assume that antibody-related serological methods for various reasons could be inadequate to diagnose a chronic rickettsial infection.",M2
18820931,"High prevalence of rheumatoid factor associated with clinical manifestations of rheumatic disease in Kaingang and Guarani Indians from Southern Brazil.The aim of the present study was to perform a screening for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibody in Kaingang, Guarani and Mestizos individuals from Mangueirinha Reservation, State of Paraná, Brazil, and associate it with demographic and clinical data. Serum samples from 321 aborigines (125 male and 196 female; 4-86 years old) and 180 non-Indians healthy individuals were analysed (62 male and 118 female; 2-81 years old). Antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) was tested by indirect immunofluorescence, and RF by agglutination in latex and turbidimetry. RF was higher in Kaingang when compared to Guarani (P = 0.009), Mestizos (P = 0.061) and non-Indians (P = 0.010). A significant increase of RF was observed in Kaingang women versus Kaingang men (P = 0.002) and, among the women, in Kaingang when compared to Mestizos and Guarani (P &lt;or= 0.008). The positivity for ANA did not show significant differences between the groups. Clinical evaluation of RF positive individuals (n = 6) confirmed rheumatoid arthritis in two Kaingang Indians. Other two individuals (RF positive) will be under medical observation, as well as two Mestizos. The differences observed among the investigated groups, suggest the influence of genetic and hormonal factors in the development of auto antibodies in these populations.",M2
18813929,"Less disease severity and favorable prognosis are associated with postmenopausal systemic lupus erythematosus patients.The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical manifestations of postmenopausal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Of the 699 SLE inpatients, 20 postmenopausal and 70 menstruous SLE patients were evaluated and compared for the clinical manifestations. The mean age of onset was 55.05 years (range from 42 to 66) with a peak of 50-60 in postmenopausal lupus patients. The average time from SLE onset to diagnosis was 2.18 years. Arthritis was the most frequent initial manifestation in the postmenopausal group. Other common clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities include lassitude, fever, alopecia, malar rash, cardiac impairment and weight loss, and elevated ESR, decreased C3, <e>ANA</e> &gt;or= 1:80, hypergammaglobulinemia and anti-RNP antibody positive. Compared with menstruous lupus patients, postmenopausal patients were more likely to have weight loss (P &lt; 0.01), myalgia and myasthenia (P &lt; 0.01), and less likely to have malar rash (P &lt; 0.05), renal involvement (P &lt; 0.01), leukocytopenia (P &lt; 0.05) and positive ANA (P &lt; 0.01). Thus, less disease severity and favorable prognosis were associated with postmenopausal SLE patients.

This study was conducted to identify the clinical characteristics of lymphadenitis in children and compare the clinical characteristics observed in children and adults. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the 20 patients 18 years of age or younger who were diagnosed with HNL based on histological tests conducted at Gyeongsang University Hospital from January 1998 to December 2006 were analyzed. RESULTS: HNL affected males and females at a 1:1 ratio, but HNL was more common in boys (8:3) among the children and HNL affected more girls among the adolescents (2:7). Cervical lymphadenopathy was the main symptom. The antinuclear antibody test was positive in three patients. Two relapse cases were reported, but both patients recuperated within several months without complications. CONCLUSIONS: HNL affected males and females at an equal incidence (1:1). But HNL occurred more often in male children than in female children, and more often in female adolescents than in male adolescents. Relapse occurred in 10% of the cases. HNL could progress into systemic lupus erythematosus in the three cases that were <e>ANA</e>-positive. Thus, a long follow-up period is important.",M2
18789071,"Positive direct immunofluorescence and autoantibody profiles in psoriasis patients.Psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus are common, but their coexistence is thought to be infrequent. Each of these diseases has a broad clinical spectrum, so that diagnosis may not be straightforward. This study aimed to investigate the following immunological parameters in psoriasis patients: (i) direct immunofluorescence (DIF); (ii) antinuclear antibody; (iii) anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); (iv) anti-Ro; and (v) anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (nRNP). Of 300 cases, comprising 189 men (62.9%) and 111 women (37.1%), 17 (5.7%; 10 men, seven women) were positive for at least one immunological parameter. Nine of 300 (3%; seven male, two female) biopsy specimens from sun-exposed psoriatic lesions demonstrated bright continuous bands of granular IF along the dermoepidermal junction with immunoreactant immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, C3 and fibrinogen. The intensity of IF at the dermoepidermal junction was graded 3+ and 2+. Three cases demonstrated IgM, two had IgG, two fibrinogen and six cases showed C3. Three cases demonstrated more than one immunoreactant. One case demonstrated C3 at the vessels. No specimen demonstrated IgA deposition. Three hundred sera were obtained from patients with psoriasis, of which five demonstrated elevated antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) titer; dilution titer varied from 1:80-640. Three had a homogeneous pattern and two had a speckled pattern. None had a peripheral pattern. Five (1.7%) of 300 demonstrated anti-Ro, two had negative ANA, and three were positive ANA, two of which were speckled and the other homogenous. Anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm and anti-nRNP were not detected. Ten patients had positive DIF but negative ANA, while five had positive ANA; all had negative DIF results. Thus, the incidence of psoriasis and lupus erythematosus coexistence is low and a baseline immunological screening test for psoriasis might not prove worthwhile.",M2
18785312,"Abnormal antinuclear antibody titers are less common than generally assumed in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) tests in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (F-ANA) and enzyme-immunoassays detecting antinucleosomal antibodies (ANSA-EIA). METHODS: Sera from 50 patients with SLE and 65 patients with RA were analyzed regarding abnormal concentrations of F-ANA (serum dilution&gt;or=1:200=95th percentile among 300 healthy blood donors). The sera were also analyzed with 2 commercial ANSA-EIA kits. RESULTS: An abnormal F-ANA titer occurred in 76% of the SLE sera compared to 23% in RA, and was not related to present use of antirheumatic drugs. At dilution 1:50, 84% of the SLE sera were F-ANA-positive compared to 20% of healthy women. Forty percent and 56%, respectively, of the SLE sera tested positive in the 2 ANSA-EIA kits. By the most sensitive assay, 96% of the ANSA-positive SLE sera produced a homogenous (chromosomal) F-ANA staining pattern compared to 18% of the ANSA-negative SLE sera. Ten of the 15 F-ANA-positive RA sera (63%) generated homogenous F-ANA staining and 13 (20%) tested positive in the most sensitive ANSA-EIA, but with no correlation to the F-ANA staining pattern. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of F-ANA at an abnormal titer was surprisingly low (76%) in established cases of SLE. ANSA occurred in 56% of the SLE sera, but also in a fair number (20%) of RA sera. Practically all ANSA-positive SLE sera were identified by chromosomal F-ANA staining. We conclude that the antigen-specific antinucleosomal EIA does not have high enough diagnostic specificity to justify use of this analysis for routine diagnostic purposes.",M2
18764857,"Significantly higher frequencies of presence of serum autoantibodies in Chinese patients with oral lichen planus.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the presence of serum anti-nuclear (<e>ANA</e>), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), anti-mitochondrial (AMA), anti-gastric parietal cell (GPCA), anti-thyroglobulin (TGA) and anti-thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (TMA) in small groups of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP). METHODS: In this study, the serum levels of ANA, SMA, AMA, GPCA, TGA and TMA were measured in a group of 320 Chinese OLP patients and 53 healthy control subjects to assess whether Chinese OLP patients had significantly higher frequencies of serum autoantibodies than healthy control subjects and to assess which risk factors had a significant influence on the possession of a specific serum autoantibody in OLP patients. RESULTS: We found that autoantibodies were present in 195 (60.9%) of the 320 OLP patients. The frequencies of presence of serum ANA (28.1%), GPCA (26.3%), TGA (21.3%) and TMA (24.4%) in OLP patients were significantly higher than those (5.7%, 1.9%, 1.9% and 1.9%, respectively) in healthy control subjects (all P-values were &lt; 0.005). Forty-one (12.8%) OLP patients also had anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVA) in their sera. The multivariate logistic regression found that major erosive OLP (EOLP) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.786], TGA/TMA-positivity (OR = 2.517), and HCVA-positivity (OR = 2.214) were significant risk factors to influence ANA-positivity in OLP patients. Moreover, only major EOLP (OR = 1.879) and ANA-positivity (OR = 2.581) were significant risk factors to influence TGA/TMA-positivity in OLP patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are significantly higher frequencies of presence of ANA, GPCA, TGA and TMA in Chinese OLP patients than in healthy control subjects.",M2
18729292,"Prognosis of neonates in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus.PURPOSE: The effects of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on neonatal prognosis were examined by comparing clinical features of full-term babies born to lupus mothers and age- and parity-matched controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2005, 39 singletons were born to 37 SLE women. Excluding 11 cases of prematurity and preeclampsia, 28 full-term neonates formed the lupus group. The control group included 66 full-term babies. The retrospective study examined medical records and compared gestational age, birth weight, days of hospital stay, small for gestational age (SGA) frequency, Apgar scores &lt; 7, and parity. Lupus neonates were tested for anti-nuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) and platelet count, and electrocardiogram was performed. RESULTS: Average gestational age (38 vs. 39 weeks, p &lt; 0.05) and birth weight (2,775 vs. 3,263g, p &lt; 0.05) were significantly different between the SLE and control groups. SGA frequency was higher in the SLE group (25% vs. 4.5%, p &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed in Apgar score, birth weight, gestational age, SGA frequency, and platelet count between lupus subgroups formed based on anti-dsDNA antibody levels and antiphospholipid antibody status. CONCLUSION: The association of maternal ANAs, antiphospholipid antibodies, and drug history with neonatal prognosis could not be elucidated. However, even in uncomplicated pregnancies, maternal lupus is disadvantageous for gestational age, birth weight, and SGA frequency.",M2
18727460,"Antinuclear antibodies prevalence in Filipinos migrated to Italy.Antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) represent the main diagnostic markers for systemic autoimmune disease (AD), although their presence can be detected in blood donors. The aim of this study was to study ANA prevalence in healthy subjects of different racial groups, exposed to the same environmental factors, in order to understand the relevance of genetics or environment in determining autoimmunity. We enrolled in this study 80 healthy Filipinos (Polynesian), migrated to Italy from an average of 15 years, and 60 healthy native Italians (Caucasian) and ANA were detected in their sera (at 1:80 screening dilution) through indirect immunofluorescence assay. We found a higher prevalence of ANA positivity in Filipinos compared to Italians (23.7% vs 8.3%--P = 0.02; OR 3.43; 95% CI 1.2-9.8), above all in females and elderly, although demographic characteristics, clinical history and habits were not significantly different between the two groups. These data confirm that ANA positivity is not a rare condition and healthy non-Caucasians present a higher prevalence of autoantibodies. This could be determined by their autoimmunity-prone immune system or by the exposition to infective agents, pollution, drugs or nutrition of a western country. Future studies to evaluate the ANA prevalence in Filipinos in their own country and the follow-up of positive patients could clarify the real predisposition to AD of this population.",M2
18708165,"Recurrent pericarditis: infectious or autoimmune?The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) remain controversial standing like a bridge that crosses infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways. Anything may cause acute pericarditis; Echo-virus, and Coxsackie are the most frequently involved viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnetii the most common bacteria, but in 85% of cases it remains  idiopathic . Recurrences occur in up to 20-50% of patients. An immuno-mediated pathogenesis is suggested by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pericardial fluid, the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies (<e>ANA</e>) in sera of the patients, the occurrence of new autoimmune diagnoses and the good response to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be used at recommended dosages, till the resolution of symptoms and normalization of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Corticosteroids should be used rarely, at low doses, with an extremely low tapering and with osteoporosis prevention. Colchicine leads to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit, reducing recurrences by 50%. The long term outcome of IRAP is good, without evidence of constriction even after a very long follow-up.",M2
18700876,"Inhibitory NKG2A and activating NKG2D and NKG2C natural killer cell receptor genes: susceptibility for rheumatoid arthritis.The inhibitory (NKG2A) and activating (NKG2D and NKG2C) natural killer (NK) cell receptors are expressed on a subset of NK and T cells. They regulate the innate and adaptive immune systems related to cytotoxicity and cytokine production that are involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The role of inhibitory and activating NK cell receptor genes might contribute to chronic inflammation and destruction of bone and cartilage in RA. Therefore, we investigated the association of the NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2D genotypes with RA. NKG2A (KLRC1) NKG2C (KLRC2), and NKG2D (KLRK1, D12S249E) genes were genotyped in 210 unrelated patients with RA and 298 controls using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We further investigated the relationships between the genotypes of each single nucleotide polymorphism and the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>), and bony erosions in RA patients. The major NKG2A c.338-90*A/*A, NKG2C102*Ser/*Ser, and NKG2D72*Ala/*Ala genotypes in RA were significantly associated compared with controls [P = 0.013, odds ratio (OR) = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44-0.91; P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.44-2.96; and P = 0.019, OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.45-0.93, respectively]. The minor NKG2A c.338-90*G/*G, NKG2C102*Phe/*Phe, and NKG2D72*Thr/*Thr genotypes showed a risk of RA (P = 0.010, OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.17-3.54; P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.12-0.48; and P = 0.032, OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.05-5.01, respectively) compared with controls. No significance was observed between the inhibitory (NKG2A) or activating (NKG2C and NKG2D) receptor genotypes and the presence of RF, ANA, or bony erosions in RA.",M2
18674829,"Antinuclear antibodies in recurrent idiopathic pericarditis: prevalence and clinical significance.BACKGROUND: A positive result for antinuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>), often as a fortuitous observation, may be cause for concern in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP), nevertheless data are lacking on their prevalence and clinical significance. This study is sought to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of ANA in IRP. METHODS: ANA titres were assessed in consecutive patients with recurrent pericarditis, and matched healthy controls. Baseline and follow-up data were recorded and compared according to ANA results. RESULTS: A total of 145 consecutive patients with recurrent pericarditis were studied: 122 patients with IRP, 23 patients with pericarditis due to known etiologies (rheumatologic diagnoses and postpericardiotomy syndrome), and 122 healthy controls. ANA were detected in 53 of 122 (43.4%) patients with IRP, and in only 12 of 122 (9.8%) controls (p&lt;0.001). Low titres (1/40-1/80) were found in the majority of cases, while moderate positivity (1/160-1/320) was more common in patients with a known rheumatic disease (26.7% vs. 5.7%; p=0.020). High concentrations of ANA (&gt; or =1/640) were not recorded. Women were at increased risk for ANA (OR 2.22 95%CI 1.07-4.60; p=0.033). During a mean follow-up of 32 months, complications and new diagnoses were similar in patients with or without ANA positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Low-positive titres are more common in patients with IRP than in controls, suggesting a possible autoimmune pathogenesis. Nevertheless, they are often a clinically non-specific finding. Routine serologic testing for ANA suggests a source for recurrent pericarditis in less than 10% of cases, and in these cases other evidence typically suggests the underlying disease.",M2
18666025,"Prevalence and patterns of anti-nuclear antibodies in Korean children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis according to ILAR criteria.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and patterns of anti-nuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>) in different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three Korean patients (M:F 83:70) with JIA were followed between 1990 and 2006 and were tested for ANA by an indirect immunofluorescence method using HEp-2 cells as the substrate. ANA tests were repeated in 37 patients during the course of the disease. The median age at onset was 7.5 years (range 0.8-15.9 years). RESULTS: ANA were positive in 50 (33%) of the 153 patients at a dilution of 1:40 or higher (&gt;1:40 in 70%, &gt;1:80 in 2%, &gt;1:160 in 16%, &gt;1:320 in 2%, and &gt;1:640 in 10%). The patterns of immunofluorescence staining were homogeneous in 50%, speckled in 38%, nucleolar in 8%, and centromere in 4%. ANA titres were decreased in 25 (68%) of the 37 patients, and the nuclear fluorescence patterns changed in 14 (38%) during follow-up. ANA seropositivity was associated with female sex (p&lt;0.0001), negative HLA-B27 (p = 0.01), and a persistently elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at follow-up (p = 0.014). Furthermore, a high ANA titre (&gt;1:160) was associated with a poor clinical outcome (active patients at follow-up) (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: ANA may be an important marker of disease activity in patients with JIA. ANA titres tend to decrease during disease remission but the fluorescence patterns do not appear to be related to disease activity or clinical outcome.",M2

METHODS: Thirty-four 4-week-old NOD mice were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: to be immunized by nasal administration of alpha-fodrin 1 microg/dose and 10 microg/dose respectively every two days (experimental groups), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or glutathion2 S-tansferase4 (GST) (control groups). The weekly volume of water drinking was calculated. The salivary flow was maintained. Serum samples were obtained to detect the anti-SSA, anti-SSB, RF, <e>ANA</e>, anti- -fodrin and anti-type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor polypeptide (M3RP) by immunofluorescence or ELISA. The cytokines of IFN-gamma and IL-10 were measured with ELISA. The salivary glands were examined by HE staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Foxp3+ CD4+ CD25+ T cells. RESULTS: The titers of anti- -fodrin antibody and M3RP antibody of the mice immunized with-fodrin were lower than those of the 2 control groups (all P &lt; 0.05), however, there was not significant differences between these two a-fodrin immunized groups. Five of the 8 mice in the GST group, 5 mice in the PBS group, 2 mice in the alpha-fodrin 1 microg/dose group, and 3 mice in the alpha-fodrin 10 microg/dose showed ANA positive. The serum IFN-gamma levels in the mice of alpha-fodrin 1 microg/dose and 10 microg/dose groups, PBS group, and GST group were (42 +/- 16), (37 +/- 15), (87 +/- 18), and (72 +/- 11) pg/ml respectively, those of the fodrin groups being significantly lower than those of the control groups (all P &lt; 0.05). There were not significant differences in the level of serum IL-10 among these four groups. The numbers of Foxp3+ CD4 CD25+ regulatory T cells were higher in the fodrin groups than in the PBS and GST control groups (all P &lt; 0.05). The lymphocytic infiltration and expression of alpha-fodrin were decreased in the alpha-fodrin administrated groups. The volume of water drinking of the alpha-fodrin 1 microg/dose group, alpha-fodrin 10 microg/dose group, PBS group, and GST group were (39.2 +/- 2.1), (40.4 +/- 2.5), (49.3 +/- 3.1), and (51.6 +/- 2.8) ml respectively. CONCLUSION: Mucosal administration of alpha-fodrin effectively inhibits the progression of experimental Sjögren's syndrome autoimmunity.",M2

To study if there is association between eye manifestations and patient's articular functional index, age at diagnosis and illness duration. METHODS: We reviewed 198 charts of rheumatoid arthritis patients followed-up from 2003 to 2006. They were studied for: prevalence of ophthalmologic manifestations, autoantibody profile, demographic data and Steinbrock's functional index. RESULTS: Secondary Sjögren's syndrome was seen in 12.1% of the patients being more common in women (p=0.049) and in patients with greater articular damage (p=0.016). Ulcerative keratitis and scleritis appeared in 2% of patients each. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) as well as illness duration and age at diagnosis had no influence in the appearance of eye manifestations. CONCLUSION: Secondary Sjögren syndrome was the most common ocular manifestation in patients with RA, mainly in women and patients with greater joint damage.",M2

PATIENTS: 9 out of 305 patients with SS, diagnosed according to the criteria proposed in 2002, had repeated positive serology for HCV. RESULTS: 9 female patients were studied. The mean age at onset of SS was 59 years, with a mean period of follow-up of 7.1 years. All the patients had glandular manifestations and they were all positive for dacryologic tests. Salivary gland biopsy was performed in 4 patients, all showing characteristic lymphocytic infiltrate. The main extraglandular features were arthralgias, photosensitivity, purpura, thyroiditis. All the patients were positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (<e>ANA</e>): 6 anti-Ro/SSA, 3 anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB positive. HCV-positive SS were compared with 296 patients with primary SS. They showed higher mean age (p=0.01), higher prevalence of photosensitivity (p=0.0266) and circulating cryoglobulins (p=0.0372). In primary SS, most patients had anti-Ro/SSA antibodies alone (49.8%) or associated to anti-La/SSB (46.5%). Five patients (1.8%) had other ANA specificities. CONCLUSIONS: A chronic HCV infection is concomitant in about 3% of patients with pSS. They differ from patients without HCV infection for the higher prevalence of photosensitivity and cryoglobulins, without clinical manifestations of cryoglobulinemia.",M2

METHODS: Plasma was collected from SLE patients and healthy subjects as controls. Protein-bound carbonyls, protein thiols, superoxide dismutase (SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) were determined by spectrophotometry. Levels of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and antinuclear antibody (<e>ANA</e>) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: When comparing with the control subjects, SLE patients exhibited elevated levels of protein carbonyls [(0.101 +/- 0.033) nmol/mg, (0.061 +/- 0.019)nmol/mg, P &lt; 0.01], degraded levels of protein thiols [(3.911 +/- 0.968) nmol/mg, (4.655 +/- 0.798) nmol/mg, P &lt; 0.01] and activities of T-SOD [(67.01 +/- 12.22) U/ml, (97.35 +/- 14.11) U/ml, P &lt; 0.01]. Levels of plasma protein thiols and activities of T-SOD were lower in SLE patients positive for anti-dsDNA antibody, compared with patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibody. CONCLUSION: We found that the elevated levels of multiple markers of protein oxidation and degraded activities of antioxidant enzymes in plasma from SLE patients existed when comparing with the controls, and the all the levels were correlated with disease activity. Our findings suggested that protein oxidation might play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic organ damage in SLE.",M2
