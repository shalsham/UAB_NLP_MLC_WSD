19860985,"Effect of calcium on iron absorption in women with marginal iron status.We measured non-haem <e>Fe</e> absorption with and without added Ca in a short-term feeding study, in thirteen women with marginal Fe status, by the use of a double stable isotope technique. Supplementing 500 mg Ca as calcium carbonate significantly (P = 0.0009) reduced Fe absorption from a single meal from 10.2 % (range 2.2-40.6) to 4.8 % (range 0.7-18.9). A significant inverse correlation in the absence ( - 0.67, P = 0.010) and presence ( - 0.58, P = 0.037) of Ca, respectively, was found between Fe absorption and Fe stores measured by serum ferritin (SF). Wide variation in Fe absorption was observed between individuals in the absence and in the presence of Ca, despite pre-selection of participants within a relatively narrow range of iron stores (SF concentrations). Correction of Fe absorption data based on group mean SF was not found to be useful in reducing the inter-individual variability in iron absorption. It appears that selecting a study group with a narrow initial range of Fe stores does not necessarily reduce the inter-individual variability in Fe bioavailability measurements. These results support the hypothesis that body Fe stores, although an important determinant of dietary Fe absorption, are not the main factor that determines Fe absorption under conditions of identical dietary intake in subjects with low Fe stores.",M1
19709447,"An algorithm to assess intestinal iron availability for use in dietary surveys.In nutritional epidemiology, it is often assumed that nutrient absorption is proportional to nutrient intake. For several nutrients, including non-haem <e>Fe</e>, this assumption may not hold. Depending on the nutrients ingested with non-haem Fe, its availability for absorption varies greatly. Therefore, using Fe intake to examine associations between Fe and health can impact upon the validity of findings. Previous algorithms that adjust Fe intakes for dietary factors known to affect absorption have been found to underestimate Fe absorption and, in the present study, perform poorly on independent dietary data. We have designed a new algorithm to adjust Fe intakes for the effects of ascorbic acid, meat, fish and poultry, phytate, polyphenols and Ca, incorporating not only absorption data from test meals but also current understanding of Fe absorption. In so doing, we have created a robust and universal Fe algorithm with potential for use in large cohorts. The algorithm described aims not to predict Fe absorption but available Fe in the gut, a measure we believe to be of greater use in epidemiological research. Available Fe is Fe available for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, taking into account enhancing or inhibiting effects of dietary modifiers. Our algorithm successfully estimated average Fe availability in test meal data used to construct the algorithm and, unlike other algorithms tested, also provided plausible predictions when applied to independent dietary data. Future research is needed to evaluate the extent to which this algorithm is useful in epidemiological research to relate Fe to health outcomes.",M1
19706212,"Leaf concentrate as an alternative to iron and folic acid supplements for anaemic adolescent girls: a randomised controlled trial in India.OBJECTIVE: Despite public health campaigns based on <e>Fe</e> and folic acid supplements, Fe-deficiency anaemia remains highly prevalent among women in India. We investigated leaf concentrate as an alternative to Fe and folic acid supplements for treating anaemia in adolescent girls. DESIGN: Randomised controlled two-arm trial over 3 months: one group received daily Fe and folic acid (IFA; 60 mg Fe, 500 microg folic acid); the other daily leaf concentrate (LC; 5 mg Fe, 13 microg folic acid). Hb concentration, mean cell volume, serum Fe, serum ferritin and total Fe-binding capacity were measured pre- and post-intervention. SETTING: Jaipur, India. SUBJECTS: One hundred and two adolescent girls aged 14-18 years. RESULTS: Of the 102 girls randomized to the two arms of the trial, four (3.9 %) were severely anaemic (Hb &lt; 7 g/dl), twenty-eight (27.5 %) were moderately anaemic (Hb &gt; or = 7 g/dl, &lt;10 g/dl) and seventy (68.6 %) were mildly anaemic (Hb &gt; or = 10 g/dl, &lt;12 g/dl). In the IFA group, eleven girls (20.4 %) withdrew due to side-effects, compared with one girl (2.1 %) in the LC group (P = 0.005). Total losses to follow-up were 14/54 in the IFA group and 2/48 in the LC group. At the end of the trial, none of the eighty-six remaining girls were severely anaemic, nine (10.5 %) were moderately anaemic and twenty-six (30.2 %) were mildly anaemic; fifty-one (59.3 %) had normal Hb levels (&gt; or = 12 g/dl). After adjustment for baseline values, LC was as effective as IFA in improving serum Fe parameters and treating anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf concentrate is an effective, and more palatable, alternative to Fe and folic acid supplements for treating anaemia in adolescent girls.",M1
19680884,"Effect of ion supplementation of a commercial soft drink on tooth enamel erosion.Acidic soft drinks are potentially erosive for dental hard tissues. This in vitro study evaluated the effect of calcium, fluoride, iron and phosphate, supplemented alone or in combination to a commercial citric acid-based carbonated beverage on dental erosion. Ninety enamel samples (4 x 4 x 3 mm) were randomly allocated to nine groups (n = 10): G1-pure beverage (control); G2-with 1 mM Ca; G3-with 0.047 mM F; G4-with 1 mM <e>Fe</e>; G5-with 1 mM P; G6 - with 1 mM Ca and 0.047 mM F; G7-with 1 mM Ca and 1 mM P; G8-with 1 mM Fe and 0.047 mM F; and G9-with 1 mM Ca, 1 mM P, 0.047 mM F and 1.0 mM Fe. The samples were subjected to six pH cycles over a 24-h period. In each cycle, the samples were immersed in pure or modified beverage (1 min) and in artificial saliva (59 min). During the remaining period (18 h), the samples were maintained in artificial saliva. Enamel loss was assessed by profilometry (microm). Data were tested using ANOVA and Tukey's tests (p &lt; 0.05). Highest enamel losses were observed in the control group (G1) and in the groups containing Fe (G4 and G8). The groups containing Ca (G2 and G6) showed significantly less wear compared to control. In conclusion, the modification of an erosive soft drink with low concentrations of Ca with or without F may reduced its erosive potential.",M1
19646048,"Iron, zinc, and protein bioavailability proxy measures of meals prepared with nutritionally enhanced beans and maize.Nutritionally enhanced beans (NEB) with more <e>Fe</e> and Zn than conventional beans (CB) and nutritionally enhanced maize (NEM) with more tryptophan and lysine than conventional maize (CM) were developed as part of a crop-biofortification strategy to improve human nutrition. Proxy measures were used to assess Fe and Zn bioavailability and protein digestibility of a bean recipe (fr√≠jol sancochado) and a maize-milk recipe (mazamorra) prepared with enhanced or conventional crops in Colombia. Fe concentration was similar in the cooked NEB and CB and in NEM and CM (P&gt; or = 0.05); in vitro Fe dialyzability was similar in cooked NEB (9.52%) and CB (9.72%) and greater for NEM (37.01%) than CM (32.24%). Zn concentration was higher in the uncooked and cooked NEB than in the CB (P &lt; 0.05); phytate: Zn molar ratios were high in cooked NEB (36: 1) and CB (47: 1), suggesting low Zn bioavailability, and not different from each other (P = 0.07). There were no differences in Zn concentration or phytate: Zn molar ratio in the maize recipes. Nitrogen, tryptophan, and lysine concentrations were higher in the cooked NEM than CM; nitrogen was higher in the cooked NEB than CB (P &lt; 0.05). In vitro protein digestibility was comparable (82% to 83%) for NEM and CM and higher for NEB (84%) than for CB (82%). The higher nutrient concentrations + similar bioavailability (protein in NEM, Zn in NEB), same nutrient concentrations + higher bioavailability (Fe in NEM) or higher nutrient concentrations + higher bioavailability (protein in NEB) can translate into more nutrients absorbed and utilized by the body.",M1
19579971,"Iron bioavailability of rats fed liver, lentil, spinach and their mixtures.To study the effects of dietary iron source (basal diet-FeSO4 x 7H2O, liver, lentil, spinach, liver + lentil, liver+spinach and lentil+spinach) on iron bioavailability, fifty-six Albino Sprague Dawley derived male 21 days old rats were fed on iron-deficient diet (7.8 mg <e>Fe</e> kg(-1) diet) and the mentioned seven iron containing diets (40 mg Fe kg(-1) diet) for 10 days. Rats fed liver diet showed higher iron apparent absorption (52.1%), hemoglobin (Hb) gain (0.94 g/100 mL), Hb-iron gain (1.2 mg), Hb-regeneration efficiency (HRE%) (50.8%), relative efficiency of HRE% (106.5%), packed cell volume gain (2.22%) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (0.64 g dL(-1)). Liver resulted in an increase in these parameters when mixed with lentil and spinach diets. However, rats fed iron free diet showed the higher dry matter absorption.",M1
19524686,"Different responses of <e>Fe</e> transporters in Caco-2/HT29-MTX cocultures than in independent Caco-2 cell cultures.The human intestinal epithelium is composed of several cell types, mainly enterocytes and goblet (mucin-secreting) cells. This study compares the cellular response of Fe transporters in Caco-2, HT29-MTX, and Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture models for Fe bioavailability. Caco-2 cells in vitro differentiate into enterocyte-like cells and HT29-MTX cell lineage into a mucin-secreting cellular population. Cell cultures were exposed to digests of Fe+3, Fe+3/ascorbic acid, cooked fish (high-available Fe) or white beans (low-available Fe). Cell responses as shown by mRNA expression of the main Fe transporters, DMT1 and DcytB, and cell ferritin formation were monitored. In Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-cultures, the mucin layer lowered the pool of free Fe to diffuse towards the cell brush border membrane of enterocytes, which was accompanied of an upregulation of DMT1 mRNA expression. In contrast, cultures exposed to digests of fish or white beans showed no significant differences in the regulation of Fe transporters.",M1
19476679,"Unexpectedly high early prevalence of anaemia in 6-month-old breast-fed infants in rural Bangladesh.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anaemia and maternal and infant factors associated with Hb values in infants at 6 months of age in rural Bangladesh. DESIGN: Infants (born to mothers supplemented with <e>Fe</e>-folic acid from mid-pregnancy) were visited at birth and 6 months of age. Mothers' anthropometric status, and infants' birth weight, gestational age at birth, weight and Hb concentration at 6 months were measured. Household socio-economic and demographic data, infant feeding practices and health status were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. SETTING: Rural Bangladesh. SUBJECTS: Four hundred and two infants. RESULTS: For the total cohort (n 402), the range of anaemia prevalence values was from 30.6 % using a cut-off value of Hb &lt; 95 g/l to 71.9 % using a value of Hb &lt; 110 g/l. Birth weight and month of birth were the only factors positively associated with infant Hb in a linear regression model (P = 0.008 and 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There was an unexpectedly high prevalence of anaemia in infants at 6 months of age, before the assumed period of vulnerability. Hb at this age tended to be higher in those with higher birth weight. We also found a season effect on Hb, as it tended to be higher as the study progressed. The high prevalence of anaemia at such an early age needs to be addressed to minimize the disease's long-term consequences.",M1
19402944,"Food and nutrient intakes of 9-month-old infants in Adelaide, Australia.OBJECTIVE: To describe the food and nutrient intakes of 9-month-old infants. DESIGN: A survey undertaken as part of a longitudinal study of child growth and development. Infant diet was characterised through a structured interview in which consumption frequency and portion size of foods were obtained. This method was compared with a 4 d diary and had adequate relative validity. SETTING: Adelaide, Australia. SUBJECTS: Three hundred and forty-one infants for whom dietary data were plausible according to pre-specified criteria. RESULTS: At 9 months of age, the median body weights for 161 girls and 180 boys were 8.8 and 9.6 kg, respectively. Differences in intakes between boys and girls largely reflected differences in size. Median daily energy intake was 3541 kJ and median contributions of protein, fat and carbohydrate to total energy were 13 %, 36 % and 50 %. Using published Estimated Average Requirements, Zn intake was inadequate for &lt;1 % of children not breast-fed at this age while <e>Fe</e> intake was inadequate for 9 %. Infants who were still breast-fed (35 %) had more diversity in the foods that provided additional energy, compared with those not receiving breast milk, and were less likely to consume nutrient-displacing drinks such as juice or cordial. Cow's milk was the main drink for 5 % of infants. CONCLUSIONS: In a group of Australian-born children, an important proportion had weaning diets that were low in Fe. Fat intake of many children was below current recommendations and cow's milk was the main milk source for a small minority.",M1
19344541,"Anaemia and associated factors among under-fives and their mothers in Bushenyi district, Western Uganda.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anaemia and associated factors among under-fives and their mothers in a rural area of Western Uganda. DESIGN: A cross-sectional investigation using both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. Stratified multistage sampling methods were used to select the study sample. A haemoglobinometer was used to assess Hb levels in the blood. SETTING: A rural district in Western Uganda. SUBJECTS: Children aged 6-59 months and their mothers aged 15-49 years. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <e>Fe</e>-deficiency anaemia among children and their mothers was 26.2 % and 17.9 %, respectively. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.5, P = 0.008) between the Hb levels of the mothers and their children. Place of birth, age of the child, factors related to complementary foods, and formal education and nutrition knowledge of the mother were major factors that were significantly associated (r = 0.05, P = 0.05) with low Hb levels among the children. The most important factors that were associated with low Hb levels of the mothers were their formal education, nutrition knowledge and health status. CONCLUSIONS: Fe-deficiency anaemia was found to be a major problem in this cohort of children and their mothers. Dietary factors and sociodemographic factors were the major factors associated with high levels of anaemia among the children and their mothers. It is therefore recommended that rural mothers should be sensitized on best practices for prevention of anaemia among both women and children.",M1
19335940,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of stainless steel cooking pots in reducing iron-deficiency anaemia in food aid-dependent populations.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of stainless steel (<e>Fe</e> alloy) cooking pots in reducing Fe-deficiency anaemia in food aid-dependent populations. DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional surveys. Between December 2001 and January 2003, three surveys among children aged 6-59 months and their mothers were conducted in 110 households randomly selected from each camp. The primary outcomes were changes in Hb concentration and Fe status. SETTING: Two long-term refugee camps in western Tanzania. SUBJECTS: Children (6-59 months) and their mothers were surveyed at 0, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Stainless steel pots were distributed to all households in Nduta camp (intervention); households in Mtendeli camp (control) continued to cook with aluminium or clay pots. RESULTS: Among children, there was no change in Hb concentration at 1 year; however, Fe status was lower in the intervention camp than the control camp (serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentration: 6.8 v. 5.9 microg/ml; P &lt; 0.001). There was no change in Hb concentration among non-pregnant mothers at 1 year. Subjects in the intervention camp had lower Fe status than those in the control camp (sTfR concentration: 5.8 v. 4.7 microg/ml; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of stainless steel pots did not increase Hb concentration or improve Fe status in children or their mothers. The use of stainless steel prevents rusting but may not provide sufficient amounts of Fe and strong educational campaigns may be required to maximize use. The distribution of stainless steel pots in refugee contexts is not recommended as a strategy to control Fe deficiency.",M1
19182326,"Dietary iron-loaded rat liver haemosiderin and ferritin: in situ measurement of iron core nanoparticle size and cluster structure using anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering.The morphology, particle size distribution and cluster structure of the hydrated iron(III) oxyhydroxide particles associated with haemosiderin and ferritin in dietary iron-loaded rat liver tissue have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and anomalous small-angle x-ray scattering (ASAXS). Rat liver tissue was removed from a series of female Porton rats which had been fed an iron-rich diet until sacrifice at various ages from 2-24 months. Hepatic iron concentrations ranged from 1 to 65 mg <e>Fe</e> g(-1) dry tissue. TEM studies showed both dispersed and clustered iron-containing nanoparticles. The dispersed particles were found to have mean sizes (+/-standard deviation) of 54 +/- 8 A for the iron-loaded animals and 55 +/- 7 A for the controls. Superposition of particles in TEM images prevented direct measurement of nanoparticulate size in the clusters. The ASAXS data were modelled to provide a quantitative estimate of both the size and spacing of iron oxyhydroxide particles in the bulk samples. The modelling yielded close-packed particles with sizes of 60 to 78 A which when corrected for anomalous scattering suggests sizes from 54 to 70 A. Particle size distributions are of particular importance since they determine the surface iron to core iron ratios, which in turn are expected to be related to the molar toxicity of iron deposits in cells.",M1
19161647,"Effect of dietary factors on anaemia among rural elderly women in south-west China: a case-control study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible dietary risk factors for anaemia in rural elderly women. DESIGN: Case-control study conducted in 2005. Cases and matched controls were interviewed in person to elicit information on lifestyle, diet and individual health. Main foods and nutrients were calculated by three 24 h recalls; intake data of tea, edible oils and spices were from an FFQ. SETTING: Fourteen villages in two counties of Guangxi Province, south-west China. SUBJECTS: Four hundred and twenty anaemic cases and 433 matched controls, aged 50-75 years. RESULTS: The mean consumption of animal foods for cases (82.4 g/d) was significantly lower than for controls (91.0 g/d), similarly for egg consumption (3.8 g/d for cases and 5.8 g/d for controls; P &lt; 0.05). The absolute value of the Dietary Balance Index, low bound score (DBI_LBS) was significantly higher for cases than for controls (P &lt; 0.05). Intakes of energy, protein, carbohydrate, vitamin A (retinol equivalents, RE), vitamin B1, riboflavin and Ca were significantly lower in cases than in controls (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in <e>Fe</e> intake between the two groups. High intake of vitamin A (RE) was inversely associated with anaemia (quartile 4 v. quartile 1: OR = 0.6, P for linear trend = 0.02). The absolute value of DBI_LBS was positively related to anaemia (quartile 4 v. quartile 1: OR = 0.4, P for linear trend &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: For rural elderly women in south-west China, anaemia had a strong positive association with undernutrition and a negative association with vitamin A intake. Dietary Fe intake was not found to be an independent risk factor for anaemia.",M1
19155586,"Iron, zinc, manganese and copper intakes in Japanese children aged 3 to 5 years.This study aimed to measure and evaluate the intakes for the four trace elements of <e>Fe</e>, Zn, Mn, and Cu in 3- to 5-y-old Japanese preschool children. The study group consisted of a total of 90 3- to 5-y-old children living in Yokkaichi, Mie, Japan. Diet samples were collected by the duplicate-portion technique on 3 d at three different seasons between summer in 1999 and winter in 2000. The medians of annual mean daily intakes (25th-75th percentile) of Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu in the 3- to 5-y-old children were 3.1 mg (2.4 to 3.6), 4.0 mg (3.4 to 4.7), 1.3 mg (1.1 to 1.6), and 0.45 mg (0.35 to 0.56), respectively. The annual mean value of the total daily diet intake had significant correlations with the Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu intakes (Spearman's r=0.55, 0.67, 0.58, and 0.55, respectively; p&lt;0.001 for all). There were significant correlations between each mineral intake. The Zn and Mn intakes had differences among ages (p=0.003 and 0.005, respectively) and the Zn intake significantly differed between boys and girls (p=0.031). The proportion of subjects whose Mn intake was the AI or less was 82%, and the proportions of subjects whose Fe, Zn, and Cu intakes were the estimated average requirements (EARs) or less were 72, 83, and 13%, respectively. Many Japanese children are deficient in Fe and Zn compared with the dietary reference intakes (DRIs). However, data in a balance study examining intakes and excretion of trace minerals are insufficient in children and DRIs for trace elements may change in future.",M1
19102811,"Iron bioavailability of cocoa powder as determined by the Hb regeneration efficiency method.<e>Fe</e> deficiency is a public-health problem worldwide, and effective measures for preventing Fe deficiency are needed. The aim of the present study was to determine the bioavailability of Fe in cocoa using the Hb regeneration efficiency (HRE) method. Thirty-five F344/N male weanling rats were fed a low-Fe diet for 4 weeks to deplete body Fe stores. Then, four groups of seven animals each were repleted for 20 d using a modified AIN-93G diet fortified with ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate or two brands of cocoa powder to provide a total dietary Fe concentration of 20 mg/kg. As a negative control, seven rats were maintained on the low-Fe diet. The HRE were 0.733, 0.350, 0.357 and 0.336 for ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate and the two brands of cocoa powder, respectively. The relative biological values (RBV), defined as the ratio of the sample HRE to that of ferrous sulphate, were 0.478, 0.488 and 0.459 for ferric citrate and the two brands of cocoa powder, respectively. The Fe bioavailability of cocoa was significantly less than that of ferrous sulphate and was similar to that of ferric citrate. The difference in Fe bioavailability between the two brands of cocoa powder was negligible. When the negative control was used to correct the data, estimates of the RBV derived from Hb gain were similar to those derived from the HRE. These results suggest that cocoa is a significant source of moderately bioavailable Fe.",M1
19073788,"Serum hepcidin is significantly associated with iron absorption from food and supplemental sources in healthy young women.BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, but to date no studies have examined the effect of hepcidin on iron absorption in humans. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess relations between both serum hepcidin and serum prohepcidin with nonheme-iron absorption in the presence and absence of food with the use of dual stable-iron-isotope techniques. DESIGN: The study group included 18 healthy nonpregnant women. Women received in random order a supplemental iron source (7.6 mg FeSO4 providing 0.9 mg 58Fe as FeSO4) and 6.8 mg 57Fe ferrous sulfate tracer administered with a nonheme food source [orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP): 1.4 mg native <e>Fe</e>]. Iron absorption was determined by analyzing blood samples taken 14 d after dosing with the use of magnetic sector thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Serum hepcidin was assessed by a new competitive serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for the refolded, mature 25-amino acid form, and serum prohepcidin was assessed by an ELISA specific for amino acids 28-47 of the hepcidin prohormone. RESULTS: In these women, iron absorption averaged 14.71 +/- 10.7% from the supplemental iron compared with 3.63 +/- 6.5% from the OFSP. Absorption of nonheme iron assessed in the presence (P = 0.038) and absence (P = 0.0296) of food was significantly associated with serum hepcidin but was not significantly related to serum prohepcidin. CONCLUSION: Serum hepcidin, but not prohepcidin, was inversely associated with iron absorption from supplemental and food-based nonheme-iron sources in iron-replete healthy women.",M1
18987288,"Dietary iron alters waterborne copper-induced gene expression in soft water acclimated zebrafish (Danio rerio).Metals like iron (<e>Fe</e>) and copper (Cu) function as integral components in many biological reactions, and, in excess, these essential metals are toxic, and organisms must control metal acquisition and excretion. We examined the effects of chronic waterborne Cu exposure and the interactive effects of elevated dietary Fe on gene expression and tissue metal accumulation in zebrafish. Softwater acclimated zebrafish exposed to 8 microg/l Cu, with and without supplementation of a diet high in Fe (560 vs. 140 mg Fe/kg food) for 21 days demonstrated a significant reduction in liver and gut Cu load relative to waterborne Cu exposure alone. Gene expression levels for divalent metal transport (DMT)-1, copper transporter (CTR)-1, and the basolateral metal transporter ATP7A in the gills and gut increased when compared with controls, but the various combinations of Cu and high-Fe diet revealed altered levels of expression. Further examination of the basolateral Fe transporter, ferroportin, showed responses to waterborne Cu exposure in the gut and a significant increase with Fe treatment alone in the liver. Additionally, we examined metallothionein 1 and 2 (MT1 and MT2), which indicated that MT2 is more responsive to Cu. To explore the relationship between transcription and protein function, we examined both CTR-1 protein levels and gill apical uptake of radiolabeled Cu64, which demonstrated decreased Cu uptake and protein abundance in the elevated Cu treatments. This study shows that high dietary Fe can significantly alter the genetic expression pattern of Cu transporters at the level of the gill, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.",M1
18755051,"Effects of ascorbic acid, phytic acid and tannic acid on iron bioavailability from reconstituted ferritin measured by an in vitro digestion-Caco-2 cell model.The effects of ascorbic acid (AA), phytate and tannic acid (TA) on <e>Fe</e> bioavailability from Fe supplied as reconstituted ferritin were compared with FeSO4 using an in vitro digestion-Caco-2 cell model. Horse spleen apoferritin was chemically reconstituted into an animal-type ferritin (HSF) and a plant-type ferritin (P-HSF) according to the typical ratios of Fe:P found in these molecules. In the presence of AA (Fe:AA molar ratio of 1:20), significantly more Fe was absorbed from FeSO4 (about 303 %), HSF (about 454 %) and P-HSF (about 371 %) when compared with ferrous sulfate or ferritin without AA. Phytic acid (PA; Fe:PA molar ratio of 1:20) significantly reduced Fe bioavailability from FeSO4 (about 86 %), HSF (about 82 %) and P-HSF (about 93 %) relative to FeSO4 and the ferritin controls. Treatment with TA (Fe:TA molar ratio of 1:1) significantly decreased Fe bioavailability (about 97 %) from both FeSO4 and the ferritin samples. AA was able to partially reverse the negative effect of PA (Fe:PA:AA molar ratio of 1:20:20) on Fe bioavailability but did not reverse the inhibiting effect of TA (Fe:TA:AA molar ratio of 1:1:20) on Fe bioavailability from ferritin and FeSO4. Overall, there were no significant differences in bioavailable Fe between P-HSF, HSF or FeSO4. Furthermore, the addition of AA (a known promoter) or the inhibitors, PA and TA, or both, did not result in significant differences in bioavailable Fe from ferritin relative to FeSO4. The results suggest that Fe in the reconstituted ferritin molecule is easily released during in vitro digestion and interacts with known promoters and inhibitors.",M1
18752697,"Dietary intake and nutritional adequacy prior to conception and during pregnancy: a follow-up study in the north of Portugal.OBJECTIVE: To assess maternal diet and nutritional adequacy prior to conception and during pregnancy. DESIGN: Follow-up of a cohort of pregnant women with collection of questionnaire data throughout pregnancy and after delivery. SETTING: Antenatal clinics at two public hospitals in Porto, Portugal. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and forty-nine pregnant women who reported a gestational age below 13 weeks at the time they attended their first antenatal visit. RESULTS: Intakes of energy and macronutrients were within recommended levels for most women. Pregnancy was accompanied by increases in the dietary intake of vitamins A and E, riboflavin, folate, Ca and Mg, but declines in the intake of alcohol and caffeine. The micronutrients with higher inadequacy prevalences prior to pregnancy were vitamin E (83%), folate (58%) and Mg (19%). These three micronutrients, together with <e>Fe</e>, were also those with the highest inadequacy prevalences during pregnancy (91%, 88%, 73% and 21%, respectively, for folate, Fe, vitamin E and Mg). Ninety-seven per cent of the women reported taking supplements of folic acid during the first trimester, but the median gestational age at initiation was 6.5 (interquartile range 5, 9) weeks. Self-reported prevalences of Fe and Mg supplementation were high, and increased throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The study identified low dietary intakes of vitamin E, folate and Mg both in the preconceptional period and during pregnancy, and low intake of Fe during pregnancy only. The low dietary intake of folate and the late initiation of supplementation indicate that current national guidelines are unlikely to be effective in preventing neural tube defects.",M1
18709235,"Effectiveness of daily and weekly iron supplementation in the prevention of anemia in infants.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of universal prophylactic targeting with iron sulfate on daily or weekly basis in the prevention of anemia in infants. METHODS: Randomized clinical field trial with children between ages six and 12 months seen at primary health care units in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2004 and 2005. Three concurrent cohorts were compared: daily group (n=150; 12.5mg <e>Fe</e>/day); weekly group (n=147; 25mg Fe/week) and control group. The intervention consisted of universal supplementation with iron sulfate for 24 weeks, combined with educational adherence-promoting measures. Outcome: mean serum hemoglobin concentration, distribution and prevalence of anemia (Hb&lt;110.0 g/l) at age 12 months. Effectiveness was evaluated considering both intent to treat and adherence to protocol, using multiple regression analysis (linear and Poisson). RESULTS: Groups were homogeneous in terms of descriptive variables. The intervention was implemented successfully, with high adhesion to protocol in both groups, and no statistical difference between them. After adjustment, only the daily regimen showed a protective effect. Adherence analysis demonstrated an evident dose-response effect on mean Hb and prevalence of anemia only for the daily regimen. No protective effect was detected for the weekly regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Universal supplementation with iron sulfate from six to 12 months of age was effective in increasing serum Hb and decreasing risk of anemia only when administered on a daily basis.",M1

If this Fe is bioavailable, algae consumption could help to combat Fe deficiency and anaemia worldwide. The objective of the present study was to evaluate Fe bioavailability, polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity from three species of marine algae distributed worldwide. A total of eighty-three subjects received maize- or wheat-based meals containing marine algae (Ulva sp., Sargassum sp. and Porphyra sp.) in different proportions (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g) added to the water to prepare the dough. All meals administered contained radioactive Fe. Absorption was evaluated calculating radioactive Fe incorporation in subjects' blood. The three species of marine algae were analysed for polyphenol content and reducing power. Algae significantly increased Fe absorption in maize- or wheat-based meals, especially Sargassum sp., due to its high Fe content. Increases in absorption were dose-dependent and higher in wheat- than in maize-based meals. Total polyphenol content was 10.84, 18.43 and 80.39 gallic acid equivalents/g for Ulva sp., Porphyra sp. and Sargassum sp., respectively. The antioxidant capacity was also significantly higher in Sargassum sp. compared with the other two species analysed. Ulva sp., Sargassum sp. and Porphyra sp. are good sources of bioavailable Fe. Sargassum sp. resulted in the highest Fe intake due to its high Fe content, and a bread containing 7.5 g Sargassum sp. covers daily Fe needs. The high polyphenol content found in Sargassum sp. could be partly responsible for the antioxidant power reported here, and apparently did not affect Fe absorption.",M1
18616847,"Seasonal variation in food pattern but not in energy and nutrient intakes of rural Beninese school-aged children.BACKGROUND: Inadequate energy and nutrient intakes are a major nutritional problem in developing countries. A recent study in Beninese school-aged children in different seasons revealed a high prevalence of stunting and poor iron status that might be related to the food pattern. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the food pattern and resulting energy and nutrient intakes of rural Beninese school-aged children in relation to season and school attendance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was performed in northern Benin in eighty randomly selected children aged 6-8 years. Dietary intake was assessed using observed weighed records. Food, energy and nutrient intakes were measured in post- and pre-harvest seasons. Complete food consumption data sets were available for seventy-five children. RESULTS: Food pattern showed seasonal variations. Cereals, roots and tubers were the main staple foods. Contributions of animal products to the diet were very small. The food pattern was not different for either boys v. girls or for children attending v. not attending school. Median daily energy intakes were 5.0 and 5.3 MJ in the post- and pre-harvest season, respectively. Only fat and vitamin C showed seasonal differences (P &lt; 0.05). Energy and nutrient intakes were different for boys and girls but, unexpectedly, not for children attending v. not attending school. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal variations in food pattern did not result in seasonality in energy and nutrient intakes. Because the children's diet was low in animal products, protein, fat and vitamin C and high in fibre, the absorption of fat, fat-soluble vitamins, carotenoids, <e>Fe</e> and Zn might be low. Fe and Zn bioavailability from such a diet needs further investigation.",M1
18578342,"[Evaluation of minerals contents in daily food rations of low physically active women]The aim of the paper was to assess the minerals contents in daily food rations of low physically active women.

The intake of Ca, <e>Fe</e>, K, Zn and Mg was very low; Ca--47.9% of recommended level, Fe--65% of recommended level, K, Zn and Mg from 55% to 68% of recommended level. The study showed unsatisfactory low consumption of milk and dairy products, cereal products, vegetables and fruits, which are rich source of minerals.",M1
18577000,"Synthesis and bioaccessibility of <e>Fe</e>-pheophytin derivatives from crude spinach extract.Heme iron is recognized as a highly bioavailable source of iron suitable for treatment of iron deficiency anemia. However, the animal origin of purified heme limits its broad applicability due to religious, personal, and food safety issues. Development of chlorophyll-derived heme mimetics offers opportunities to expand current iron fortification strategies. The objective of this study was the synthesis of Fe-pheophytin (FePhe) derivatives from natural chlorophyll and subsequent evaluation of their digestive behavior and bioaccessibility in vitro. FePhe a and a' were synthesized from crude spinach extracts by treatment with 1.3 M iron(II)chloride and 0.25 M Na-acetate dissolved in glacial acetic acid at 80 degrees C for 30 min. FePhe-rich extracts (approximately 1 mM) were formulated into corn starch based test meals (7.5% lipid) and subjected to a 2-step in vitro digestion designed to simulate in vivo gastric and small intestinal conditions. Recovery of FePhe following digestion and transfer of FePhe and pheophytins (Phe) from test meal matrix to mixed micelles was assessed by RP C18-HPLC to determine the digestive stability and micellarization efficiency (bioaccessibility). FePhe a and a' derivatives were moderately stable to digestive conditions with recoveries of 52.3% and 58.7%, respectively. Residual Phe a was stable to digestion. Micellarization efficiency of FePhe a (4%) and a' (3.4%) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than Phe a (25.8%) from test meals. While digestive stability and micellarization efficiency are limiting, the presence of lipophilic FePhe derivatives in mixed micelles suggests that these compounds would be available for subsequent absorption in the intestinal tract.",M1
18542970,"An in vitro examination of intestinal iron absorption in a freshwater teleost, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).This study investigated the physiological characteristics of intestinal iron absorption in a freshwater teleost, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Using an in vitro gastro-intestinal sac technique, we evaluated the spatial pattern and concentration dependent profile of iron uptake, and also the influence of luminal chemistry (pH and chelation) on iron absorption. We demonstrated that the iron uptake rate in the anterior intestine is significantly higher than that in the mid and posterior intestine. Interestingly, absorption of iron in the anterior intestine occurs likely via simple diffusion, whereas a carrier-mediated pathway is apparent in the mid and posterior intestine. The uptake of ferric and ferrous iron appeared to be linear over the entire range of iron concentration tested (0-20 microM), however the uptake of ferrous iron was significantly higher than that of ferric iron at high iron concentrations (&gt;15 microM). An increase in mucosal pH from 7.4 to 8.2 significantly reduced iron absorption in both mid and posterior intestine, implying the involvement of a <e>Fe</e>(2+)/H(+) symporter. Iron chelators (nitrilotriacetic acid and desferrioxamine mesylate) had no effects on iron absorption, which suggests that fish are able to acquire chelated iron via intestine.",M1
18460487,"Oily fish increases iron bioavailability of a phytate rich meal in young iron deficient women.BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a major health problem worldwide, and is associated with diets of low iron bioavailability. Non-heme iron absorption is modulated by dietary constituents, one of which is the so-called  meat factor , present in meat, fish (oily and lean) and poultry, which is an important enhancer of iron absorption in humans. Food processing also affects iron bioavailability. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of consuming sous vide cooked salmon fish on non-heme iron bioavailability from a bean meal, rich in phytate, in iron-deficient women. DESIGN: Randomized crossover trial in 21 young women with low iron stores (ferritin &lt; 30 microg/L). Two test meals were extrinsically labelled with stable isotopes of iron (<e>Fe</e>-57 or Fe-58). Iron bioavailability was measured as the incorporation of stable isotopes into erythrocytes 14 d after meals consumption. RESULTS: The addition of fish to the bean meal significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001) iron absorption. Serum ferritin concentration and iron absorption were inversely correlated for both the bean meal (R(2) = 0.294, p = 0.011) and the fish and bean meal (R(2) = 0.401, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Sous vide cooked salmon fish increases iron absorption from a high phytate bean meal in humans.",M1
18400710,"Iron absorption in young Indian women: the interaction of iron status with the influence of tea and ascorbic acid.BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid (AA) enhances and tea inhibits iron absorption. It is unclear whether iron status influences the magnitude of this effect. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the influence of the iron status of young women on iron absorption from a rice meal with or without added tea or AA. DESIGN: Two stable-isotope iron absorption studies were made in 2 groups of 10 subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and 10 subjects who were iron replete (control subjects). In study 1, the reference rice meal was fed alone or with 1 or 2 cups of black tea. In study 2, the reference meal was fed alone or with AA (molar ratio to iron, 2:1 or 4:1). Iron absorption was measured by the erythrocyte incorporation of (57)<e>Fe</e> and (58)Fe labels at 14 d. RESULTS: Mean fractional iron absorption from the reference rice meal was approximately 2.5 times as great in the IDA group as in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The consumption of 1 or 2 cups of tea decreased iron absorption in the control subjects by 49% (P &lt; 0.05) or 66% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, and in the IDA group by 59% or 67% (P &lt; 0.001 for both), respectively. AA (molar ratio to iron, 2:1 or 4:1) increased iron absorption by 270% or 343%, respectively, in control subjects and by 291% or 350%, respectively, in subjects with IDA (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effect of tea and the enhancing effect of AA on iron absorption were similar in the 2 groups. Overall differences in iron absorption in the 2 groups, however, continued to be dictated by iron status.",M1
18326610,"Effects of prenatal food and micronutrient supplementation on infant development: a randomized trial from the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions, Matlab (MINIMat) study.BACKGROUND: Few data exist for the effects of multiple micronutrient (MM) or food supplementation to undernourished pregnant women on their offsprings' development. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effects on infant development of early (8-10 wk gestation) or usual ( approximately 17 wk gestation) supplementation with food and MM, 30 mg <e>Fe</e> + 400 microg folate, or 60 mg Fe + 400 microg folate. DESIGN: A large, randomized, controlled trial of pregnancy supplementation was conducted in Bangladesh. A subsample of infants (n = 2853) were assessed on 2 problem-solving tests (support and cover tests), the motor index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and Wolke's behavior ratings at 7 mo of age. RESULTS: There were no significant effects of any intervention in the group as a whole. However, infants of undernourished mothers [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) &lt; 18.5] who received early food supplementation performed slightly but significantly (P = 0.035) better on the support test than did infants of mothers who received usual food supplementation (z score: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.33). There were no benefits in infants of higher-BMI mothers (P = 0.024 for BMI x food interaction). Children of low-BMI mothers who received MMs had slightly better motor scores (z score: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.48) and activity ratings (z score: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.037, 0.45) than did those who received 30 mg Fe + 400 microg folate, whereas other children did not benefit (P = 0.05 for both motor scores and BMI x micronutrients and for activity and BMI x micronutrients). CONCLUSIONS: Small benefits from early food and MM supplementation were found in infants of low-BMI but not of high-BMI mothers. However, the benefits were of doubtful functional importance, and longer follow-up is required to determine programmatic implications.",M1
18284710,"Aetiological factors and perception of anaemia in Tunisian women of reproductive age.OBJECTIVES: To identify aetiological factors in anaemia and to explore knowledge, perceptions and attitudes towards anaemia. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional surveys and sixteen focus group discussions. SETTING: The two regions with the highest prevalence of anaemia in Tunisia, Greater Tunis (GT) and the South West (SW). SUBJECTS: Two representative samples of 687 (GT) and 729 (SW) women of reproductive age; 108 women were included in focus group discussions. RESULTS: Among anaemic women, 63.4% in the GT region and 80.2% in the SW displayed iron deficiency (ID). Genetic haemoglobinopathies accounted for 10.0% and 3.6% of the cases of anaemia in the two regions, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, the major factors for iron-deficiency anaemia were low dietary <e>Fe</e> intake (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 3.0, 8.4), drinking tea after eating (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.0, 5.7) and pica (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.1, 3.9). Most of the women related anaemia to the following causes: malnutrition, lack of hygiene, and their heavy workload and responsibilities in the household. Many women connected anaemia with hypotension. Few established a relationship between ID and anaemia. They had confidence in their doctor for treatment, but many complained they were not given sufficient information. Low dietary Fe intake, inappropriate food practices and inadequate perceptions contribute to the aetiology of anaemia in women. CONCLUSIONS: These results point out to the need for a strategy combining food fortification, Fe supplementation for pregnant women, nutritional education for the general public and at-risk specific target groups, and training of health professionals.",M1
18223381,"Enteral erythropoietin and iron stimulate erythropoiesis in suckling rats.OBJECTIVES: A primary objective was to evaluate whether addition of enteral iron supplementation will facilitate a systemic erythropoietic effect when feeding erythropoietin (Epo) to suckling rats. A secondary objective was to confirm that iron does not alter the previous finding that enteral Epo exerts local trophic effects on the small intestine. METHODS: Four-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent gastrostomy and were fed a cow's milk-based rat milk substitute for 8 days. We studied rats fed rat milk substitute alone (control), enteral Epo 425 U x kg(-1) x day(-1), and enteral Epo 1700 U x kg(-1) x day(-1), and the effects of oral iron sulfate (<e>Fe</e>) therapy (6 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)). Blood was collected to measure hemoglobin (Hb), reticulocytes, red cell indices, and zinc protoporphyrin/heme. To confirm previous work describing trophic effects of enteral Epo on the intestine, duodenal villous height was measured. RESULTS: Hb levels in control (84 +/- 1 g/L) were similar to Epo 425 (87 +/- 1 g/L). Hb levels in control+Fe (97 +/- 1 g/L), Epo 425+Fe (97 +/- 1 g/L), and Epo 1700 (94 +/- 1 g/L) were higher than control, P &lt; 0.001, but mean Hb level in Epo 1700+Fe was higher (105 +/- 1 g/L) than the other groups, P &lt; 0.003. Mean cell volume was higher in rats receiving iron supplementation, compared with those without iron, P &lt; 0.005. Duodenal villous height was taller in Epo 1700+Fe compared with control + Fe, P &lt; 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: If combined with sufficient iron supplementation, high-dose Epo artificially fed to suckling rats exerted a systemic erythropoietic effect in addition to the previously reported local trophic effects.",M1
18214021,"Iron absorption: comparison of prediction equations and reality. Results from a feeding trial in the Philippines.BACKGROUND: A number of algorithms have been developed that seek to predict the bioavailability of iron from mixed meals and diets, but their direct validity in predicting change in iron status remains questionable. Throughout the course of conducting a large feeding trial in convents in Manila, we collected weighed food-intake data and have the opportunity to directly compare the performance of these prediction equations. AIMS: The specific aims of this particular analysis are as follows: (a) to determine habitual intakes of macro- and micronutrients in religious sisters in Manila, (b) to determine the predicted efficiency of iron absorption from each of the published bioavailability algorithms (Monsen, Hallberg, Reddy, Tseng, Barghava, and Du), and (c) to determine which of these equations best predicts the actual  gain  in iron in religious sisters over the duration of the trial. DESIGN: The efficacy of consuming high-iron rice was tested during a nine-month feeding trial with a double-blinded dietary intervention; these results have been published [7]. Religious sisters living in 10 convents around metropolitan Manila, the Philippines were randomly assigned to consume either high-iron rice (3.21 mg/kg <e>Fe</e>) or a local variety of control rice (0.57 mg/kg Fe) within each convent. RESULTS: Religious sisters in convents consumed a diet that appeared to be typical of habitual intakes of macro-and micronutrients in this part of the Philippines. The analysis of the six equations revealed highly significant differences in predicted efficiency of iron absorption. The Hallberg, Monsen, and Reddy equations all predicted similar median efficiency (6.88, 7.92, and 6.42%). In contrast, Bhargava (4.68%), Tseng (3.23%), and Du (2.92%) were significantly lower. The correlation (r = 0.98) of Monsen to Hallberg was highly significant and the slope was not different than unity. The median efficiency of absorption based on the gain in body iron in 114 subjects over nine months, combined with an estimate of daily iron requirements, was 17.2%. Thus, none of these equations approximated the computed iron absorption based on improvement in serum ferritin and suggests alternative approaches to predicting iron accumulation from diet need to be formulated. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory factors in the prediction equations either had little effect or had too large of an effect on apparent bioavailability as compared to median absorption over a nine-month period. The causes of the lack of agreement between computed iron gain and predicted absorption are open to discussion and will need to be resolved.",M1
18184378,"Investigations on iron bioavailability of different sources and supply levels in piglets.Two experiments were conducted to investigate the iron bioavailability of different sources and supply levels in piglets. In experiment 1, the influence of feeding an iron deficient basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 28 ppm <e>Fe</e> either in form of Fe-chelate, crystalline Fe-glycinate, or Fe-sulphate on apparent iron digestibility and on blood parameters was determined. In experiment 2, a dose-response approach was used to determine the effects of supplementing an iron-deficient basal diet with 30, 60, or 90 ppm of Fe either in form of crystalline Fe-glycinate or Fe-sulphate on digestibility of Fe, growth and blood parameters. In experiment 1, comparison of iron sources revealed a tendency (0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.1) for a higher Fe digestibility from Fe-glycinate (40.9%) compared with Fe-chelate (30.8%) or Fe-sulphate (30.7%). Fe-balance was higher (p &lt; 0.05) for Fe-glycinate compared with Fe-sulphate but iron balance was similar for iron sulphate and iron chelate. Those results, however, were not reflected in data of blood parameters. In experiment 2, iron digestibility, blood parameters and performance were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced by iron supply. Effects of iron source on digestibility of iron were lower than observed in the first experiment.",M1
18004661,"Bioavailability of calcium, iron and zinc fortified whole wheat flour chapatti.The bioavailability and interactive effects of calcium, iron and zinc fortified whole wheat flour chapattis on female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were determined. The whole wheat flour was fortified with CaCO3, FeSO4 and ZnSO4 at 1000, 40 and 20 mg/kg, respectively and fed to 64 female Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks. Retention of Ca, <e>Fe</e> and Zn was determined in plasma, femur and liver tissues. Ca levels in plasma and liver did not alter significantly while the Ca retention in femur changed significantly with the change in fortificants. The calcium retention was higher in the femur of rats fed on the diet supplemented with Ca + Zn (221 +/- 13.61 mg/g) than the rats fed on the diet supplemented with Ca + Fe (219 +/- 18.92 mg/g). The iron in plasma, liver and femur ranged from 2.19 +/- 0.11 to 2.77 +/- 0.10 microg/ml, 203.5 +/- 13.24 to 251.5 +/- 17.19 microg/g and 43.5 +/- 1.05 to 52 +/- 2.07 microg/g while zinc content ranged from 1.31 +/- 0.089 to 1.55 +/- 0.114 microg/ml, 89.5 +/- 3.41 to 132 +/- 6.10 microg/g and 175 +/- 8.29 to 191 +/- 10.85 microg/g, respectively. The minerals interacted with each other resulting in decrease of bioavailability among each other. The absorption was higher in the rats fed on fortified diet than those fed on unfortified chapatti diet. Hence, it is concluded that fortification of whole wheat flour is feasible to overcome the Ca, Fe and Zn malnutrition in the vulnerable groups.",M1
17925056,"Dietary exposure and trends of exposure to nutrient elements iodine, iron, selenium and sodium from the 2003-4 New Zealand Total Diet Survey.The mean dietary exposure to the nutrient elements iodine, <e>Fe</e>, Se and Na by eight age-sex groups of the New Zealand population was estimated from foods purchased and prepared as for consumption. A total of 968 samples comprising 121 foods were collected and analysed. Mean daily exposures were calculated from mean concentration levels of the selected nutrients in each food combined with simulated diets for a 25+-year-old male and female, a 19-24-year-old male, a 11-14-year-old boy and girl, a 5-6-year-old child, a 1-3-year-old toddler and a 6-12-month-old infant. Food concentrations and dietary exposures are reported and compared with nutrient reference values (for example, recommended daily intakes, adequate intakes or upper limits). Dietary iodine exposures for all age-sex groups were well below recommended levels and have steadily decreased since 1982, raising concern especially for the physical and mental development of infants and young children. Fe exposures meet the recommended daily intake for the average male and 11-14 year olds but are only about half that recommended for adult females. Se exposure is about 20 % less than optimal for females. Na exposures, excluding discretionary salt, are above the acceptable exposure level for all age-sex groups, and exceed the upper intake limits for 25+-year-old males, 19-24-year-old young males, and 11-14-year-old boys and girls by up to 125 % for an average consumer.",M1
17825453,"Iron preloading aggravates nutritional steatohepatitis in rats by increasing apoptotic cell death.BACKGROUND/AIMS: High serum ferritin and liver iron concentrations were found in some patients with NASH, suggesting a role for iron as a co-factor that aggravates liver injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of parenteral iron in a rat model of NASH induced by a methionine choline deficient diet (MCDD). METHODS: Wistar rats were divided into 1 - Control, 2 - Iron (<e>Fe</e>), 3 - MCDD, 4 - MCDD&amp;Fe groups. Iron dextran 100mg/kg was administered intra-muscularly in groups 2 and 4. All rats were fed MCDD, Groups 1 and 2 were supplied with choline and methionine. Blood and tissue samples were obtained after 4weeks. RESULTS: The iron injection alone did not affect the liver whereas MCDD led to steatohepatitis. Iron worsened steatosis without any obvious effect on accompanying inflammation. It aggravated tissue injury by increasing apoptosis. Liver fibrosis was observed only in 3 out of 10 rats in the MCDD&amp;Fe group. CONCLUSIONS: Observation of liver fibrosis only in the MCDD&amp;Fe group suggests that iron induced increase in apoptosis contributes to the development of fibrosis at an earlier time than expected.",M1
17764597,"Viable, lyophilized lactobacilli do not increase iron absorption from a lactic acid-fermented meal in healthy young women, and no iron absorption occurs in the distal intestine.Lactic acid-fermented foods have been shown to increase <e>Fe</e> absorption in human subjects, possibly by lowering pH, activation of phytases, production of organic acids, or by the viable lactic acid bacteria. In this study the effect of a heat-inactivated lactic acid-fermented oat gruel with and without added viable, lyophilized Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on non-haem Fe absorption was investigated. Furthermore, Fe absorption in the distal intestine was determined. In a randomized, double-blinded crossover trial eighteen healthy young women aged 22 (SD 3) years with low Fe status (serum ferritin &lt; 30 microg/l) were served the two test gruels, extrinsically labelled with 59Fe and served with two enterocoated capsules (containing 55Fe(II) and 55Fe(III), respectively) designed to disintegrate in the ileum. The meals were consumed on two consecutive days, e.g. in the order AA followed by BB in a second period. Non-haem Fe absorption was determined from 59Fe whole-body retention and isotope activities in blood samples. The concentrations of Fe, lactate, phytate, and polyphenols, and the pH were similar in the heat-inactivated lactic acid-fermented oat gruels with and without added L. plantarum 299v, and no difference in Fe absorption was observed between the test gruels (1.4 and 1.3%, respectively). Furthermore, no absorption of Fe in the distal intestine was observed. In conclusion, addition of viable, lyophilized lactobacillus to a heat-inactivated lactic acid-fermented oat gruel does not affect Fe absorption, and no absorption seems to occur in the distal part of the intestine from low Fe bioavailability meals in these women.",M1
17524184,"Haem and non-haem iron intake through 17 years of adult life of a British Birth Cohort.An investigation was carried out to determine whether there were significant changes in the intake of haem and non-haem <e>Fe</e> of adult men and women in the UK from 1982 (aged 36 years) to 1999 (aged 53 years). The 1253 subjects studied were members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development; a longitudinal study of a nationally representative cohort of births in 1946. Food intake was recorded in a 5-d diary at age 36 years in 1982, 43 years in 1989 and 53 years in 1999. Outcome measures were mean intakes of total Fe, haem and non-haem Fe, by year, gender and food source. There were significant changes in total Fe, haem Fe and non-haem Fe intake over the three time points. Total Fe intake was significantly higher in 1989 than in 1982 or 1999 for both men and women but haem Fe was significantly lower in 1999 mainly due to a 40% fall in haem Fe from beef during this period. Haem Fe from processed meats fell by more than 50% between 1989 and 1999 but that from poultry rose by more than 50%. Cereal foods remained the most important source of non-haem Fe and the contribution from breakfast cereals rose relative to that of bread over the 17 years. Several factors could be responsible for these changes, particularly the importance of the epidemic of BSE from 1990. The possible advantages of a lower haem Fe intake in older subjects are discussed.",M1
17440529,"Oxalic acid does not influence nonhaem iron absorption in humans: a comparison of kale and spinach meals.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of oxalic acid (OA) on nonhaem iron absorption in humans. DESIGN: Two randomized crossover stable iron isotope absorption studies. SETTING: Zurich, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: Sixteen apparently healthy women (18-45 years, &lt;60 kg body weight), recruited by poster advertizing from the staff and student populations of the ETH, University and University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland. Thirteen subjects completed both studies. METHODS: Iron absorption was measured based on erythrocyte incorporation of (57)<e>Fe</e> or (58)Fe 14 days after the administration of labelled meals. In study I, test meals consisted of two wheat bread rolls (100 g) and either 150 g spinach with a native OA content of 1.27 g (reference meal) or 150 g kale with a native OA content of 0.01 g. In study II, 150 g kale given with a potassium oxalate drink to obtain a total OA content of 1.27 g was compared to the spinach meal. RESULTS: After normalization for the spinach reference meal absorption, geometric mean iron absorption from wheat bread rolls with kale (10.7%) did not differ significantly from wheat rolls with kale plus 1.26 g OA added as potassium oxalate (11.5%, P=0.86). Spinach was significantly higher in calcium and polyphenols than kale and absorption from the spinach meal was 24% lower compared to the kale meal without added OA, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.16). CONCLUSION: Potassium oxalate did not influence iron absorption in humans from a kale meal and our findings strongly suggest that OA in fruits and vegetables is of minor relevance in iron nutrition.",M1
17350802,"New insights about iron bioavailability inhibition by zinc.OBJECTIVE: We measured the effects of lower and higher doses of zinc (Zn) given as an aqueous solution on the bioavailability of iron (<e>Fe</e>). METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects received a solution with 0.5 mg of elemental Fe as ferrous sulfate given alone or with 0.59 mg of Zn as zinc sulfate (molar ratio Zn:Fe 1:1). Fourteen days after they received a second solution with 10 mg of Fe given alone or with 11.71 mg of Zn (molar ratio Zn:Fe 1:1). Iron bioavailability was assessed by erythrocyte incorporation of iron radioisotopes (55)Fe and (59)Fe. RESULTS: No significant effect of Zn on Fe bioavailability was observed at lower doses; however, at higher doses Fe bioavailability was inhibited by 56% (P &lt; 0.001, repeated measures analysis of variance). CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of Zn on Fe bioavailability depends on the total amount of both minerals present in the intestinal lumen. This fact should be considered when designing a supplementation program if Fe and Zn are to be provided together.",M1
17349663,"Blood mononucleocytes are sensitive to the DNA damaging effects of iron overload--in vitro and ex vivo results with human and rat cells.Iron exposure enhances colorectal carcinogeneis, by producing reactive oxygen species, which damage lipids, proteins and DNA. We recently demonstrated that ferric-nitrilotriacetate (<e>Fe</e>-NTA) damages DNA of human colon cells in different stages of malignant transformation. Opposed to this, little is known on systemic effects of iron and it is still difficult to determine the border between essential iron supplementation and iron overload in humans. The aim of this study was to determine whether Fe-NTA causes global and specific DNA damage in peripheral leucocytes. Human leucocytes were treated in vitro with Fe-NTA for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed (6 weeks) with an iron-overload diet (9.9 g Fe/kg DM) and whole blood was collected. DNA damage was measured in human and rat blood cells using the alkaline version of the Comet Assay with repair specific enzymes. In human cells the distribution of TP53 in the comet images was detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (Comet FISH) to measure DNA damage in the region of the TP53 gene. Fe-NTA (10-500 microM) was clearly genotoxic in human leucocytes in vitro, and also in leucocytes of rats fed the iron overload diet. The induced damage in human leucocytes was approximately two-fold that observed previously in human colon cells. Oxidized bases were induced by iron in rat leucocytes in vivo, while they were not induced in human leucocytes in vitro. Fe-NTA enhanced the migration of TP53 signals into the comet tail of human leucocytes, indicating a high susceptibility of this tumour-relevant gene towards DNA damage induced by iron overload. In conclusion, iron markedly induced DNA damage in human and rat leucocytes, which shows that these white blood cells are sufficiently sensitive to assess exposure to iron. The measurement of DNA damage in human leucocytes could be used as a sensitive biomarker to study iron overload in vivo in humans and thus to determine whether supplementation results in genotoxic risk.",M1
17311949,"Synthesis, characterization, and bioavailability in rats of ferric phosphate nanoparticles.Particle size is a determinant of iron (<e>Fe</e>) absorption from poorly soluble Fe compounds. Decreasing the particle size of metallic Fe and ferric pyrophosphate added to foods increases Fe absorption. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize nanoparticles of FePO(4) and determine their bioavailability and potential toxicity in rats. Amorphous FePO(4) nanopowders with spherical structure were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). The nanopowders were characterized and compared with commercially available FePO(4) and FeSO(4), including measurements of specific surface area (SSA), structure by transmission electron microscopy, in vitro solubility at pH 1 and 2, and relative bioavailability value (RBV) to FeSO(4) in rats using the hemoglobin repletion method. In the latter, the potential toxicity after Fe repletion was assessed by histological examination and measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The commercial FePO(4) and the 2 FePO(4) produced by FSP (mean particle sizes, 30.5 and 10.7 nm) had the following characteristics: SSA: 32.6, 68.6, 194.7 m(2)/g; in vitro solubility after 30 min at pH 1: 73, 79, and 85% of FeSO(4); and RBV: 61, 70, and 96%, respectively. In the histological examinations and TBARS analysis, there were no indications of toxicity. In conclusion, nanoparticles of FePO(4) have a solubility and RBV not significantly different from FeSO(4). Reducing poorly soluble Fe compounds to nanoscale may increase their value for human nutrition.",M1
17234227,"Iron supplement prevents lead-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier during rat development.Children are known to be venerable to lead (Pb) toxicity. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) in immature brain is particularly vulnerable to Pb insults. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Pb exposure damaged the integrity of the BBB in young animals and iron (<e>Fe</e>) supplement may prevent against Pb-induced BBB disruption. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Three groups of rats were exposed to Pb in drinking water containing 342 microg Pb/mL as Pb acetate, among which two groups were concurrently administered by oral gavage once every other day with 7 mg Fe/kg and 14 mg Fe/kg as FeSO(4) solution as the low and high Fe treatment group, respectively, for 6 weeks. The control group received sodium acetate in drinking water. Pb exposure significantly increased Pb concentrations in blood by 6.6-folds (p&lt;0.05) and brain tissues by 1.5-2.0-folds (p&lt;0.05) as compared to controls. Under the electron microscope, Pb exposure in young animals caused an extensive extravascular staining of lanthanum nitrate in brain parenchyma, suggesting a leakage of cerebral vasculature. Western blot showed that Pb treatment led to 29-68% reduction (p&lt;0.05) in the expression of occludin as compared to the controls. Fe supplement among Pb-exposed rats maintained the normal ultra-structure of the BBB and restored the expression of occludin to normal levels. Moreover, the low dose Fe supplement significantly reduced Pb levels in blood and brain tissues. These data suggest that Pb exposure disrupts the structure of the BBB in young animals. The increased BBB permeability may facilitate the accumulation of Pb. Fe supplement appears to protect the integrity of the BBB against Pb insults, a beneficial effect that may have significant clinical implications.",M1
17225920,"Improved iron bioavailability in an oat-based beverage: the combined effect of citric acid addition, dephytinization and iron supplementation.BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency in children is a major worldwide nutritional problem. An oat beverage was developed for 1- to 3-year-old children and different treatments were used to improve the iron bioavailability. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of citric acid addition, phytase treatment and supplementation with different iron compounds on non-heme iron absorption in human from a mineral-supplemented oat-based beverage. METHODS: A 240 g portion of a 55Fe-labeled test product (T) or a 59Fe-labeled reference dose (R) was served as breakfast after overnight fasting on four consecutive days in the order of TRRT. On day 18 the retention of 59Fe was measured by a whole-body counter and the erythrocytes uptake of 55Fe and 59Fe by a liquid-scintillation counter. Forty-two healthy subjects (men and women) were randomized into four study groups, members of each being given one of the studied four products (A, B, C, and D) supplemented with <e>Fe</e> (1.3 mg/portion), Zn, Ca, Se and P. Ferric ammonium citrate (FeAC) was added to products A, B, and C and ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) to product D. Citric acid (60 mg/portion) was added to products B, C, and D and phytase treatment applied to products C and D. RESULTS: Citric acid improved iron absorption by 54% from 3.9% in product A to 6.0% in product B (p = 0.051). Phytase treatment increased iron absorption by 78% (from 6.0 to 10.7%, p = 0.003) by reducing the phytate-phosphorus content per portion from 16.3 mg in product B to 2.8 mg in product C. The two compounds gave similar iron absorption rates (p = 0.916). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of citric acid addition, dephytinization and iron supplementation significantly increased the iron absorption in an oat-based beverage. Such a beverage can be useful in the prevention of iron deficiency in 1- to 3-year-old children.",M1
17209188,"Effect of high-dose iron supplements on fractional zinc absorption and status in pregnant women.BACKGROUND: Women have an increased risk of iron deficiency during pregnancy because of the demands of the developing fetus. Iron supplements are commonly advocated as a prophylactic treatment and are generally taken with meals to reduce side effects, but iron can interfere with the absorption of zinc. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effect of consuming an iron supplement (100 mg <e>Fe</e>/d as ferrous gluconate) with meals from 16 wk gestation to term on zinc status and absorption. DESIGN: Stable-isotope techniques were used to measure zinc status (exchangeable zinc pool, EZP) and fractional zinc absorption (FZA) in early and late pregnancy from a meal consumed at a different time from that of iron supplement or placebo consumption in 6 women given iron supplements and 7 given a placebo. RESULTS: FZA increased during pregnancy, independent of iron supplementation. FZA was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) at week 34 than at weeks 16 and 24, and urinary zinc excretion was higher at week 34 than at week 16 (P = 0.02). The size of the EZP remained unchanged throughout pregnancy and was unaffected by iron supplementation. The iron status of iron-supplemented women was higher than that of the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In iron-replete pregnant women who consumed a Western diet, no detectable adverse effects on zinc metabolism were observed after ingestion of 100 mg Fe/d. An increase in the efficiency of zinc absorption was observed during late pregnancy.",M1
17181889,"Levels of serum transferrin receptor and its response to <e>Fe</e>-supplement in Fe-deficient children.The object of the present study was to investigate the levels of serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) and its response to Fe supplementation in Fe-deficient children and the role of sTfR in detecting Fe deficiency and assessing the efficacy of Fe supplementation. According to the diagnostic standard, 1006 children, aged 6-14 years in Fangshan district, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China, were divided into four groups: normal; Fe store depletion (IDs); Fe deficiency erythropoiesis (IDE); Fe deficiency anaemia (IDA). sTfR was determined and transferrin receptor-ferritin (TfR-F) index was calculated in 238 children, sixty-four normal and 174 Fe deficient. Children were administered a NaFeEDTA capsule containing 60 mg Fe once per week for the IDs and IDE groups and three times per week for the IDA group for nine consecutive weeks. The parameters reflecting Fe status and sTfR were determined before and after Fe supplementation. The levels of sTfR and TfR-F index in Fe-deficient children were significantly higher than those in the normal group. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that sTfR has proper diagnostic efficacy for functional Fe deficiency. After Fe supplementation, the level of sTfR was significantly decreased in children with IDs, but not in children with IDE and IDA, while TfR-F index was significantly decreased in Fe-deficient children. sTfR is a reliable indicator for detecting functional Fe deficiency, and TfR-F index is a sensitive parameter for assessing the efficacy of Fe supplementation.",M1
17010238,"Risk of iron overload in carriers of genetic mutations associated with hereditary haemochromatosis: UK Food Standards Agency workshop.The UK Food Standards Agency convened a group of expert scientists to review current research investigating diet and carriers of genetic mutations associated with hereditary haemochromatosis. The workshop concluded that individuals who are heterozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene do not appear to respond abnormally to dietary <e>Fe</e> and therefore do not need to change their diet to prevent accumulation of body Fe.",M1
17010230,"Lactic acid fermentation stimulated iron absorption by Caco-2 cells is associated with increased soluble iron content in carrot juice.An in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model was applied to explore the impact of lactic acid (LA) fermentation by Lactobacillus pentosus FSC1 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides FSC2 on the <e>Fe</e> bioavailability of carrot juice. The redox state of Fe in fermented carrot juice was also assessed as a crucial factor for absorption. LA fermentation was shown to improve mineral solubility to different extents at simulated physiological conditions: Mn (2-fold); Fe (1.5-1.7-fold); Zn (1.2-fold); Cu (1-fold). Soluble Fe2+ was increased about 16-fold by LA fermentation, and about one third of the Fe2+ remained soluble after in vitro digestion (about 4-5-fold higher than in fresh juice). Data on cell-line studies showed a 4-fold increase in the efficiency of Fe uptake, but not in transepithelial transfer by Caco2 cells, as a result of fermentation. The increases in Fe2+ level and the efficiency of cellular Fe uptake were strain-dependent. To sum up the effect on both Fe solubility and cellular uptake efficiency, the amount of cellularly absorbed Fe from Ln. mesenteroides FSC2-fermented juice was about 20 % higher than that from L. pentosus FSC1-fermented juice (22.7 v. 19.2 microg/l juice per mg protein). To conclude, LA fermentation enhanced Fe absorption by Caco-2 cells from carrot juice because of increases in not only Fe solubility after digestion, but also the efficiency of cellular Fe uptake. The fermentation-improved efficiency of Fe uptake was possibly due to the increased level of soluble Fe2+ rather than a being a strain-specific event.",M1
16881908,"Household dietary strategies to enhance the content and bioavailability of iron, zinc and calcium of selected rice- and maize-based Philippine complementary foods.Philippine complementary foods are predominantly plant-based, with a low content of readily available iron, zinc, and calcium, and a relatively high amount of phytate, a potent inhibitor of mineral absorption. Some of the phytate is water soluble, and hence can be removed by soaking. In this study we have compared the iron, zinc, and calcium content, and estimated iron and zinc bioavailability of rice- and maize-based Filipino complementary foods prepared with and without soaking and/or enrichment with chicken liver, egg yolk, small soft-boned fish, and mung bean grits. Analysis of iron, zinc, and calcium were performed by atomic absorption spectrometry, and phytate (based on hexa-(IP6) and penta-inositol phosphate (IP5) by HPLC; corresponding [Phy]/[<e>Fe</e>] and [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios were calculated as predictors of iron and zinc bioavailability. Addition of chicken liver, followed by egg yolk, resulted in the greatest increases in iron and zinc content for both the rice- and maize-based complementary foods, whereas addition of small dried fish with bones had the greatest effect on calcium. The IP5 + IP6 content and [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios were higher in the maize- than rice-based complementary foods, and were reduced by soaking, although only the maize plus mung bean grits, with and without soaking, had [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios above 15. Enrichment with animal protein or soaking has the potential to enhance the content of absorbable iron, zinc, and probably calcium to varying degrees in rice- and maize-based Philippine complementary foods.",M1
16869994,"A lactic acid-fermented oat gruel increases non-haem iron absorption from a phytate-rich meal in healthy women of childbearing age.Lactic acid-fermented foods have been shown to increase <e>Fe</e> absorption in human subjects, possibly by lowering pH, activation of phytases, and formation of soluble complexes of Fe and organic acids. We tested the effect of an oat gruel fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on non-haem Fe absorption from a low-Fe bioavailability meal compared with a pasteurised, fermented oat gruel and non-fermented oat gruels. In a cross-over trial twenty-four healthy women with a mean age of 25 (sd 4) years were served (A) fermented gruel, (B) pasteurised fermented gruel, (C) pH-adjusted non-fermented gruel, and (D) non-fermented gruel with added organic acids. The meals were extrinsically labelled with 55Fe or 59Fe and consumed on 4 consecutive days, for example, in the order ABBA or BAAB followed by CDDC or DCCD in a second period. Fe absorption was determined from isotope activities in blood samples. The fermented gruel with live L. plantarum 299v increased Fe absorption significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with the pasteurised and non-fermented gruels. The lactic acid concentration in the fermented gruel was 19 % higher than in the pasteurised gruel, but the Fe absorption was increased by 50 %. In the gruel with organic acids, the lactic acid concentration was 52 % lower than in the pasteurised gruel, with no difference in Fe absorption. The fermented gruel increased non-haem Fe absorption from a phytate-rich meal in young women, indicating a specific effect of live L. plantarum 299v and not only an effect of the organic acids.",M1
16844240,"The effects of dietary iron concentration on gastrointestinal and branchial assimilation of both iron and cadmium in zebrafish (Danio rerio).Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were fed either a diet containing 33mgFekg(-1) (low) or 95mgFekg(-1) (normal) for 10 weeks, after which short-term Cd and <e>Fe</e> uptake by the gastrointestinal tract and gill was assessed. Carcass metal content and transcript levels of the iron importer, Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1) and an iron exporter, ferroportin1, in both the gastrointestinal tract and gill were also measured. Fish fed the low Fe diet accumulated 13 times more Cd into their livers via the gastrointestinal tract than those fed the normal Fe diet. However, no significant increase in liver Fe accumulation was measured. Concomitantly, when exposed to 48nmolCdL(-1) fish fed the low Fe diet exhibited a approximately 4-fold increase in Cd accumulation on the gill and in the liver, compared to those fed a normal diet. In addition, fish fed the low Fe diet also significantly accumulated more Fe on the gill (nine-fold increase) and into the carcass (four-fold increase) when exposed to 96nmolFeL(-1), compared to fish fed a normal diet. Surprisingly, carcass Fe, Ca and Mg concentrations were increased in fish fed the low Fe diet, which suggests that Fe body levels may not be a good indicator of whether a fish is more or less susceptible to increased non-essential metal accumulation via an Fe uptake pathway. However, significantly elevated transcript levels of DMT1 and ferroportin1 (2.7- and 3.8-fold induction, respectively) were seen in the gastrointestinal tract, and DMT1 in the gills (1.8-fold induction) of zebrafish fed a low Fe diet. The correlation between Cd uptake and DMT1 expression suggests that one route of uptake of Cd, either from the diet or from the water, could be via DMT1.",M1
16825689,"Iron absorption by healthy women is not associated with either serum or urinary prohepcidin.BACKGROUND: Although hepcidin is proposed as a regulator of iron absorption, this has not been assessed in humans. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the relation between serum or urinary prohepcidin and iron absorption in healthy premenopausal women. DESIGN: The subjects were 28 healthy women aged 22-51 y with normal hemoglobin concentrations (120-152 g/L). Absorption of 0.5 mg <e>Fe</e> with 0.2 microCi 59Fe tracer, both as FeSO4, was measured by whole-body scintillation counting 13 d after oral administration. Fasting blood and urine samples were collected the day of and 16 wk after the absorption measurement. Serum and urinary prohepcidin concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using an antibody against amino acid residues 28-47 of the proregion. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) iron absorption was 36 +/- 19% (range: 4-81%), and serum ferritin (geometric x) was 27 microg/L (range: 4-122 microg/L), as commonly observed in healthy premenopausal women. Serum prohepcidin was 196 microg/L (range: 99-376 microg/L) and, in contrast with urinary prohepcidin, was relatively consistent for the women between 0 and 16 wk. Serum prohepcidin correlated directly with serum ferritin (R2 = 0.28, P &lt; 0.01) but was unrelated to 59Fe absorption, in contrast to serum ferritin (R2 = 0.33, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum prohepcidin concentrations were relatively stable within subjects and correlated with serum ferritin. However, unlike serum ferritin, neither serum nor urinary prohepcidin concentrations were related to iron absorption in healthy women.",M1
16772458,"Serum iron curves can be used to estimate dietary iron bioavailability in humans.Erythrocyte incorporation of isotopic iron (<e>Fe</e>) is the standard method for assessing iron bioavailability, but the process is expensive, technically difficult, and gives no information on the kinetics of absorption. The main objective of this study was to validate serum Fe curves as measures of dietary iron absorption because previous work demonstrated that serum iron curves can be generated with iron doses as low as 5-20 mg and that up to 20 mg iron can be added to meals without affecting relative absorption. In 3 studies, groups (n = 10, 10, 21) of Fe-deficient, mildly anemic women consumed meals of varying calculated Fe bioavailability, with and without added ferric chloride (10 mg Fe). Blood samples were collected at baseline and every 30 min for 4 h after the meal. Serum Fe concentrations were measured. Areas under the serum Fe curves and peak concentrations were used in different models to estimate Fe absorption and uptake. In 21 subjects, (58)Fe-enriched ferric chloride was added to the meals, and blood was taken 2 wk later to calculate red cell isotope incorporation. The addition of 10 mg Fe to test meals produced measurable serum iron curves even when the meal Fe bioavailability was low. Serum Fe curves were highly reproducible and were affected as expected by food composition. Even the single measurement at the estimated time of peak iron concentration was correlated significantly with erythrocyte incorporation of (58)Fe (r = 0.72, P &lt; 0.0001). Hence the extent and rate of absorption of nonheme iron from meals, rather than in individuals, can be investigated with such subjects without the need for isotopes.",M1
16688480,"Formulation and sensory evaluation of Prosopis alba (Algarrobo) pulp cookies with increased iron and calcium dialyzabilities.Prosopis alba (algarrobo) is an important indigenous specie, which fruits are used as food and feed since ancient times. Cookies containing algarrobo pulp (AP) with increased iron and calcium availabilities were formulated and sensory evaluated. AP is preferred as food ingredient because of its high sugar content and pleasant flavour. Formulated cookies mean proximal composition was 8.9 g/100 g protein, 7.2 g/100 g dietary fiber, 25 g/100 g total sugar, and 18.5 g/100 g crude fat with iron and calcium contents 30 ppm and 340 ppm, respectively. Ascorbic (AA) and citric (CA) acids at different mM acid: mM <e>Fe</e> were added in order to increase mineral availabilities being evaluated by an in vitro method. Those ratios were 5:1 and 10:1 for AA:Fe whereas for CA:Fe were 50:1 and 100:1 and combinations of them. After chosen the best AA:Fe and CA:Fe ratios (5:1 and 50:1, respectively), sensory evaluation with trained sensory panel and a consumer acceptability test with one hundred and seventy untrained judges were carried out. Acceptability test showed that 77.65% of the people (&lt; 25 years old 41.76%, 25-50 years old 20.00% and &gt; 50 years old 15.89%) tasting final formulated cookies indicated that they  like very much  or  moderately like  and there were not consumers rejecting them.",M1
16672076,"Biofortification of essential nutritional compounds and trace elements in rice and cassava.Plant biotechnology can make important contributions to food security and nutritional improvement. For example, the development of 'Golden Rice' by Professor Ingo Potrykus was a milestone in the application of gene technology to deliver both increased nutritional qualities and health improvement to wide sections of the human population. Mineral nutrient and protein deficiency as well as food security remain the most important challenges for developing countries. Current projects are addressing these issues in two major staple crops, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and rice. The tropical root crop cassava is a major source of food for approximately 600 million of the population worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa &gt;200 million of the population rely on cassava as their major source of dietary energy. The nutritional quality of the cassava root is not sufficient to meet all dietary needs. Rice is the staple food for half the world population, providing approximately 20% of the per capita energy and 13% of the protein for human consumption worldwide. In many developing countries the dietary contributions of rice are substantially greater (29.3% dietary energy and 29.1% dietary protein). The current six most popular 'mega' rice varieties (in terms of popularity and acreage), including Chinese hybrid rice, have an incomplete amino acid profile and contain limited amounts of essential micronutrients. Rice lines with improved <e>Fe</e> contents have been developed using genes that have functions in Fe absorption, translocation and accumulation in the plant, as well as improved Fe bioavailability in the human intestine. Current developments in biotechnology-assisted plant improvement are reviewed and the potential of the technology in addressing human nutrition and health are discussed.",M1
16571151,"Iron solubility compared with in vitro digestion-Caco-2 cell culture method for the assessment of iron bioavailability in a processed and unprocessed complementary food for Tanzanian infants (6-12 months).The <e>Fe</e> solubility test is a commonly used, easy and relatively cheap in vitro tool for predicting Fe bioavailability in food matrices. However, the outcome of a recent field trial comparing the effect on Fe status of Tanzanian infants of processed v. unprocessed complementary foods (CF), with otherwise the same composition, challenged the validity of this test for predicting Fe bioavailability. In the solubility test, significant more soluble Fe was observed in processed compared with unprocessed foods (mean 18.8 (sem 0.21) v. 4.8 (sem 0.23) %; P&lt;0.001). However, in the field trial, no significant difference in Fe status was seen between processed and unprocessed CF groups after 6 months' follow-up. Therefore, twenty-four samples of these CF (twelve processed and twelve unprocessed batches) were analysed in triplicate for Fe availability using an in vitro digestion-Caco-2 cell culture method and results were compared with solubility results. Significantly more soluble Fe was presented to Caco-2 cells in the processed compared with unprocessed samples (mean 11.5 (sem 1.16) v. 8.5 (sem 2.54) %; P=0.028), but proportionally less Fe was taken up by the cells (mean 3.0 (sem 0.40) v. 11.7 (sem 2.22) %; P=0.007). As a net result, absolute Fe uptake was lower (not significantly) in processed compared with unprocessed CF (mean 1.3 (sem 0.16) v. 3.4 (sem 0.83) nmol/mg cell protein; P=0.052). These data clearly demonstrate that the Fe solubility test was not a good indicator of Fe bioavailability in these particular food matrices.

16522928,"Cooking and <e>Fe</e> fortification have different effects on Fe bioavailability of bread and tortillas.OBJECTIVE: To identify iron sources for wheat- (WF) and corn-flour (CF) fortification taking into account the effect of cooking. METHODS: Sixty-six Fe-depleted rats were replete with various Fe sources. Fe bioavailability and utilization in wheat bread (WB) and corn tortillas (CT) fortified with various Fe sources was assessed after the depletion and repletion periods. RESULTS: Baking decreased the phytates content of WF by 97%. Improvements in Hb and FeHb were greater in rats fed unfortified WB than in those fed unfortified WF. Fe fortification had no benefit. In contrast, phytates content was unchanged by tortilla preparation, but fortification improved iron availability. Iron bioavailability indicators were best in rats fed CT fortified with ferrous sulfate and NaFe(III)EDTA than in those fed unfortified CT or CT plus reduced Fe. CONCLUSION: We concluded that baking WF bread improved the bioavailability of native Fe with no further effect of fortification. Pan-cooking of lime-treated CF did not improve Fe bioavailability, but addition of Ferrous sulfate or NaFe(III)EDTA did it, despite the high phytate and calcium content of tortillas.",M1
16522913,"Diet-induced iron deficiency anemia and pregnancy outcome in rhesus monkeys.BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is relatively common in the third trimester of pregnancy, but causal associations with low birth weight and compromised neonatal iron status are difficult to establish in human populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of diet-induced IDA on intrauterine growth and neonatal iron status in an appropriate animal model for third-trimester IDA in women. DESIGN: Hematologic and iron-status measures, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal and neonatal evaluations were compared between pregnant rhesus monkeys (n = 14) fed a diet containing 10 microg <e>Fe</e>/g diet from the time of pregnancy detection (gestation days 28-30) and controls (n = 24) fed 100 microg Fe/g diet. RESULTS: By the third trimester, 79% of the iron-deprived dams and 29% of the control monkeys had a hemoglobin concentration &lt;11 g/dL. There were also significant group differences in hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and serum iron. At birth, the newborns of monkeys iron-deprived during pregnancy had significantly lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin values and a lower ratio of erythroid to total colony-forming units in bone marrow than did the control newborns. Pregnancy weight gain did not differ significantly between the iron-deprived and control dams, and the fetuses and newborns of the iron-deprived dams were not growth retarded relative to the controls. Gestation length, the number of stillbirths, and neonatal neurobehavioral test scores did not differ significantly by diet group. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that an inadequate intake of iron from the diet during pregnancy in rhesus monkeys can lead to compromised hematologic status of the neonate without indications of growth retardation or impaired neurologic function at birth.",M1
16400057,"Iron absorption from soybean ferritin in nonanemic women.BACKGROUND: Dietary ferritin, a protein cage around an iron mineral, is an underestimated source of bioavailable iron. Plant ferritin, the most common dietary ferritin, has not been studied. Iron from animal ferritin is absorbed as well as is iron from FeSO4 in women. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine iron absorption from purified soybean ferritin. DESIGN: Healthy, nonanemic women (n = 16) were fed a standardized meal (bagel, cream cheese, and apple juice) containing 1 microCi 59Fe/meal as FeSO4 or (extrinsically labeled) as iron-free soybean ferritin reconstituted with the high phosphate characteristic of plant ferritin (iron:phosphorus = 4:1). Iron-free, apo-soybean ferritin was prepared (with the use of thioglycolic acid and extensive dialysis) from purified ferritin. In a randomized crossover design, the other labeled meal, which contained FeSO4 or ferritin, was given after 4 wk. The subjects received 140 microg <e>Fe</e> as ferritin (2.5 mg) or as FeSO4. After 28 d, whole-body 59Fe and 59Fe in red blood cells were measured before and after dosing. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in whole-body iron absorption from soybean ferritin (29.9 +/- 19.8%) and that from FeSO4 (34.3 +/- 23.6%) or in iron absorption calculated from red blood cell incorporation (33.0 +/- 20.1% for soybean ferritin and 35.3 +/- 23.4% for FeSO4), which confirmed previous results with animal ferritin that was mineralized and labeled similarly. An inverse relation was observed between serum ferritin and iron absorption from both ferritin and FeSO4, which suggested that sensors regulating iron absorption respond similarly to iron provided as ferrous salts or as ferritin mineral. CONCLUSION: Iron from soybean ferritin is well absorbed and may provide a model for novel, utilizable, plant-based forms of iron for populations with a low iron status.",M1
16332661,"Comparison of the efficacy of wheat-based snacks fortified with ferrous sulfate, electrolytic iron, or hydrogen-reduced elemental iron: randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in Thai women.BACKGROUND: Although elemental iron powders are widely used to fortify cereal products, little data exist on their efficacy in humans. OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of wheat-based snacks fortified with ferrous sulfate, electrolytic iron, or hydrogen-reduced iron in Thai women with low iron stores. DESIGN: A double-blind intervention was conducted in 18-50-y-old women (n = 330) randomly assigned into 4 groups to receive either no fortification iron or 12 mg <e>Fe</e>/d for 6 d/wk for 35 wk as ferrous sulfate, electrolytic iron, or hydrogen-reduced iron in a baked, wheat-flour-based snack. Snacks were not consumed with meals, and consumption was monitored. At baseline, 20 wk, and 35 wk, hemoglobin status and iron were measured and the groups were compared. RESULTS: Between baseline and 35 wk, geometric mean serum ferritin (SF) increased significantly in all 3 groups receiving iron (P &lt; 0.01), and geometric mean serum transferrin receptor (TfR) decreased significantly in the groups receiving ferrous sulfate and electrolytic iron (P &lt; 0.05). Calculated mean (+/-SD) body iron stores increased from 1.5 +/- 2.8 to 5.4 +/- 2.9 mg/kg in the ferrous sulfate group, from 1.5 +/- 3.5 to 4.4 +/- 3.6 mg/kg in the electrolytic iron group, and from 1.3 +/- 3.2 to 3.2 +/- 4.3 mg/kg in the hydrogen-reduced iron group (P &lt; 0.01 for all 3 groups) but did not change significantly in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Ferrous sulfate, electrolytic iron, and hydrogen-reduced iron, fortified into wheat-based snacks, significantly improved iron status.

RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the iron absorption and the S-Fe increase (R2 = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: This short and valid observation period proposes the S-Fe procedure as an uncomplicated and clinically applicable tool when evaluating the iron absorption capacity of patients.",M1
16222918,"Effect of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplements on maternal weight and skinfold changes: a randomized double-blind clinical trial in Mexico.BACKGROUND: Recent trials of prenatal multivitamin-mineral supplements have yielded mixed findings for outcomes such as birth size, but the benefits of prenatal multivitamin-mineral supplements for maternal outcomes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplements (MM) compared to iron only (<e>FE</e>) supplements on changes in maternal weight and body composition during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. METHODS: A randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted in semi-rural Mexico. Women received either MM or FE supplements, 6 days per week from early pregnancy to delivery. Anthropometric measurements were obtained at recruitment, 26 and 37 weeks pregnancy, and 1 month postpartum. Women in both groups were similar at recruitment except that body-mass index (BMI) was greater in the FE group. RESULTS: Mean weight gain during pregnancy was significantly greater (-0.6 kg) in the MM group (n = 283) compared to the FE group (n = 287), but not after adjusting for maternal BMI at recruitment. Overweight women in the MM group gained 0.53 kg between recruitment and 1 month postpartum, whereas those in the FE group lost 0.63 kg; there were no differences between experimental groups among non-overweight women (p =.06 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iron supplements, MM supplements did not increase weight gain during pregnancy after adjusting for baseline differences in BMI but may lead to greater postpartum weight retention among overweight women.",M1
16210715,"Effect of time of initiation and dose of prenatal iron and folic acid supplementation on iron and folate nutriture of Korean women during pregnancy.BACKGROUND: In Korea, it is customary to prescribe iron and folic acid supplements to pregnant women after the 20th wk of gestation; however, little evidence exists to support this practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of time of initiation and dose of prenatal iron and folic acid supplementation on the iron and folate nutriture of Korean women during pregnancy. DESIGN: A total of 131 pregnant women were placed into 1 of 5 experimental groups, either the control group or 1 of 4 supplemented groups. The supplemented groups varied by time of initiation, which was either during the first trimester or at week 20 of gestation, and by dose of iron and folic acid supplements provided, which consisted of either 30 mg <e>Fe</e> plus 175 microg folic acid or 60 mg Fe plus 350 microg folic acid. All supplemented groups continued supplementation until delivery. RESULTS: Improvements in iron and folate nutriture were highly dependent on when the supplement program was initiated, but both supplement doses were equally effective. In contrast, the influence of folic acid supplementation on maternal folate status was not as pronounced as was the influence of iron supplementation on iron status. CONCLUSION: In pregnant Korean women, initiating iron and folic acid supplementation earlier during pregnancy may prevent the deterioration of iron and folate nutriture more than does increasing supplement doses in later stages of pregnancy.",M1
16197581,"Impact of menstrual blood loss and diet on iron deficiency among women in the UK.Women of childbearing age are at risk of <e>Fe</e> deficiency if insufficient dietary Fe is available to replace menstrual and other Fe losses. Haem Fe represents 10-15 % of dietary Fe intake in meat-rich diets but may contribute 40 % of the total absorbed Fe. The aim of the present study was to determine the relative effects of type of diet and menstrual Fe loss on Fe status in women. Ninety healthy premenopausal women were recruited according to their habitual diet: red meat, poultry/fish or lacto-ovo-vegetarian. Intake of Fe was determined by analysing 7 d duplicate diets, and menstrual Fe loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method. A substantial proportion of women (60 % red meat, 40 % lacto-ovo-vegetarian, 20 % poultry/fish) had low Fe stores (serum ferritin &lt;10 microg/l), but the median serum ferritin concentration was significantly lower in the red meat group (6.8 microg/l (interquartile range 3.3, 16.25)) than in the poultry/fish group (17.5 microg/l (interquartile range 11.3, 22.4) (P&lt;0.01). The mean and standard deviation of dietary Fe intake were significantly different between the groups (P=0.025); the red meat group had a significantly lower intake (10.9 (sd 4.3) mg/d) than the lacto-ovo-vegetarians (14.5 (sd 5.5) mg/d), whereas that of the poultry/fish group (12.8 (sd 5.1) mg/d) was not significantly different from the other groups. There was no relationship between total Fe intake and Fe status, but menstrual Fe loss (P=0.001) and dietary group (P=0.040) were significant predictors of Fe status: poultry/fish diets were associated with higher Fe stores than lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets. Identifying individuals with high menstrual losses should be a key component of strategies to prevent Fe deficiency.",M1
16162530,"Effects of source of gossypol and supplemental iron on plasma gossypol in Holstein steers.Four experiments were conducted to evaluate factors influencing concentrations of plasma total gossypol (TG) in 30 Holstein steers fed cottonseed products. At the end of each 28-d experiment, steers were weighed and blood samples were collected and analyzed for plasma TG concentrations. During the entire study, steers did not show any overt signs of gossypol toxicity. In the 28 d before experiment 1, 30 steers with a body weight (BW) of 273 kg were fed a standardization diet with 15.0% Upland whole cottonseed (WCS) that resulted in a mean intake of 9.08 g/d of TG per steer/d and a plasma TG of 1.66 microg/mL. In experiment 1, 30 steers were fed 1 of 5 diets with 15.0% Upland WCS, but different levels of supplemental <e>Fe</e> [0, 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg of diet dry matter (DM)]. Average daily gain was not affected by level of Fe in the diet, but DM intake, plasma TG, and plasma TG response decreased linearly as Fe in diets increased. In experiment 2, steers were fed diets with 15.0% Upland cottonseed as whole, cracked, roasted, cracked-roasted, or extruded. Analysis of the seed revealed that roasting or extrusion markedly reduced free gossypol (FG) content. Minor effects on animal performance were observed, but plasma TG decreased with roasting or extrusion of seeds, with the greatest reduction when the seed was cracked and then roasted. In experiment 3, steers were fed 2 levels of WCS (7.0 or 14.0% of DM) with 3 levels of cottonseed meal (2.8, 5.5, or 8.5% of DM) in the diet. Animal performance was not altered by diet, but plasma gossypol concentrations and responses were greater in steers fed diets with more WCS, because of the greater FG intake. In experiment 4, 24 steers were fed diets with 15.0% cottonseed (Upland or Pima) either as whole or cracked. Pima cottonseed increased TG and FG intakes, which resulted in greater plasma TG concentration and response. Animal response to processing of cottonseed tended to differ according to type of cottonseed. However, feeding Pima and cracking of cottonseed increased gossypol availability and plasma TG concentrations.",M1
16115336,"Pork meat increases iron absorption from a 5-day fully controlled diet when compared to a vegetarian diet with similar vitamin C and phytic acid content.Meat increases absorption of non-haem iron in single-meal studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate, over a 5 d period, the potential increasing effect of consumption of pork meat in a whole diet on the fractional absorption of non-haem iron and the total absorption of iron, when compared to a vegetarian diet. A randomised cross-over design with 3 x 5 d whole-diet periods with diets containing Danish-produced meat, Polish-produced meat or a vegetarian diet was conducted. Nineteen healthy female subjects completed the study. All main meals in the meat diets contained 60 g of pork meat and all diets had high phytic acid content (1250 mumol/d). All main meals were extrinsically labelled with the radioactive isotope (59)<e>Fe</e> and absorption of iron was measured in a whole body counter. The non-haem iron absorption from the Danish meat diet was significantly higher compared to the vegetarian diet (P=0.031). The mean fractional absorption of non-haem iron was 7.9 (se1.1), 6.8 (se 1.0) and 5.3 (se 0.6) % for the Danish and Polish meat diets and vegetarian diet, respectively. Total absorption of iron was higher for both meat diets compared to the vegetarian diet (Danish meat diet: P=0.006, Polish meat diet: P=0.003). The absorption ratios of the present study were well in accordance with absorption ratios estimated using algorithms on iron bioavailability. Neither the meat diets nor the vegetarian diets fulfilled the estimated daily requirements of absorbed iron in spite of a meat intake of 180 g/d in the meat diets.",M1
15877881,"Meal-based intake assessment tool: relative validity when determining dietary intake of <e>Fe</e> and Zn and selected absorption modifiers in UK men.A computer-based dietary assessment tool, the meal-based intake assessment tool (MBIAT), is described. In the current study, dietary intakes of Fe and Zn fractions (total Fe, non-haem Fe, haem Fe, meat Fe, total Zn) and dietary components that influence Fe and Zn absorption (vitamin C, phytate, Ca, grams of meat/fish/poultry, black tea equivalents, phytate:Zn molar ratio) were assessed. The relative validity of the MBIAT was determined in forty-eight UK men aged 40 years and over by comparing its results with those from weighed diet records collected over 12 d. There was good agreement between the MBIAT and the weighed diet records for median intakes of total, non-haem, haem and meat Fe, Zn, vitamin C, phytate, grams of meat/fish/poultry and phytate:Zn molar ratio. Correlations between the two methods ranged from 0.32 (for Ca) to 0.80 (for haem Fe), with 0.76 for total Fe and 0.75 for Zn. The percentage of participants classified by the MBIAT into the same/opposite weighed diet record quartiles ranged from 56/0 for Fe and 60/0 for Zn to 33/10 for Ca. The questionnaire also showed an acceptable level of agreement between repeat administrations (e.g. a correlation for total Fe of 0.74). In conclusion, the MBIAT is appropriate for assessing group dietary intakes of total Fe and Zn and their absorption modifiers in UK men aged 40 years and over.",M1
15864409,"The relative bioavailability in humans of elemental iron powders for use in food fortification.BACKGROUND: Bioavailability data in humans of elemental iron powders is limited although elemental iron is a common form of iron when used as a fortificant. AIM OF THE STUDY: The relative bioavailability (RBV) of seven elemental iron powders, five commercially available and two developmental are evaluated. In addition, one commercial electrolytic iron powder given with ascorbic acid (AA) was examined. METHODS: Based on a validated method this double-blinded randomized crossover study included three groups of male blood donors (n = 3*16) who were served rolls fortified with different elemental iron powders or ferrous sulfate (FeSO(4)) nine weeks apart. Blood samples were drawn every hour for six hours. RBV was obtained by comparing the increase in serum iron concentration induced by the elemental iron with the increase induced by FeSO(4). RESULTS: All elemental iron powders studied were significantly less well absorbed compared to FeSO(4). The electrolytic iron given with 50-mg AA was as well absorbed as FeSO(4) (molar ratio = 1:6, AA:<e>Fe</e>). The mean RBVs of the iron powders were: electrolytic (A-131, RBV = 0.65); electrolytic (Electrolytic, RBV = 0.59); carbonyl (Ferronyl, RBV = 0.58); H-reduced (AC- 325, RBV = 0.56); H-reduced (Hi-Sol, RBV = 0.50); carbonyl (CF, RBV = 0.37); reduced (Atomet 95SP, RBV = 0.36). The reduced iron was distinguished by having significantly lower RBV (0.36) although no significant overall ranking was possible. CONCLUSION: Based on a validated method this doubleblinded cross-over study in humans showed that the evaluated elemental iron powders currently available for commercial use are significantly less well absorbed compared to FeSO(4). The results indicate that the reduced iron powder was absorbed to a lower extent compared to the other iron powders and only 36% compared to FeSO(4). Ascorbic acid seems to improve the bioavailability of elemental iron even though a rather low molar ratio is used. Thus, if confirmed, this enhancing effect of ascorbic acid on elemental iron when used as a fortificant could be used by co-fortifying them.",M1
15817857,"Iron absorption in male C282Y heterozygotes.BACKGROUND: The suggestion that carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation absorb nonheme iron more efficiently than do carriers of the wild type has public health implications for countries where the C282Y mutation is common and foods are fortified with iron. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of C282Y heterozygosity on nonheme-iron absorption from a diet high in bioavailable iron and from iron-fortified cereals. DESIGN: The subjects were recruited from a parallel study investigating the relation between HFE mutations, habitual diet, and iron status. Iron absorption was measured in 15 wild-type carriers and 15 C282Y heterozygotes aged &gt;/=40 y. Each subject consumed 3 meals of high iron bioavailability (labeled with <e>Fe</e>-57) for 2 d and 2 meals with fortified cereal products (labeled with Fe-54) for the next 3 d. Iron absorption was measured from isotope incorporation into red blood cells 14 d after the last labeled meal and was corrected for utilization of absorbed iron by means of an intravenous infusion of Fe-58. RESULTS: Absorption of Fe-57 with the high-iron-bioavailability diet was 6.8 +/- 6.8% (0.6 +/- 0.6 mg/d) in the wild-type carriers and 7.6 +/- 3.2% (0.7 +/- 0.3 mg/d) in the C282Y heterozygotes. Absorption of Fe-54 with cereal products was 4.9 +/- 2.0% (0.7 +/- 0.3 mg/d) in the wild-type carriers and 5.3 +/- 1.3% (0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/d) in the C282Y heterozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: There was no overall significant difference between C282Y heterozygotes and wild-type men in iron absorption from either dietary nonheme iron or fortified cereal products.",M1
15756294,"Iron absorption by human subjects from different iron fortification compounds added to Thai fish sauce.OBJECTIVES: (a) To measure iron absorption by human subjects from citric acid stabilized fish sauce fortified with ferrous sulfate, ferric ammonium citrate or ferrous lactate and (b) to identify the effect of added citric acid (3 g/l) on iron absorption from ferrous sulfate fortified fish sauce. DESIGN: Iron absorption from the intrinsically labeled compounds was determined via erythrocyte incorporation of isotopic labels ((57)<e>Fe</e> and (58)Fe) using a randomized crossover design. In three separate absorption studies, 10 adult women each consumed a basic test meal of rice and vegetable soup seasoned with isotopically labeled, iron fortified fish sauce. RESULTS: Iron absorption was significantly lower from ferrous lactate and from ferric ammonium citrate fortified fish sauce than from ferrous sulfate fortified fish sauce. Fractional iron absorption (geometric mean; -1s.d., +1s.d.) was 8.7(3.6; 21.4)% for ferrous lactate compared to 13.0(5.4; 31.4)% from ferrous sulfate, P = 0.003 (study 1) and 6.0(2.5; 14.3)% from ferric ammonium citrate relative to 11.7(4.4; 30.7)% from ferrous sulfate, P &lt; 0.001, in study 2. Citric acid added at a molar ratio of approximately 2.5 to iron had no effect on iron absorption from ferrous sulfate (study 3). Iron absorption in the presence of citric acid was 14.1(6.4; 30.8)% compared to 12.0(5.8; 24.7)% in its absence (P = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Iron absorption was 50-100% higher from ferrous sulphate fortified fish sauce than from fish sauce fortified with ferric ammonium citrate or ferrous lactate. In the presence of citric acid as a chelator, ferrous sulfate would appear to be a useful fortificant for fish sauce. SPONSORSHIP: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna, Austria.",M1
15753148,"Tocopherols and the treatment of colon cancer.Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Vitamin E (VE) and other antioxidants may help prevent colon cancer by decreasing the formation of mutagens arising from the free radical oxidation of fecal lipids or by  non-antioxidant  mechanisms. VE is not a single molecule, but refers to at least eight different molecules, that is, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Methods: Both animal models and human colon cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of different forms of VE. Rats were fed diets deficient in tocopherols or supplemented with either alpha-tocopherol or gamma-tocopherol. Half the rats in each of these groups received normal levels of dietary <e>Fe</e> and the other half Fe at eight times the normal level. In our cell experiments, we looked at the role of gamma-tocopherol in upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) in the SW 480 human cell line. Results: Rats fed the diets supplemented with alpha-tocopherol had higher levels of VE in feces, colonocytes, plasma, and liver than did rats fed diets supplemented with gamma-tocopherol. Dietary Fe levels did not influence tocopherol levels in plasma, liver, or feces. For colonocytes, high dietary Fe decreased tocopherol levels. Rats fed the gamma-tocopherol-supplemented diets had lower levels of fecal lipid hydroperoxides than rats fed the alpha-tocopherol-supplemented diets. Ras-p21 levels were significantly lower in rats fed the gamma-tocopherol-supplemented diets compared with rats fed the alpha-tocopherol-supplemented diets. High levels of dietary Fe were found to promote oxidative stress in feces and colonocytes. Our data with the SW480 cells suggest that both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol upregulate PPAR-gamma mRNA and protein expression. gamma-tocopherol was, however, found to be a better enhancer of PPAR-gamma expression than alpha-tocopherol at the concentrations tested.",M1
15705227,"Iron availability of a fortified processed wheat cereal: a comparison of fourteen iron forms using an in vitro digestion/human colonic adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cell model.In this three-phase study we first compared the availability of fourteen <e>Fe</e> forms in a wheat-based ready-to-eat breakfast cereal using an in vitro digestion/human colonic adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cell model. We then investigated the effect of milk and/or coffee on those fortified cereals found in phase 1 to show promising increases in Fe availability. The Fe forms assessed in phase 1 were reduced (control), carbonyl, electrolytic, FePO(4), FeSO(4), FeCO(3), Na(2)FeEDTA, Ferrochel (Albion Laboratories, Clearfield, UT, USA; ferrous bis-glycinate), encapsulated ferrous fumarate, FeSO(4), ferrous lactate and Biofer (LipoTech, Britwell Salome, Oxfordshire; FeSO(4)), SQM (Sea-Questra-Min Iron; Quali Tech, Chaska, MN, USA; polysaccharide-complexed FeSO(4)) and Sun Active (Taiyo Kagaku, Yokkaichi, Japan). All these forms increased Fe uptake compared with the unfortified cereal. Relative to the control, the following increases in Fe availability were observed: electrolytic, 52 %; ferrous fumarate, 30-35 %; Sun Active, 78 %; Ferrochel, 125 %; Na(2)FeEDTA, 291 %. Recent human studies have shown similar data with regard to Ferrochel, FeSO4 and Na(2)FeEDTA, with the latter being more bioavailable. Our phase-2 studies indicated that the addition of milk to FeSO(4)-fortified cereal increased Fe availability, but this availability was markedly decreased by the addition of coffee to the digest. Conversely, a loss in availability from Na(2)FeEDTA was observed with the addition of milk; however, the addition of coffee did not markedly affect Fe availability from this form. In phase-3 studies we observed increased Fe availability upon the addition of milk to cereals containing Ferrochel, FeSO(4), Sun Active, a mixture of reduced Fe and Na(2)FeEDTA or reduced Fe. For these forms we did not assess the behaviour after the addition of coffee. In conclusion, when considering possible fortificants for optimizing Fe bioavailability within a foodstuff, it is of paramount importance to consider the interaction between the fortified foodstuffs and other components of the meal (such as milk and coffee with a breakfast).",M1
15621297,"Metal chelates of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid in animal feeding. Part 2: Further characterizations, in vitro and in vivo investigations.The alpha-hydroxyacid 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (the so-called methionine hydroxy-analogue, MHA), largely used in animal nutrition as a source of methionine, forms stable metal chelates with divalent metals of formula [{CH(3)SCH(2) CH(2)CH(OH)COO}(2)M].nH(2)O. Protonation and iron(III) and copper(II) complex formation constants have been determined by potentiometry at 25 degrees C. Distribution diagrams show that no free <e>Fe</e>(3+) cations are present in solution at pH&gt;2.5. ESI-MS (Electron-Spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry) investigations carried out both on iron and zinc complexes in solution have evidenced various species with different MHA/metal ratios. In vivo trials were carried out with rats. After receiving a zinc-deficient diet for 3 weeks, animals were fed the same diet added with zinc sulfate or zinc/MHA chelate; the zinc content of faeces was higher (+45%; P&lt;0.05) in sulfate fed rats, whereas zinc retention was higher (+61%; P&lt;0.05) in the Zn/MHA diet. Experiments in vitro with human intestinal Caco-2 cells indicated that the MHA/Fe chelate was taken up by the cells without any apparent toxic effect. The iron uptake was higher than that of iron nitrilotriacetate (Fe(3+)NTA), an effective chelate for delivering iron to milk diets. In conclusion, these data indicate that the use of MHA chelates could be a valuable tool to increase bioavailability of trace minerals and reduce the environmental impact of animal manure.",M1
15447902,"Iron in ferritin or in salts (ferrous sulfate) is equally bioavailable in nonanemic women.BACKGROUND: Recent studies in humans suggest that ferritin iron in soybeans has high bioavailability. However, direct evidence for this is lacking because the soybeans were intrinsically labeled; thus, iron bound to other ligands, such as phytate, was also labeled. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to evaluate the absorption of iron from extrinsically labeled, purified ferritin (horse spleen) reconstituted with either high-phosphate iron mineral (plant-type) or low-phosphate iron mineral (animal-type) and to compare it with iron absorption from ferrous sulfate. DESIGN: Nonanemic, healthy young women were fed a standard breakfast meal supplemented with (59)<e>Fe</e>-labeled ferritin or ferrous sulfate, in randomized order. Fifteen subjects received ferritin with the low-phosphate iron mineral, and 15 subjects received ferritin with the high-phosphate iron mineral. Iron absorption was measured in a whole-body counter after 14 and 28 d and by red blood cell incorporation after 28 d. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in iron absorption between ferritin and ferrous sulfate: low-phosphate iron mineral ferritin (x +/- SD: 21.4 +/- 14.7%) compared with ferrous sulfate (21.9 +/- 14.6%), or high-phosphate iron mineral ferritin (22.2 +/- 19.2%) compared with ferrous sulfate (16.7 +/- 7.1%). Results obtained by using whole-body retention of iron and red blood cell incorporation differed with the type of iron, which suggests that pathways for iron uptake and utilization differed for the 2 forms. CONCLUSIONS: Iron is equally well absorbed from ferritin and ferrous sulfate independent of the phosphate content of the ferritin iron mineral. Thus, dietary ferritin iron is likely to be a good source of iron.",M1
15294343,"Dietary iron regulates intestinal cadmium absorption through iron transporters in rats.The intestinal absorption of cadmium (Cd) is influenced by body iron (<e>Fe</e>) status in laboratory animals and humans. In this study we investigated the role of the apical Fe transporter divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and the basolateral Fe exporter metal transporter protein 1 (MTP1) in Cd absorption. Rats were divided into the following groups; an Fe-sufficient (FeS) control group that was fed an FeS diet for 4 weeks (FeS, 4 weeks); an Fe-deficient (FeD) group that was fed an FeD diet for 4 weeks (FeD, 4 weeks); an FeS control group that was fed an FeS diet for 8 weeks (FeS, 8 weeks); an FeD/FeS group that was fed an FeD diet for 4 weeks and then an FeS diet for the following 4 weeks (FeD/FeS, 4 weeks/4 weeks); and an FeD group that was fed an FeD diet for 8 weeks (FeD, 8 weeks). After the 4- and 8-week feeding periods, rats were given a single oral gavage of Cd and were sacrificed 24 h later. The FeD (4 weeks) group developed Fe deficient anemia, but the parameters returned to control levels in the FeD/FeS group (4 weeks/4 weeks). The Cd body burden was greater in FeD (4 weeks) rats compared to FeS control (4 weeks), but returned to control Cd levels in FeD/FeS (4 weeks/4 weeks) rats. In addition, the expression of DMT1 and MTP1 was induced by Fe deficiency in the duodenum of FeD (4 weeks) rats, but was down-regulated to control values in FeD/FeS (4 weeks/4 weeks) rats. The correlation between duodenal DMT1 and MTP1 expression and Cd body burden in rats suggests an important role of DMT1 and MTP1 in Cd absorption.",M1
15164943,"Does nitric oxide contribute to iron-dependent brain injury after experimental cerebral ischaemia?Experimental and clinical data suggest that iron has a key role in cerebral ischaemia. We measure infarct volume and analyse the nitric oxide responses to brain injury in rat stroke model after increased oral iron intake. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in a group of 20 male Wistar rats, 10 of which were fed with a control diet and 10 of which were fed with iron-enriched diet containing 2.5% carbonyl iron for 9 weeks. L-arginine and nitric oxide metabolites were determined in blood samples before and at 2, 6, 8 and 48 h after MCAO. Infarct volume, thiobarbituric acid reaction substances (TBARS) and tissue iron were measured at 48 h. Infarct volume was 66% greater in the iron-fed rats than in the control group. Iron-fed animals showed significantly higher levels of TBARS. Liver iron stores (3500 +/- 199 vs 352 +/- 28 microg <e>Fe</e>/g, p&lt;0.0001) but not brain iron stores (131 +/- 11 vs 139 +/- 8 microg Fe/g, p=0.617), were significantly higher in the iron-fed group. L-arginine levels were slightly lower in iron-fed rats and decreased significantly in both groups at 6 and 8 hours after MCAO. The levels of the stable end products of NOS (NOx = nitrite + nitrate) were significantly higher in iron-fed rats before MCAO (16.2 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.6 +/- 0.8 micromol x L(-1), p&lt;0.05), with a further increase during the six first hours after MCAO in both groups. These results suggest that the iron overload that increases both superoxide and nitric oxide production leads to peroxynitrite formation, thus enhancing brain damage.",M1
15164114,"Effectiveness of weekly vitamin A (10,000 IU) and iron (60 mg) supplementation for adolescent boys and girls through schools in rural and urban East Java, Indonesia.OBJECTIVE: High prevalences of vitamin A deficiency and anaemia among adolescents warrant interventions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of school-based supplementation to reduce anaemia and improve vitamin A status. DESIGN: School-based, grade-randomized, intervention. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: In all, 1757 girls and 1859 boys, aged 12-15 y, in 24 Junior High Schools. INTERVENTIONS: Weekly supplementation for 14 weeks with 60 mg iron and 250 microg folate (<e>Fe</e> group; n=978), 10 000 IU vitamin A (VA group; n=970) or both (VAFe group; n=1042) to subjects in 15 schools, compared to subjects in nine other schools not receiving supplements (control; n=626). RESULTS: The baseline anaemia prevalence (Hb &lt;120 g/l) in girls was 20% (prepubertal) and 26% (pubertal), and in boys 24% (pre-pubertal) and 11% (pubertal). Serum retinol concentrations were low (&lt;1.05 micromol/l) in 41% of boys and 45% of girls. The interventions did not increase haemoglobin concentrations. Serum retinol concentration of boys, but not girls, in the VA group increased (0.33 vs 0.07 micromol/l in controls; P&lt;0.01). The risk factors for low serum retinol concentration were lower baseline serum retinol concentration (OR 0.02-0.03) with, for girls, nightblindness at baseline (OR 5.88), and for boys, not receiving vitamin A (OR control: 1.00; VA: 0.37; Fe: 0.77; VAFe: 0.34) and maternal illiteracy (OR mother never attended school 1.00, mother received any formal education 0.17-0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with vitamin A increased serum retinol concentration of boys. Iron supplementation did not change Hb. This appeared to be due to poor compliance, and partly related to side effects.",M1
15113721,"Randomized controlled trial of prenatal zinc supplementation and fetal bone growth.BACKGROUND: Maternal zinc deficiency is relatively common in developing countries, but its consequences for fetal growth are not established. OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine whether improvement in maternal gestational zinc status is positively associated with fetal growth as assessed by ultrasonography. DESIGN: We conducted a double-masked, randomized trial among 242 pregnant Peruvian women in an impoverished shantytown in Lima, Peru. At 10-16 wk of gestation, the women were randomly assigned to receive daily supplements containing 60 mg <e>Fe</e> and 250 microg folic acid, with or without 25 mg Zn. We measured fetal head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and femur diaphysis length at 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 38 wk of gestation. Fetal measures were analyzed longitudinally to evaluate differences in trends of fetal growth by supplement type, and within-subject correlations were taken into account. RESULTS: Femur diaphysis length was greater in fetuses whose mothers received zinc supplements (P &lt; 0.05), and the difference tended to increase with gestational age. No significant differences by supplement type were observed for the other anatomical sites measured. CONCLUSIONS: The observed positive effect of prenatal zinc on fetal femur diaphysis length is consistent with the results of experimental studies in animals and in vitro. The supplementation effect represents an upward shift in mean femur diaphysis length at term of about one-quarter of the reference SD. These findings suggest the potential importance of maternal zinc status for fetal bone growth in humans and illustrate the value of ultrasonography for evaluating the effect of prenatal nutritional interventions on components of fetal growth.",M1
15078340,"The effects of inhibition of haem biosynthesis by griseofulvin on intestinal iron absorption.The relationship between haem biosynthesis and intestinal iron absorption in mice was investigated by ascertaining the effect of the haem synthesis inhibitor, griseofulvin, on duodenal iron absorption using both in vivo and in vitro measurements. Urinary 5-aminolaevulinic acid levels were increased within 24 hr of feeding mice with griseofulvin diet (2.5% w/w), with more marked increases seen after 3-7 days. Urinary porphobilinogen levels also showed a similar trend. In vivo intestinal iron absorption was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) in experimental mice, mainly due to reduction in the transfer of 59Fe from the enterocytes to the portal circulation. In vitro studies using isolated duodenal fragments also exhibited marked decreases in both iron uptake and <e>Fe</e> (III) reduction. Changes in mucosal Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT-1), Dcytb and Ireg1 (iron regulated protein 1) mRNA levels paralleled the changes in iron absorption. The reduction in iron absorption after griseofulvin treatment was normalised when mice were simultaneously injected with haem-arginate. These data support the hypothesis that intermediates in haem biosynthesis, particularly 5-aminolaevulinic acid, regulate intestinal iron absorption.",M1
14997284,"Low iron diet retards 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-mediated tumor promotion in murine skin.Recently, we have shown that low iron state reduces benzoyl peroxide-mediated tumor promotion in murine skin. To further test the dependence of iron on skin tumor development, we assessed the effect of a low iron diet on 12- O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-mediated tumor promotion in murine skin. Female Swiss albino mice were fed on a low iron diet and initiated with a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (DMBA, 40 microg as 150 microl per mouse) and promoted with TPA (2.5 microg as 200 microl per mouse, twice-weekly application for 20 weeks). The appearance of the first papilloma and the number of tumors (papillomas and carcinomas) per mouse were recorded weekly. We observed a decrease in tumor incidence (papillomas and carcinomas) and number of tumors per mouse in TPA-promoted mice fed on low iron diet (0.23 mg <e>Fe</e>/kg diet) compared to normal mice fed on balanced mouse chow (1.70 mg Fe/kg diet). The total iron consumption per day by mice being fed on balanced mouse chow was 340-400 microg Fe/kg body weight, and the total iron consumption per day by mice being fed on low iron diet was 45-55 microg Fe/kg body weight. The number of papillomas per mouse was 45% lower and the conversion of papillomas to carcinomas was about 20% lower in mice fed a low iron diet. The tumor size was also smaller in mice being fed on low iron diet. TPA treatment resulted in decreases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and depletion in the level of epidermal reduced glutathione (GSH). Feeding mice on low iron diet along with TPA treatment resulted in approximately 50-75% recovery of the depleted levels of GSH and antioxidant enzymes. In addition, TPA-mediated induction of biological markers of tumor promotion, viz. ornithine decarboxylase activity and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into cutaneous DNA, was about 60% lower in TPA-treated mice fed on low iron diet than in normal mice treated with TPA. Cutaneous iron levels were also lower in mice fed on low iron diet than in mice fed on normal diet. Histopathological sections of the skin portion adjoining tumors showed a lower degree of epidermal hyperplasia and lesser infiltration of inflammatory cells in the dermis, and absence of hyperkeratosis in mice fed on low iron diet. Thus, in this study we observe that the tumor promoting potential of TPA is reduced in mice fed on low iron diet, which is also accompanied by lesser inflammatory changes in the skin of tumor-bearing mice fed on low iron diet.",M1
14756918,"Factors associated with Hb concentration in children aged 6-59 months in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil.In 1997, the prevalence of anaemia was 40.9 % among children aged 6-59 months in the State of Pernambuco, north-east Brazil. Using the same sample of children, we have investigated possible reasons for this high prevalence. A representative sample was selected through a three-stage process: proportional systematic random sampling of municipalities in the State, systematic random sampling of census sectors within these municipalities, and finally, simple random sampling of households with children aged 6-59 months to obtain the sample of 650 children. Data collection included demographic, environmental, socio-economic and maternal variables, and nutritional status and dietary intakes of the children. Multiple linear regression analysis was based on a hierarchical model of factors associated with Hb concentration. The mean Hb concentration of children aged 6-23 months was 10 g/l lower than that of older children. In the regression analysis, child age explained 8.3 % of the variance in Hb concentration. The intake of bioavailable <e>Fe</e> explained a further 3.3, serum retinol 2.7, diarrhoea 2.4, water treatment 1.7, sanitation 1.3 and low birth-weight 0.5 %. The final model explained 23.4 % of the variance in Hb concentration. We conclude that child age, bioavailable-Fe intake, serum retinol concentration, diarrhoea, water treatment, sanitation and low birth-weight are independently associated with Hb concentration. In north-east Brazil, anaemia prevention programmes among children should focus on those aged &lt;2 years and should consider feasible strategies to improve intakes of bioavailable Fe and vitamin A, and reduce infection. Supplemental Fe should be given to low birth-weight infants.",M1
14748947,"Intake of dietary iron is low in patients with Crohn's disease: a case-control study.Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often experience <e>Fe</e> deficiency (ID) and frequently alter their diet to relieve abdominal symptoms. The present study set out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by 2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with controls (both P&lt;0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects for men (P&lt;0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic acid (P&lt;0.001) and phytic acid (P&lt;0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients with CD due to lower intakes (P&lt;0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients, which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe supplementation should be carefully considered.",M1
14641971,"Total-diet study: dietary intakes of macro elements and trace elements in Italy.The present study provides the dietary intakes of macro elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, P) and trace elements (<e>Fe</e>, Zn, Cu, Se) from the Italian total diet. The contribution of the most representative food groups of the total diet (cereals and cereal products, vegetables, fruit, milk and dairy products, meat and meat products, fish) to the daily intakes of these nutrients was also evaluated. The Italian total diet was formulated following the 'market-basket' approach. Cereals represented the primary sources of Cu (35 %), Fe (30 %) and Mg (27 %). About 89 % of the total daily intake of Fe was derived from plant foods. The vegetables food group was the main source of dietary K (27 %). Most of the Ca (59 %) and P (27 %) was derived from the milk-and-dairy food group. Of the dietary Zn, 41 % was provided by meat, which, together with the fish food group, was the primary source of Se (20 %). The adequacy of the Italian total diet with respect to nutritional elements was assessed by comparing the daily intakes with the average requirement values of the Italian recommended dietary allowances. The present findings indicated that the dietary patterns of the Italian total diet were generally consistent with current Italian dietary recommendations for both macro and trace elements. The major concern was for Ca, for which daily intake was 76 % of the average recommendation for the Italian population. It should not be ruled out that there could be a potential risk of inadequate Fe intake in some segments of the population.",M1
14641967,"Iron absorption from ferrous fumarate in adult women is influenced by ascorbic acid but not by Na2EDTA.Ascorbic acid and Na2EDTA enhance <e>Fe</e> absorption from the water-soluble Fe compound FeSO4 but their effect on poorly water-soluble Fe compounds such as ferrous fumarate is less well established. In the present study, the effects of ascorbic acid and Na2EDTA on Fe absorption from ferrous fumarate were evaluated in adult women (ten women/study) from the erythrocyte incorporation of Fe stable isotopes ((57)Fe or (58)Fe) 14 d after administration. Two separate studies were made with test meals of Fe-fortified infant cereal (5 mg Fe/meal). Data were evaluated by paired t tests and the results are presented as geometric means. In study 1a, the comparison between Fe absorption from ferrous fumarate- and FeSO4-fortified cereal showed that adult women absorb Fe as well from ferrous fumarate as from FeSO4 (3.0 and 3.1 % respectively, P=0.85). After addition of Na2EDTA (Na2EDTA:fortification Fe molar ratio of 1:1), Fe absorption from FeSO4 was significantly higher than from ferrous fumarate (5.3 v. 3.3 % respectively, P&lt;0.01; study 1b). In study 2, Fe absorption was compared from ferrous fumarate-fortified meals with and without ascorbic acid added at a 4:1 molar ratio (relative to fortification Fe) and the results showed that ascorbic acid increased Fe absorption from ferrous fumarate significantly (6.3 v. 10.4 %, P=0.02). The results of the present studies show that Fe absorption from ferrous fumarate is enhanced by ascorbic acid but not by Na2EDTA, thus emphasising that not all findings from Fe absorption studies made with FeSO4 can be extrapolated to Fe compounds with different solubility properties.",M1
14594790,"Iron supplements inhibit zinc but not copper absorption in vivo in ileostomy subjects.BACKGROUND: Iron supplements may inhibit intestinal zinc and copper uptake because these elements may compete for binding to a transporter molecule (divalent metal transporter 1) that is located on the apical side of the small intestinal epithelium. OBJECTIVE: We quantified the interaction between different amounts of administered iron and the absorption of zinc and copper in humans. DESIGN: Eleven subjects with an ileostomy [mean (+/- SD) age: 55 +/- 9 y] ingested a stable-isotope-labeled zinc and copper solution containing 12 mg Zn ((66)Zn and (67)Zn) and 3 mg Cu ((65)Cu) in the presence of 0, 100, or 400 mg <e>Fe</e> as ferrous gluconate on 3 respective test days. Subsequently, 1 mg (70)Zn was injected intravenously. Subjects collected ileostomy effluent and urine for 24 h and 7 d, respectively. Zinc status and true zinc absorption were calculated from the urinary excretion of the zinc isotopes. Apparent copper absorption was calculated from ileostomy effluent excretion of the orally administered copper isotopes. RESULTS: Zinc status did not differ significantly between the 3 iron doses. Mean (+/- SEM) zinc absorption was significantly higher in the absence of iron than with the concomitant ingestion of 100 or 400 mg Fe (44 +/- 22% compared with 26 +/- 14% and 23 +/- 6%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05), whereas zinc absorption did not differ significantly between the 100- and 400-mg Fe doses. Apparent copper absorption was 48 +/- 14%, 54 +/- 26%, and 53 +/- 7% in the presence of 0, 100, and 400 mg Fe, respectively, and did not differ significantly between the 3 iron doses. CONCLUSION: Oral iron therapy may impair zinc absorption and thus zinc status in a dose-independent fashion but does not affect copper absorption.",M1
12936926,"The efficacy of a local ascorbic acid-rich food in improving iron absorption from Mexican diets: a field study using stable isotopes.BACKGROUND: One potentially sustainable approach to improving iron status at the community level is to encourage the consumption of local ascorbic acid-rich foods, in conjunction with meals high in nonheme iron. OBJECTIVE: The study, conducted in rural Mexico, measured stable isotopes of iron to evaluate the effect on iron absorption of the addition of 25 mg ascorbic acid as agua de lim√≥n (limeade) to 2 typical meals per day for 2 wk. DESIGN: Fifteen nonpregnant, nonlactating, iron-deficient (ferritin &lt; 12 microg/L) women (x +/- SD age: 28.3 +/- 7.7 y) fasted overnight and were brought to a community clinic. After an initial blood sample, subjects consumed 0.25 mg (57)<e>Fe</e> with both breakfast and lunch for 14 d. On day 29, another blood sample was taken, and a reference dose of 2.7 mg (58)Fe with 25 mg ascorbic acid was given. For the following 15 d, participants consumed 0.25 mg (57)Fe added to both breakfast and lunch with 25 mg ascorbic acid added to each meal as limeade. A final blood sample was taken on day 59. RESULTS: Iron absorption was calculated from recovery of isotopes in blood obtained 14 d after administration of each isotope. When 25 mg ascorbic acid as limeade was added to test meals twice a day for 2 wk, iron absorption increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) in every subject: the mean absorption rose from 6.6 +/- 3.0% to 22.9 +/- 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of 25 mg ascorbic acid as limeade twice daily with meals substantially improved iron absorption and may improve the iron status of nonpregnant, nonlactating, iron-deficient women.",M1
12885708,"Iron absorption from fish sauce and soy sauce fortified with sodium iron EDTA.BACKGROUND: Fish sauce and soy sauce have been suggested as food vehicles for iron fortification in Asia. NaFeEDTA is a potentially useful fortificant because it can be added to these condiments without causing precipitation during storage. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate iron absorption from NaFeEDTA-fortified fish sauce and soy sauce against a reference fortificant (FeSO(4)), to compare iron absorption from NaFeEDTA-fortified fish sauce and soy sauce, and to evaluate the influence of fish sauce and soy sauce per se on iron absorption. DESIGN: Five separate iron-absorption studies were made in adult women (10 women per study). Iron absorption was measured on the basis of erythrocyte incorporation of (57)<e>Fe</e> or (58)Fe 14 d after the intake of labeled meals of rice or rice and vegetables. Fish sauce or soy sauce (10 g) fortified with 5 mg Fe as NaFeEDTA or FeSO(4) was fed with selected meals. The results are presented as geometric means. RESULTS: Iron absorption from NaFeEDTA- and FeSO(4)-fortified fish sauce (3.3% and 3.1%, respectively) and soy sauce (6.1% and 5.6%, respectively) was not significantly different. No significant difference was observed when NaFeEDTA-fortified fish sauce and soy sauce were compared directly (6.7% and 7.9%, respectively). Soy sauce inhibited iron absorption from rice-based meals (8.5% without and 6.0% with soy sauce; P &lt; 0.02), whereas fish sauce did not affect iron absorption significantly. CONCLUSION: The relatively high iron absorption from NaFeEDTA-fortified fish sauce and soy sauce and the acceptable organoleptic properties of NaFeEDTA indicate the potential usefulness of this iron fortificant in fish sauce and soy sauce fortification programs.",M1
12844373,"Effect of maternal iron restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology in the adult rat offspring.In rats, maternal anaemia during pregnancy causes hypertension in the adult offspring, although the mechanism is unknown. The present study investigated the renal morphology of adult rats born to mothers who were <e>Fe</e>-deficient during pregnancy. Rats were fed either a control (153 mg Fe/kg diet, n 7) or low-Fe (3 mg/kg diet, n 6) diet from 1 week before mating and throughout gestation. At delivery, the Fe-restricted (IR) mothers were anaemic; the IR pups were also anaemic and growth-retarded at 2 d of age. At 3 and 16 months, systolic blood pressure in the IR offspring (163 (sem 4) and 151 (sem 4) mmHg respectively, n 13) was greater than in control animals (145 (sem 3) and 119 (sem 4) mmHg respectively, n 15, P&lt;0.05). At post mortem at 18 months, there was no difference in kidney weight between treatment groups, although relative kidney weight as a fraction of body weight in the IR offspring was greater than in control animals (P&lt;0.05). Glomerular number was lower in the IR offspring (11.4 (sem 1.1) per 4 mm(2), n 13) compared with control rats (14.8 (sem 0.7), n 15, P&lt;0.05). Maternal treatment had no effect on glomerular size, but overall, female rats had smaller and more numerous glomeruli per unit area than male rats. When all animals were considered, inverse relationships were observed between glomerular number and glomerular size (r-0.73, n 28, P&lt;0.05), and glomerular number and systolic blood pressure at both 3 months (r-0.42, n 28, P&lt;0.05) and 16 months of age (r-0.64, n 28, P&lt;0.05). Therefore, in rats, maternal Fe restriction causes hypertension in the adult offspring that may be due, in part, to a deficit in nephron number.",M1
12775112,"The effect of dietary iron levels on changes in iron status and zinc-dependent enzyme activities in rats fed two levels of dietary zinc.In order to determine the interrelationship between dietary iron and zinc levels, the effects of dietary iron levels (2, 10, 20, and 40 microg/g) on changes in iron and zinc status and zinc enzyme activities (aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ALA-D EC 4.2.1.24 and alkaline phosphatase ALK-P EC 3.1.3.1) in male Wistar rats were investigated using adequate and marginally deficient zinc diets (25 and 5 microg/g). When rats were fed 5 microg Zn/g diets, body weight gain and food intake remained unchanged at a <e>Fe</e> diet intake of 20 microg/g or greater. Similar tendencies were obtained for hemoglobin, hematocrit, plasma iron, and transferrin saturation. In contrast, liver, spleen, and femur iron concentrations increased gradually with increased iron intake. Feeding diets containing 25 microg Zn/g did not alter these parameters. The percentages of apparent iron absorption in both dietary zinc groups tended to increase with decreasing dietary iron and attained maximum levels at an Fe intake of 10 microg/g. However, In the case of rats fed Fe at concentrations of 2 microg/g Iron absorption decreased. Regardless of the dietary zinc level, rats fed diets with an Fe concentration of 2 microg/g had decreased zinc absorption and plasma ALK-P activity. However, ALA-D activity was not influenced by dietary iron.",M1
12769546,"Assessment of concentrations of iron and zinc and bioavailable iron in grains of early-maturing tropical maize varieties.Twenty elite early-maturing (75-90 days) tropical maize varieties grown in three diverse agroecologies in West Africa were evaluated to identify varieties with high kernel-<e>Fe</e> and -Zn and bioavailable Fe levels. Bioavailable iron was assessed using an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model. Significant (P &lt; 0.001) varietal differences were observed in mean kernel-Fe and -Zn levels. The ranges were 15.5-19.1 mg kg(-)(1) for Fe and 16.5-20.5 mg kg(-)(1) for Zn. Genetic component accounted for 34% of the total variation in kernel-Zn and for 11% of the variation in kernel-Fe levels. Mean bioavailable Fe in varieties ranged between 4% below and 49% above the reference control variety. A significant negative relationship was detected between kernel-P concentration and bioavailable Fe (R = -0.36; P &lt; 0.004; n = 60). Two varieties, ACR90POOL16-DT and ACR86TZESR-W, were identified as the most promising for further evaluation to determine their efficacy as improved sources of iron in target populations.",M1
12663287,"A community-based randomized controlled trial of iron and zinc supplementation in Indonesian infants: interactions between iron and zinc.BACKGROUND: Combined supplementation with iron and zinc during infancy may be effective in preventing deficiencies of these micronutrients, but knowledge of their potential interactions when given together is insufficient. OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the effect in infants of combined supplementation with iron and zinc and of supplementation with single micronutrients on iron and zinc status. DESIGN: Indonesian infants (n = 680) were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with 10 mg <e>Fe</e> (Fe group), 10 mg Zn (Zn group), 10 mg Fe + 10 mg Zn (Fe+Zn group), or placebo from 6 to 12 mo of age. Venous blood samples were collected at the start and end of the study. Five hundred forty-nine infants completed the supplementation and had both baseline and follow-up blood samples available for analysis. RESULTS: Baseline prevalences of anemia, iron deficiency anemia (anemia and low serum ferritin), and low serum zinc (&lt; 10.7 micromol/L) were 41%, 8%, and 78%, respectively. After supplementation, the Fe group had higher hemoglobin (119.4 compared with 115.3 g/L; P &lt; 0.05) and serum ferritin (46.5 compared with 32.3 microg/L; P &lt; 0.05) values than did the Fe+Zn group, indicating an effect of zinc on iron absorption. The Zn group had higher serum zinc (11.58 compared with 9.06 micromol/L; P &lt; 0.05) than did the placebo group. There was a dose effect on serum ferritin in the Fe and Fe+Zn groups, but at different levels. There was a significant dose effect on serum zinc in the Zn group, whereas no dose effect was found in the Fe+Zn group beyond 7 mg Zn/d. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with iron and zinc was less efficacious than were single supplements in improving iron and zinc status, with evidence of an interaction between iron and zinc when the combined supplement was given.",M1
12597403,"Effects of breed (Angus vs Simmental) and copper and zinc source on mineral status of steers fed high dietary iron.Forty-four Angus (n = 24) and Simmental (n = 20) steers, averaging 301 kg initially, were used to determine the effects of breed and Cu and Zn source (SO4 or proteinate (Prot) form) on Cu and Zn status of steers fed high dietary iron (<e>Fe</e>). Steers were stratified by weight within breed and randomly assigned to treatments. Treatments consisted of: 1) CuSO4 + ZnSO4 ,2) CuSO4 + ZnProt, 3) CuProt + ZnSO4, and 4) CuProt + ZnProt. Copper and Zn sources were added to provide 5 mg Cu and 25 mg supplemental Zn/kg DM. All steers were individually fed a corn silage-based diet supplemented with 1,000 mg Fe (from FeSO4)/kg DM. Liver biopsy samples were obtained at the beginning and end of the 149-d study. Serum samples were collected initially and at 28-d intervals for determination of ceruloplasmin activity and Zn and Cu concentrations. Copper and Zn source did not affect performance, serum or liver Cu and Zn concentrations, or ceruloplasmin activity. Copper status decreased (P &lt; 0.01) in all steers with time, and increasing the level of supplemental Cu from 5 to 10 mg/kg DM on d 84 did not prevent further drops in serum Cu and ceruloplasmin. Simmental steers had lower (P &lt; 0.05) serum and liver Cu concentrations, and serum ceruloplasmin activity throughout the study. These results indicate that neither CuSO4 nor CuProt were effective at the supplemental concentrations evaluated in alleviating the adverse effect of high Fe on Cu status. Simmental steers had lower Cu status than Angus, suggesting a higher Cu requirement.",M1
12584213,"A rapid decrease in the expression of DMT1 and Dcytb but not Ireg1 or hephaestin explains the mucosal block phenomenon of iron absorption.BACKGROUND: A large oral dose of iron will reduce the absorption of a subsequent smaller dose of iron in a phenomenon known as mucosal block. Molecular analysis of this process may provide insights into the regulation of intestinal iron absorption. AIMS: To determine the effect of an oral bolus of iron on duodenal expression of molecules associated with intestinal iron transport in rats and to relate this to changes in iron absorption. METHODS: Rats were given an oral dose of iron and duodenal expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), Dcytb, Ireg1, and hephaestin (Hp) was determined using the ribonuclease protection assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Iron absorption was measured using radioactive (59)<e>Fe</e>. RESULTS: A decrease in intestinal iron absorption occurred following an oral dose of iron and this was associated with increased enterocyte iron levels, as assessed by iron regulatory protein activity and immunoblotting for ferritin. Reduced absorption was also accompanied by a rapid decrease in expression of the mRNAs encoding the brush border iron transport molecules Dcytb and the iron responsive element (IRE) containing the splice variant of DMT1. No such change was seen in expression of the non-IRE splice variant of DMT1 or the basolateral iron transport molecules Ireg1 and Hp. Similar changes were observed at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that brush border, but not basolateral, iron transport components are regulated locally by enterocyte iron levels and support the hypothesis that systemic stimuli exert their primary effect on basolateral transport molecules.",M1
12550097,"An iron-rich diet protects the liver and kidneys against cadmium-induced injury in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus).The objective of this study was to determine whether supplemental dietary iron (<e>Fe</e>) would protect against cadmium (Cd)-induced injury in the liver and kidneys of bank voles. The rodents were provided, for 6 weeks, Fe-adequate (60-80 microg/g) and Fe-enriched (250-270 microg/g) diets containing 0.05 (control), 40, and 80 microg Cd/g. Histological examinations and analyses of Cd, Cd bound and not bound to metallothionein (MT), Fe, and lipid peroxidation in liver and kidneys were carried out. The Fe-enriched diet prevented Cd-induced histopathological changes as well as deprivation of tissue Fe and lipid peroxidation. Also, supplemental Fe significantly decreased hepatic and renal Cd burden. However, in the Cd-80 bank voles fed the Fe-enriched diet, the non-MT-bound Cd, considered a toxic species, reached 4.7 microg/g liver and 13.7 microg/g kidney, these values being similar to those at which histopathological changes occurred in the voles fed Cd diets not supplemented with Fe. The data indicate that the protective effect of supplemental Fe in the bank vole may be due to the prevention of Cd-induced deprivation of tissue Fe and Fe-dependent oxidative processes rather than to reduction of cadmium accumulation.",M1
12514274,"Increasing the cooking temperature of meat does not affect nonheme iron absorption from a phytate-rich meal in women.The effect of increasing cooking temperatures of meat on nonheme iron absorption from a composite meal was investigated. Cysteine-containing peptides may have a role in the iron absorption enhancing effect of muscle proteins. Heat treatment can change the content of sulfhydryl groups produced from cysteine and thereby affect iron absorption. Twenty-one women (25 +/- 3 y) were served a basic meal without meat and two other meals consisting of the basic meal plus 75 g of pork meat cooked at 70, 95 or 120 degrees C. The meals were extrinsically labeled with (55)<e>Fe</e> or (59)Fe. Iron absorption was determined from measurements of whole-body (59)Fe retention and the activity of (55)Fe and (59)Fe in blood samples. Nonheme iron absorptions were 0.9 (0.5-4.0)% (P = 0.06), 0.7 (0.4-3.9)% (P = 0.1) and 2.0 (1.3-3.1)% (P &lt; 0.001) greater when meat cooked at 70, 95 or 120 degrees C, respectively, was added to the basic meal. Increasing the cooking temperature of meat did not impair nonheme iron absorption compared with cooking at 70 degrees C. Because the cysteine content of meat decreased with increasing cooking temperature, this argues against a specific contribution of sulfhydryl groups from cysteine residues in the promotion of nonheme iron absorption by meat proteins.",M1
12489824,"Bioavailability of Petit-Suisse cheese as food vehicle for iron fortification estimated by the prophylactic method.Microencapsulated ferrous sulfate (SFE-171) and ferric orthophosphate in Petit-Suisse cheese were examined for iron bioavailability by the prophylactic method. The iron sources were industrially added to different samples of Petit-Suisse cheese, which were mixed with other food components in our laboratory before use. A reference standard diet inclusive of nonmicroencapsulated ferrous sulfate and a control diet low in iron content were prepared in the laboratory. The final iron content in the fortified diets was approximately 15 mg <e>Fe</e>/kg diet. These diets were administered to weaning rats for 23 days. The iron bioavailability was evaluated as the ratio of iron incorporated into hemoglobin to oral iron intake, thereby being estimated as 62.6 +/- 8.8% for ferrous sulfate and 59.2 +/- 10.6% for SFE-171, which were significantly effective at p &lt; 0.01 compared to 43.4 +/- 10.5% for ferric orthophosphate. It thus turned out that SFE-171 was stable through industrial processing with Petit-Suisse cheese as the food vehicle and served as an iron fortifier equal to ferrous sulfate in bioavailability.",M1
12450908,"Efficacy and trial effectiveness of weekly and daily iron supplementation among pregnant women in rural Bangladesh: disentangling the issues.BACKGROUND: According to our current understanding, iron absorption with weekly iron supplements is not higher than that with daily supplements (ie, there is no mucosal block). However, community-based trials have repeatedly shown that a weekly regimen is as effective as a daily one. Furthermore, when differences in absorption are found, they are commonly smaller than would be expected on the basis of differences in the amount of iron provided. The possibility of differential compliance between the regimens needs to be evaluated to explain these findings. OBJECTIVE: Taking compliance into account, we compared the efficacy and trial effectiveness of weekly and daily iron supplementation during pregnancy. DESIGN: In Bangladesh, 50 antenatal centers were randomly assigned to prescribe either 2 doses of 60 mg <e>Fe</e> once weekly or 1 dose of 60 mg Fe/d. Compliance was monitored by using a pill bottle equipped with an electronic counting device. Hemoglobin concentrations were measured at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 wk of supplementation. RESULTS: There was no differential effect per iron tablet between weekly and daily regimens. A 12-wk daily regimen (68% compliance) produced a small but significantly greater hemoglobin response than did the weekly regimen (104% compliance). The first 20 tablets consumed produced most of the effect; after 40 tablets, there was no further response. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a mucosal block in the daily regimen. Over 12 wk, 50% of the amount of iron in a daily regimen was sufficient for maximum hemoglobin effect. The weekly regimen provided a large part of this amount, explaining the limited difference in effect.

We measured infarct volume and analysed the oxidative stress, and also the excitatory and inflammatory responses to brain injury in a rat stroke model after an increased oral iron intake. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in ten male Wistar rats fed with a diet containing 2.5% carbonyl iron for 9 weeks, and in ten control animals. Glutamate, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in blood samples before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h after MCAO, and thiobarbituric acid reaction substances (TBARS) were analysed at 48 h. Infarct volume was measured at 48 h by image analysis on brain slices stained with 1% TTC. Tissue iron was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Infarct volume was 66% greater in the iron fed rats than in the control group (178+/-49 mm(3) versus 107+/-53 mm(3), P&lt;0.01). Significant higher levels of glutamate, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were observed in the group with iron intake (peak values were obtained at 6, 8 and 4 h, respectively). Iron-fed animals also showed significantly higher levels of TBARS than those receiving a normal diet (6.52+/-0.59 vs. 5.62+/-0.86 micro mol/l, P=0.033) Liver iron stores (3500+/-199 vs. 352+/-28 micro g <e>Fe</e>/g, P&lt;0.0001), but not brain iron stores (131 vs. 139 micro g Fe/g, P=0.617), were significantly higher in the iron fed rats group. These results suggest that iron intake is associated with larger infarct volumes after MCAO in the rat. This effect seems to be associated with higher oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and inflammatory responses.",M1
12296427,"Response of liver and heart trace elements in rats to the interaction between dietary zinc and iron.An analysis of the interaction between dietary iron (<e>Fe</e>) and zinc (Zn) was performed by using data from Sprague-Dawley rats in a 5 x 4 fully crossed factorially arranged experiment. The concentrations of 9 trace elements from the liver and 10 from the heart were determined and subjected to diverse statistical analyses and were classified by their response to the interaction between dietary Fe and Zn. The interaction was studied by using analysis of variance (ANOVA), discriminant analysis, and logistic regression to determine the direction of interaction; that is, did dietary Fe affect dietary Zn or did dietary Zn affect dietary Fe? The use of discriminant analysis allowed for using multiple parameters (rather than a single parameter) to determine possible interactions between Fe and Zn. Thus, two main levels of interaction were studied: the separate response of each tissue mineral and the response of some grouped minerals. The responses studied were the effect of dietary Zn on tissue trace element parameters, the effect of dietary Fe on the parameters, the effect of dietary Zn on combined (grouped) parameters, and the effect of dietary Fe on combined parameters. As determined by ANOVA, only three individual trace elements--liver Fe, Cu, and Mo--were significantly affected by the interaction between Fe and Zn. However, a broader interaction between Fe and Zn is revealed when groups of, rather than single, trace elements arestudied. For example, an interaction between dietary Fe and Zn affects the weighted linear combination of heart Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn. This article presents the hypothesis that grouped parameters may be useful as status indicators. The complete dataset can be found at http://www.gfhnrc.ars. usda.gov/fezn.",M1
12221204,"Moderate iron overload enhances lipid peroxidation in livers of rats, but does not affect NF-kappaB activation induced by the peroxisome proliferator, Wy-14,643.It has been hypothesized that high concentrations of tissue iron may enhance carcinogenesis induced by free radical mechanisms. Wy-14,643 is a peroxisome proliferator that is hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Tumor induction may result in part from excessive production of reactive oxygen species, particularly H(2)O(2). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of iron status on oxidative stress and NF-kappaB activation in livers of rats treated with Wy-14,643. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of four diets (20, 45, 650, 1500 mg <e>Fe</e>/kg diet) for 28 d. At the time of tissue collection, liver iron ranged from 1.4 to 9.9 micro mol/g wet tissue in the diet groups. Wy-14,643 (0 or 0.1 g/100 g diet) was added to the diet for the final 10 d of the study. Wy-14,643 doubled the liver weight/body weight ratio (P = 0.0001), which was also increased by iron supplementation (P &lt; 0.01). Iron supplementation increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and/or conjugated dienes, but there was no synergism between Wy 14,643 and iron on lipid peroxidation measures. The hepatic DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was increased in rats administered Wy-14,643. However, differences in liver iron concentration did not alter activation of NF-kappaB in untreated rats or in those treated with Wy-14,643. DNA double-strand breakage was not affected by iron or Wy-14,643. In summary, although moderate changes in iron status altered liver lipid peroxidation, iron did not significantly increase oxidative stress induced by a hepatocarcinogenic peroxisome proliferator.",M1
20545365,"Structures of metal-substituted human histone deacetylase 8 provide mechanistic inferences on biological function .The metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) adopt an alpha/beta protein fold first identified in rat liver arginase. Despite insignificant overall amino acid sequence identity, these enzymes share a strictly conserved metal binding site with divergent metal specificity and stoichiometry. HDAC8, originally thought to be a Zn(2+)-metallohydrolase, exhibits increased activity with Co(2+) and <e>Fe</e>(2+) cofactors based on k(cat)/K(M) (Gantt, S. L., Gattis, S. G., and Fierke, C. A. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 6170-6178). Here, we report the first X-ray crystal structures of metallo-substituted HDAC8, Co(2+)-HDAC8, D101L Co(2+)-HDAC8, D101L Mn(2+)-HDAC8, and D101L Fe(2+)-HDAC8, each complexed with the inhibitor M344. Metal content of protein samples in solution is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. For the crystalline enzymes, peaks in Bijvoet difference Fourier maps calculated from X-ray diffraction data collected near the respective elemental absorption edges confirm metal substitution. Additional solution studies confirm incorporation of Cu(2+); Fe(3+) and Ni(2+) do not bind under conditions tested. The metal dependence of the substrate K(M) values and the K(i) values of hydroxamate inhibitors that chelate the active site metal are consistent with substrate-metal coordination in the precatalytic Michaelis complex that enhances catalysis. Additionally, although HDAC8 binds Zn(2+) nearly 10(6)-fold more tightly than Fe(2+), the affinities for both metal ions are comparable to the readily exchangeable metal concentrations estimated in living cells, suggesting that HDAC8 could bind either or both Fe(2+) or Zn(2+) in vivo.",M2
20536189,"Biophysical characterization of iron in mitochondria isolated from respiring and fermenting yeast.The distributions of <e>Fe</e> in mitochondria isolated from respiring, respiro-fermenting, and fermenting yeast cells were determined with an integrative biophysical approach involving Mossbauer and electronic absorption spectroscopies, electron paramagnetic resonance, and inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry. Approximately 40% of the Fe in mitochondria from respiring cells was present in respiration-related proteins. The concentration and distribution of Fe in respiro-fermenting mitochondria, where both respiration and fermentation occur concurrently, were similar to those of respiring mitochondria. The concentration of Fe in fermenting mitochondria was also similar, but the distribution differed dramatically. Here, levels of respiration-related Fe-containing proteins were diminished approximately 3-fold, while non-heme HS Fe(II) species, non-heme mononuclear HS Fe(III), and Fe(III) nanoparticles dominated. These changes were rationalized by a model in which the pool of non-heme HS Fe(II) ions serves as feedstock for Fe-S cluster and heme biosynthesis. The integrative approach enabled us to estimate the concentration of respiration-related proteins.",M2
20534554,"Organometallic mechanism of action and inhibition of the 4Fe-4S isoprenoid biosynthesis protein GcpE (IspG).We report the results of a series of chemical, EPR, ENDOR, and HYSCORE spectroscopic investigations of the mechanism of action (and inhibition) of GcpE, E-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl-4-diphosphate (HMBPP) synthase, also known as IspG, an <e>Fe</e>(4)S(4) cluster-containing protein. We find that the epoxide of HMBPP when reduced by GcpE generates the same transient EPR species as observed on addition of the substrate, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cyclo-diphosphate. ENDOR and HYSCORE spectra of these transient species (using (2)H, (13)C and (17)O labeled samples) indicate formation of an Fe-C-H containing organometallic intermediate, most likely a ferraoxetane. This is then rapidly reduced to a ferracyclopropane in which the HMBPP product forms an eta(2)-alkenyl pi- (or pi/sigma) complex with the 4th Fe in the Fe(4)S(4) cluster, and a similar  metallacycle  also forms between isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and GcpE. Based on this metallacycle concept, we show that an alkyne (propargyl) diphosphate is a good (K(i) approximately 300 nM) GcpE inhibitor, and supported again by EPR and ENDOR results (a (13)C hyperfine coupling of approximately 7 MHz), as well as literature precedent, we propose that the alkyne forms another pi/sigma metallacycle, an eta(2)-alkynyl, or ferracyclopropene. Overall, the results are of broad general interest because they provide new mechanistic insights into GcpE catalysis and inhibition, with organometallic bond formation playing, in both cases, a key role.",M2
20489182,"A role for tetrahydrofolates in the metabolism of iron-sulfur clusters in all domains of life.Iron-sulfur (<e>Fe</e>/S) cluster enzymes are crucial to life. Their assembly requires a suite of proteins, some of which are specific for particular subsets of Fe/S enzymes. One such protein is yeast Iba57p, which aconitase and certain radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes require for activity. Iba57p homologs occur in all domains of life; they belong to the COG0354 protein family and are structurally similar to various folate-dependent enzymes. We therefore investigated the possible relationship between folates and Fe/S cluster enzymes using the Escherichia coli Iba57p homolog, YgfZ. NMR analysis confirmed that purified YgfZ showed stereoselective folate binding. Inactivating ygfZ reduced the activities of the Fe/S tRNA modification enzyme MiaB and certain other Fe/S enzymes, although not aconitase. When successive steps in folate biosynthesis were ablated, folE (lacking pterins and folates) and folP (lacking folates) mutants mimicked the ygfZ mutant in having low MiaB activities, whereas folE thyA mutants supplemented with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (lacking pterins and depleted in dihydrofolate) and gcvP glyA mutants (lacking one-carbon tetrahydrofolates) had intermediate MiaB activities. These data indicate that YgfZ requires a folate, most probably tetrahydrofolate. Importantly, the ygfZ mutant was hypersensitive to oxidative stress and grew poorly on minimal media. COG0354 genes of bacterial, archaeal, fungal, protistan, animal, or plant origin complemented one or both of these growth phenotypes as well as the MiaB activity phenotype. Comparative genomic analysis indicated widespread functional associations between COG0354 proteins and Fe/S cluster metabolism. Thus COG0354 proteins have an ancient, conserved, folate-dependent function in the activity of certain Fe/S cluster enzymes.",M2
20486436,"Effects of iron on growth and intracellular chemical contents of Microcystis aeruginosa.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of iron on the growth, physiology and photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. METHODS: A gradient of iron concentrations was employed to investigate the growth, photo-pigments (chlorophyll A and phycocyanin), and cell chemical contents (C, N, P) of Microcystis aeruginosa in response to different iron additions. RESULTS: The specific growth rate during the exponential growth phase, as well as the cell chlorophyll A and the phycocyanin content, was limited by iron below 12.3 tmol <e>Fe</e> x L(-1). The growth was inhibited when the iron concentration was at 24.6 micromol Fe x L(-1). The cell chlorophyll A and the phycocyanin content were saturated when the iron concentration was above 12.3 micromol Fe x L(-1) and declined slightly at 24.6 micromol Fe x L(-1). At a low iron concentration (about 6.15 micromol Fe x L(-1) and less), the cell nitrogen and carbohydrate content were iron limited, and the variation of the cell phosphorus content was similar to that of the nitrogen and carbohydrate, with a transition point of 12.3 micromol Fe x L(-1). CONCLUSION: The variation of cynobacteria growth is synchronous with that of the photo-pigments or the cell chemical content, and there exist relationships among photosynthesis, growth and internal chemical content, which could be useful for the growth estimation from the cell characteristics.",M2
20481466,"Human iron-sulfur cluster assembly, cellular iron homeostasis, and disease.Iron-sulfur (<e>Fe</e>-S) proteins contain prosthetic groups consisting of two or more iron atoms bridged by sulfur ligands, which facilitate multiple functions, including redox activity, enzymatic function, and maintenance of structural integrity. More than 20 proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters in eukaryotes. Defective Fe-S cluster synthesis not only affects activities of many iron-sulfur enzymes, such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, but also alters the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis, causing both mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron deficiency. In this work, we review human Fe-S cluster biogenesis and human diseases that are caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Fe-S cluster biogenesis takes place essentially in every tissue of humans, and products of human disease genes, including frataxin, GLRX5, ISCU, and ABCB7, have important roles in the process. However, the human diseases, Friedreich ataxia, glutaredoxin 5-deficient sideroblastic anemia, ISCU myopathy, and ABCB7 sideroblastic anemia/ataxia syndrome, affect specific tissues, while sparing others. Here we discuss the phenotypes caused by mutations in these different disease genes, and we compare the underlying pathophysiology and discuss the possible explanations for tissue-specific pathology in these diseases caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenesis.",M2

20446731,"Photoreductive dissolution of iron oxides trapped in ice and its environmental implications.The availability of iron has been thought to be a main limiting factor for the productivity of phytoplankton and related with the uptake of atmospheric CO(2) and algal blooms in fresh and sea waters. In this work, the formation of bioavailable iron (<e>Fe</e>(II)(aq)) from the dissolution of iron oxide particles was investigated in the ice phase under both UV and visible light irradiation. The photoreductive dissolution of iron oxides proceeded slowly in aqueous solution (pH 3.5) but was significantly accelerated in polycrystalline ice, subsequently releasing more bioavailable ferrous iron upon thawing. The enhanced photogeneration of Fe(II)(aq) in ice was confirmed regardless of the type of iron oxides [hematite, maghemite (gamma-Fe(2)O(3)), goethite (alpha-FeOOH)] and the kind of electron donors. The ice-enhanced dissolution of iron oxides was also observed under visible light irradiation, although the dissolution rate was much slower compared with the case of UV radiation. The iron oxide particles and organic electron donors (if any) in ice are concentrated and aggregated in the liquid-like grain boundary region (freeze concentration effect) where protons are also highly concentrated (lower pH). The enhanced photodissolution of iron oxides should occur in this confined boundary region. We hypothesized that electron hopping through the interconnected grain boundaries of iron oxide particles facilitates the separation of photoinduced charge pairs. The outdoor experiments carried out under ambient solar radiation of Ny-Alesund (Svalbard, 78 degrees 55'N) also showed that the generation of dissolved Fe(II)(aq) via photoreductive dissolution is enhanced when iron oxides are trapped in ice. Our results imply that the ice(snow)-covered surfaces and ice-cloud particles containing iron-rich mineral dusts in the polar and cold environments provide a source of bioavailable iron when they thaw.",M2
20446730,"Synthesis of highly reactive subnano-sized zero-valent iron using smectite clay templates.A novel method was developed for synthesizing subnano-sized zero-valent iron (ZVI) using smectite clay layers as templates. Exchangeable <e>Fe</e>(III) cations compensating the structural negative charges of smectites were reduced with NaBH(4), resulting in the formation of ZVI. The unique structure of smectite clay, in which isolated exchangeable Fe(III) cations reside near the sites of structural negative charges, inhibited the agglomeration of ZVI resulting in the formation of subnanoscale ZVI particles in the smectite interlayer regions. X-ray diffraction revealed an interlayer spacing of approximately 5 A. The non-structural iron content of this clay yields a calculated ratio of two atoms of ZVI per three cation exchange sites, in full agreement with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results since the diameter of elemental Fe is 2.5 A. The clay-templated ZVI showed superior reactivity and efficiency compared to other previously reported forms of ZVI as indicated by the reduction of nitrobenzene; structural Fe within the aluminosilicate layers was nonreactive. At a 1:3 molar ratio of nitrobenzene/non-structural Fe, a reaction efficiency of 83% was achieved, and over 80% of the nitrobenzene was reduced within one minute. These results confirm that non-structural Fe from Fe(III)-smectite was reduced predominantly to ZVI which was responsible for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. This new form of subnanoscale ZVI may find utility in the development of remediation technologies for persistent environmental contaminants, for example, as components of constructed reactive domains such as reactive caps for contaminated sediments.",M2
20426439,"In-situ magnetic susceptibility measurements as a tool to follow geomicrobiological transformation of <e>Fe</e> minerals.Fe minerals sorb nutrients and pollutants and participate in microbial and abiotic redox reactions. Formation and transformation of Fe minerals is typically followed by mineral analysis at different time points. However, in lab studies the available sample amount is often limited and sampling may even influence the experimental conditions. We therefore evaluated the suitability of in situ magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements, which do not require sampling, as an alternative tool to follow ferro(i)magnetic mineral (trans-)formation during ferrihydrite reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and in soil microcosms. In our experiments with MR-1, a large initial increase in volume specific MS (kappa) followed by a slight decrease correlated well with the initial formation of magnetite and further reduction of magnetite to siderite as also identified by micro-XRD. The presence of humic acids retarded magnetite formation, and even inhibited magnetite formation completely, depending on their concentration. In soil microcosms, an increase in kappa accompanied by increasing concentrations of HCl-extractable Fe occurred only in microbially active set-ups, indicating a microbially induced change in soil Fe mineralogy. Based on our results, we conclude that MS measurements are suitable to follow microbial Fe mineral transformation in pure cultures as well as in complex soil samples.",M2

20421510,"Roles of glutamates and metal ions in a rationally designed nitric oxide reductase based on myoglobin.A structural and functional model of bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NOR) has been designed by introducing two glutamates (Glu) and three histidines (His) in sperm whale myoglobin. X-ray structural data indicate that the three His and one Glu (V68E) residues bind iron, mimicking the putative <e>Fe</e>(B) site in NOR, while the second Glu (I107E) interacts with a water molecule and forms a hydrogen bonding network in the designed protein. Unlike the first Glu (V68E), which lowered the heme reduction potential by approximately 110 mV, the second Glu has little effect on the heme potential, suggesting that the negatively charged Glu has a different role in redox tuning. More importantly, introducing the second Glu resulted in a approximately 100% increase in NOR activity, suggesting the importance of a hydrogen bonding network in facilitating proton delivery during NOR reactivity. In addition, EPR and X-ray structural studies indicate that the designed protein binds iron, copper, or zinc in the Fe(B) site, each with different effects on the structures and NOR activities, suggesting that both redox activity and an intermediate five-coordinate heme-NO species are important for high NOR activity. The designed protein offers an excellent model for NOR and demonstrates the power of using designed proteins as a simpler and more well-defined system to address important chemical and biological issues.",M2
20420442,"Ten year performance evaluation of a field-scale zero-valent iron permeable reactive barrier installed to remediate trichloroethene contaminated groundwater.The Monkstown zero-valent iron permeable reactive barrier (ZVI PRB), Europe's oldest commercially-installed ZVI PRB, had been treating trichloroethene (TCE) contaminated groundwater for about 10 years on the Nortel Network site in Northern Ireland when cores from the reactive zone were collected in December, 2006. Groundwater data from 2001-2006 indicated that TCE is still being remediated to below detection limits as the contaminated groundwater flows through the PRB. Ca and <e>Fe</e> carbonates, crystalline and amorphous Fe sulfides, and Fe (hydr)oxides have precipitated in the granular ZVI material in the PRB. The greatest variety of minerals is associated with a approximately 1-2 cm thick, slightly cemented crust on top (up-gradient influent entrance) of the ZVI section of the PRB and also with the discontinuous cemented ZVI material ( approximately 23 cm thick) directly below it. The greatest presence of microbial communities also occurred in the up-gradient influent portion of the PRB compared to its down-gradient effluent section, with the latter possibly due to less favorable conditions (i.e., high pH, low oxygen) for microbial growth. The ZVI filings in the down-gradient effluent section of the PRB have a projected life span of &gt;10 years compared with ZVI filings from the continuous to discontinuous cemented up-gradient ZVI section (upper approximately 25 cm) of the PRB, which may have a life span of only approximately 2-5 more years. Supporting Information from applied, multi-tracer testing indicated that restricted groundwater flow is occurring in the upper approximately 25 cm of the ZVI section and preferential pathways have also formed in this PRB over its 10 years of operation.",M2
20418861,"Stepwise [FeFe]-hydrogenase H-cluster assembly revealed in the structure of HydA(DeltaEFG).Complex enzymes containing <e>Fe</e>-S clusters are ubiquitous in nature, where they are involved in a number of fundamental processes including carbon dioxide fixation, nitrogen fixation and hydrogen metabolism. Hydrogen metabolism is facilitated by the activity of three evolutionarily and structurally unrelated enzymes: the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases and [Fe]-hydrogenases (Hmd). The catalytic core of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA), termed the H-cluster, exists as a [4Fe-4S] subcluster linked by a cysteine thiolate to a modified 2Fe subcluster with unique non-protein ligands. The 2Fe subcluster and non-protein ligands are synthesized by the hydrogenase maturation enzymes HydE, HydF and HydG; however, the mechanism, synthesis and means of insertion of H-cluster components remain unclear. Here we show the structure of HydA(DeltaEFG) (HydA expressed in a genetic background devoid of the active site H-cluster biosynthetic genes hydE, hydF and hydG) revealing the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and an open pocket for the 2Fe subcluster. The structure indicates that H-cluster synthesis occurs in a stepwise manner, first with synthesis and insertion of the [4Fe-4S] subcluster by generalized host-cell machinery and then with synthesis and insertion of the 2Fe subcluster by specialized hydE-, hydF- and hydG-encoded maturation machinery. Insertion of the 2Fe subcluster presumably occurs through a cationically charged channel that collapses following incorporation, as a result of conformational changes in two conserved loop regions. The structure, together with phylogenetic analysis, indicates that HydA emerged within bacteria most likely from a Nar1-like ancestor lacking the 2Fe subcluster, and that this was followed by acquisition in several unicellular eukaryotes.",M2
20417331,"Determination of Mn, <e>Fe</e>, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in seawater using high resolution magnetic sector inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS).A novel method, combining isotope dilution with standard additions, was developed for the analysis of eight elements (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in seawater. The method requires just 12 mL of sample and employs an off-line pre-concentration step using the commercially available chelating resin Toyopearl AF-Chelate-650M prior to determination by high resolution inductively coupled plasma magnetic sector mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Acidified samples were spiked with a multi-element standard of six isotopes ((57)Fe, (62)Ni, (65)Cu, (68)Zn, (111)Cd and (207)Pb) enriched over natural abundance. In addition, standard additions of a mixed Co and Mn standard were performed on sub-sets of the same sample. All samples were irradiated using a low power (119 mW cm(-2); 254 nm) UV system, to destroy organic ligands, before pre-concentration and extraction from the seawater matrix. Ammonium acetate was used to raise the pH of the 12 mL sub-samples (off-line) to pH 6.4+/-0.2 prior to loading onto the chelating resin. The extracted metals were eluted using 1.0 M Q-HNO(3) and determined using ICP-MS. The method was verified through the analysis of certified reference material (NASS-5) and the SAFe inter-comparison samples (S1 and D2), the results of which are in good agreement with the certified and reported consensus values.

20417183,"DR2539 is a novel DtxR-like regulator of Mn/<e>Fe</e> ion homeostasis and antioxidant enzyme in Deinococcus radiodurans.Transcriptional regulators of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) family control the expression of genes involved in the uptake of iron and manganese, which is not only necessitous nutrients but also was suggested to be essential for intracellular redox cycling of microorganisms. We identified a unique DtxR homologue (DR2539) with special characteristics from Deinococcus radiodurans, which is known for its extreme resistance to radiation and oxidants. The dr2539 mutant showed higher resistance to hydrogen peroxide than the wild-type strain R1. Intracellular catalase activity assay and semiquantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that this DtxR is a negative regulator of catalase (katE). Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR, global transcription profile and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the DtxR is involved in the regulation of antioxidant system by maintaining the intracellular Mn/Fe ion homeostasis of D. radiodurans. However, unlike the other DtxR homologues, the DtxR of D. radiodurans acts as a negative regulator of a Mn transporter gene (dr2283) and as a positive regulator of Fe-dependent transporter genes (dr1219, drb0125) in D. radiodurans.",M2

The present study is undertaken to determine Co, <e>Fe</e>, and Ni concentrations in sera from viral hepatitis patients. In all eighty patients with chronic hepatitis (B, C) and 29 healthy individuals were chosen for this study. Donors were selected from different environmental areas, including Aswan, Kom Ombo, and Edfu as polluted areas, and Daraw as an unpolluted area. Co, Fe, and Ni concentrations in patient and healthy blood serum were measured by two different analytical techniques: differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPA(d)SV) and atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The results reveal that Fe is present in higher level in the blood serum of hepatitis patients than in the healthy control, whereas Co and Ni showed the opposite trend. Hepatitis patients from Edfu area exhibited higher Fe level in their serum than those from the other areas, while hepatitis patients and healthy control from Daraw area (free from pollution) exhibited the lowest metal values. Patients with hepatitis C show lower levels of Co, Ni, and Fe in their serum than those with hepatitis B. A comparative study was carried out between the results using DPA(d)SV and AAS techniques, which are in very good agreements.",M2
20410416,"Quantification of hepatic iron deposition in patients with liver disease: comparison of chemical shift imaging with single-echo T2*-weighted imaging.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of chemical shift imaging, compared with that of single-echo T2*-weighted imaging, for hepatic iron quantification in patients with liver disease, and to examine the confounding effect of steatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients who underwent liver MRI and who had concomitant liver histopathologic analysis were retrospectively assessed. Chemical shift imaging and T2*-weighted imaging (n = 49) of the liver were reviewed by two independent observers. An iron index for each sequence (I(<e>Fe</e>-CSI) and I(Fe-T2*), respectively) was correlated with pathologic iron grade (0-4). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of both sequences for the diagnosis of iron deposition (grades &gt;or= 1, &gt;or= 2, and &gt;or= 3), and the impact of steatosis on accuracy was evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-seven (74.6%) patients had hepatic siderosis. There was a significant correlation between both I(Fe-CSI) and I(Fe-T2*) with pathologic iron grade (r = 0.65 and -0.61, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001 for both). I(Fe-CSI) and I(Fe-T2*) were significantly higher or lower in iron grades 2-4 versus grades 0-1 and in grades 3-4 versus grades 0-2 (p &lt; 0.001). Area under the curve values for detecting iron grade &gt;or= 1, &gt;or= 2, and &gt;or= 3 were 0.75, 0.88, and 0.90 for I(Fe-CSI) and 0.72, 0.81, and 0.98 for I(Fe-T2*). Accuracy was lower for both sequences in steatotic patients for detection of iron grades &gt;or= 1 and &gt;or= 2, without reaching significance. CONCLUSION: Routine chemical shift imaging and single-echo T2*-weighted imaging have excellent diagnostic performance for detection of significant hepatic siderosis (grade &gt;or= 2). Concomitant steatosis lowers the diagnostic performance of both sequences without reaching significance.",M2
20408812,"Transferrin-iron routing to the cytosol and mitochondria as studied by live and real-time fluorescence.In the present study we analysed the mechanism of intracellular routing of iron acquired by erythroid cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of Tf-<e>Fe</e> [Tf (transferrin)-iron]. Using real-time fluorimetry and flow cytometry, in conjunction with targeted fluorescent metal sensors, we monitored concurrently the cytosolic and mitochondrial changes in labile iron evoked by endocytosed Tf-Fe. In K562 human erythroleukaemia cells, most of the Tf-Fe was found to be delivered to the cytosolic labile iron pool by a saturable mechanism [60-120 nM Km (app)] that was quantitatively dependent on: Tf receptor levels, endosomal acidification/reduction for dislodging iron from Tf and ensuing translocation of labile iron into the cytosolic compartment. The parallel ingress of iron to mitochondria was also saturable, but with a relatively lower Km (app) (26-42 nM) and a lower maximal ingress per cell than into the cytosol. The ingress of iron into the mitochondrial labile iron pool was blocked by cytosol-targeted iron chelators, implying that a substantial fraction of Tf-Fe delivered to these organelles passes through the cytosol in non-occluded forms that remain accessible to high-affinity ligands. The present paper is the first report describing intracellular iron routing measured in intact cells in real-time and in quantitative terms, opening the road for also exploring the process in mixed-cell populations of erythroid origin.",M2
20399203,"The transition metals copper and iron in neurodegenerative diseases.Neurodegenerative diseases constitute a worldwide health problem. Metals like iron and copper are essential for life, but they are also involved in several neurodegenerative mechanisms such as protein aggregation, free radical generation and oxidative stress. The role of <e>Fe</e> and Cu, their pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic relevance are discussed regarding four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metal-mediated oxidation by Fenton chemistry is a common feature for all those disorders and takes part of a self-amplifying damaging mechanism, leading to neurodegeneration. The interaction between metals and proteins in the nervous system seems to be a crucial factor for the development or absence of neurodegeneration. The present review also deals with the therapeutic strategies tested, mainly using metal chelating drugs. Metal accumulation within the nervous system observed in those diseases could be the result of compensatory mechanisms to improve metal availability for physiological processes.",M2
20398794,"Exposure to excess dissolved iron in vivo affects oxidative status in the bivalve Mya arenaria.The effect of in vivo <e>Fe</e> exposure on the oxidative metabolism of the bivalve Myaarenaria was studied. Fe was supplemented in natural seawater and resulted in a significant increase in the total Fe content in the bivalve digestive gland (DG) between 9 to 17days of exposure. Mortality of treated animals increased drastically after day 18. Oxidative stress conditions were characterized in DG through assessment of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ascorbyl radical (A) content. Both parameters were affected following a biphasic profile showing significant increases by days 2 and 9 of Fe exposure. The content of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was significantly increased over control values by days 2, 9 and 17 of treatment. The labile Fe pool (LIP) in isolated DG was elevated over control values by day 7, and maintained this increase until day 17 of Fe exposure. The content of NO, assessed by EPR spin trapping, was 60% lower in DG of animals exposed for 2days to Fe than in control values, with no further changes. The biphasic profile of oxidative stress response to Fe exposure in DG suggests that at early stages of Fe supplementation the cellular control mechanisms, such as CAT activity, were operative to limit oxidative damage, but further Fe exposure overwhelmed these abilities. Moreover, the second phase could be understood as the consequence of the exhaustion of cellular protective systems that could also involve NO.",M2
20392879,"Antioxidant-rich oral supplements attenuate the effects of oral iron on in situ oxidation susceptibility of human feces.Prophylactic doses of 120 mg of iron (<e>Fe</e>) are commonly used to prevent Fe-deficiency anemia in vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries. Evidence shows that residual Fe in the large bowel may alter the normal antioxidant capacity of the fecal stream. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of dietary antioxidants from the Carotino Tocotrienol-Carotene Mixed Concentrate (CTCMC) on the depletion of fecal antioxidant capacity by oral Fe supplementation. In total, 17 healthy male adults participated in the 2 phases of the study, 5 in the pilot study and 12 in the definitive intervention trial. Participants received different treatments, separated by washout periods. These included: 120 mg Fe; 120 mg Fe and refined palm oil (FeOil); and 120 mg Fe in refined palm oil combined with 1 of 2 dosages (0.4 g and 0.8 g) of CTCMC/5 mL of refined palm oil (CTCB and CTCA treatments, respectively). Fecal samples were collected and analyzed to quantify the products of hydroxyl radical attack on salicylic acid (2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid, and catechol) at baseline and after active supplementation. Fe supplementation in either form (Fe or FeOil treatments) increased the concentrations of hydroxylated compounds in fecal samples. The production of hydroxylated compounds was significantly lower in treatments CTCB and CTCA than in the FeOil reference. Baseline antioxidant capacity state was virtually restored with dietary carotenoids and tocotrienols from the CTCMC. In conclusion, dietary antioxidants can reverse the depletion of fecal antioxidant capacity induced by oral Fe supplements.",M2
20391801,"Mineralization of C.I. Acid Red 14 azo dye by UV/<e>Fe</e>-ZSM5/H2O2, process.The zeolite Fe-ZSM5 was applied as a heterogeneous catalyst in the photo-Fenton process for mineralization of azo dye Acid Red 14 (AR14). Under optimal conditions (20 mM of H2O2 0.25 g L(-1) of catalyst and initial natural pH of the solution) 76% of total organic carbon (TOC) of a solution containing 40 mg L(-1) of the dye could be removed after 120 min in a 1.0 L tubular, closed-circulation batch photoreactor. Leaching tests and comparative experiments indicated that the application of the heterogeneous catalyst could increase the photo-Fenton process efficiency. A kinetic model was developed for this process and showed that the dye mineralization rate obeyed the pseudo-first order kinetic when the initial concentration of the dye was low. It was also observed that the catalytic behaviour of Fe-ZSM5 could be reproduced in consecutive experiments without a considerable drop in the process efficiency. Estimation of electrical energy consumption (EE/O) of the process as a function of mineralization efficiency revealed that the UV/Fe-ZSM5/H2O2 process not only increased the mineralization efficiency of the process, but also decreased the cost of electrical energy consumed by the process.",M2
20391799,"Application of Fe2V4O13 as a new multi-metal heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants.Iron tetrapolyvanadate (Fe2V4O13) was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that Fe2V4O13 could effectively catalyse H2O2 to generate active OH; therefore, Fe2V4O13 was employed as a new two-metal heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst. The decomposition of H2O2 and the degradation of Acid Orange II catalysed by Fe2V4O13 could be well described with a simple pseudo-first-order rate equation between the reaction temperatures of 15 degrees C and 30 degreesC. It was inferred from the reaction activation energy data that the generation of the hydroxyl radical was a control step in a series of reactions for the oxidation of Acid Orange II in the presence of H2O2 and Fe2V4O13. The catalytic activity of Fe2V4O13 towards degradation of Acid Orange II was not only much higher than that of alpha-Fe2O3, V2O5 and FeVO4 but also than that of their mixtures with an identical ratio of <e>Fe</e> and V, such as 2FeVO4 + V2O5 and Fe2O3 + 2V2O5. The high catalytic activity possibly involved a special two-way Fenton-like mechanism and the synergistic activation of Fe(III) and V(V) in Fe2V4O13 towards H2O2.",M2
20391109,"Pulmonary oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis in rat models of cardiovascular disease.Underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for the exacerbation of air pollution health effects. Pulmonary oxidative stress, inflammation, and altered iron (<e>Fe</e>) homeostasis secondary to CVD may influence mammalian susceptibility to air pollutants. Rodent models of CVD are increasingly used to examine mechanisms of variation in susceptibility. Baseline cardiac and pulmonary disease was characterized in healthy normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, cardiovascular compromised spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats. Blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing frequencies were measured in rats 11 to 12 wk of age, followed by necropsy at 14 to 15 wk of age. Blood pressure and heart rate were increased in SHR and SHHF relative to WKY rats (SHR &gt; SHHF &gt; WKY). Increased breathing frequency in SHHF and SHR (SHR &gt; SHHF &gt; WKY) resulted in greater minute volume relative to WKY. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein and neutrophils were higher in SHHF and SHR relative to WKY (SHHF &gt;&gt; SHR &gt; WKY). Lung ascorbate and glutathione levels were low in SHHF rats. BALF Fe-binding capacity was decreased in SHHF relative to WKY rats and was associated with increased transferrin (Trf) and ferritin. However, lung ferritin was lower and Trf was higher in SHHF relative to WKY or SHR rats. mRNA for markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-2, interleukin [IL]-1alpha, and heme oxygenase [HO]-1) were greater in SHHF and SHR relative to WKY rats. Trf mRNA rose in SHR but not SHHF relative to WKY rats, whereas transferrin receptors 1 and 2 mRNA was lower in SHHF rats. Four of 12 WKY rats exhibited cardiac hypertrophy despite normal blood pressure, while demonstrating some of the pulmonary complications noted earlier. This study demonstrates that SHHF rats display greater underlying pulmonary complications such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired Fe homeostasis than WKY or SHR rats, which may play a role in SHHF rats' increased susceptibility to air pollution.",M2
20390917,"Influence of Fenton reagent oxidation on mineralization and decolorization of municipal landfill leachate.This study evaluated the effectiveness of Fenton's technique for the treatment of semi-aerobic landfill leachate collected from Pulau Burung Landfill Site (PBLS), Penang, Malaysia. The Fe2+ or Fe3+ as catalyst and H2O2 as oxidizing agent are commonly used for the classical Fenton's reaction. In present study, the effect of operating conditions such as pH, reaction time, molar ratio, agitation rate, feeding mode and Fenton reagent concentrations which are important parameters that affect the removal efficiencies of Fenton method were investigated. Under the most favorable conditions, the highest removals of 58.1 and 78.3% were observed for COD and color, respectively. In general, the best operating conditions were pH = 3, <e>Fe</e> = 560 mg L(-1), H2O2 = 1020 mg L(-1), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio = 3, agitation rate = 400 rpm and reaction time = 120 minutes. The results highlighted that stepwise addition of Fenton's reagent was more effective than adding the entire volume in a single step. Excessive hydrogen peroxide and iron have shown scavenging effects on hydroxyl radicals and reduced degradation of refractory organics in the landfill leachate.",M2
20390913,"Oxidation of nitrogen-containing pollutants by novel ferrate(VI) technology: a review.Nitrogen-containing pollutants have been found in surface waters and industrial wastewaters due to their presence in pesticides, dyes, proteins, and humic substances. Treatment of these compounds by conventional oxidants produces disinfection by-products (DBP). Ferrate(VI) (<e>Fe</e>(VI)O(4)(2-), Fe(VI)) is a strong oxidizing agent and produces a non-toxic by-product Fe(III), which acts as a coagulant. Ferrate(VI) is also an efficient disinfectant and can inactivate chlorine resistant microorganisms. A novel ferrate(VI) technology can thus treat a wide range of pollutants and microorganisms in water and wastewater. The aim of this paper is to review the kinetics and products of the oxidation of nitrogen-containing inorganic (ammonia, hydroxylamine, hydrazine, and azide) and organic (amines, amino acids, anilines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and dyes) compounds by ferrate(VI) in order to demonstrate the feasibility of ferrate(VI) treatment of polluted waters of various origins. Several of the compounds can degraded in seconds to minutes by ferrate(VI) with the formation of non-hazardous products. The mechanism of oxidation involves either one-electron or two-electrons processes to yield oxidation products. Future research directions critical for the implementation of the ferrate(VI)-based technology for wastewater and industrial effluents treatment are recommended.",M2
20390909,"Parametric study on the effect of the ratios [H2O2]/[Fe3 +] and [H2O2]/[substrate] on the photo-Fenton degradation of cationic azo dye basic blue 41.An experimental parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of [H(2)O(2)], [<e>Fe</e>(3 +)] and [H(2)O(2)]/[Fe(3 +)] ratio on the photo-Fenton degradation of a azo dye Basic Blue 41 (BB41) in aqueous solution. This method consists of coupling between Fenton's reagent and UV irradiation in order to catalyze the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals, a powerful oxidizing agent which leads to degradation of organic pollutants until total mineralization. The kinetics study of the reaction between BB41 and hydroxyl radicals showed that the degradation of BB41 follows the first-order kinetics. It was found that the concentration of H(2)O(2) and ferric iron as well as their ratio [H(2)O(2)]/[Fe(3 +)] are key factors governing the removal of BB41 in aqueous medium and that the optimal ratio [H(2)O(2)]/[Fe(3 +)] is equal to 10 for 0.2 mM Fe(3 +) concentration. The initial BB41 concentration and the [H(2)O(2)]/[BB41] ratio are also found as significant operating parameters on the mineralization efficiency. The optimization of the operating conditions permitted to obtain a quasi-total mineralization of synthetic BB41 aqueous solutions. When these optimal conditions were applied to the real wastewater, 90% of TOC removal was obtained after 8 h of irradiation time.",M2
20390893,"Bio-dissolution of Ni, V and Mo from spent petroleum catalyst using iron oxidizing bacteria.Bioleaching studies of spent petroleum catalyst containing Ni, V and Mo were carried out using iron oxidizing bacteria. Various leaching parameters such as <e>Fe</e>(II) concentration, pulp density, pH, temperature and particle size were studied to evaluate their effects on the leaching efficiency as well as the kinetics of dissolution. The percentage of leaching of Ni and V were higher than Mo. The leaching process followed a diffusion controlled model and the product layer was observed to be impervious due to formation of ammonium jarosite (NH(4))Fe(3)(SO(4))(2)(OH)(6). Apart from this, the lower leaching efficiency of Mo was due to a hydrophobic coating of elemental sulfur over Mo matrix in the spent catalyst. The diffusivities of the attacking species for Ni, V and Mo were also calculated.",M2
20390891,"Effects of key reaction parameters on the reductive dechlorination of chloroform with Pd/Fe0 bimetal in aqueous solution.In this study, bimetallic Pd/<e>Fe</e>(0) particles were synthesized and employed to reduce chloroform in aqueous solution. The investigation emphasized on the effects of some key reaction parameters including Pd/Fe(0) dosage, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and presence of anions on the reductive dechlorination reaction. The experimental results showed that high Pd/Fe(0) dosage, low initial pH and low ORP benefited the reductive dechlorination of chloroform. The ORP values in the aqueous chloroform solution bubbled with different gases of N(2), O(2) and air varied significantly and the efficiency of chloroform degradation under different atmospheres followed an order from high to low as N(2) &gt; air &gt; O(2). The experiments also demonstrated that SO(4)(2 -) and NO(3)(-) ions inhibited the dechlorination reaction significantly, while H(2)PO(4)(-) ion had no significant influence on the dechlorination.",M2
20390884,"Oxidation kinetics of degradation of 1,4-dioxane in aqueous solution by H2O2/<e>Fe</e>(II) system.Kinetic studies of oxidative degradation of 1,4-dioxane present in aqueous solutions in the concentration range between 2.27 x 10(-3) mol/L (200 ppm) and 5.68 x 10(-3) mol/L (500 ppm) were conducted in batch rector. This analysis considers the hydroxyl radicals ((*)OH) produced by Fenton reagent as the main species responsible for the degradation process. 1,4-dioxane was degraded to the extent of 97 to 99% after 30 min of reaction time. The pH of the reaction medium decreased substantially during the experiment. In all cases, most of 1,4-dixane degradation occurred during the initial 5 min of reaction. A kinetic model is proposed for the oxidation of 1,4-dioxane by Fenton reagent and this model is applied to calculate the kinetic rate constant for the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and 1,4 dioxane. The reaction rate constant for the reaction of 1,4-dioxane with (*)OH radicals was evaluated and the value is 2.25 x 10(8)/M-s.",M2
20390857,"Arsenic removal from water using iron-impregnated granular activated carbon in the presence of bacteria.This study investigated the adsorption of arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] to iron-impregnated granular activated carbon (<e>Fe</e>-GAC), focusing on the effects of bacteria on arsenic removal. Characteristics of Fe-GAC were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Batch experiments were performed under various experimental conditions to determine the adsorption of As(III) and As(V) to Fe-GAC in the absence and presence of bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Bacillus subtilis). In addition, biosorption of As(III) and As(V) to bacteria was observed with batch experiments. Experimental results showed that Fe-GAC was characterized by mosaic-like deposition layers separated by interspacing on the surface. Iron impregnation increased the removal of As(III) and As(V) in GAC. Biosorption experiments indicated that a small amount of As(V) adsorbed to bacteria while no adsorption of As(III) was observed. This phenomenon can be attributed to interactions of anionic As(V) with positively-charged amine groups present on bacterial surfaces. Results also showed that the influence of bacteria on arsenic removal in Fe-GAC was not eminent in our experimental conditions even though bacteria could occupy surface adsorption sites on iron (hydr)oxides. This study demonstrated that hindrance effects of bacteria on arsenic adsorption to the surfaces of Fe-GAC were minimal.",M2

The aim of the present study was to demonstrate trace mineral interactions among organic copper, iron, manganese and zinc (Cu, <e>Fe</e>, Mn and Zn) in broiler chickens. 2. Three experiments were conducted using a control diet which was deficient in Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. 3. In experiment 1, the control diet, supplemental organic Cu, Fe alone and combined diets, were randomly fed to 4 groups of one-day-old Cobb broilers (each group had 6 replicates of 4 birds). 4. In experiment 2, the control diet, supplemental organic Mn and Zn alone or combined with Cu, Fe diets and corresponding inorganic combined diet, were randomly fed to 6 groups (each group had 8 replicates of 6 birds). 5. In experiment 3, the depletion of organic Zn, the depletion of inorganic Zn and normal Zn treatments were carried out in three groups of one-day-old Cobb broilers (each group had 8 replicates of 6 birds). 6. Adding organic Cu, Fe and Mn alone or combined to Zn deficient diets did not significantly improve bird performance and were mostly excreted. Supplemental organic Zn alone or combined with other elements significantly increased feed intake, body weight gain and tibia bone length. However, supplemental organic Fe alone or combined with Cu significantly increased feed intake but had no obvious effect on body weight gain. The organic Fe supplementation resulted in a wider tibia. 7. Depletion of organic and inorganic Zn resulted in decreased feed intake, body weight gain and total tibia bone Zn content. Zinc deficiency did not affect the uptake of organic Fe by tibia bone but reduced its total Fe content. 8. Zinc is the first limiting element among these 4 trace minerals. Adding Mn, Cu and Fe to Zn deficient diets did not stimulate bird performance. Surplus organic Fe and Cu resulted in increased feed intake and increased tibia bone Fe content but did not contribute to bird performance.",M2

All experiments were performed in a 1.0 L tubular closed circulation batch photo-reactor. The dye degradation quantum yield was maximal when the solution initial pH was about 5. An amount of about 0.3 mg L(-1) of Fe ions leached out of the zeolite. However, monitoring Fe ion concentration during the experiments showed that the efficiency of the process is not due to the leached Fe ions. The effect of pH on decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide in different systems such as H(2)O(2) alone, UV/H(2)O(2), UV/Zeolite and UV/Zeolite/H(2)O(2) was explored in detail to explain the results obtained.",M2

20388194,"Phloem small RNAs, nutrient stress responses, and systemic mobility.BACKGROUND: Nutrient availabilities and needs have to be tightly coordinated between organs to ensure a balance between uptake and consumption for metabolism, growth, and defense reactions. Since plants often have to grow in environments with sub-optimal nutrient availability, a fine tuning is vital. To achieve this, information has to flow cell-to-cell and over long-distance via xylem and phloem. Recently, specific miRNAs emerged as a new type of regulating molecules during stress and nutrient deficiency responses, and miR399 was suggested to be a phloem-mobile long-distance signal involved in the phosphate starvation response. RESULTS: We used miRNA microarrays containing all known plant miRNAs and a set of unknown small (s) RNAs earlier cloned from Brassica phloem sap 1, to comprehensively analyze the phloem response to nutrient deficiency by removing sulfate, copper or iron, respectively, from the growth medium. We show that phloem sap contains a specific set of sRNAs that is distinct from leaves and roots, and that the phloem also responds specifically to stress. Upon S and Cu deficiencies phloem sap reacts with an increase of the same miRNAs that were earlier characterized in other tissues, while no clear positive response to -<e>Fe</e> was observed. However, -Fe led to a reduction of Cu- and P-responsive miRNAs. We further demonstrate that under nutrient starvation miR399 and miR395 can be translocated through graft unions from wild type scions to rootstocks of the miRNA processing hen1-1 mutant. In contrast, miR171 was not transported. Translocation of miR395 led to a down-regulation of one of its targets in rootstocks, suggesting that this transport is of functional relevance, and that miR395, in addition to the well characterized miR399, could potentially act as a long-distance information transmitter. CONCLUSIONS: Phloem sap contains a specific set of sRNAs, of which some specifically accumulate in response to nutrient deprivation. From the observation that miR395 and miR399 are phloem-mobile in grafting experiments we conclude that translocatable miRNAs might be candidates for information-transmitting molecules, but that grafting experiments alone are not sufficient to convincingly assign a signaling function.",M2
20385840,"Bovine cytochrome c oxidase structures enable O2 reduction with minimization of reactive oxygens and provide a proton-pumping gate.The O(2) reduction site of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), comprising iron (<e>Fe</e>(a3)) and copper (Cu(B)) ions, is probed by x-ray structural analyses of CO, NO, and CN(-) derivatives to investigate the mechanism of the complete reduction of O(2). Formation of the derivative contributes to the trigonal planar coordination of and displaces one of its three coordinated imidazole groups while a water molecule becomes hydrogen bonded to both the CN(-) ligand and the hydroxyl group of Tyr244. When O(2) is bound to Fe2+a3 , it is negatively polarized (O2- ), and expected to induce the same structural change induced by CN(-). This structural change allows to receive three electron equivalents nonsequentially from Cu1B+, Fe3+a3, and Tyr-OH, providing complete reduction of O(2) with minimization of production of active oxygen species. The proton-pumping pathway of bovine CcO comprises a hydrogen-bond network and a water channel which extend to the positive and negative side surfaces, respectively. Protons transferred through the water channel are pumped through the hydrogen-bond network electrostatically with positive charge created at the Fe(a) center by electron donation to the O(2) reduction site. Binding of CO or NO to induces significant narrowing of a section of the water channel near the hydrogen-bond network junction, which prevents access of water molecules to the network. In a similar manner, O(2) binding to is expected to prevent access of water molecules to the hydrogen-bond network. This blocks proton back-leak from the network and provides an efficient gate for proton-pumping.",M2
20385754,"Zinc uptake contributes to motility and provides a competitive advantage to Proteus mirabilis during experimental urinary tract infection.Proteus mirabilis, a Gram-negative bacterium, represents a common cause of complicated urinary tract infections in catheterized patients or those with functional or anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. ZnuB, the membrane component of the high-affinity zinc (Zn(2+)) transport system ZnuACB, was previously shown to be recognized by sera from infected mice. Since this system has been shown to contribute to virulence in other pathogens, its role in Proteus mirabilis was investigated by constructing a strain with an insertionally interrupted copy of znuC. The znuC::Kan mutant was more sensitive to zinc limitation than the wild type, was outcompeted by the wild type in minimal medium, displayed reduced swimming and swarming motility, and produced less flaA transcript and flagellin protein. The production of flagellin and swarming motility were restored by complementation with znuCB in trans. Swarming motility was also restored by the addition of Zn(2+) to the agar prior to inoculation; the addition of <e>Fe</e>(2+) to the agar also partially restored the swarming motility of the znuC::Kan strain, but the addition of Co(2+), Cu(2+), or Ni(2+) did not. ZnuC contributes to but is not required for virulence in the urinary tract; the znuC::Kan strain was outcompeted by the wild type during a cochallenge experiment but was able to colonize mice to levels similar to the wild-type level during independent challenge. Since we demonstrated a role for ZnuC in zinc transport, we hypothesize that there is limited zinc present in the urinary tract and P. mirabilis must scavenge this ion to colonize and persist in the host.",M2
20382967,"ClpC1, an ATP-dependent Clp protease in plastids, is involved in iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis leaves.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Iron (<e>Fe</e>) is necessary for plant growth and development. Although it is well known that Fe deficiency causes chlorosis in plants, it remains unclear how the Fe homeostasis is regulated in mesophyll cells. The aim of this work was to identify a gene related to Fe homeostasis in leaves. METHODS: A spontaneous mutant irm1, which revealed typical Fe-deficiency chlorosis, was found from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using map-based cloning, the gene responsible for the altered phenotype of irm1 was cloned. The expression of genes was analysed using northern blot hybridization and multiplex RT-PCR analysis. Further, GUS staining with transgenic promoter-GUS lines and transient expression of the fusion protein with GFP were used for detecting the expression pattern of the gene in different tissues and at different developmental stages, and for the subcelluar localization of the gene product. KEY RESULTS: A point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 2317 of ClpC1 on chromosome V of Arabidopsis is responsible for the irm1 phenotype. The leaf chlorosis of the mutant irm1 and clpc1 (a T-DNA-inserted null mutant of ClpC1) could be converted to green by watering the soil with Fe solution. The expression intensity of ferric reductase FRO8 in irm1 and clpc1 was disordered (significantly higher than that of wild type). CONCLUSIONS: The glycine residue at amino acid 773 of ClpC1 is essential for its functions. In addition to its known functions reported previously, ClpC1 is involved in leaf Fe homeostasis, presumably via chloroplast translocation of some nuclear-encoded proteins which function in Fe transport.",M2
20381026,"Low iron stores are related to higher blood concentrations of manganese, cobalt and cadmium in non-smoking, Norwegian women in the HUNT 2 study.Low iron (<e>Fe</e>) stores may influence absorption or transport of divalent metals in blood. To obtain more knowledge about such associations, the divalent metal ions cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) and parameters of Fe metabolism (serum ferritin, haemoglobin (Hb) and transferrin) were investigated in 448 healthy, menstruating non-smoking women, age 20-55 years (mean 38 years), participating in the Norwegian HUNT 2 study. The study population was stratified for serum ferritin: 257 were iron-depleted (serum ferritin &lt; 12 microg/L) and 84 had iron deficiency anaemia (serum ferritin &lt; 12 microg/L and Hb &lt; 120 g/L). The low ferritin group had increased blood concentrations of Mn, Co and Cd but normal concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb. In multiple regression models, ferritin emerged as the main determinant of Mn, Co and Cd (p &lt; 0.001), while no significant associations with Cu, Zn and Pb were found. Adjusted r(2) for the models were 0.28, 0.48 and 0.34, respectively. Strong positive associations between blood concentrations of Mn, Co and Cd were observed, also when controlled for their common association with ferritin. Apart from these associations, the models showed no significant interactions between the six divalent metals studied. Very mild anaemia (110 &lt; or = Hb &lt; 120 g/L) did not seem to have any effect independent of low ferritin. Approximately 26% of the women with iron deficiency anaemia had high concentrations of all of Mn, Co and Cd as opposed to 2.3% of iron-replete subjects. The results confirm that low serum ferritin may have an impact on body kinetics of certain divalent metal ions, but not all. Only a fraction of women with low iron status exhibited an increased blood concentration of divalent metals, providing indication of complexities in the body's handling of these metals.",M2
20380459,"Transition-metal ions in zeolites: coordination and activation of oxygen.Zeolites containing transition-metal ions (TMIs) often show promising activity as heterogeneous catalysts in pollution abatement and selective oxidation reactions. In this paper, two aspects of research on the TMIs Cu, Co, and <e>Fe</e> in zeolites are discussed: (i) coordination to the lattice and (ii) activated oxygen species. At low loading, TMIs preferably occupy exchange sites in six-membered oxygen rings (6MR), where the TMIs preferentially coordinate with the O atoms of Al tetrahedra. High TMI loadings result in a variety of TMI species formed at the zeolite surface. Removal of the extralattice O atoms during high-temperature pretreatments can result in autoreduction. Oxidation of reduced TMI sites often results in the formation of highly reactive oxygen species. In Cu-ZSM-5, calcination with O(2) results in the formation of a species, which was found to be a crucial intermediate in both the direct decomposition of NO and N(2)O and the selective oxidation of methane into methanol. An activated oxygen species, called alpha-O, is formed in Fe-ZSM5 and reported to be the active site in the partial oxidation of methane and benzene into methanol and phenol, respectively. However, this reactive alpha-O can only be formed with N(2)O, not with O(2). O(2)-activated Co intermediates in faujasite (FAU) zeolites can selectively oxidize alpha-pinene and epoxidize styrene. In Co-FAU, Co(III) superoxo and peroxo complexes are suggested to be the active cores, whereas in Cu and Fe-ZSM-5, various monomeric and dimeric sites have been proposed, but no consensus has been obtained. Very recently, the active site in Cu-ZSM-5 was identified as a bent [Cu-O-Cu](2+) core (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009, 106, 18908-18913). Overall, O(2) activation depends on the interplay of structural factors such as the type of zeolite and sizes of the channels and cages and chemical factors such as the Si/Al ratio and the nature, charge, and distribution of the charge-balancing cations. The presence of several different TMI sites hinders the direct study of the spectroscopic features of the active site. Spectroscopic techniques capable of selectively probing these sites, even if they only constitute a minor fraction of the total amount of TMI sites, are thus required. Fundamental knowledge of the geometric and electronic structures of the reactive active site can help in the design of novel selective oxidation catalysts.",M2
20380376,"Chemical transformations during aging of zerovalent iron nanoparticles in the presence of common groundwater dissolved constituents.Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) that was aged in simulated groundwater was evaluated for alterations in composition and speciation over 6 months to understand the possible transformations NZVI could undergo in natural waters. NZVI was exposed to 10 mN of various common groundwater anions (Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-), HPO(4)(2-), and HCO(3)(-)) or to dissolved oxygen (saturated, approximately 9 mg/L). Fresh and exposed NZVI samples, along with <e>Fe</e>-oxide model compounds, were then analyzed using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to yield both relative oxidation state, using the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and quantitative speciation information regarding the types and proportions of mineral species present, from analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Over 1 month of aging the dissolved anions inhibited the oxidation of the NZVI to varying degrees. Aging for 6 months, however, resulted in average oxidation states that were similar to each other regardless of the anion used, except for nitrate. Nitrate passivated the NZVI surface such that even after 6 months of aging the particles retained nearly the same mineral and Fe(0) content as fresh NZVI. Linear least-squares combination fitting (LCF) of the EXAFS spectra for 1 month-aged samples indicated that the oxidized particles remain predominantly a binary phase system containing Fe(0) and Fe(3)O(4), while the 6 month aged samples contained additional mineral phases such as vivianite (Fe(3)(PO(4))(2).8H(2)O) and iron sulfate species, possibly schwertmannite (Fe(3+)(16)O(16)(OH,SO(4))(12-13).10-12H(2)O). The presence of these additional mineral species was confirmed using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD). NZVI exposed to water saturated with dissolved oxygen showed a rapid (&lt;24 h) loss of Fe(0) and evolved both magnetite and maghemite (gamma-Fe(2)O(3)) within the oxide layer. These findings have implications toward the eventual fate, transport, and toxicity of NZVI used for groundwater remediation.",M2
20378150,"Toxicity of xenobiotics during sulfate, iron, and nitrate reduction in primary sewage sludge suspensions.The effect and persistence of six organic xenobiotics was tested under sulfate-, iron-, and nitrate-reducing conditions in primary sewage sludge suspensions. The xenobiotics tested were acenaphthene, phenanthrene, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) added to initial analytical concentrations of 54-117 mgL(-1). The suspensions were incubated at 30 degrees C for 15 weeks and rates of sulfate, iron, and nitrate reduction were estimated from the time course of hydrogen sulfide accumulation, <e>Fe</e>(II) accumulation, and nitrate depletion, respectively. Chemical analysis showed that the xenobiotics were persistent under the different electron acceptor regimes for the duration of the experiment. This was partly attributed to low bioavailability and microbial toxicity of the xenobiotics. Rates of anaerobic respiration in control suspensions (without added xenobiotics) showed a weekly reduction potential of 0.84 mM SO(4)(2-), 0.92 mM Fe(III), and 9.25 mM NO(3)(-). All three processes were completely inhibited by 1,2,4-TCB (54 mgL(-1)) whereas there was no significant (P&lt;0.05) toxicity of phenanthrene (109 mgL(-1)) and DEHP (105 mgL(-1)). Sulfate reduction was inhibited completely by LAS (105 mgL(-1)), 76% by acenaphthene (54 mgL(-1)) and 57% by 4-NP (117 mgL(-1)), and likewise iron reduction was inhibited 62% by LAS and 55% by 4-NP (the latter though at P&lt;0.10). Nitrate reduction was not significantly inhibited by acenaphthene and 4-NP and furthermore was resistant to LAS toxicity (105 mgL(-1)). Nitrate reduction also had the highest potential for mineralization of organic matter and thus was the most robust of the tested anaerobic processes in the sewage sludge suspensions.",M2
20377174,"Hydrogen peroxide photocycling in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea.The dynamics of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was investigated from December 2007 to October 2008 in the Gulf of Aqaba, which in the absence of H(2)O(2) contribution from biological production, rain and runoff, turned out to be a unique natural photochemical laboratory. A distinct seasonal pattern emerged, with highest midday surface H(2)O(2) concentrations in spring-summer (30-90 nM) as compared to winter (10-30 nM). Similarly, irradiation normalized net H(2)O(2) formation rates obtained in concurrent ship-board experiments were faster in spring-summer than in winter. These seasonal patterns were attributed to changes in water characteristics, namely elevated spring-summer chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The role of trace elements in H(2)O(2) photoformation was studied by simultaneously measuring superoxide (O(2)(-)), <e>Fe</e>(II), and H(2)O(2) formation and loss in ambient seawater and in the presence of superoxide dismutase, iron and copper. O(2)(-) was found to decay fast in the Gulf water, with a half-life of 15-28 s, primarily due to catalytic reactions with trace metals (predominantly copper). Hence, H(2)O(2) formation in the Gulf involves metal-catalyzed O(2)(-) disproptionation. Added iron moderately lowered net H(2)O(2) photoformation, probably due to its participation in Fe(II) oxidation, a process that may also modify H(2)O(2) formation in situ.",M2
20375262,"Bioactive dietary polyphenols decrease heme iron absorption by decreasing basolateral iron release in human intestinal Caco-2 cells.Because dietary polyphenolic compounds have a wide range of effects in vivo and vitro, including chelation of metals such as iron, it is prudent to test whether the regular consumption of dietary bioactive polyphenols impair the utilization of dietary iron. Because our previous study showed the inhibitory effect of (-) -epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and grape seed extract (GSE) on nonheme iron absorption, we investigated whether EGCG and GSE also affect iron absorption from heme. The fully differentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells grown on microporous membrane inserts were incubated with heme (55)<e>Fe</e> in uptake buffer containing EGCG or GSE in the apical compartment for 7 h. Both EGCG and GSE decreased (P &lt; 0.05) transepithelial transport of heme-derived iron. However, apical heme iron uptake was increased (P &lt; 0.05) by GSE. Despite the increased cellular levels of heme (55)Fe, the transfer of iron across the intestinal basolateral membrane was extremely low, indicating that basolateral export was impaired by GSE. In contrast, EGCG moderately decreased the cellular assimilation of heme (55)Fe, but the basolateral iron transfer was extremely low, suggesting that the basolateral efflux of heme iron was also inhibited by EGCG. Expression of heme oxygenase, ferroportin, and hephaestin protein was not changed by EGCG and GSE. The apical uptake of heme iron was temperature dependent and saturable in fully differentiated Caco-2 cells. Our data show that bioactive dietary polyphenols inhibit heme iron absorption mainly by reducing basolateral iron exit rather than decreasing apical heme iron uptake in intestinal cells.",M2

Selenium contents ranged between 0.42 and 1.20 mg/kg wet tissue (wt) in Hereford (H) breed and between 0.49 and 1.3 mg/kg wt in Braford (B) breed. In H and B breeds, T, TT and RP, and TT and RP were the richest cuts in selenium, respectively. Copper contents ranged between 0.25 and 1.04 mg/kg wt in H, and between 0.19 and 1.09 mg/kg wt in B. In H breed, RP had significantly more Cu than ER, TT, and RR. In B breed, ER and RR show a significant lower Cu level in comparison to the other meat cuts.

Here we report that GLRX5 is essential for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis in human cells. GLRX5, a mitochondrial protein that is highly expressed in erythroid cells, can homodimerize and assemble [2Fe-2S] in vitro. In GLRX5-deficient cells, [<e>Fe</e>-S] cluster biosynthesis was impaired, the iron-responsive element-binding (IRE-binding) activity of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) was activated, and increased IRP2 levels, indicative of relative cytosolic iron depletion, were observed together with mitochondrial iron overload. Rescue of patient fibroblasts with the WT GLRX5 gene by transfection or viral transduction reversed a slow growth phenotype, reversed the mitochondrial iron overload, and increased aconitase activity. Decreased aminolevulinate delta, synthase 2 (ALAS2) levels attributable to IRP-mediated translational repression were observed in erythroid cells in which GLRX5 expression had been downregulated using siRNA along with marked reduction in ferrochelatase levels and increased ferroportin expression. Erythroblasts express both IRP-repressible ALAS2 and non-IRP-repressible ferroportin 1b. The unique combination of IRP targets likely accounts for the tissue-specific phenotype of human GLRX5 deficiency.",M2
20360560,"Simulated atmospheric processing of iron oxyhydroxide minerals at low pH: roles of particle size and acid anion in iron dissolution.A number of recent studies have shown that iron dissolution in <e>Fe</e>-containing dust aerosol can be linked to source material (mineral or anthropogenic), mineralogy, and iron speciation. All of these factors need to be incorporated into atmospheric chemistry models if these models are to accurately predict the impact of Fe-containing dusts into open ocean waters. In this report, we combine dissolution measurements along with spectroscopy and microscopy to focus on nanoscale size effects in the dissolution of Fe-containing minerals in low-pH environments and the importance of acid type, including HNO(3), H(2)SO(4), and HCl, on dissolution. All of these acids are present in the atmosphere, and dust particles have been shown to be associated with nitrate, sulfate, and/or chloride. These measurements are done under light and dark conditions so as to simulate and distinguish between daytime and nighttime atmospheric chemical processing. Both size (nano- versus micron-sized particles) and anion (nitrate, sulfate, and chloride) are found to play significant roles in the dissolution of alpha-FeOOH under both light and dark conditions. The current study highlights these important, yet unconsidered, factors in the atmospheric processing of iron-containing mineral dust aerosol.",M2
20359941,"Iron-oxide aerogel and xerogel catalyst formulations: characterization by 57Fe M√∂ssbauer and XAFS spectroscopies.Iron in various iron-oxide aerogel and xerogel catalyst formulations (&gt; or =85% <e>Fe</e>(2)O(3); &lt; or =10% K, Co, Cu, or Pd) developed for possible use in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction has been examined by (57)Fe M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. The seventeen samples consisted of both as-prepared and calcined aerogels and xerogels and their products after use as catalysts for FTS or the WGS reaction. Complementary XAFS spectra were obtained on the occurrence of the secondary elements in some of the same materials. A broad, slightly asymmetric, two-peak M√∂ssbauer spectrum was obtained from the different as-prepared and calcined catalyst formulations in the majority of cases. Such spectra could only be satisfactorily fit with three quadrupole doublet components, but no systematic trends in the isomer shift and quadrupole splitting parameters and area ratios of the individual components could be discerned that reflected variations in the composition or preparation of the aerogel or xerogel materials. However, significant reductions were noted in the M√∂ssbauer effective thickness (recoilless absorption effect per unit mass of iron) parameter, chi(eff)/g, determined at room temperature, for aerogels and xerogels compared to bulk iron oxides, reflecting the openness and lack of rigidity of the aerogel and xerogel structures. M√∂ssbauer measurements for two aerogels over the range from 15 to 292K confirmed the greatly diminished nature of this parameter at room temperature. Major increases in the effective thickness parameter were observed when the open structure of the aerogel or xerogel collapsed during calcination resulting in the formation of iron oxides (hematite, spinel ferrite). Similar structural changes were indicated by increases in this parameter after use of iron-oxide aerogels as catalysts for FTS or the WGS reaction, during which the iron-oxide aerogel was converted to a mixture of nonstoichiometric magnetite and the H√§gg carbide, chi-Fe(5)C(2), or nonstoichiometric magnetite, respectively.",M2
20359483,"Molecular architecture of the Mn2+-dependent lactonase UlaG reveals an RNase-like metallo-beta-lactamase fold and a novel quaternary structure.The ulaG gene, located in the ula regulon, is crucial for the catabolism of l-ascorbate under anaerobic conditions and it has been proposed to encode for the putative l-ascorbate-6-P lactonase. The ulaG gene is widespread among eubacteria, including human commensal and pathogenic genera such as Escherichia, Shigella, Klebsiella and Salmonella. Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of the apoenzyme and Mn(2+) holoenzyme of UlaG from E. coli to 2.6 A resolution, determined using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and molecular replacement, respectively. The structures reveal a highly specialized metallo-beta-lactamase-like fold derived from an ancient structural template that was involved in RNA maturation and DNA repair. This fold has a novel quaternary architecture consisting of a hexameric ring formed by a trimer of UlaG dimers. A mononuclear Mn(2)(+)-binding site resides at the core of the active site, which displays micromolar affinity for Mn(2+) and a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination. The active site Mn(2+) ion can be replaced by Co(2+) or Zn(2+), but not by <e>Fe</e>(3+). We further show that the Mn(2+) or Co(2)(+)-loaded enzyme exhibits lactonase activity towards l-ascorbate 6-P, thereby providing the first direct evidence of its catalytic role in the L-ascorbate catabolic pathway. Guided by the structural homology, we show that UlaG is able to cleave phosphodiester linkages in cyclic nucleotides, suggesting that the conservation of the fold and of the key catalytic residues allows for the evolutionary acquisition of substrate specificity for novel but related substrates.",M2
20356952,"Plant <e>Fe</e> status affects the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soil microbes have been demonstrated to play an important role in favouring plant iron (Fe) uptake under Fe-limiting conditions. However, the mechanisms involved are still unclear. This present study reported the effects of plant Fe status on the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere, and their potential function in improving plant Fe nutrition. METHODS: An Fe-efficient plant, red clover (Trifolium pratense 'Kenland') was cultured in a calcareous soil to obtain rhizosphere soils with (Fe-sufficient) or without (Fe-stressed) foliar FeEDTA spraying. The siderophore-producing ability of rhizospheric microbes was measured. The bioavailability of the siderophore-solubilized Fe from iron oxides/hydroxides was tested in hydroponic culture. KEY RESULTS: In rhizosphere soil, the number of microbes that secreted siderophores quickly was more in the Fe-stressed treatment than in the Fe-sufficient one, while the number of microbes that did not secret siderophores was the opposite. A significantly higher concentration of phenolics was detected in the rhizosphere soil of Fe-stressed plants. Moreover, after the soil was incubated with phenolic root exudates, the composition of the siderophore-secreting microbial community was similar with that of the rhizosphere of Fe-stressed plant. Additionally, the siderophores produced by a rhizospheric microbe isolated from the Fe-stressed treatment can well solubilize iron oxides/hydroxides, and the utilization of the siderophore-solubilized Fe by plant was even more efficient than EDTA-Fe. CONCLUSIONS: Iron-deficiency stress of red clover would alter the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere, which is probably due to the phenolics secretion of the root, and may in turn help to improve the solubility of Fe in soils and plant Fe nutrition via elevated microbial siderophore secretion.",M2
20356166,"Polyelectrolyte multilayer-assisted immobilization of zero-valent iron nanoparticles onto polymer nanofibers for potential environmental applications.We report a facile approach to synthesizing and immobilizing zero-valent iron nanoparticles (ZVI NPs) onto polyelectrolyte (PE) multilayer-assembled electrospun polymer nanofibers for potential environmental applications. In this approach, negatively charged cellulose acetate (CA) nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning were assembled with multilayers of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) through electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. The formed PAA/PDADMAC multilayers onto CA nanofibers were then used as a nanoreactor to complex <e>Fe</e>(II) ions through the binding with the free carboxyl groups of PAA for subsequent reductive formation of ZVI NPs. Combined scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry analysis studies demonstrate that the ZVI NPs are successfully synthesized and uniformly distributed into the PE multilayers assembled onto the CA nanofibers. The produced hybrid nanofibrous mats containing ZVI NPs were found to exhibit superior capability to decolorize acid fuchsin, an organic dye in dyeing wastewater. We show that the loading capacity of ZVI NPs can be tuned by changing the number of PE layers and the cycles of binding/reduction process. Increasing the number of the binding/reduction cycles leads to a slight bigger size of the ZVI NPs, which is not beneficial for improving the reactivity of ZVI NPs. The present approach to synthesizing and immobilizing ZVI NPs onto polymer nanofibers opens a new avenue to fabricating various fiber-based composite materials with a high surface area to volume ratio for environmental, catalytic, and sensing applications.",M2
20356136,"Flame synthesis of nanosized Cu-Ce-O, Ni-Ce-O, and <e>Fe</e>-Ce-O catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction.A flame synthesis method has been used to prepare nanosized, high-surface-area Cu-Ce-O, Ni-Ce-O, and Fe-Ce-O catalysts from aqueous solutions of metal acetate precursors. The particles were formed by vaporization of the precursors followed by reaction and then gas to particle conversion. The specific surface areas of the synthesized powders ranged from 127 to 163 m(2)/g. High-resolution transmission electron microscope imaging showed that the particle diameters for the ceria materials are in the range of 3-10 nm, and a thin layer of amorphous material was observed on the surface of the particles. The presence and surface enrichment of the transition-metal oxides (CuO, NiO, and Fe(2)O(3)) on the ceria particles were detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electron energy-loss spectroscopic studies suggest the formation of a core-shell structure in the as-prepared particles. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies suggest that the dopants in all M-Ce-O systems are almost isostructural with their oxide counterparts, indicating the doping materials form separate oxide phases (CuO, Fe(2)O(3), NiO) within the host matrix (CeO(2)). Etching results confirm that most of the transition-metal oxides are present on the surface of CeO(2), easily dissolved by nitric acid. The performance of the flame-synthesized catalysts was examined toward water-gas shift (WGS) activity for fuel processing applications. The WGS activity of metal ceria catalysts decreases in the order Cu-Ce-O &gt; Ni-Ce-O &gt; Fe-Ce-O &gt; CeO(2) with a feed mixture having a hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H(2)/CO) ratio of 1.

20356037,"Inactivation of MS2 coliphage in Fenton and Fenton-like systems: role of transition metals, hydrogen peroxide and sunlight.The inactivation of coliphage MS2 by iron- and copper-catalyzed Fenton systems was studied to assess the importance of this process for virus inactivation in natural systems and during water treatment by advanced oxidation processes. The influence of H(2)O(2) (3-50 microM) and metal (1-10 microM) concentrations, HO(*) production, and sunlight on inactivation was investigated. Inactivation was first order with respect to H(2)O(2), but the dependence on the metal concentration was more complex. In the Cu/H(2)O(2) system, the inactivation rate constant k(obs) increased with added Cu up to 2.5 microM, and then leveled off. This was consistent with Cu saturation of the solution, indicating that only soluble Cu contributed to inactivation. In contrast, inactivation in the <e>Fe</e>/H(2)O(2) system was governed by colloidal iron. Irradiation by sunlight only affected the Fe/H(2)O(2) system, leading to a 5.5-fold increase in k(obs) (up to 3.1 min(-1)). HO(*) production, measured by electron spin resonance, could not account for the observed inactivation in the Fe/H(2)O(2) system. Other oxidants, such as ferryl species, must therefore play a role. Experiments using bulk oxidant scavengers revealed that inactivation occurred by a caged mechanism involving oxidant production by metals located in close proximity to the virus. Overall, our results show that the Fenton/photo-Fenton process may serve as an efficient technology for virus disinfection.",M2
20355802,"Sol-gel-derived iron oxide thin films on silicon: surface properties and interfacial chemistry.Uniform high-quality iron oxide thin films can be formed from the spin coating of iron oxide/hydroxide sol-gels on a silicon substrate. Thermal processing of the films at temperatures of approximately 300 degrees C results in the transformation of films into a ternary layered structure with iron oxide, <e>Fe</e>(2)O(3), at the surface, characterized by Mossbauer spectroscopy, and reduced, metallic iron characterized by depth profiling of the surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as a function of Ar(+) etching. Imaging of the etched surface by scanning electron microscopy reveals two distinct regions at the interface, nanoparticles that are very iron-rich separated by an unstructured region that is somewhat less iron-rich. The results demonstrate a synthetic protocol for the spontaneous formaton of a ternary layered structure from a simple one-step preparation.",M2
20352837,"Direct synthesis of water-dispersible FePt nanoparticles capped with L-cysteine.A direct synthetic route of FePt nanoparticles (NPs) has been developed. Reduction of platinum acethylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) and thermal decomposition of iron carbonyl (<e>Fe</e>(CO)5) in the presence of L-cysteine produced fcc FePt NPs with a mean diameter of 2.9 nm. Capping of the FePt NPs with L-cysteine is accomplished by a thiolate linkage between the amino acid and the NP surfaces, which renders them water-dispersible rather than in organic solvents. SQUID magnetization study demonstrated that the FePt NPs exhibited superparamagnetic behavior at 300 K. For the structural model of the FePt NPs, the Fe K-edge and Pt L(III)-edge XAFS results suggest that most of the Pt atoms are preferentially located in the core region, the Fe atoms are preferentially located in the shell region.",M2
20351428,"Wet hydrogen peroxide catalytic oxidation of phenol with FeAC (iron-embedded activated carbon) catalysts.This investigation aims at exploring the catalytic oxidation activity of iron-embedded activated carbon (FeAC) and the application for the degradation of phenol in the wet hydrogen peroxide catalytic oxidation (WHPCO). FeAC catalysts were prepared by pre-impregnating iron in coconut shell with various iron loadings in the range of 27.5 to 46.5% before they were activated. The FeAC catalysts were characterised by measuring their surface area, pore distribution, functional groups on the surface, and X-ray diffraction patterns. The effects of iron loading strongly inhibited the pore development of the catalyst but benefited the oxidation activity in WHPCO. It was found that the complete conversion of phenol was observed with all FeAC catalysts in oxidation. High level of chemical oxygen demand (COD) abatement can be achieved within the first 30 minutes of oxidation. The iron embedded in the activated carbon showed good performance in the degradation and mineralisation of phenol during the oxidation due to the active sites as iron oxides formed on the surface of the activated carbon. It was found that the embedding irons were presented in gamma-<e>Fe</e>(2)O(3), alpha-Fe(2)O(3), and alpha-FeCOOH forms on the activated carbon. The aging tests on FeAC catalysts showed less activity loss, and less iron leaching was found after four oxidation runs.",M2
20350740,"Hexavalent chromium removal from near natural water by copper-iron bimetallic particles.The reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) by zero-valent iron (ZVI) is self-inhibiting in near natural groundwater because insulating <e>Fe</e>(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxide film forms on the ZVI surface during the reaction. This study tries to overcome this deficiency by coating the surface of ZVI with copper to form copper-iron bimetallic particles. The Cr(VI) removal rate by ZVI rose significantly after the copper coating was applied. The copper loading needed for enhancing Cr(VI) removal was much higher than that needed for enhancing removal of chlorinated organic compounds or other oxidative contaminants, because of the higher oxidation potential of Cr(VI). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate that coating copper onto the surface of ZVI can not only increase the deepness of the oxidation film but also increase the oxidation state of iron in the film. This phenomenon means higher Cr(VI) removal capacity per unit weight of ZVI.",M2
20350328,"A/C magnetic hyperthermia of melanoma mediated by iron(0)/iron oxide core/shell magnetic nanoparticles: a mouse study.BACKGROUND: There is renewed interest in magnetic hyperthermia as a treatment modality for cancer, especially when it is combined with other more traditional therapeutic approaches, such as the co-delivery of anticancer drugs or photodynamic therapy. METHODS: The influence of bimagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) combined with short external alternating magnetic field (AMF) exposure on the growth of subcutaneous mouse melanomas (B16-F10) was evaluated. Bimagnetic <e>Fe</e>/Fe3O4 core/shell nanoparticles were designed for cancer targeting after intratumoral or intravenous administration. Their inorganic center was protected against rapid biocorrosion by organic dopamine-oligoethylene glycol ligands. TCPP (4-tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrin) units were attached to the dopamine-oligoethylene glycol ligands. RESULTS: The magnetic hyperthermia results obtained after intratumoral injection indicated that micromolar concentrations of iron given within the modified core-shell Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles caused a significant anti-tumor effect on murine B16-F10 melanoma with three short 10-minute AMF exposures. We also observed a decrease in tumor size after intravenous administration of the MNPs followed by three consecutive days of AMF exposure 24 hrs after the MNPs injection. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that intratumoral administration of surface modified MNPs can attenuate mouse melanoma after AMF exposure. Moreover, we have found that after intravenous administration of micromolar concentrations, these MNPs are capable of causing an anti-tumor effect in a mouse melanoma model after only a short AMF exposure time. This is a clear improvement to state of the art.",M2
20350000,"Impact of nanoscale zero valent iron on geochemistry and microbial populations in trichloroethylene contaminated aquifer materials.Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles are a promising technology for reducing trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the subsurface. Prior to injecting large quantities of nanoparticles into the groundwater it is important to understand what impact the particles will have on the geochemistry and indigenous microbial communities. Microbial populations are important not only for nutrient cycling, but also for contaminant remediation and heavy metal immobilization. Microcosms were used to determine the effects of NZVI addition on three different aquifer materials from TCE contaminated sites in Alameda Point, CA, Mancelona, MI, and Parris Island, SC. The oxidation and reduction potential of the microcosms consistently decreased by more than 400 mV when NZVI was added at 1.5 g/L concentrations. Sulfate concentrations decreased in the two coastal aquifer materials, and methane was observed in the presence of NZVI in Alameda Point microcosms, but not in the other two materials. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed significant shifts in Eubacterial diversity just after the <e>Fe</e>(0) was exhausted, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed increases of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene (dsrA) and Archaeal 16s rRNA genes, indicating that reducing conditions and hydrogen created by NZVI stimulate both sulfate reducer and methanogen populations. Adding NZVI had no deleterious effect on total bacterial abundance in the microcosms. NZVI with a biodegradable polyaspartate coating increased bacterial populations by an order of magnitude relative to controls. The lack of broad bactericidal effect, combined with the stimulatory effect of polyaspartate coatings, has positive implications for NZVI field applications.",M2
20348591,"Coupling between magnetic and optical properties of stable Au-<e>Fe</e> solid solution nanoparticles.Au-Fe nanoparticles constitute one of the simplest prototypes of a multifunctional nanomaterial that can exhibit both magnetic and optical (plasmonic) properties. This solid solution, not feasible in the bulk phase diagram in thermal equilibrium, can be formed as a nanostructure by out-of-equilibrium processes. Here, the novel magnetic, optical and magneto-optical properties of ion-implanted Au-Fe solid solution nanoparticles dispersed in a SiO(2) matrix are investigated and correlated. The surface plasmon resonance of the Au-Fe nanoparticles with almost equicomposition is strongly damped when compared to pure Au and to Au-rich Au-Fe nanoparticles. In all cases, the Au atoms are magnetically polarized, as measured by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and ferromagnetically coupled with Fe atoms. Although the chemical stability of Au-Fe nanoparticles is larger than that of Fe nanoparticles, both the magnetic moment per Fe atom and the order temperature are smaller. These results suggest that electronic and magnetic properties are more influenced by the hybridization of the electronic bands in the Au-Fe solid solution than by size effects. On the other hand, the magneto-optical transitions allowed in the vis-nIR spectral regions are very similar. In addition, we also observe, after studying the properties of thermally treated samples, that the Au-Fe alloy is stabilized, not by surface effects, but by the combination of the out-of-equilibrium nature of the ion implantation technique and by changes in the properties due to size effects.",M2
20346910,"<e>Fe</e>-heme structure in Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.We have carried out an X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) study of ferric, ferrous, CO- and NO-bound Haemophilus ducreyi Cu,ZnSOD (HdSOD) in solution to investigate the structural modifications induced by the binding of small gaseous ligands to heme in this enzyme. The combined analysis of EXAFS and XANES data has allowed us to characterize the local structure around the Fe-heme with 0.02A accuracy, revealing a heterogeneity in the distances between iron and the two histidine ligands which was not evident in the X-ray crystal structure. In addition, we have shown that the metal oxidation state does not influence the Fe-heme coordination environment, whereas the presence of the CO and NO ligands induces local structural rearrangements in the enzyme which are very similar to those already observed in other hexa-coordinated heme proteins, such as neuroglobin.",M2
20345089,"Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy applied to [<e>Fe</e>(OEP)(NO)]: the vibrational assignments of five-coordinate ferrous heme-nitrosyls and implications for electronic structure.This study presents Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS) data on the five-coordinate (5C) ferrous heme-nitrosyl complex [Fe(OEP)(NO)] (1, OEP(2-) = octaethylporphyrinato dianion) and the corresponding (15)N(18)O labeled complex. The obtained spectra identify two isotope sensitive features at 522 and 388 cm(-1), which shift to 508 and 381 cm(-1), respectively, upon isotope labeling. These features are assigned to the Fe-NO stretch nu(Fe-NO) and the in-plane Fe-N-O bending mode delta(ip)(Fe-N-O), the latter has been unambiguously assigned for the first time for 1. The obtained NRVS data were simulated using our quantum chemistry centered normal coordinate analysis (QCC-NCA). Since complex 1 can potentially exist in 12 different conformations involving the FeNO and peripheral ethyl orientations, extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations and QCC-NCA simulations were performed to determine how these conformations affect the NRVS properties of [Fe(OEP)NO]. These results show that the properties and force constants of the FeNO unit are hardly affected by the conformational changes involving the ethyl substituents. On the other hand, the NRVS-active porphyrin-based vibrations around 340-360, 300-320, and 250-270 cm(-1) are sensitive to the conformational changes. The spectroscopic changes observed in these regions are due to selective mechanical couplings of one component of E(u)-type (in ideal D(4h) symmetry) porphyrin-based vibrations with the in-plane Fe-N-O bending mode. This leads to the observed variations in Fe(OEP) core mode energies and NRVS intensities without affecting the properties of the FeNO unit. The QCC-NCA simulated NRVS spectra of 1 show excellent agreement with experiment, and indicate that conformer F is likely present in the samples of this complex investigated here. The observed porphyrin-based vibrations in the NRVS spectra of 1 are also assigned based on the QCC-NCA results. The obtained force constants of the Fe-NO and N-O bonds are 2.83-2.94 (based on the DFT functional applied) and about 12.15 mdyn/A, respectively. The electronic structures of 5C ferrous heme-nitrosyls in different model complexes are then analyzed, and variations in their properties based on different porphyrin substituents are explained. Finally, the shortcomings of different DFT functionals in describing the axial FeNO subunit in heme-nitrosyls are elucidated.",M2
20340124,"Protein-protein complex formation affects the Ni-<e>Fe</e> and Fe-S centers in the H2-sensing regulatory hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha H16.The regulatory Ni-Fe hydrogenase (RH) from the H(2)-oxidizing bacterium Ralstonia eutropha functions as an oxygen-resistant hydrogen sensor, which is composed of the large, active-site-containing HoxC subunit and the small subunit HoxB carrying Fe-S clusters. In vivo, the HoxBC subunits form a dimer designated as RH(wt). The RH(wt) protein transmits its signals to the histidine protein kinase HoxJ, which itself forms a homotetramer and a stable complex with RH(wt) (RH(wt)-HoxJ(wt)), located in the cytoplasm. In this study, we used X-ray absorption (XAS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the impact of various complexes between RH and HoxJ on the structural and electronic properties of the Ni-Fe active site and the Fe-S clusters. Aside from the RH(wt) protein and the RH(wt)-HoxJ(wt) complex, we investigated the RH(stop) protein, which consists of only one HoxB and HoxC unit due to the missing C-terminus of HoxB, as well as RH(wt)-HoxJ(Deltakinase), in which the histidine protein kinase lacks the transmitter domain. All constructs reacted with H(2), leading to the formation of the EPR-detectable Ni(III)-C state of the active site and to the reduction of Fe-S clusters detectable by XAS, thus corroborating that H(2) cleavage is independent of the presence of the HoxJ protein. In RH(stop), presumably one Fe-S cluster was lost during the preparation procedure. The coordination of the active site Ni in RH(stop) differed from that in RH(wt) and the RH(wt)-HoxJ complexes, in which additional Ni--O bonds were detected by XAS. The Ni--O bonds caused only very minor changes of the EPR g-values of the Ni-C and Ni-L states and of the IR vibrational frequencies of the diatomic CN(-) and CO ligands at the active-site Fe ion. Both one Fe-S cluster in HoxB and an oxygen-rich Ni coordination seem to be stabilized by RH dimerization involving the C-terminus of HoxB and by complex formation with HoxJ.",M2
20334415,"Destruction of polychlorinated aromatic compounds by spinel-type complex oxides.Destruction of polychlorinated aromatic compounds was carried out over spinel-type catalysts XY2O4 (where X = Mg, Ca, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Y = Al, <e>Fe</e>). The catalysts were characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and FTIR. The performance of these catalysts toward the decomposition of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) was evaluated in a closed system. The spinel-type catalyst with mesoporous structure demonstrated high catalytic activity for the hydrodechlorination of polychlorinated aromatic compounds. Among them, the copper-aluminum spinel (CuAl2O4), specifically calcined at 600 degrees C, exhibited the best activity. More than 85% dechlorination efficiency of HCB and 99% decomposition of polychlorinated dibenzodioxin (PCDD) were achieved at 250 degrees C for 30 min over the above catalyst which was more effective than the corresponding metallic copper and copper oxide catalysts during the thermal degradation of polychlorinated aromatic compounds. The correlation of catalytic performance to structural characteristics is discussed based on the detailed characterization. The simple preparation procedure and reasonable cost of the spinel-type catalysts present a good potential for the thermal treatment of polychlorinated aromatic pollutants at lower temperatures.",M2
20334380,"Roles of the distinct electronic structures of the {<e>Fe</e>(NO)(2)}(9) and {Fe(NO)(2)}(10) dinitrosyliron complexes in modulating nitrite binding modes and nitrite activation pathways.Nitrosylation of [PPN](2)[(ONO)(2)Fe(eta(2)-ONO)(2)] [1; PPN = bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium] yields the nitrite-containing {Fe(NO)}(7) mononitrosyliron complex (MNIC) [PPN](2)[(NO)Fe(ONO)(3)(eta(2)-ONO)] (2). At 4 K, complex 2 exhibits an S = (3)/(2) axial EPR spectrum with principal g values of g( perpendicular) = 3.971 and g( parallel) = 2.000, suggestive of the {Fe(III)(NO(-))}(7) electronic structure. Addition of 1 equiv of PPh(3) to complex 2 triggers O-atom transfer of the chelating nitrito ligand under mild conditions to yield the {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) dinitrosyliron complex (DNIC) [PPN][(ONO)(2)Fe(NO)(2)] (3). These results demonstrate that both electronic structure [{Fe(III)(NO(-))}(7), S = (3)/(2)] and redox-active ligands ([RS](-) for [(RS)(3)Fe(NO)](-) and [NO(-)] for complex 2) are required for the transformation of {Fe(NO)}(7) MNICs into {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) DNICs. In comparison with the PPh(3)-triggered O-atom abstraction of the chelating nitrito ligand of the {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) DNIC [(1-MeIm)(2)(eta(2)-ONO)Fe(NO)(2)] (5; 1-MeIm = 1-methylimidazole) to generate the {Fe(NO)(2)}(10) DNIC [(1-MeIm)(PPh(3))Fe(NO)(2)] (6), glacial acetic acid protonation of the N-bound nitro ligand in the {Fe(NO)(2)}(10) DNIC [PPN][(eta(1)-NO(2))(PPh(3))Fe(NO)(2)] (7) produced the {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) DNIC [PPN][(OAc)(2)Fe(NO)(2)] (8), nitric oxide, and H(2)O. These results demonstrate that the distinct electronic structures of {Fe(NO)(2)}(9/10) motifs [{Fe(NO)(2)}(9) vs {Fe(NO)(2)}(10)] play crucial roles in modulating nitrite binding modes (O-bound chelating/monodentate nitrito for {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) DNICs vs N-bound nitro as a pi acceptor for {Fe(NO)(2)}(10) DNICs) and regulating nitrite activation pathways (O-atom abstraction by PPh(3) leading to the intermediate with a nitroxyl-coordinated ligand vs protonation accompanied by dehydration leading to the intermediate with a nitrosonium-coordinated ligand). That is, the redox shuttling between the {Fe(NO)(2)}(9) and {Fe(NO)(2)}(10) DNICs modulates the nitrite binding modes and then triggers nitrite activation to generate nitric oxide.",M2
20334195,"Chemometrics-assisted kinetic-potentiometric methods for simultaneous determination of <e>Fe</e>(II), Al(III), and Zr(IV) using a fluoride ion-selective electrode.Partial least-squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR) were used for the simple, accurate, and simultaneous determination of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV) using the kinetic data from a novel potentiometric method. The complex forming reaction rate of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV) with fluoride ions was monitored by a fluoride ion-selective electrode. The experimental data showed the good ability of ion-selective electrodes as detectors, not only for the direct determination of fluoride ion, but also for simultaneous kinetic-potentiometric analysis using the PLS and PCR methods. The methods are based on the differences observed in the complexation rate of fluoride ions. Results have demonstrated that the simultaneous determination of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV) can be performed in concentration ranges of 0.5-18.5, 0.2-14.0, and 0.4-21.0 microg/mL, respectively. After the application of PLS, the total root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was found to be 0.121, 0.122, and 0.129 for the 10-sample experiment of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV), respectively. For PCR, the RMSEP was found to be 0.156, 0.162, and 0.178 for the 10-sample experiment of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV), respectively. The effects of certain foreign ions upon the reaction rate were determined for assessing the selectivity of the method. The proposed methods (H-point standard addition, PLS, and PCR) were evaluated using a set of synthetic sample mixtures, and applied for the simultaneous determination of Fe(III), Al(III), and Zr(IV) in water samples.",M2
20304584,"Ferritin levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in peripheral arterial disease: a substudy of the Iron (<e>Fe</e>) and Atherosclerosis Study (FeAST) Trial.BACKGROUND: This study delineated correlations between ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in a cohort of 100 cancer-free patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) participating in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study #410, the Iron (Fe) and Atherosclerosis Study (FeAST). FeAST, a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, tested the hypothesis that reduction of iron stores using phlebotomy would influence clinical outcomes in 1227 PAD patients randomized to iron reduction or control groups. The effects of statin administration were also examined in the Sierra Nevada Health Care (SNHC) cohort by measuring serum ferritin levels at entry and during the 6-year study period. No difference was documented between treatment groups in all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Iron reduction in the main study caused a significant age-related improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes, new cancer diagnoses, and cancer-specific death. METHODS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-alpha receptors 1 and 2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at entry and at 6-month intervals for 6 years. Average levels of ferritin and lipids at entry and at the end of the study were compared. The clinical course and ferritin levels of 23 participants who died during the study were reviewed. RESULTS: At entry, mean age of entry was 67 +/- 9 years for the SNHCS cohort, comparable to FeAST and clinical and laboratory parameters were equivalent in substudy participants randomized to iron reduction (n = 51) or control (n = 49). At baseline, 53 participants on statins had slightly lower mean entry-level ferritin values (114.06 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 93.43-134.69) vs the 47 off statins (127.62 ng/mL; 95% CI, 103.21-152.02). Longitudinal analysis of follow-up data, after adjusting for the phlebotomy treatment effect, showed that statin use was associated with significantly lower ferritin levels (-29.78 ng/mL; Cohen effect size, -0.47 [t(df, 134) = 2.33, P = .02]). Mean follow-up average ferritin levels were higher in 23 participants who died (132.5 ng/mL; 95% CI, 79.36-185.66) vs 77 survivors (83.6 ng/mL; 95% CI, 70.34-96.90; Wilcoxon P = .05). Mean follow-up IL-6 levels were higher in dead participants (21.68 ng/mL; 95% CI, 13.71-29.66) vs survivors (12.61 ng/mL; 95% CI, 10.72-14.50; Wilcoxon P = .018). Ferritin levels correlated (Pearson) with average IL-6 levels (r = 0.1845; P = .002) and hsCRP levels (r = .1175; P = .04) during the study. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate statistical correlations between levels of ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in this subset of patients with PAD.",M2
20303568,"Application of zerovalent iron (<e>Fe</e>(0)) to enhance degradation of HCHs and DDX in soil from a former organochlorine pesticides manufacturing plant.Remediation of pesticide-polluted soil is particularly challenging when pesticides in soil are aged and a mixture of pesticides is present. Application of zerovalent iron (Fe(0)) was investigated to accelerate the degradation of HCHs (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDX (DDT, DDE and DDD) in the soil from a former organochlorine pesticide manufacturing plant. Ultrasonic extraction was used extract the organochlorine pesticides from soil. The identification and quantification of organochlorine pesticides in the extracts were accomplished by gas chromatograph. The addition of Fe(0) facilitated the degradation of the beta-HCH isomer, but had little effect on the degradation of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and delta-HCH. Zerovalent iron significantly increased the degradation of p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT in soil, and the percentage degradation of p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT increased with increased Fe(0) concentration during the first period of incubation. However, the amount of p,p'-DDD, the main dechlorinated product of p,p'-DDT, basically kept increased except in the unamended soil. The addition of Fe(0) therefore did not increased the percent degradation of summation SigmaDDT (p,p'-DDT+p,p'-DDD+p,p'-DDE) markedly.",M2
20302851,"Tumor promotion by copper-overloading and its enhancement by excess iron accumulation involving oxidative stress responses in the early stage of a rat two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model.To investigate liver tumor promotion mechanisms of copper (Cu)- and iron (<e>Fe</e>)-overloading, immunolocalization of metal-related biomolecules and lipid peroxidation end products was examined in preneoplastic liver cell foci that expressed glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) in early-stage tumor promotion over 6 weeks in a rat two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model. Gene expression and concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in the liver were also analyzed. Cu-overloading alone exerted a weak promoting activity, which was enhanced by Fe-overloading. By Cu-overloading, GST-P(+) foci that co-expressed transferrin receptors or downregulated ceruloplasmin increased, suggesting preneoplastic lesion-specific enhancement of oxidative cellular stress. Cu-overloading also increased transcripts of antioxidant enzymes (Gstm3 and Gst Yc2 subunit), cell proliferation, and numbers of single liver cells expressing GST-P or heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, suggesting that oxidative stress induces single-cell toxicity, with the ensuing regeneration contributing to tumor promotion. Fe-overloading increased liver TBARS and HO-1-expressing Kupffer cells, the latter suggesting protection against inflammatory stimuli causing fluctuating proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels. By co-overloading of Cu and Fe, Cu-overload-related single liver cell toxicity and regeneration increased, as did cytokine imbalances involving increased cyclooxygenase-2-producing Kupffer cells and accumulation of malondialdehyde within GST-P(+) foci. These results suggest an involvement of oxidative stress responses in Cu-induced tumor promotion and Fe-induced enhancement by increasing cytokine imbalances and GST-P(+) foci-specific lipid peroxidation.",M2
20236681,"Reductive degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A over iron-silver bimetallic nanoparticles under ultrasound radiation.The present study described the degradation behavior of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in <e>Fe</e>-Ag suspension solutions under ultrasonic radiation (US). The Fe-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with core-shell structure were successfully synthesized by reduction and deposition of Ag on nanoscale Fe surface, and were further characterized by BET, XRD, TEM, SEM, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. The results revealed that the displacement plating produced a non-uniform overlayer of Ag additive on iron; the as-synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles were spherical with diameters of 20-100 nm aggregated in the form of chains. Batch studies demonstrated that the TBBPA (2 mg L(-1)) was completely degraded in 20 min over Fe-Ag nanoparticles, which has higher degradation efficiency than Fe(0) nanoparticles under US. The effects of Fe-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles loading, initial TBBPA concentration, pH of the solution, Ag loading and temperature on the reduction efficiency of TBBPA under US were investigated. The complete reduction of TBBPA in 20 min was determined selectively under the conditions of pH (pH=6.0+/-0.5), Ag loading(1 wt.%) at 30 degrees C over the fabricated Fe-Ag nanoparticles. Additionally, the major intermediates identified by LC-MS technique were tri-BBPA, di-BBPA, mono-BBPA and BPA and the degradation mechanism was also proposed.",M2
20232345,"Iron in neuronal function and dysfunction.Iron (<e>Fe</e>) is an essential element for many metabolic processes, serving as a cofactor for heme and nonheme proteins. Cellular iron deficiency arrests cell growth and leads to cell death; however, like most transition metals, an excess of intracellular iron is toxic. The ability of Fe to accept and donate electrons can lead to the formation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, and oxidative damage to tissue components; contributing to disease and, perhaps, aging itself. It has also been suggested that iron-induced oxidative stress can play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Iron progressively accumulates in the brain both during normal aging and neurodegenerative processes. However, iron accumulation occurs without the concomitant increase in tissue ferritin, which could increase the risk of oxidative stress. Moreover, high iron concentrations in the brain have been consistently observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In this regard, metalloneurobiology has become extremely important in understanding the role of iron in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons have developed several protective mechanisms against oxidative stress, among them the activation of cellular signaling pathways. The final response will depend on the identity, intensity, and persistence of the oxidative insult. The characterization of the mechanisms involved in high iron induced in neuronal dysfunction and death is central to understanding the pathology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders.",M2
20230820,"Iron, the retina and the lens: a focused review.This review is focused on iron metabolism in the retina and in the lens and its relation to their respective age-related pathologies, macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract (ARC). Several aspects of iron homeostasis are considered first in the retina and second in the lens, paying particular attention to the transport of iron through the blood-retinal barrier and through the lens epithelial cell barrier, to the immunochemistry of iron-related proteins and their expression in both the retina and the lens, and to the nature of the photochemical damage caused by UV light on both tissues. A comparative overview of some iron related parameters (total iron, transferrin (Tf), transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity), in plasma and ocular tissues and fluids of three animal species is also presented. Based on results selected from the literature reviewed, and our own results, a scheme for the overall circulation of iron within and out of the eye is proposed, in which, (i) iron is pumped from the retina to the vitreous body by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process at the endfeet of M√ºller cells, (ii) vitreal Tf binds this iron and the complex diffuses towards the lens, (iii) the iron/Tf complex is incorporated into the lens extracellular space probably at the lens equator and moves to the epithelial-fiber interface, (iv) upon interaction with Tf receptors of the apical pole of lens epithelial cells, the iron/Tf complex is endocytosed and iron is exported as <e>Fe</e>(3+) by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process taking place at the basal pole of the epithelial cells, and (v) Fe(3+) is bound to aqueous humor Tf and drained with the aqueous humor into systemic blood circulation for recycling. The proposed scheme represents an example of close cooperation between the retina and the lens to maintain a constant flow of iron within the eye that provides an adequate supply of iron to ocular tissues and secures the systemic recycling of this element. It does not discount the existence of additional ways for iron to leave the eye through the blood-retinal barrier. In this review both AMD and ARC are recognized as multifactorial diseases with an important photoxidative component, and exhibiting a remarkable similitude of altered local iron metabolism. The epidemiological relationship between ARC and ferropenic anemia is explained on the basis that hepcidin, the hormone responsible for the anemia of chronic inflammation, could paradoxically cause intracellular iron overload in the lens by interfering with the proposed ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated export of iron at the basal side of the anterior lens epithelium. Other authors have suggested that a similar situation is created in the retina in the case of AMD.",M2
20230048,"Crystallographic and single-crystal spectral analysis of the peroxidase ferryl intermediate.The ferryl [<e>Fe</e>(IV)O] intermediate is important in many heme enzymes, and thus, the precise nature of the Fe(IV)-O bond is critical in understanding enzymatic mechanisms. The 1.40 A crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase Compound I has been determined as a function of X-ray dose while the visible spectrum was being monitored. The Fe-O bond increases in length from 1.73 A in the low-X-ray dose structure to 1.90 A in the high-dose structure. The low-dose structure correlates well with an Fe(IV) horizontal lineO bond, while we postulate that the high-dose structure is the cryo-trapped Fe(III)-OH species previously thought to be an Fe(IV)-OH species.",M2
20229093,"Functional characterization of iron-substituted neural zinc finger factor 1: metal and DNA binding.Neural zinc finger factor 1 (NZF-1) is a nonclassical zinc finger protein involved in neuronal development. NZF-1 contains multiple copies of a unique CCHHC zinc-binding domain that recognize a promoter element in the beta-retinoic acid receptor gene termed beta-retinoic acid receptor element (beta-RARE). Previous studies have established that a two-domain fragment of NZF-1 bound with zinc is sufficient for specific DNA binding. Proper functioning of the nervous system relies heavily on iron and misregulation of this highly redox active metal has serious consequences. Several classes of zinc finger proteins have been shown to bind other metal ions, including iron. To determine if ferrous iron can coordinate to the metal-binding sites of NZF-1 and assess the functional consequences of such coordination, a fragment of NZF-1 that contains two zinc-binding domains, NZF-1 double finger (NZF-1-DF), was prepared. UV-vis spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that <e>Fe</e>(II) is capable of binding to NZF-1-DF. Upon reconstitution with either Fe(II) or Zn(II), NZF-1-DF binds selectively and tightly (nanomolar affinity) to its target beta-RARE DNA sequence, whereas apo-NZF-1-DF does not bind to DNA and instead aggregates.",M2
20226929,"Sensitively electrochemical detection of the DNA damage in situ by electro-Fenton reaction based on <e>Fe</e>@Fe2O3 core-shell nanonecklace and multi-walled carbon nanotube composite.An electrochemical biosensor for mimicking the metal-mediated DNA damage pathway in situ was presented. The Fenton reagents (H(2)O(2) and iron ion) for the DNA damage were generated in situ with a constant rate from the sensing film. H(2)O(2) and iron ion reacted further together to yield hydroxyl radical, which attacked DNA in the film. These courses of DNA damage were just like those happened in organism. The DNA damage was detected by monitoring the differential pulse voltammetric response of an electrochemical indicator, Co(phen)(3)(3+). Another electrochemical indicator, Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+), was also used for monitoring the DNA damage as a complementary means and the minimal detectable amount of DNA damage was 0.16 microg. The biosensor had good reproducibility. After this biosensor was used for 11 times, 90% of the first detection signal was obtained.",M2
20226494,"Abiotic transformation of high explosives by freshly precipitated iron minerals in aqueous FeII solutions.Zerovalent iron barriers have become a viable treatment for field-scale cleanup of various ground water contaminants. While contact with the iron surface is important for contaminant destruction, the interstitial pore water within and near the iron barrier will be laden with aqueous, adsorbed and precipitated <e>Fe</e>(II) phases. These freshly precipitated iron minerals could play an important role in transforming high explosives (HE). Our objective was to determine the transformation of RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), and TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) by freshly precipitated iron Fe(II)/Fe(III) minerals. This was accomplished by quantifying the effects of initial Fe(II) concentration, pH, and the presence of aquifer solids (Fe(III) phases) on HE transformation rates. Results showed that at pH 8.2, freshly precipitated iron minerals transformed RDX, HMX, and TNT with reaction rates increasing with increasing Fe(II) concentrations. RDX and HMX transformations in these solutions also increased with increasing pH (5.8-8.55). By contrast, TNT transformation was not influenced by pH (6.85-8.55) except at pH values &lt;6.35. Transformations observed via LC/MS included a variety of nitroso products (RDX, HMX) and amino degradation products (TNT). XRD analysis identified green rust and magnetite as the dominant iron solid phases that precipitated from the aqueous Fe(II) during HE treatment under anaerobic conditions. Geochemical modeling also predicted Fe(II) activity would likely be controlled by green rust and magnetite. These results illustrate the important role freshly precipitated Fe(II)/Fe(III) minerals in aqueous Fe(II) solutions play in the transformation of high explosives.",M2
20225400,"The manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins: what is what, where are they, and what can the sequences tell us?The manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins make up a recently discovered group of proteins that contain a heterodinuclear Mn/<e>Fe</e> redox cofactor. The chemical potential of the heterodinuclear metal site is just starting to be characterized, but available data suggest that it may have capabilities for similarly versatile chemistry as the extensively studied diiron-carboxylate cofactor. The presently identified members of the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are all sequence homologues of the radical-generating R2 subunit of class I ribonucleotide reductase, canonically a diiron protein. They are also commonly misannotated as such in databases. In spite of the sequence similarity, the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins form at least two functionally distinct groups, radical-generating ribonucleotide reductase subunits and ligand-binding Mn/Fe proteins. Here, the presently available sequences for the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are gathered, grouped, and analyzed. The analysis provides sequence determinants that allow group identification of new sequences on the single-protein level. Key differences between the groups are mapped on the known representative structures, providing clues to the structural prerequisites for metal specificity, cofactor formation, and difference in function. The organisms that encode manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are briefly discussed; their environmental preference suggests that the Mn/Fe heterodinuclear cofactor is preferred by extremophiles and pathogens with a particularly high relative presence in Archaea.",M2
20222672,"High-yield UV-photochemical vapor generation of iron for sample introduction with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.A novel approach to the generation of volatile iron compounds (likely the pentacarbonyl) with high efficiency is described, wherein solutions containing either <e>Fe</e>(2+) or Fe(3+) and low molecular weight organic acids such as formic, acetic or propionic are exposed to a UV source. An optimum generation efficiency of 60 +/- 2% was achieved in 50% formic acid at pH 2.5 with an irradiation time of 250 s by use of a 17 W low-pressure mercury grid lamp. Compared to conventional solution nebulization, sensitivity and limit of detection were improved 80- and 100-fold, respectively, at the 238.204 nm Fe II emission line. A precision of 0.75% RSD was achieved at a concentration of 100 ng/mL. Photochemical vapor generation sample introduction was used for the determination of trace iron in several environmental Certified Reference Materials, including National Research Council Canada DORM-3 fish muscle tissue, DOLT-3 and DOLT-4 fish liver tissues, and SLRS-5 river water, providing analytical results in excellent agreement with certified values based on a simple external calibration.",M2
20221544,"Mechanism of electrocatalytic hydrogen production by a di-iron model of iron-iron hydrogenase: a density functional theory study of proton dissociation constants and electrode reduction potentials.Simple dinuclear iron dithiolates such as (mu-SCH2CH2CH2S)[<e>Fe</e>(CO)3]2, (1) and (mu-SCH2CH2S)[Fe(CO)3]2 (2) are functional models for diiron-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-H2ases, that catalyze the reduction of protons to H2. The mechanism of H2 production with 2 as the catalyst and with both toluenesulfonic (HOTs) and acetic (HOAc) acids as the H+ source in CH3CN solvent has been examined by density functional theory (DFT). Proton dissociation constants (pKa) and electrode reduction potentials (E(o)) are directly computed and compared to the measured pKa of HOTs and HOAc acids and the experimental reduction potentials. Computations show that when the strong acid, HOTs, is used as a proton source the one-electron reduced species 2- can be protonated to form a bridging hydride complex as the most stable structure. Then, this species can be reduced and protonated to form dihydrogen and regenerate 2. This cycle produces H2 via an ECEC process at an applied potential of -1.8 V vs. Fc/Fc+. A second faster process opens for this system when the species produced at the ECEC step above is further reduced and H2 release returns the system to 2- rather than 2, an E[CECE] process. On the other hand, when the weak acid, HOAc, is the proton source a more negative applied reduction potential (-2.2 V vs. Fc/Fc+) is necessary. At this potential two one-electron reductions yield the dianion 2(2-) before the first protonation, which in this case occurs on the thiolate. Subsequent reduction and protonation form dihydrogen and regenerate 2- through an E[ECEC] process.",M2
20221540,"The iron-site structure of [<e>Fe</e>]-hydrogenase and model systems: an X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy study.The [Fe]-hydrogenase is an ideal system for studying the electronic properties of the low spin iron site that is common to the catalytic centres of all hydrogenases. Because they have no auxiliary iron-sulfur clusters and possess a cofactor containing a single iron centre, the [Fe]-hydrogenases are well suited for spectroscopic analysis of those factors required for the activation of molecular hydrogen. Specifically, in this study we shed light on the electronic and molecular structure of the iron centre by XAS analysis of [Fe]-hydrogenase from Methanocaldococcus jannashii and five model complexes (Fe(ethanedithiolate)(CO)(2)(PMe(3))(2), [K(18-crown-6)](2)[Fe(CN)(2)(CO)(3)], K[Fe(CN)(CO)(4)], K(3)[Fe(III)(CN)(6)], K(4)[Fe(II)(CN)(6)]). The different electron donors have a strong influence on the iron absorption K-edge energy position, which is frequently used to determine the metal oxidation state. Our results demonstrate that the K-edges of Fe(II) complexes, achieved with low-spin ferrous thiolates, are consistent with a ferrous centre in the [Fe]-hydrogenase from Methanocaldococcus jannashii. The metal geometry also strongly influences the XANES and thus the electronic structure. Using in silico simulation, we were able to reproduce the main features of the XANES spectra and describe the effects of individual donor contributions on the spectra. Thereby, we reveal the essential role of an unusual carbon donor coming from an acyl group of the cofactor in the determination of the electronic structure required for the activity of the enzyme.",M2
20221534,"Isomerization of the hydride complexes [HFe2(SR)2(PR3)(x)(CO)(6-x)]+ (x = 2, 3, 4) relevant to the active site models for the [FeFe]-hydrogenases.The stepwise formation of bridging (mu-) hydrides of diiron dithiolates is discussed with attention on the pathway for protonation and subsequent isomerizations. Our evidence is consistent with protonations occurring at a single <e>Fe</e> center, followed by isomerization to a series of mu-hydrides. Protonation of Fe(2)(edt)(CO)(4)(dppv) (1) gave a single mu-hydride with dppv spanning apical and basal sites, which isomerized at higher temperatures to place the dppv into a dibasal position. Protonation of Fe(2)(pdt)(CO)(4)(dppv) (2) followed an isomerization pathway similar to that for [1H](+), except that a pair of isomeric terminal hydrides were observed initially, resulting from protonation at the Fe(CO)(3) or Fe(CO)(dppv) site. The first observable product from low temperature protonation of the tris-phosphine Fe(2)(edt)(CO)(3)(PMe(3))(dppv) (3) was a single mu-hydride wherein PMe(3) is apical and the dppv ligand spans apical and basal sites. Upon warming, this isomer converted fully but in a stepwise manner to a mixture of three other isomeric hydrides. Protonation of Fe(2)(pdt)(CO)(3)(PMe(3))(dppv) (4) proceeded similarly to the edt analogue 3, however a terminal hydride was observed, albeit only briefly and at very low temperatures (-90 degrees C). Low-temperature protonation of the bis-chelates Fe(2)(xdt)(CO)(2)(dppv)(2) produced exclusively the terminal hydrides [HFe(2)(xdt)(mu-CO)(CO)(dppv)(2)](+) (xdt = edt and pdt), which subsequently isomerized to a pair of mu-hydrides. At room temperature these (dppv)(2) derivatives convert to an equilibrium of two isomers, one C(2)-symmetric and the other C(s)-symmetric. The stability of the terminal hydrides correlates with the (C(2)-isomer)/(C(s)-isomer) equilibrium ratio, which reflects the size of the dithiolate. The isomerization was found to be unaffected by the presence of excess acid, by solvent polarity, and the presence of D(2)O. This isomerization mechanism is proposed to be intramolecular, involving a 120 degrees rotation of the HFeL(3) subunit to an unobserved terminal basal hydride as the rate-determining step. The observed stability of the hydrides was supported by DFT calculations, which also highlight the instability of the basal terminal hydrides. Isomerization of the mu-hydride isomers occurs on alternating FeL(3) via 120 degree rotations without generating D(2)O-exchangeable intermediates.",M2
20220129,"Potassium-activated GTPase reaction in the G Protein-coupled ferrous iron transporter B.FeoB is a prokaryotic membrane protein responsible for the import of ferrous iron (<e>Fe</e>(2+)). A defining feature of FeoB is that it includes an N-terminal 30-kDa soluble domain with GTPase activity, which is required for iron transport. However, the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of this domain appears to be too slow for FeoB either to function as a channel or to possess an active Fe(2+) membrane transport mechanism. Here, we present crystal structures of the soluble domain of FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus in complex with GDP and with the GTP analogue derivative 2'-(or -3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (mant-GMPPNP). Unlike recent structures of the G protein domain, the mant-GMPPNP-bound structure shows clearly resolved, active conformations of the critical Switch motifs. Importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrate that the GTPase activity of FeoB is activated by K(+), which leads to a 20-fold acceleration in its hydrolysis rate. Analysis of the structure identified a conserved asparagine residue likely to be involved in K(+) coordination, and mutation of this residue abolished K(+)-dependent activation. We suggest that this, together with a second asparagine residue that we show is critical for the structure of the Switch I loop, allows the prediction of K(+)-dependent activation in G proteins. In addition, the accelerated hydrolysis rate opens up the possibility that FeoB might indeed function as an active transporter.",M2
20218714,"Cryoreduction of the NO-adduct of taurine:alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD) yields an elusive {FeNO}(8) species.The <e>Fe</e>(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG)-dependent enzymes are a functionally and mechanistically diverse group of mononuclear nonheme-iron enzymes that activate dioxygen to couple the decarboxylation of alphaKG, which yields succinate and CO(2), to the oxidation of an aliphatic C-H bond of their substrates. Their mechanisms have been studied in detail by a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational methods. Two reaction intermediates have been trapped and characterized for several members of this enzyme family. The first intermediate is the C-H-cleaving Fe(IV)-oxo complex, which exhibits a large deuterium kinetic isotope effect on its decay. The second intermediate is a Fe(II):product complex. Reaction intermediates proposed to occur before the Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate do not accumulate and therefore cannot be characterized experimentally. One of these intermediates is the initial O(2) adduct, which is a {FeO(2)}(8) species in the notation introduced by Enemark and Feltham. Here, we report spectroscopic and computational studies on the stable NO-adduct of taurine:alphaKG dioxygenase (TauD), termed TauD-{FeNO}(7), and its one-electron reduced form, TauD-{FeNO}(8). The latter is isoelectronic with the proposed O(2) adduct and was generated by low-temperature gamma-irradiation of TauD-{FeNO}(7). To our knowledge, TauD-{FeNO}(8) is the first paramagnetic {FeNO}(8) complex. The detailed analysis of experimental and computational results shows that TauD-{FeNO}(8) has a triplet ground state. This has mechanistic implications that are discussed in this Article. Annealing of the triplet {FeNO}(8) species presumably leads to an equally elusive {FeHNO}(8) complex with a quintet ground state.",M2

20213118,"Transport of iron chelators and chelates across MDCK cell monolayers: implications for iron excretion during chelation therapy.Iron chelators are effective at removing iron from the body in iron overload, but little is known about the handling of iron chelates by the kidney. We studied the transport of deferoxamine, deferasirox, and three hydroxypyridones, and their iron chelates, in polarized renal epithelial MDCK cells growing on Transwell inserts. Directional iron efflux was also studied in (59)<e>Fe</e>-loaded cells. The chelators were transported at comparable rates in the apical and basolateral directions and moved faster than their corresponding chelates, except for deferoxamine, which did not move from the basolateral to the apical side. In contrast, the chelates were transported faster in the apical-to-basolateral direction. More permeable chelators were more efficient at removing iron from iron-loaded cells compared with deferoxamine. Iron is preferentially removed from the basolateral side, and kinetic modeling suggests facilitated diffusion of chelates in some cases. Basolateral iron efflux is temperature-dependent and partially sensitive to ATP depletion. Polarized transport of chelates suggests the kidney may be involved in reabsorption of iron bound to chelators, with a temperature-sensitive facilitated removal of some iron complexes from the basolateral side. Further studies are warranted to determine if these processes may contribute to the observed nephrotoxicity of some iron chelators.",M2
20211525,"Long-term evaluation of lethal and sublethal toxicity of industrial effluents using Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa.Acute toxicity and feeding rate inhibition of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant and its adjacent stream water on Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa were comparatively studied. The acute toxicity of the final effluent (<e>FE</e>) fluctuated greatly over the sampling period from January to August 2009. Toxicity identification results of the FE in July 2009 showed that Cu originating from the Fenton's reagent was likely a key toxicant. In addition, the feeding rate of both species was still inhibited by the FEs in which acute toxicity was not observed. These findings indicate that the feeding response would be a useful tool for monitoring sublethal effects of industrial effluents. For the acute toxicity test, M. macrocopa was more sensitive than D. magna, but the opposite result was true in the case of the feeding rate inhibition. These suggest that different species have different sensitivities to toxic chemicals and to the test methods.",M2

By using X-ray crystallography, M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy, and Fe and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) it is convincingly shown that, in contrast to our previous studies on [Fe(cyclam)(mnt)](1+) (cyclam=1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane), the oxidation of 1-4 is metal-centered yielding the genuine Fe(IV) complexes 1(ox)-4(ox). For the latter complexes, a spin ground state of S=1 has been established by magnetic susceptibility measurements, which indicates a low-spin d(4) configuration. DFT calculations at the B3LYP level support this electronic structure and exclude the presence of a ligand pi radical coordinated to an intermediate-spin ferric ion. M√∂ssbauer parameters and XAS spectra have been calculated to calibrate our computational results against the experiment. Finally, a simple ligand-field approach is presented to correlate the structural features obtained from X-ray crystallography (100 K) with the spectroscopic data.",M2

Characterization of the surface modification was performed on the basis of Fourier transform infrared spectra. The separation/preconcentration conditions of the analyte were investigated, including the pH value, the shaking time, the sample fl ow rate and volume, the elution condition and the interfering ions. At pH 4, the new adsorbent had relatively high capacity and enrichment factor compared to other methods reported so far. The adsorbed Fe(III) was quantitatively eluted by 2 mL of 0.5 mol L(-1) HCl. Common coexisting ions did not interfere with the separation. The detection limit of the method was 0.19 microg L(-1). The relative standard deviation was 3.4% (n=8) which indicated that the method had good precision for the analysis of trace Fe(III) in solution samples. The method was validated using two certified reference materials and has been applied for the determination of trace Fe(III) in biological and natural water samples with satisfactory results.",M2
20201571,"Improvement of (31)P NMR spectral resolution by 8-hydroxyquinoline precipitation of paramagnetic <e>Fe</e> and Mn in environmental samples.Solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is currently the main method for the characterization of phosphorus (P) forms in environment samples. However, identification and quantification of P compounds may be hampered by poor resolution of spectra caused by paramagnetic Fe and Mn. In this study, a novel technique was developed to improve spectral resolution by removing paramagnetic Fe and Mn from alkaline extracts via 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HOQ) precipitation. Batch experiments showed that both Fe and Mn were effectively removed by the precipitation at pH 9.0, with the removal efficiencies of 83-91% for Fe and 67-78% for Mn from the extracts of five different environmental samples, while little effect was found on concentration of total P. The (31)P NMR analysis of a model P solution showed that addition of 8-HOQ and its precipitation with metal ions did not alter P forms. Further analyses of the five extracts with (31)P NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the 8-HOQ precipitation was an ideal method compared with the present postextraction techniques, such as bicarbonate dithionate (BD), EDTA and Chelex-100 treatments, by improving spectral resolution to a large extent with no detrimental effects on P forms.",M2

The new hexadentate ligand is capable of forming six coordinate complexes with rhenium(V), iron(III) and cobalt(III). In the case of the iron(III) and cobalt(III) complexes the ligand doubly deprotonates to give the monocations [<e>Fe</e>(III)(H(2)L)](+) and [Co(III)(H(2)L)](+) in which the metal ion is in a distorted octahedral environment. In the rhenium(V) complex the ligand loses four protons by deprotonation of both secondary amine nitrogen atoms to give [Re(V)(L)](+) with the metal ion in a distorted trigonal prismatic coordination environment. [Re(V)(L)](+) represents a rare example of a rhenium(V) complex that does not contain one of the ReO(3+), ReN(2+) or Re(NPh)(2+) cores. The new ligand and metal complexes have been characterised by a combination of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and microanalysis. The electrochemistry of [Fe(III)(H(2)L)](+), [Co(III)(H(2)L)](+) and [Re(V)(L)](+) has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry with each complex undergoing a single electron reduction event. It is possible to prepare the rhenium(V) complex from ReOCl(3)(PPh(3))(2) or directly from [ReO(4)](-) with the addition of a reductant, which suggests the new ligand may be of interest in the development of rhenium radiopharmaceuticals.",M2
20199219,"Exposure to 56Fe-particle radiation accelerates electrophysiological alterations in the hippocampus of APP23 transgenic mice.Abstract An unavoidable complication of space travel is exposure to high-charge, high-energy (HZE) particles. In animal studies, exposure of the CNS to HZE-particle radiation leads to neurological alterations similar to those seen in aging or Alzheimer's disease. In this study we examined whether HZE-particle radiation accelerated the age-related neuronal dysfunction that was previously described in transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP). These APP23 transgenic mice exhibit age-related behavioral abnormalities and deficits in synaptic transmission. We exposed 7-week-old APP23 transgenic males to brain-only (56)<e>Fe</e>-particle radiation (600 MeV/nucleon; 1, 2, 4 Gy) and recorded synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices at 2, 6, 9, 14 and 18-24 months. We stimulated Schaeffer collaterals and recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spikes (PS) in CA1 neurons. Radiation accelerated the onset of age-related fEPSP decrements recorded at the PS threshold from 14 months of age to 9 months and reduced synaptic efficacy. At 9 months, radiation also reduced PS amplitudes. At 6 months, we observed a temporary deficit in paired-pulse inhibition of the PS at 2 Gy. Radiation did not significantly affect survival of APP23 transgenic mice. We conclude that irradiation of the brain with HZE particles accelerates Alzheimer's disease-related neurological deficits.",M2
20199026,"Catalytic N-N coupling of aryl azides to yield azoarenes via trigonal bipyramid iron-nitrene intermediates.The reactivity of the trigonal bipyramidal iron(I) complex [SiP(iPr)(3)]<e>Fe</e>(N(2)) ([SiP(iPr)(3)] = (2-iPr(2)PC(6)H(4))(3)Si(-)) toward organoazides has been examined. 1-Adamantylazide was found to coordinate the iron center to form stable [SiP(iPr)(3)]Fe(eta(1)-N(3)Ad). Aryl azides instead afforded unstable [SiP(iPr)(3)]Fe(N(3)Ar) species that decayed gradually to regenerate [SiP(iPr)(3)]Fe(N(2)) with release of azoarenes (ArN horizontal lineNAr). The conversion of aryl azides to azoarenes can thus be achieved catalytically. Competitive trapping experiments strongly suggest the intermediacy of reactive nitrene complexes of the type [SiP(iPr)(3)]Fe(NAr) that couple bimolecularly in the N-N bond forming step. Evidence for one such intermediate was provided by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy via photolysis of [SiP(iPr)(3)]Fe(N(3)Ar) in a frozen glass. The electronic structures of these putative nitrene intermediates have been examined by DFT methods.",M2
20206007,"Determination of ferrous and ferric iron in aqueous biological solutions.A solvent extraction method was employed to determine ferrous and ferric iron in aqueous samples. <e>Fe</e>(3+) is selectively extracted into the organic phase (n-heptane) using HDEHP (bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate) and is then stripped using a strong acid. After separation, both oxidation states and the total iron content were determined directly by ICP-MS analysis. This extraction method was refined to allow determination of both iron oxidation states in the presence of strong complexing ligands, such as citrate, NTA and EDTA. The accuracy of the method was verified by crosschecking using a refinement of the ferrozine assay. Presented results demonstrate the ability of the extraction method to work in a microbiological system in the presence of strong chelating agents following the bioreduction of Fe(3+) by the Shewanella alga BrY. Based on the results we report, a robust approach was defined to separately analyze Fe(3+) and Fe(2+) under a wide range of potential scenarios in subsurface environments where radionuclide/metal contamination may coexist with strongly complexing organic contaminants.",M2
20205456,"Aquatic photochemistry of fluoroquinolone antibiotics: kinetics, pathways, and multivariate effects of main water constituents.The ubiquity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) in surface waters urges insights into their fate in the aqueous euphotic zone. In this study, eight FQs (ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, levofloxacin, sarafloxacin, difloxacin, enrofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and balofloxacin) were exposed to simulated sunlight, and their photodegradation was observed to follow apparent first-order kinetics. Based on the determined photolytic quantum yields, solar photodegradation half-lives for the FQs in pure water and at 45 degrees N latitude were calculated to range from 1.25 min for enrofloxacin to 58.0 min for balofloxacin, suggesting that FQs would intrinsically photodegrade fast in sunlit surface waters. However, we found freshwater and seawater constituents inhibited their photodegradation. The inhibition was further explored by a central composite design using sarafloxacin and gatifloxacin as representatives. Humic acids (HA), <e>Fe</e>(III), NO(3)(-), and HA-Cl(-) interaction inhibited the photodegradation, as they mainly acted as radiation filters and/or scavengers for reactive oxygen species. The photodegradation product identification and ROS scavenging experiments indicated that the FQs underwent both direct photolysis and self-sensitized photo-oxidation via *OH and (1)O(2). Piperazinyl N(4)-dealkylation was primary for N(4)-alkylated FQs, whereas decarboxylation and defluorination were comparatively important for the other FQs. These results are of importance toward the goal of assessing the persistence of FQs in surface waters.",M2
