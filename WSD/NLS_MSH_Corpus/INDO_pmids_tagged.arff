19238702,"Geological history and oceanography of the <e>Indo</e>-Malay Archipelago shape the genetic population structure in the false clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris).Like many fishes on coral reefs, the false clown anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, has a life history with two different phases: adults are strongly site attached, whereas larvae are planktonic. Therefore, the larvae have the potential to disperse, but the degree of dispersal potential depends primarily on the period of the larval stage, which is only 8-12 days in A. ocellaris. In this study, we investigated the genetic population structure and gene flow in A. ocellaris across the Indo-Malay Archipelago by analysing a fragment of the mitochondrial control region. Population genetic analysis, using AMOVA, revealed a significant and high overall phi(ST)-value of 0.241 (P &lt; 0.001), clearly showing limited gene flow. Haplotype network analysis detected eight distinct clades corresponding mainly to different geographical areas, which were most probably separated during sea level low stands in the Pleistocene. The distribution of the clades among the different populations indicated slow partial re-mixing mainly in the central region of the archipelago. Major surface currents seem to facilitate larval dispersal, indicated by higher connectivity along major surface currents in the region (e.g. Indonesian Throughflow). Four main groups were found by the hierarchical AMOVA within the archipelago. These different genetic lineages should be managed and protected as separate ornamental fishery stocks and resource contributing to the genetic diversity of the area. Regarding the high diversity and the differentiation among areas within the Indo-Malay Archipelago of A. ocellaris populations, the centre-of-origin theory is supported to be the main mechanism by which the high biodiversity evolved in this area.",M1
19216767,"The extent of population genetic subdivision differs among four co-distributed shark species in the <e>Indo</e>-Australian archipelago.BACKGROUND: The territorial fishing zones of Australia and Indonesia are contiguous to the north of Australia in the Timor and Arafura Seas and in the Indian Ocean to the north of Christmas Island. The area surrounding the shared boundary consists of a variety of bio-diverse marine habitats including shallow continental shelf waters, oceanic trenches and numerous offshore islands. Both countries exploit a variety of fisheries species, including whaler (Carcharhinus spp.) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.). Despite their differences in social and financial arrangements, the two countries are motivated to develop complementary co-management practices to achieve resource sustainability. An essential starting point is knowledge of the degree of population subdivision, and hence fisheries stock status, in exploited species. RESULTS: Populations of four commercially harvested shark species (Carcharhinus obscurus, Carcharhinus sorrah, Prionace glauca, Sphyrna lewini) were sampled from northern Australia and central Indonesia. Neutral genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region sequence and allelic variation at co-dominant microsatellite loci) revealed genetic subdivision between Australian and Indonesian populations of C. sorrah. Further research is needed to address the possibility of genetic subdivision among C. obscurus populations. There was no evidence of genetic subdivision for P. glauca and S. lewini populations, but the sampling represented a relatively small part of their distributional range. For these species, more detailed analyses of population genetic structure is recommended in the future. CONCLUSION: Cooperative management between Australia and Indonesia is the best option at present for P. glauca and S. lewini, while C. sorrah and C. obscurus should be managed independently. On-going research on these and other exploited shark and ray species is strongly recommended. Biological and ecological similarity between species may not be a predictor of population genetic structure, so species-specific studies are recommended to provide new data to assist with sustainable fisheries management.",M1
18850081,"Seasonality of spawning by tropical anguillid eels around Sulawesi Island, Indonesia.Remarkably little is known about the life histories of the many tropical anguillid eels distributed across the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific region, and since the Danish expedition to study eels in the region in 1928 and 1929, research on these eels has only begun again in recent years. Sampling for anguillid leptocephali in the Indonesian Seas has been carried out recently to learn about the spawning ecology and larval distributions of tropical eels there. The leptocephali of Anguilla marmorata, Anguilla bicolor pacifica, Anguilla borneensis, Anguilla interioris, and Anguilla celebesensis were collected around Sulawesi Island both in May 2001 and October of 2002. The development of genetic identification techniques has enabled these leptocephali to be identified to species, and their distributions and sizes during different seasons indicated that there are differing life history patterns among sympatric species in the region. A. celebesensis was found to have been spawning in Tomini Bay of northeastern Sulawesi Island in March and April 2001, but apparently, no spawning had occurred in the late summer and fall of 2002. Studies on anguillid glass eels have suggested that tropical anguillids may spawn throughout much of year, but our research on leptocephali in Tomini Bay and data on the downstream migration of tropical anguillids in the major tributary to Tomini Bay indicate that A. celebesensis may have a distinct seasonal pattern of spawning possibly related to the regional monsoon cycles. This is the first evidence of seasonality of spawning in tropical anguillid eels whose life histories are only just beginning to be revealed.",M1
18559177,"Activity evaluation of cocoa pod borer sex pheromone in cacao fields.The previously identified female sex pheromone of cocoa pod borer, Conopomorpha cramerella, was re-evaluated for its attractive activity in different field conditions. It was found that lures containing 100-mug of synthetic sex pheromone blend, (E,Z,Z)- and (E,E,Z)-4,6,10-hexadecatrienyl acetates, and the corresponding alcohols in a ratio of 40:60:4:6 in a polyethylene vial attracted male C. cramerella moths in Sabah and peninsular Malaysia and in Sumatra and Sulawesi, Indonesia, suggesting that the same pheromone strain existed in a wide stretch of the <e>Indo</e>-Malayan archipelago. Of the three kinds of trap designs tested, the Delta traps were more effective than Pherocon V scale traps. Male captures were not significantly different among traps baited with 100-, 300-, or 1,000-mug doses of sex pheromone. A release rate study of pheromone formulation conducted in the laboratory showed that volatile active ingredients were desorbed from polyethylene vials following first-order kinetics, which indicates a satisfactory  half-life time  of a 100-mug loading is approximately 6 wk under laboratory conditions. A satisfactory attractiveness of the lure with a 100-mug loading was approximately 1-2 mo in the fields.",M1
18198837,"Semisynthetic studies on the manzamine alkaloids.Chemical transformation studies were conducted on (-)-8-hydroxymanzamine A ( 1), (-)-manzamine F ( 2), manzamine A ( 3), and (+)-8-hydroxymanzamine A ( 4), isolated from <e>Indo</e>-Pacific Acanthostrongylophora sponges. Thirteen new semisynthetic manzamine derivatives, including four Delta (34,35) manzamines ( 5, 6, 8, and 9) and the unprecedented manzamine derivative 17, are reported. The potent in vitro activities of the obtained semisynthetic manzamines against activated brain microglia and the AIDS opportunistic infection pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis are presented.",M1
17725569,"Molecular signatures of Pleistocene sea-level changes that affected connectivity among freshwater shrimp in <e>Indo</e>-Australian waters.A major paradigm in evolutionary biology asserts that global climate change during the Pleistocene often led to rapid and extensive diversification in numerous taxa. Recent phylogenetic data suggest that past climatic oscillations may have promoted long-distance marine dispersal in some freshwater crustacea from the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA). Whether this pattern is common, and whether similar processes are acting on diversification below the species level is unknown. We used nuclear and mitochondrial molecular variation in a freshwater-dependent decapod crustacean (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), sampled widely from the IAA, to assess the impact of Pleistocene sea-level changes on lineage diversification in this species. Fitting of an isolation with migration model enabled us to reject ongoing migration among lineages, and results indicate that isolation among both mainland-mainland and mainland-island lineages arose during the mid-Pleistocene. Our data suggest a scenario of widespread marine dispersal during Pleistocene glacial maxima (in support of the 'Pleistocene marine dispersal hypothesis') when sea levels were low, and geographical distances between fresh watersheds were greatly reduced, followed by increased isolation as sea levels subsequently rose.",M1
17347105,"Systematic placement of an enigmatic Southeast Asian taxon Eupetes macrocerus and implications for the biogeography of a main songbird radiation, the Passerida.Biogeographic connections between Australia and other continents are still poorly understood although the plate tectonics of the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific region is now well described. Eupetes macrocerus is an enigmatic taxon distributed in a small area on the Malay Peninsula and on Sumatra and Borneo. It has generally been associated with Ptilorrhoa in New Guinea on the other side of Wallace's Line, but a relationship with the West African Picathartes has also been suggested. Using three nuclear markers, we demonstrate that Eupetes is the sister taxon of the South African genus Chaetops, and their sister taxon in turn being Picathartes, with a divergence in the Eocene. Thus, this clade is distributed in remote corners of Africa and Asia, which makes the biogeographic history of these birds very intriguing. The most parsimonious explanation would be that they represent a relictual basal group in the Passerida clade established after a long-distance dispersal from the Australo-Papuan region to Africa. Many earlier taxonomic arrangements may have been based on assumptions about relationships with similar-looking forms in the same, or adjacent, biogeographic regions, and revisions with molecular data may uncover such cases of neglect of ancient relictual patterns reflecting past connections between the continents.",M1
16201135,"Indonesian mitochondrial DNA and its opposition to a Pleistocene era origin of proto-Polynesians in island southeast Asia.The origin of modern Polynesians, the route of their expansion into the Pacific Ocean, and the timing of their movements all remain contentious topics in modern anthropology. Numerous studies have used molecular data to elucidate settlement patterns in the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific region, but the same evidence is often interpreted in opposing ways by different researchers. Above all, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity has been used to discriminate between competing migration models and has narrowed the probable source of proto-Polynesian peoples to southern China and Taiwan or eastern Indonesia. Richards et al. (1998) used a dating method employing the p statistic to argue for an origin of Polynesian peoples in eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene (&gt; 10,000 years ago). Here, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is recalculated for a new series of Indonesian mtDNA sequences with Polynesian affinities. These data, which incorporate additional sequences published after 1998, produce dates that cannot rule out the possibility of a common ancestor for these sequences during the Holocene (&lt; 10,000 years ago). This implies that previous estimates of TMRCA dates for Indonesian sequences lacked the statistical robustness necessary for replicability. The extant mtDNA evidence can no longer be viewed as favoring a Polynesian origin in eastern Indonesia, but instead remains consistent with an origin of proto-Polynesian peoples in southern China and Taiwan.",M1
15387674,"Antineoplastic agents. 535. Isolation and structure of plakorstatins 1 and 2 from the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific sponge Plakortis nigra.Two new cancer cell growth inhibiting cyclic peroxides, plakorstatins 1 (1) and 2 (2), were isolated from the Indonesian marine sponge Plakortis nigra. The structures of plakorstatins 1 and 2 including relative configuration were elucidated on the basis of mass and 2D NMR spectroscopic interpretations. These are the first plakortides with an epoxy group in the side chain. Plakorstatin 2 was found to differ from plakorstatin 1 only in the configuration of the epoxide group. Both exhibited moderate cancer cell growth inhibition against the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line with ED(50) values of 1.1 and 0.91 microg/mL, respectively, for peroxides 1 and 2.",M1
14675592,"Ethnicity in relation to atrial fibrillation and stroke (the West Birmingham Stroke Project).To test the hypothesis that ethnic differences may exist in the epidemiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) and other cardiovascular conditions among patients admitted to the hospital with nonhemorrhagic stroke, we reviewed registry data over a 2-year period of 832 consecutive patients admitted with nonhemorrhagic stroke to our hospital, which serves a multiethnic population. <e>Indo</e>-Asians and Afro-Caribbeans with acute (nonhemorrhagic) stroke had a lower prevalence of AF, despite a greater prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, than whites. AF was an independent predictor of increased mortality after stroke in our multiethnic population as a whole, but AF appears to be a less prominent factor in stroke among Indo-Asians and Afro-Caribbeans than in whites.",M1
12542334,"Puupehenone congeners from an <e>indo</e>-pacific hyrtios sponge.An investigation of the constituents from an Indonesian Hyrtios sponge has provided new insights about the chemistry and biology of the puupehenones, a unique class of merosesquiterpenes. The parent compound, puupehenone (2), has been repeatedly encountered in sponges from four distinct orders. In this study we characterized three compounds, (+)-(5S,8S,9R,10S)-20-methoxypuupehenone (3), (+)-(5S,8S,10S)-20-methoxy-9,15-ene-puupehenol (4), and (+)-(5S,8S,9R,10S)-15,20-dimethoxypuupehenol (5). Their structures were supported by complete sets of spectroscopic data along with comparisons to literature properties. While 5 was observed in the crude extracts, it was also heat labile and could be converted at 35 degrees C to a mixture of 3 and 4. The possibility that 3, 4, and 5 are formed from 2 by a series of methanol additions is discussed. The bioactivity of these compounds in soft-agar cytotoxicity tests was also explored.",M1
12520298,"Magnitude and timing of temperature change in the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific warm pool during deglaciation.Ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific region have a strong influence on global heat and water vapour transport and thus constitute an important component of the climate system. Changes in sea surface temperatures and convection in the tropical Indo-Pacific region are thought to be responsible for the interannual to decadal climate variability observed in extra-tropical regions, but the role of the tropics in climate changes on millennial and orbital timescales is less clear. Here we analyse oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios of foraminiferal shells from the Makassar strait in the heart of the Indo-Pacific warm pool, to obtain synchronous estimates of sea surface temperatures and ice volume. We find that sea surface temperatures increased by 3.5-4.0 degrees C during the last two glacial-interglacial transitions, synchronous with the global increase in atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic warming, but the temperature increase occurred 2,000-3,000 years before the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets melted. Our observations suggest that the tropical Pacific region plays an important role in driving glacial-interglacial cycles, possibly through a system similar to how El Niño/Southern Oscillation regulates the poleward flux of heat and water vapour.",M1
12492342,"Structures and cytotoxic properties of sponge-derived bisannulated acridines.A reinvestigation of sponge natural products from additional <e>Indo</e>-Pacific collections of Xestospongiacf. carbonaria and X. cf. exigua has provided further insights on the structures, biological activities, and biosynthetic origin of bisannulated acridines. These alkaloids include one known pyridoacridine, neoamphimedine (2), and three new analogues, 5-methoxyneoamphimedine (4), neoamphimedine Y (5), and neoamphimedine Z (6). A completely new acridine, alpkinidine (7), was also isolated. A disk diffusion soft agar assay, using a panel of five cancer cell lines (solid tumors and leukemias) and two normal cells, was used to evaluate the differential cytotoxicity (solid tumor selectivity) of the sponge semipure extracts and selected compounds including amphimedine (1), 2, 4, and 7. While all four compounds were solid tumor selective, 1 and 2 were the most potent and 4 was the most selective. The rationale used to characterize the new structures is outlined along with the related biosynthetic pathways envisioned to generate 2 and 7.",M1
12425370,"Ethnic differences in peripheral vascular disease.The wide variation in the way coronary artery disease (CAD) affects different ethnic groups and the associated risk factor profiles of these groups have been extensively studied, but ethnic differences in the clinical manifestations of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) have been relatively neglected. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of PVD in different ethnic groups and to explore possible pathophysiological factors accounting for these differences. Atherosclerotic PVD is generally less prevalent in <e>Indo</e>-Asians and Afro-Caribbeans than in caucasians, despite the 'classical' risk factors being as prevalent, if not more so, suggesting the possibility of as yet unidentified risk factors in these groups. Angiographic and microscopic evidence suggests that patients of African or Afro-Caribbean origin suffer from a different pattern of PVD, which primarily affects the distal arteries. In contrast, Indo-Asians tend to suffer from thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) far more frequently than other ethnic groups; thus, their arterial disease appears to present much earlier and with greater severity. However, if this sub-category of patient is excluded, they seem to suffer much less from 'simple' atherosclerotic disease than their caucasian counterparts. Despite a higher prevalence of diabetes among Indo-Asians, the prevalence of intermittent claudication is considerably less in this ethnic group.",M1
12184829,"Rapid recovery of genetic diversity of stomatopod populations on Krakatau: temporal and spatial scales of marine larval dispersal.Although the recovery of terrestrial communities shattered by the massive eruption of Krakatau in 1883 has been well chronicled, the fate of marine populations has been largely ignored. We examined patterns of genetic diversity in populations of two coral reef-dwelling mantis shrimp, Haptosquilla pulchella and Haptosquilla glyptocercus (Stomatopoda: Protosquillidae), on the islands of Anak Krakatau and Rakata. Genetic surveys of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c (subunit 1) in these populations revealed remarkably high levels of haplotypic and nucleotide diversity that were comparable with undisturbed populations throughout the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific. Recolonization and rapid recovery of genetic diversity in the Krakatau populations indicates that larval dispersal from multiple and diverse source populations contributes substantially to the demographics of local populations over intermediate temporal (tens to hundreds of years) and spatial scales (tens to hundreds of kilometres). Natural experiments such as Krakatau provide an excellent mechanism to investigate marine larval dispersal and connectivity. Results from stomatopods indicate that marine reserves should be spaced no more than 50-100 km apart to facilitate ecological connectivity via larval dispersal.",M1
11522192,"Dynamic mimicry in an <e>Indo</e>-Malayan octopus.During research dives in Indonesia (Sulawesi and Bali), we filmed a distinctive long-armed octopus, which is new to science. Diving over 24 h periods revealed that the 'mimic octopus' emerges during daylight hours to forage on sand substrates in full view of pelagic fish predators. We observed nine individuals of this species displaying a repertoire of postures and body patterns, several of which are clearly impersonations of venomous animals co-occurring in this habitat. This 'dynamic mimicry' avoids the genetic constraints that may limit the diversity of genetically polymorphic mimics but has the same effect of decreasing the frequency with which predators encounter particular mimics. Additionally, our observations suggest that the octopus makes decisions about the most appropriate form of mimicry to use, allowing it to enhance further the benefits of mimicking toxic models by employing mimicry according to the nature of perceived threats.",M1
8894789,"Ethnic differences in pre-admission levels of physical activity in patients admitted with myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Regular exercise is generally considered to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Reduced levels of physical activity in <e>Indo</e>-Asians may partly explain why patients from this ethnic group sustain so many heart attacks. AIM: To investigate ethnic differences in pre-admission levels of physical activity amongst patients admitted with myocardial infarction and triggers for the acute cardiac event. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using standard Baecke questionnaire, which provided a semi-quantitative work score, sport score, leisure score and total activity score of general daily activities, with additional questions on activity at the onset of chest pain. SETTING: Coronary Care Unit, City Centre Teaching Hospital. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: We studied 100 consecutive patients (76 males, mean age 62.3 years, S.D. 12.5; 74 caucasians, 26 Indo-Asians) admitted with myocardial infarction. Most patients were engaged in sedentary activities, including lying in bed (25%), sitting (19%), watching television (14%) and sleeping (6%), whilst only 21% of patients were engaged in physical activity at chest pain onset; there were, however, no ethnic differences in activity at chest pain onset. There was a diurnal variation in chest pain onset, with the mode between 08:00 and 10:00 h. As the mean age of Indo-Asians was significantly lower than caucasians in the whole group (56.3 vs. 64.4 years; t-test, P &lt; 0.002), the Baecke questionnaire analysis was confined to only male patients aged &lt; 70 years (n = 56). Indo-Asian patients with myocardial infarction were found to have a significantly lower overall physical activity score (3.78 vs. 5.33; P = 0.003), leisure time physical activity (2.43 vs. 2.74; P &lt; 0.05) and sporting score (0.14 vs. 0.82; P &lt; 0.01) when compared to caucasians, despite a similar mean age and body mass index. CONCLUSION: The majority of myocardial infarction patients were engaged in sedentary activities at chest pain onset. Although there were no differences between caucasians and Indo-Asians in activity at symptom onset, Indo-Asian patients had a significantly lower overall physical activity score, leisure time physical activity and sporting score compared to caucasians. The lower general physical activity amongst Indo-Asians may in part contribute to the high prevalence of ischaemic heart disease amongst this ethnic group.",M1

(Radix) quadrasi (Philippines). L. (Radix) rubiginosa (Indonesia), L. (Radix) rubiginosa (Thailand), L. (Radix) viridis (Guam) and L. (Radix) viridis (Hong Kong). Fifty randomly chosen adult specimens of each species were studied and compared, although only field-collected specimens were studied for the first four groups and laboratory-raised specimens for the last two group. Results strongly suggested that L. cumingiana is a distinct species among the rest. L. quadrasi, L. rubiginosa (Indonesia) and L. rubiginosa (Thailand) exhibited great affinity towards each other. Likewise, the two geographical isolates of L. viridis were practically identical to each other except for some minor size differences.",M1
8160067,"Comparative radular morphology of Lymnaea (Bullastra) cumingiana (Pulmonata: Lymnaeidae) and related taxa in the <e>Indo</e>-Pacific region.The radular morphology of Lymnaea (Bullastra) cumingiana was compared to that of five other Indo-Pacific lymnaeid  species , namely: L. (Radix) quadrasi (Philippines), L. (R.) rubiginosa (Indonesia and Thailand) and L. (R.) viridix (Guam and Hong Kong) in order to investigate the taxonomic relationship among the six species. Although all six species uniformly exhibited a unicuspid, slightly asymmetrical central (rachidian) tooth and tricuspid laterals, interesting differences were noted among the outer marginals. These were observed to be uniquely bicuspid in L. cumingiana, predominantly tricuspid in L. quadrasi, tetracuspid in L. rubiginosa (Indonesia and Thailand) and multicuspid in L. viridis (Guam and Hong Kong). Thus, the results support the hypotheses that L. cumingiana is a unique species compared to the rest, that L. quadrasi is closely related to L. rubiginosa (Indonesia and Thailand) and that the two geographical isolates of L. viridis have not diverged. Radular morphology was therefore found to have a limited significance in elucidating the taxonomic relationship between the six groups of lymnaeids studied.",M1
6466216,"Primary health care for <e>Indo</e>-Chinese children in Australia.This study reports the detailed analysis of 61 consecutive presentations by recent immigrants from Indo-China to the Casualty Department of a modern Australian Children's Hospital. The parents/guardians were interviewed either in the Casualty Department or in their homes. Indo-Chinese children coming to a Casualty Department manifested the same age distribution and spectrum of illnesses that is seen in the general Australian paediatric population. However, significantly fewer presentations to hospital occurred due to accidents/trauma when the group was compared with the general population attending the Casualty Department. Only 21% of the Vietnamese and Cambodian families can communicate satisfactorily with hospital staff without interpreter help. Fifty-one per cent of parents reported that they did not have enough English for a medical interview without an interpreter. Twenty-eight per cent did not have enough English to communicate at all. Parents of Vietnamese children reported that on occasions they had not sought medical care for their children because of language difficulties. Many families do not know that an Interpreter Service is available, and many believe that access to such a service is available only through a doctor. Many of these children also use traditional Chinese remedies in the context of their contemporary Australian lives. We have found no evidence that this practice causes late presentation with deleterious effects, or any evidence that it compromises modern 'Western' treatment.",M1

20098676,"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin induces heterogeneity in lipid membranes: potential implication for its diverse biological action.BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), has a large number of divergent biological effects, the molecular mechanism(s) for which have yet to be fully elucidated. Interestingly, Indo is highly amphiphilic and associates strongly with lipid membranes, which influence localization, structure and function of membrane-associating proteins and actively regulate cell signaling events. Thus, it is possible that Indo regulates diverse cell functions by altering micro-environments within the membrane. Here we explored the effect of Indo on the nature of the segregated domains in a mixed model membrane composed of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl-choline (di16:0 PC, or DPPC) and dioleoyl phosphatidyl-choline (di18:1 PC or DOPC) and cholesterol that mimics biomembranes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a series of fluorescent probes in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) study, we found that Indo induced separation between gel domains and fluid domains in the mixed model membrane, possibly by enhancing the formation of gel-phase domains. This effect originated from the ability of Indo to specifically target the ordered domains in the mixed membrane. These findings were further confirmed by measuring the ability of Indo to affect the fluidity-dependent fluorescence quenching and the level of detergent resistance of membranes. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Because the tested lipids are the main lipid constituents in cell membranes, the observed formation of gel phase domains induced by Indo potentially occurs in biomembranes. This marked Indo-induced change in phase behavior potentially alters membrane protein functions, which contribute to the wide variety of biological activities of Indo and other NSAIDs.",M2
20042691,"Influence of indomethacin on ventilatory and cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 and breathing stability: the influence of PCO2 gradients.Indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), a reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, is a useful tool for assessing the role of cerebrovascular reactivity on ventilatory control. Despite this, the effect of INDO on breathing stability during wakefulness has yet to be examined. Although the effect of reductions in cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity on ventilatory CO(2) sensitivity is likely dependent upon the method used, no studies have compared the effect of INDO on steady-state and modified rebreathing estimates of ventilatory CO(2) sensitivity. The latter method includes the influence of PCO(2) gradients and cerebral perfusion, whereas the former does not. We examined the hypothesis that INDO-induced reduction in cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity would 1) cause unstable breathing in conscious humans and 2) increase ventilatory CO(2) sensitivity during the steady-state method but not during rebreathing methods. We measured arterial blood gases, ventilation (VE), and middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) before and 90 min following INDO ingestion (100 mg) or placebo in 12 healthy participants. There were no changes in resting arterial blood gases or Ve following either intervention. INDO increased the magnitude of Ve variability (index of breathing stability) during spontaneous air breathing (+4.3 +/- 5.2 Deltal/min, P = 0.01) and reduced MCAv (-25 +/- 19%, P &lt; 0.01) and MCAv-CO(2) reactivity during steady-state (-47 +/- 27%, P &lt; 0.01) and rebreathing (-32 +/- 25%, P &lt; 0.01). The Ve-CO(2) sensitivity during the steady-state method was increased with INDO (+0.5 +/- 0.5 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1), P &lt; 0.01), while no changes were observed during rebreathing (P &gt; 0.05). These data indicate that the net effect of INDO on ventilatory control is an enhanced ventilatory loop gain resulting in increased breathing instability. Our findings also highlight important methodological and physiological considerations when assessing the effect of INDO on ventilatory CO(2) sensitivity, whereby the effect of INDO-induced reduction of cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity on ventilatory CO(2) sensitivity is unmasked with the rebreathing method.",M2
19696359,"Cyclooxygenase and thromboxane/prostaglandin receptor contribute to aortic endothelium-dependent dysfunction in aging female spontaneously hypertensive rats.Cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived vasoconstrictory prostanoids contribute to impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in aging male (m) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR); however, vasomotor responses in aging female (f) SHR and sex differences in aging SHR are unknown. Examining mechanisms governing dysfunction in aging fSHR will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vascular complications in advanced hypertension. Aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation dose responses (ACh) of 16- and 30-wk-old mSHR and fSHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were examined in the absence (no drug control) and presence of COX inhibition [indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>)] and thromboxane/prostaglandin receptor inhibition (SQ-29548). No drug control-treated 16-wk mSHR exhibited considerable blunting of the peak relaxation response to ACh (e.g., 77 +/- 4% relaxation to 10(-5) mol/l) vs. Wistar-Kyoto controls (89 +/- 6%), and greater dysfunction occurred in 30-wk mSHR (63 +/- 2%). Interestingly, ACh relaxations of fSHR were unimpaired at 16 wk (101 +/- 2% to 10(-5) mol/l), but blunted in 30 wk (76 +/- 4%). Indo and SQ-29548 restored robust ACh vasorelaxation in all groups (e.g., 113 +/- 3 and 112 +/- 3%, respectively, in Indo- and SQ-29548-treated 30-wk fSHR). Aortic COX-1 protein expression was elevated by 75% in 30-wk vs. 16-wk fSHR, whereas group-averaged ACh-stimulated aortic PGI(2) release (assessed as 6- keto-PGF(1alpha)) was 30% greater in 30-wk vs. 16-wk fSHR (9,926 +/- 890 vs. 7,621 +/- 690 pg.ml(-1).mg dry wt(-1)), although this did not reach significance (P = 0.0758). Dramatic deterioration of endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in fSHR across this age range involves COX and thromboxane/prostaglandin receptor, supporting a mechanism of impairment similar to that which occurs in aging mSHR.",M2
19553924,"Effects of chronic treatment with the CB1 antagonist, rimonabant on the blood pressure, and vascular reactivity of obese Zucker rats.Rimonabant (RM) is a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist useful in the treatment of obesity associated cardiovascular risk factors. Since cannabinoids are vasoactive compounds, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with RM on systolic blood pressure (SBP), and endothelial and vascular reactivity. Obese Zucker rats (OZRs) and their lean counterparts were orally treated during 20 weeks with either RM (10 mg/kg/day). Endothelial and vascular function was assessed in aorta and small mesenteric arteries (SMAs) by concentration response curves to acetylcholine (ACh) and phenylephrine (Phe), respectively. Participation of nitric oxide (NO) was evaluated by incubation with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived products involvement was analyzed by incubation with indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). Plasma lipid profile, insulin and adiponectin were also analyzed. Sympathetic activity was evaluated by urinary excretion of noradrenaline. As expected, RM decreased body weight gain and enhanced adiponectin concentration. Insulin resistance and sympathetic activity were also decreased. The increase in SBP observed in OZRs was reduced by treatment with RM. Aortae and SMAs from OZRs exhibited lower contractile response to Phe, being this effect prevented by RM administration. Although ACh-induced response and NO participation remained unaltered with obesity, enhanced COX-derived constrictor products were found in OZRs. RM treatment neither altered endothelium-dependent relaxation nor L-NAME-sensitive component of the response. Nevertheless, it was able to regulate COX-derived vasoactive products participation. Those effects may contribute to explain some of the cardiovascular protective actions elicited by this drug.",M2
19549555,"Involvement of prostaglandin F2alpha in the adverse effect of PCB 77 on the force of contractions of bovine myometrium.Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) stimulate in vitro both the force of myometrial contractions and endometrial secretion of PGF2alpha in cattle. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the participation of PGF2alpha in the effect of PCBs on uterine contractility. For this aim, the myometrial strips were incubated (48h) with PCB 77 at the dose of 1, 10 and 100ng/ml (i.e., 0.0034, 0.034 and 0.34nmol/ml) separately or jointly with indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, 10(-4)M), which blocks the PGF2alpha synthesis. Next, the force of myometrial strips contractions was measured. Further, the influence of PCB 77 (0.1, 1 and 10ng/ml) on the PGF2alpha secretion from myometrial cells after 6, 24, and 48h and PCB 77 (1 and 10ng/ml) on the mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and PGF2alpha synthase (PGFS) in myometrial cells after 6 and 24h, was investigated. The increase (P&lt;0.05-0.001) of the contractions force of myometrial strips evoked by each dose of PCB 77, was markedly reduced (P&lt;0.05-001) by INDO. There was an increase (P&lt;0.05-0.001) of both PGF2alpha secretion after all studied periods of cell incubation and mRNA expression for COX-2 and PGFS after 6h treatment of myometrial cells with PCB 77. It can be concluded that myometrial synthesis of PGF2alpha and its further secretion is a part of the mechanism by means of which PCB 77 may affect the force of myometrial contractions in cattle.",M2
19548191,"Anti-ischemic activity and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant effect of hydrolysable tannins from the leaves of Rhus coriaria (Sumac) in isolated rabbit heart and thoracic aorta.The aim of this work was to investigate the cardioprotective activity of hydrolysable gallotannins from Rhus coriaria L. leaves extract (RCLE) in isolated rabbit heart preparations, submitted to low-flow ischemia/reperfusion damage. RCLE induces a dose-dependent normalization of coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), reducing left ventricular contracture during ischemia, and improving left ventricular developed pressure and the maximum rate of rise and fall of left ventricular pressure at reperfusion. Creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) outflow were significantly reduced during reperfusion. In parallel there was a rise in the release of the cytoprotective 6-ketoprostaglandin F (1alpha) (6-keto-PGF (1alpha)) and a decrease of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), both significant only at the highest RCLE concentrations (150-500 microg/mL). The vasorelaxant activity of RCLE was studied in isolated rabbit aorta rings precontracted with norepinephrine (NE) with and without endothelium. The vasorelaxation induced by RCLE was predominantly endothelium-dependent as demonstrated by the loss of RCLE vasorelaxant ability in i) de-endothelized rings and ii) in intact aortic rings after pretreatment with NG-monomethyl- L-arginine (L-NMMA) and 1 H-[1.2.4]oxadiazolo[4.3- A]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). The inhibition of vasorelaxation in intact rings by indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) demonstrates the ability of RCLE to modulate the coronary endothelium cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. The K-ATP channel antagonist glibenclamide (GLIB) was ineffective. The antioxidant activity of RCLE, investigated in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) model and in living cell systems (rat erythrocytes), was stronger than that of gallic acid, ascorbic acid and trolox. The structure of its main bioactive constituents, profiled by HPLC-ESI-HR-S, comprised a mixture of polygalloylated D-glucopyranose with different degrees of galloylation and 3- O-methylgallic acid. The cardiovascular protective effect of RCLE seems to be due to an interplay of different factors: COX pathway activation, TNF-alpha inhibition, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, and free radical and ROS scavenging.",M2
19366347,"Gastrointestinal safety and therapeutic efficacy of parenterally administered phosphatidylcholine-associated indomethacin in rodent model systems.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is limited in its enteral or parenteral use by side effects of gastroduodenal bleeding and ulceration. We have investigated the ability of phosphatidylcholine associated with indomethacin to form a therapeutically effective drug (<e>INDO</e>-PC) with reduced gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity for parenteral use. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were treated acutely by intravenous or chronically with subcutaneous injection of vehicle, indomethacin or INDO-PC using three related protocols. We then evaluated the following properties of these parenterally administered test drugs: (i) GI toxicity (luminal and faecal haemoglobin; intestinal perforations and adhesions; and haematocrit); (ii) bioavailability (plasma indomethacin); and (iii) therapeutic efficacy (analgesia from sensitivity to pressure; anti-inflammatory from ankle thickness; cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibition from synovial fluid prostaglandin E(2) concentration) in rats with adjuvant-induced joint inflammation. KEY RESULTS: Acute and chronic dosing with INDO-PC produced less GI bleeding and intestinal injury than indomethacin alone, whereas the bioavailability, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and COX inhibitory activity of INDO-PC were comparable to indomethacin. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The chemical association of phosphatidylcholine with indomethacin appears to markedly reduce the GI toxicity of the NSAID while providing equivalent therapeutic efficacy in a parenteral INDO-PC formulation.",M2
19299569,"Exercise training reverses age-related decrements in endothelium-dependent dilation in skeletal muscle feed arteries.We tested two hypotheses, first that exercise training reverses age-related decrements in endothelium-dependent dilation in soleus muscle feed arteries and second that this improved endothelium-dependent dilation is the result of increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due to increased content and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and/or increased antioxidant enzyme content. Young (2 mo) and old (22 mo) male Fischer 344 rats were exercise trained (Ex) or remained sedentary (Sed) for 10-12 wk, yielding four groups of rats: 1) young Sed (4-5 mo), 2) young Ex (4-5 mo), 3) old Sed (24-25 mo), and 4) old Ex (24-25 mo). Soleus muscle feed arteries (SFA) were isolated and cannulated with two glass micropipettes for examination of endothelium-dependent (ACh) and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] vasodilator function. To determine the mechanism(s) by which exercise affected dilator responses, ACh-induced dilation was assessed in the presence of N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; to inhibit NO synthase), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; to inhibit cyclooxygenase), and l-NNA + Indo. Results indicated that ACh-induced dilation was blunted in old Sed SFA relative to young Sed SFA. Exercise training improved ACh-induced dilation in old SFA such that vasodilator responses in old Ex SFA were similar to young Sed and young Ex SFA. Addition of l-NNA, or l-NNA + Indo, abolished the exercise effect. Immunoblot analysis revealed that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content was increased by training in old SFA, whereas eNOS and SOD-1 protein content were not altered. Addition of exogenous SOD, or SOD + catalase, improved ACh-induced dilation in old Sed SFA such that vasodilator responses were similar to young Sed SFA. Addition of l-NNA abolished the effect of exogenous SOD in old Sed arteries. Collectively, these results indicate that exercise training reverses age-induced endothelial dysfunction in SFA by increasing NO bioavailability and that increases in vascular antioxidant capacity may play an integral role in the improvement in endothelial function.",M2
19118158,"Influence of cerebral blood flow on breathing stability.Our previous work showed a diminished cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to changes in Pa(CO(2)) in congestive heart failure patients with central sleep apnea compared with those without apnea. Since the regulation of CBF serves to minimize oscillations in H(+) and Pco(2) at the site of the central chemoreceptors, it may play an important role in maintaining breathing stability. We hypothesized that an attenuated cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in Pa(CO(2)) would narrow the difference between the eupneic Pa(CO(2)) and the apneic threshold Pa(CO(2)) (DeltaPa(CO(2))), known as the CO(2) reserve, thereby making the subjects more susceptible to apnea. Accordingly, in seven normal subjects, we used indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; 100 mg by mouth) sufficient to reduce the CBF response to CO(2) by approximately 25% below control. The CO(2) reserve was estimated during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The apnea threshold was determined, both with and without Indo, in NREM sleep, in a random order using a ventilator in pressure support mode to gradually reduce Pa(CO(2)) until apnea occurred. results: Indo significantly reduced the CO(2) reserve required to produce apnea from 6.3 +/- 0.5 to 4.4 +/- 0.7 mmHg (P = 0.01) and increased the slope of the ventilation decrease in response to hypocapnic inhibition below eupnea (control vs. Indo: 1.06 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.61 +/- 0.27 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1), P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that reductions in the normal cerebral vascular response to hypocapnia will increase the susceptibility to apneas and breathing instability during sleep.",M2
19118095,"ATP-induced vasodilation and purinergic receptors in the human leg: roles of nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and adenosine.Plasma ATP is thought to contribute to the local regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow. Intravascular ATP infusion can induce profound limb muscle vasodilatation, but the purinergic receptors and downstream signals involved in this response remain unclear. This study investigated: 1) the role of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and adenosine as mediators of ATP-induced limb vasodilation and 2) the expression and distribution of purinergic P(2) receptors in human skeletal muscle. Systemic and leg hemodynamics were measured before and during 5-7 min of femoral intra-arterial infusion of ATP [0.45-2.45 micromol/min] in 19 healthy male subjects with and without coinfusion of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA; NO formation inhibitor; 12.3 +/- 0.3 (SE) mg/min), indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>; prostaglandin formation blocker; 613 +/- 12 microg/min), and/or theophylline (adenosine receptor blocker; 400 +/- 26 mg). During control conditions, ATP infusion increased leg blood flow (LBF) from baseline conditions by 1.82 +/- 0.14 l/min. When ATP was coinfused with either l-NMMA, INDO, or l-NMMA + INDO combined, the increase in LBF was reduced by 14 +/- 6, 15 +/- 9, and 39 +/- 8%, respectively (all P &lt; 0.05), and was associated with a parallel lowering in leg vascular conductance and cardiac output and a compensatory increase in leg O(2) extraction. Infusion of theophylline did not alter the ATP-induced leg hyperemia or systemic variables. Real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA content from the vastus lateralis muscle of eight subjects showed the highest expression of P(2Y2) receptors of the 10 investigated P(2) receptor subtypes. Immunohistochemistry showed that P(2Y2) receptors were located in the endothelium of microvessels and smooth muscle cells, whereas P(2X1) receptors were located in the endothelium and the sacrolemma. Collectively, these results indicate that NO and prostaglandins, but not adenosine, play a role in ATP-induced vasodilation in human skeletal muscle. The expression and localization of the nucleotide selective P(2Y2) and P(2X1) receptors suggest that these receptors may mediate ATP-induced vasodilation in skeletal muscle.",M2
19036387,"Development of Fe3O4-poly(L-lactide) magnetic microparticles in supercritical CO2.The Fe(3)O(4)-poly(L-lactide) (Fe(3)O(4)-PLLA) magnetic microparticles were successfully prepared in a process of solution-enhanced dispersion by supercritical CO(2) (SEDS), and their morphology, particle size, magnetic mass content, surface atom distribution and magnetic properties were characterized. Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) was used as a drug model to produce drug-polymer magnetic composite microparticles. The resulting Fe(3)O(4)-PLLA microparticles with mean size of 803 nm had good magnetic property and a saturation magnetization of 24.99 emu/g. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test indicated that most of the Fe(3)O(4) were encapsulated by PLLA, which indicated that the Fe(3)O(4)-PLLA magnetic microparticles had a core-shell structure. After further loading with drug, the Indo-Fe(3)O(4)-PLLA microparticles had a bigger mean size of 901 nm, and the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) analysis demonstrated that the SEDS process was a typical physical coating process to produce drug-polymer magnetic composite microparticles, which is favorable for drugs since there is no change in chemistry. The in vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the Fe(3)O(4)-PLLA magnetic microparticles had no cytotoxicity and were biocompatible, which means there is potential for biomedical application.",M2
18985092,"Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) mediates endothelium-dependent vasodilator effects of aqueous extracts from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.The vascular effects of an aqueous extract prepared from the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (ELE), a medicinal herb commonly used in antihypertensive herbal prescriptions in China, were investigated in rat mesenteric resistance arteries. The mesenteric vascular bed was perfused with Krebs solution and the perfusion pressure was measured with a pressure transducer. In preparations with an intact endothelium and precontracted with 7 microM methoxamine, perfusion of ELE (107102 mg/ml for 15 min) caused a concentration-dependent vasodilatation, which was abolished by chemical removal of the endothelium. The ELE-induced vasodilatation was inhibited by neither indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) nor NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, a nitric oxide inhibitor). The ELE-induced vasodilatation was significantly inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA, a K channel blocker) and 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (18alpha-GA, a gap-junction inhibitor), and abolished by high K-containing Krebs' solution. Atropine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited the vasodilatation induced by ELE at high concentrations. These results suggest that the ELE-induced vasodilatation is endothelium-dependent but nitric oxide (NO)- and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2)-independent, and is mainly mediated by the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in the mesenteric resistance arteries. Furthermore, the ELE-induced EDHF-mediated response involves the activation of K-channels and gap junctions.",M2
18842497,"Role of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase in hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation of portal hypertension.BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) are both powerful vasoactive substances correlated with the hyperhemodynamics of portal hypertension (PHT), a common syndrome characterized by a pathological increase in portal venous pressure. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible interaction between these two endothelial vasodilators, together with their respective roles in the hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation of PHT. METHODS: Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: intrahepatic portal hypertension (IHPH) induced by injection of CCl4 (n=31), prehepatic portal hypertension (PHPH) induced by partial stenosis of the portal vein (n=33), and sham-operated controls (SO) (n=32). Animals of each group received indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, either short-term (7 days) or long-term (15 days), with saline as control. Free portal pressure (FPP), together with the concentration of NO and PGI2 in serum were measured. The activity of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the abdominal aorta and small intestine were determined by spectrophotometry. RT-PCR was performed to measure the levels of cNOS and iNOS mRNA in the arteries and small intestines. RESULTS: Compared with SO rats, the concentrations of NO and PGI2 in PHT rats were elevated, which were consistent with the increased FPP (P&lt;0.05). Although administration of INDO persistently decreased the concentration of PGI2 in serum (P&lt;0.05), the long-term INDO-treated IHPH and PHPH groups had restored splanchnic hyperdynamic circulation, demonstrated by the enhanced FPP (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the changes of dynamic circulatory state in both IHPH and PHPH rats were concomitant with the expression and activity of iNOS and the concentration of NO (P&lt;0.05). Although the expression and activity of cNOS in abdominal aorta of PHT rats were higher than in SO rats (P&lt;0.05), there was no difference in small intestinal tissues between PHT and SO rats (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, the changes of iNOS activity and mRNA expression were more marked than cNOS in PHT rats, and there was no difference in expression and activity of cNOS between PHT rats treated by short- and long-term INDO (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: iNOS plays an important role in the hemodynamic abnormalities of PHT induced by overproduction of NO. There is a possible interaction between PGI2 and NO in hyperhemodynamics of PHT, but PGI2 may not be a mediator in the formation and development of the hyperdynamic circulatory state in PHT rats.",M2
18722378,"An investigation into the role of prostaglandins in zebrafish oocyte maturation and ovulation.This study explored the potential for ovarian-derived prostaglandins (PGs) to be involved in the regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation in zebrafish. It was demonstrated that cultured vitellogenic follicles have the capacity to produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and PGF(2alpha) in response to arachidonic acid (AA) in a concentration-dependent manner, and that AA stimulates the in vitro production of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). The production of AA-stimulated PGF(2alpha) was significantly reduced by treatment with the non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). Treatment of full-grown follicles with AA did not induce oocyte maturation as assessed by germinal vesicle breakdown, but INDO significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous maturation. Using Real-Time PCR, it was shown that follicles of different developmental size classes (primary growth and pre-vitellogenic, early-vitellogenic, and mid- to full-grown vitellogenic) express enzymes that release (cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)); phospholipase Cgamma1) or metabolize (COX-1, COX-2, and prostaglandin synthase-2) AA to PG metabolites. The expression of cPLA(2) was found to be significantly greater in full-grown follicles compared to follicles of the pre- and early-vitellogenic stages. In vivo studies demonstrated that breeding groups of zebrafish exposed to 100 microg/L INDO exhibited reduced spawning rates and clutch sizes compared with control and 1 microg/L INDO exposed fish. In other studies, it was shown that naturally spawning groups of females exhibit increased ovarian levels of PGF(2alpha), E(2), and 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (a maturation-inducing hormone in zebrafish) near the time of ovulation compared with non-breeding females. Collectively, these experiments indicate that the AA pathway in zebrafish ovaries is involved in the regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation and a non-selective inhibitor of COX disrupts these processes.",M2
18702446,"Effects of indomethacin and buprenorphine analgesia on the postoperative recovery of mice.Buprenorphine (Bup) is the most commonly used analgesic in mice, yet few objective assessments address its superiority for postsurgical recovery. In mice, IP implantation of a radiotelemetry device induces decreases in body weight (BW), food and water intake (FI, WI), core temperature (Tc), and activity levels that persist approximately 14 d in the absence of analgesia. To compare the efficacy of Bup with that of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) for postsurgical recovery, male C57BL/6J mice were treated on the day of radiotelemetry implantation with Bup (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) or Indo (1 mg/kg s.c.) followed by treatment with Indo (1 mg/kg p.o.) on the next day (Bup-Indo versus Indo-Indo). Responses were compared between treatments in mice implanted with a radiotelemetry device and those that did not undergo surgery. Changes in BW, FI, WI, Tc, and activity were examined throughout 14 d of recovery. Indo-Indo was more efficacious in inhibiting postsurgical BW, FI, and WI reductions, compared with Bup-Indo. Bup also reduced BW and FI in the absence of surgery, indicating a nonspecific effect of this drug on these variables. Indo-Indo treatment was associated with higher activity levels during lights-on-to-lights-off transition periods compared with that observed with Bup-Indo. According to 5 objective measures of surgical recovery, our data suggest that Indo-Indo treatment is more efficacious than is Bup-Indo for postsurgical recovery of radiotelemetry-implanted mice.",M2
18667186,"Altered responsiveness of small uterine arteries in women with idiopathic menorrhagia.OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to study vascular reactivity of small myometrial arteries in women with idiopathic menorrhagia. STUDY DESIGN: Small myometrial arteries were isolated from 6 patients with idiopathic menorrhagia and 4 controls. The contractile responses to thromboxane mimetic (U46619) and endothelin-1 were assessed before and after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester alone or in combination with indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>). Endothelium-dependent dilation to bradykinin and basal tension were compared before and after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester alone, or with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester in combination with indomethacin. RESULTS: Constriction to endothelin-1 was enhanced in idiopathic menorrhagia arteries (P &lt; .05). Idiopathic menorrhagia arteries demonstrated enhanced basal tension after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester, which was further exaggerated by indomethacin. NOS inhibition had no effect on basal tension in controls, but basal tension was enhanced after inhibition of cyclooxygenase-derived products (P &lt; .05). Bradykinin-mediated dilation was significantly increased in idiopathic menorrhagia (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: The presence of functional alterations in small myometrial arteries could contribute to idiopathic menorrhagia.",M2
18581209,"Cyclooxygenase inhibitors down regulate P-glycoprotein in human colorectal Caco-2 cell line.PURPOSE: Elevated expression of the ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) seems to correlate with multidrug resistance of cancer cells. In this study we investigated the effect of COX inhibitors in modulating P-gp and BCRP expression and P-gp activity in Caco-2 cells. METHODS: mRNA and protein expression of MDR1 and BCRP were evaluated by real time PCR and western blot respectively. The activity of P-gp was measured by intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123 or 3H-Digoxin. RESULTS: The chronic exposure of Caco-2 to indomethacin heptyl ester (<e>indo</e> HE) (0.4 muM) or nimesulide (10 muM) (selective COX-2 inhibitors) and naproxen (6 muM) (non selective inhibitor COX-1/COX-2) significantly decreased the expression and activity of P-gp. In contrast, the acute treatment by nimesulide and naproxen did not modify these parameters while indo HE treatment (48-72 h) caused a protein decrease and a functional inhibition of P-gp. Unexpectedly, the short-term treatment with naproxen induced an important increase of BCRP expression, but this induction was lost after long-term treatment. No modification of BCRP expression was observed after indo HE or nimesulide treatment. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest a possible down regulation of P-gp by COX inhibitors, which may enhance the accumulation of chemotherapy agents.",M2
18534796,"Inhibition of lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes by extracts isolated from Bacopa monniera (L.) Wettst.AIM OF THE STUDY: Bacopa monniera Linn is described in the Ayurvedic Materia Medica, as a therapeutically useful herb for the treatment of inflammation. In the current study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of methanolic extract of Bacopa monniera (BME). For some experiments EtOAc and bacoside fractions were prepared from BME. The effect of these extracts in modulating key mediators of inflammation was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, rat mononuclear cells and human whole blood assay were employed as in vivo and in vitro models. RESULTS: In carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, BME brought about 82% edema inhibition at a dose of 100mg/kg i.p. when compared to indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) (3mg/kg) that showed 70% edema inhibition. BME also significantly inhibited 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 15-LOX and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activities in rat monocytes in vivo. Among the fractions tested in vitro, EtOAc fraction possessed significant 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity with IC(50) value of 30 microg/ml compared to butylated hydroxyl toluene (IC(50) = 13 microg/ml). This fraction also exerted significant hydroxyl radical scavenging activity with IC(50) value of 25 microg/ml in comparison with quercetin (IC(50) = 5 microg/ml). Inhibitory effects of EtOAc and bacoside fractions on LOX and COX activities in Ca-A23187 stimulated rat mononuclear cells were also assessed. 5-LOX IC(50) values were 25 microg/ml for EtOAc, 68 microg/ml for bacosides and 2 microg/ml for nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) where as COX-2 IC(50) values were 1.32 microg/ml for EtOAc, 1.19 microg/ml for bacoside fraction and 0.23 microg/ml for indomethacin. EtOAc and bacoside fractions also brought about significant decrease in TNF-alpha release ex vivo. CONCLUSION: Bacopa monniera possesses anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of COX and LOX and downregulation of TNF-alpha.",M2
18456739,"15-Lipoxygenase metabolites contribute to age-related reduction in acetylcholine-induced hypotension in rabbits.Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites from the 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1) pathway, trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (THETAs) and hydroxy-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (HEETAs), are endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs) and relax rabbit arteries. Rabbit vascular 15-LO-1 expression, THETA and HEETA synthesis, and nitric oxide and prostaglandin-independent relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) and AA decreased with age (neonates to 16-wk-old). We characterized age-dependent ACh-hypotensive responses in vivo in 1-, 4-, 8-, and 16-wk-old rabbits and the contribution of THETAs and HEETAs to these responses. In anesthetized rabbits, blood pressure responses to ACh (4-4,000 ng/kg) were determined in the presence of vehicle or various inhibitors. ACh responses decreased with age (P &gt; 0.001). In the absence or presence of N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), maximum responses in 1 (-54.7 +/- 7.4 and -37.9 +/- 3.9%)- and 4 (-48.8 +/- 2.4 and -35.5 +/- 7.8%)-wk-old rabbits were higher than 8 (-30.0 +/- 2.8 and -26.6 +/- 4.4%)- and 16 (-36.7 +/- 3.5 and -27.3 +/- 10%)-wk-old rabbits. A lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755C, reduced THETA and HEETA synthesis in mesenteric arteries. In the presence of Indo and N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine, ACh relaxations were reduced by BW755C to a greater extent in the mesenteric arteries from the younger rabbits. In 4-wk-old rabbits treated with l-NAME and Indo, the maximum ACh hypotension was reduced by the potassium channel inhibitors apamin and charybdotoxin to -6.9 +/- 0.9%, by apamin alone to -19.5 +/- 1.4%, and by BW755C to -18.8 +/- 3.5%. The present study indicates that the age-related decrease in ACh-induced hypotension is mediated by the decreased synthesis of the 15-LO-1 metabolites THETAs and HEETAs.",M2
18449509,"Prostaglandin E2-mediated dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production in pristane-induced lupus mice.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by inflammatory and dysregulatory immune responses including overactive B cells, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, and T cell hyperactivity. PGE(2) modulates a variety of immune processes at sites of inflammation, including production of inflammatory cytokines. However, the role of PGE(2) in dysregulatory inflammatory and immune responses in lupus remains unclear. We investigated whether PGE(2) mediates production of inflammatory cytokines in pristane-induced lupus BALB/c mice. Our results showed that levels of serum and BAL PGE(2) and LPS-stimulated production of PGE(2) by peritoneal macrophages were remarkably increased in pristane-induced lupus mice compared to healthy controls. Exogenous PGE(2) enhanced production of IL-6, IL-10, and NO but decreased TNF-alpha by macrophages and augmented IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 by splenocytes from pristane-induced lupus mice compared to healthy controls. Exogenous PGE(2) also enhanced production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 by thymocytes from pristane-induced lupus mice. Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), a PGE(2) synthesis inhibitor, greatly inhibited LPS-induced production of IL-6 and IL-10 by macrophages from pristane-induced lupus mice, while enhanced TNF-alpha. Indo remarkably inhibited Con A-increased production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 by splenocytes and thymocytes from pristane-induced lupus mice.

18320321,"Bioflora probiotic in immunomodulation and prophylaxis of intestinal bacterial translocation in rats.The immunomodulator effect of Bioflora probiotic on T (CD4+) and B (CD20) lymphocytes in gastrointestinal mucosa and intestinal bacterial translocation was studied using Wistar rats (n = 10 per group). Two experiments were used: (I) stress with immobilization and water immersion at 22 degrees C for 7 h plus the application of indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) 10 mg/kg SC every 24 h for 3 days (comparator group), and (II) stress experiment I with the addition of 1 mL of Bioflora applied through a orogastric tube every 12 h for 3 days. At the 4th day, in asepsis, a dissection laparotomy of liver, spleen, mesenteric lymphatic nodes, and cecum was performed for microbiological culture, and stomach, ileum, and colon were also dissected for immunohistochemical and quantification of CD4+ and CD20. Findings in experiment I revealed cecum bacterial overdevelopment of 6 x 10(10) +/- 2.3 x 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU) (P &lt; 0.01) and positive cultures in liver, spleen, and all mesenteric lymphatic nodes. On the other hand, in the group treated with Probiotic Bioflora, cecum without overdevelopment (3 x 10(6) +/- 1.3 x 10(5) CFU), negative cultures in liver and spleen, and in lymphatic nodes two positive and eight negative cultures for E. coli and P. vulgaris (P &lt; 0.01) were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed a relevant increase of T lymphocytes (CD4+) in ileum and colon. CONCLUSIONS: Bioflora probiotic was shown to be an intestinal immunomodulator that induced increased T (CD4+) lymphocytes that also offer prophylaxis of intestinal bacterial translocation in a stressed rat model.",M2
18241971,"Non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibition before periodic acceleration (pGz) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation.Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) along the spinal axis is a novel method of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Oscillatory motion of the supine body in a horizontal fashion provides ventilation and blood flow to vital organs during cardiac arrest and pulsatile shear stress to the vascular endothelium. We previously showed in pigs that pGz-CPR affords better overall survival, post resuscitation myocardial function, and neurological outcomes compared to conventional chest compression CPR. pGz through pulsatile shear stress on the vascular endothelium elicits acute production of prostaglandins and endothelial-derived nitric oxide (eNO) in whole animal models and in vitro preparations. The salutary effects associated with pGz-CPR compared to chest compression CPR are in part related to endothelial-derived nitric oxide. Both eNO and prostaglandins are cardioprotective in ischemia reperfusion models. To differentiate between the roles of these mediators, indomethacin a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor (COX) was used as a tool to investigate prostaglandin effects during pGz-CPR by acute outcomes of survival, cardioprotection and regional blood flows (RBF). Two groups of anesthetized, intubated pigs weighing 25-36kg were studied. Prior to electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) animals received equal volumes of either saline placebo Control (CONT) (n=9) or indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), (n=8), (2mg/kg). After 3min of unsupported VF, both groups received 15min of pGz-CPR followed by pharmacologic and electrical attempts for resuscitation. Return of circulation (ROSC) to 3h occurred in (78%) in CONT and (63%) in INDO pretreated animals. There was no statistically significant difference in hemodynamics between groups at baseline or during the protocol. At baseline, INDO caused a decrease in brain RBF. Two hours after ROSC, INDO blunted the hyperemia response to brain and heart. Echocardiographic evidence of myocardial dysfunction was most notable for the INDO group in the wall motion score index (WMSI). After 3h of ROSC there was a 4-fold difference in both creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and Troponin I concentration between INDO and CONT. Therefore, non-specific acute inhibition of COX in part blunts the salutary effects of pGz-CPR. These data suggest that prostaglandins in part are involved in the cardio protection induced by pGz during CPR.",M2
18082780,"The effects of prostaglandin inhibition on whole-body ischemia-reperfusion in swine.BACKGROUND: Prostaglandins (PGs), particularly PGE2 and PGI2, have a salutary effect on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial damage. OBJECTIVE: We investigated acute PG synthesis inhibition on outcomes from whole-body ischemia-reperfusion injury using a well-characterized model of ventricular fibrillation (VF)-induced cardiac arrest in pigs. In addition, we assessed early postresuscitation myocardial function in survivors using echocardiography as well as a biochemical measure of myocardial tissue damage. METHODS: Twenty-six animals (weight range, 25-35 kg) received indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>; 2 mg/kg, nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 inhibitor), celecoxib (2 mg/kg; selective COX-2 inhibitor [COX-2-I]), or saline placebo 30 minutes before induction of VF. After 3 minutes of VF with no intervention, the animals received standard chest compression using an automated chest compression device (Thumper; Michigan Instruments, Grand Rapids, Mich) for 15 minutes. After 18 minutes of VF, a single dose of vasopressin and bicarbonate were administered and defibrillation attempted. Hemodynamics, regional blood flow, echocardiography, and serum troponin I measurements were performed before and after drug infusion or placebo, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). RESULT: Return of spontaneous circulation to 180 minutes occurred in 9 of 10 animals receiving placebo, 7 of 8 animals given COX-2-I, and 3 of 8 animals given INDO (P = .01, placebo or COX-2-I vs INDO). Hemodynamics did not differ among groups over time. Indomethacin and COX-2-I attenuated the increase in regional blood flow in the heart and brain, observed in the placebo group, 30 minutes after ROSC. All 3 study groups had significant decrease in percentage of ejection fraction and fractional shortening after ROSC and significant increase in wall motion score index after ROSC. In the COX-2-I group, troponin I increased 9-fold compared with placebo, 180 minutes after ROSC. Whole-body ischemia-reperfusion and CPR significantly increased PGE2 and PGI2 levels. The latter were blunted by pretreatment with COX inhibition. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PGs have a critical role in myocardial function and viability during low-blood-flow states produced by CPR and possibly other low-blood-flow clinical conditions.",M2
18044010,"The anti-secretory and anti-ulcer activities of esomeprazole in comparison with omeprazole in the stomach of rats and rabbits.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat hyperacid secretion and stomach ulcers. The study investigated the anti-secretory and anti-ulcer effects of esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole on dimaprit, histamine and dibutyryl adenosine 3, 5 cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP)-evoked gastric acid secretion, acidified ethanol (AE) and indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>)-induced haemorrhagic lesions and on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in the rat in vivo and rabbit in vitro preparations. The effect of omeprazole was also investigated for comparison. Dimaprit-induced acid secretion was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibited by both PPIs in a dose-dependent manner. In the isolated rabbit gastric glands, both PPIs elicited marked reductions in histamine- and dbcAMP-evoked acid secretion with similar potency. The lesions induced by either AE or INDO were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced in the presence of either esomeprazole or omeprazole compared to control values. Increasing doses of esomeprazole before AE treatment resulted in a marked degree of cytoprotection and an elevation in the concentration of bound PGE2 in the stomach tissue homogenate. The results show that esomeprazole and omeprazole were equally effective against gastric haemorrhagic lesions induced by either AE or INDO and in inhibiting dimaprit-, dbcAMP- and histamine-induced gastric acid secretion in the rat and rabbit stomach both in vivo and in vitro. The gastro-protective effect of esomeprazole was found to be proportional to the bound PGE2 levels in the glandular area of the stomach.",M2
17974130,"Indomethacin inhibits thymic involution in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.Diabetes is chronic disease that is accompanied by a rapid thymus involution. To investigate the factors responsible for thymic involution in a model of STZ-induced diabetes, mice were injected with STZ alone or in combination with the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). Thymus weight, glycemia and serum corticosterone were measured, and apoptosis in thymus and thymocyte cultures was analyzed by flow cytometry. Although earlier studies report that streptozotocin (STZ) is toxic to lymphoid tissues, in our experiments even massive doses of STZ did not negatively affect thymocyte cultures. Cultured thymocytes also seemed unaffected by high glucose concentrations, even after 24 h of exposure. Administration of INDO concomitantly with STZ reduced thymic involution but did not prevent the onset of hyperglycemia or reduce established hyperglycemia. When INDO was given before STZ, the same degree of thymic involution occurred; however, hyperglycemia was reduced, although normoglycemia was not restored. INDO also reduced serum corticosterone. Because thymocytes are known to be sensitive to glucocorticoids, this finding suggests that cyclooxygenase 2 inhibition may retard thymic involution by reducing serum glucocorticoids. In conclusion, our results show that STZ and hyperglycemia are not toxic to thymocytes and that cyclooxygenase 2-mediated mechanisms are involved in thymic involution during diabetes.",M2

In Experiment 1, diced placental slices from day-90 intact or OVX pregnant ewes that were ovariectomized or laparotomized and ovaries were not removed on day 83 were collected on day-90 and incubated in vitro in M-199 with Vehicle, ovine luteinizing hormone (oLH), ovine follicle stimulating hormone (oFSH), ovine placental lactogen (oPL), PGE(l), PGE(2), PGD(2), PGI(2), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 or 2 (IGF(l); IGF(2)), leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)), platelet activating factor (PAF) 16 or 18 (PAF-16; PAF-18) at doses of 0, 1, 10, or 100ng/ml for 4h. In Experiment 2, placental slices from day-90 intact and OVX (intact or OVX laporotomized 7 days earlier) pregnant ewes were incubated in vitro with vehicle, INDO, Meclofenamate (MECLO), PGE(l), PGE(2), INDO+PGE(1), MECLO+PGE(l), INDO+PGE(2), or MECLO+PGE(2) for 4h.

17544306,"Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation in the forelimb and hindlimb vasculatures of swine.Limb differences in endothelial function exist between arm and leg vasculatures of humans. The current investigation tested the hypothesis that forelimb and hindlimb vasorelaxation are similar in the absence of limb differences in blood pressure. Conduit arteries (brachials/femorals) and second order arterioles were harvested from 22 miniature Yucatan swine. In vitro assessment of vasorelaxation was determined by administering increasing doses of bradykinin (BK), acetylcholine (ACh), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The role of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways was assessed in conduit arteries but not resistance arterioles through L-NAME (300 microM) and <e>INDO</e> (5 microM) incubation, respectively. The relaxation responses to BK and ACh were similar in brachial and femoral arteries. SNP relaxation response was greater in the brachial compared to femoral arteries. There were also no significant differences in the relaxation responses of second order arterioles of the forelimb and hindlimb to BK, ACh, and SNP. Incubation of conduit arterial rings in L-NAME produced a greater reduction in BK and ACh relaxation in the brachial (approximately 25%) compared to femoral (approximately 13%) arterial rings. The current results of this investigation suggest that the forelimb and hindlimb vasculatures of swine have relatively similar vasorelaxation responses to both endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators.",M2
17499811,"Modulation of aortic vascular reactivity by sex hormones in a male rat model of metabolic syndrome.Modulation by sex hormones of aortic reactivity in rats with the metabolic syndrome (MS) was investigated. The following groups of weanling male Wistar rats were used: control rats (C) received regular tap water while MS rats received 30% sucrose in their drinking water; both had rodent chow for 24 weeks. These two groups were further subdivided into the following four groups: intact (Int), castrated (Cas), castrated plus testosterone (T) and castrated plus estradiol (E). Vascular response of thoracic aortic rings to norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (ACh), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) and nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was investigated. Blood pressure (BP) and serum nitrates and nitrites were measured. BP and serum nitrates and nitrites were modified by castration and treatments with either T or E. Vasoconstriction in Int MS and Cas MS+T aortas was larger than in C and Cas C+T, respectively. Vasodilation in Int MS and Cas MS+T was reduced in comparison with C and Cas C+T, Cas MS and Cas MS+E. Indomethacin decreased vasoconstriction in all groups (P&lt;0.002) but Int C and Cas C+T remained significantly smaller than Int MS and Cas MS+T. l-NAME in NE-contracted vessels induced a significant increase in vasoconstriction, except in Cas C+E rats; the responses of Int MS and Cas MS+T were significantly larger than in Int C and Cas C+T.

17347273,"Inhibition of nitric oxide and prostaglandins, but not endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors, reduces blood flow and aerobic energy turnover in the exercising human leg.Prostaglandins, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs) are substances that have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow during physical activity. We measured haemodynamics, plasma ATP at rest and during one-legged knee-extensor exercise (19 +/- 1 W) in nine healthy subjects with and without intra-arterial infusion of indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; 621 +/- 17 microg min(-1)), Indo + N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 12.4 +/- 0.3 mg min(-1)) (double blockade) and Indo + L-NMMA + tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; 12.4 +/- 0.3 mg min(-1)) (triple blockade). Double and triple blockade lowered leg blood flow (LBF) at rest (P&lt;0.05), while it remained unchanged with Indo. During exercise, LBF and vascular conductance were 2.54 +/- 0.10 l min(-1) and 25 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively, in control and they were lower with double (33 +/- 3 and 36 +/- 4%, respectively) and triple (26 +/- 4 and 28 +/- 3%, respectively) blockade (P&lt;0.05), while there was no difference with Indo. The lower LBF and vascular conductance with double and triple blockade occurred in parallel with a lower O(2) delivery, cardiac output, heart rate and plasma [noradrenaline] (P&lt;0.05), while blood pressure remained unchanged and O(2) extraction and femoral venous plasma [ATP] increased. Despite the increased O(2) extraction, leg was 13 and 17% (triple and double blockade, respectively) lower than control in parallel to a lower femoral venous temperature and lactate release (P&lt;0.05). These results suggest that NO and prostaglandins play important roles in skeletal muscle blood flow regulation during moderate intensity exercise and that EDHFs do not compensate for the impaired formation of NO and prostaglandins. Moreover, inhibition of NO and prostaglandin formation is associated with a lower aerobic energy turnover and increased concentration of vasoactive ATP in plasma.",M2
17324584,"Ticlopidine prevents the formation but delays the healing of ethanol-induced gastric lesions in the rat.The effects of acute or long-term oral ticlopidine administration in normal rat gastric mucosa or on gastric lesions induced by ethanol 50% (EtOH, 1 ml/rat, os) were examined and compared with those of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Ticlopidine does not affect gastric mucosal integrity either after acute (100 and 300 mg kg(-1)) or 1-week (100 mg kg(-1), die) oral administration. Ticlopidine (30-300 mg kg(-1), os) administered 1h before EtOH dose-dependently prevented the development of gastric haemorragic lesions. When ticlopidine was administered 1h after EtOH, it significantly (p&lt;0.05) delays gastric lesions healing. Acute ASA (50 and 100 mg kg(-1), os) administration causes a mild irritant activity similar to that observed after 1 week of ASA (50 mg kg(-1), os/die) administration. In condition of mucosal damage, ASA does not modify either the induction or the healing of EtOH-induced gastric lesions. To assess the possible involvement of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) or prostaglandins (PG) in the gastric protective activity of ticlopidine, the rats were pretreated with an inhibitor of NO-synthesis, L-NAME (70 mg kg(-1), s.c.) or the inhibitor of PG synthesis, indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>, 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.). Indo, but not L-NAME, was able to significantly counteract the gastroprotective activity of ticlopidine against EtOH injury. Furthermore, ticlopidine increases (47%) gastric PGE(2) content in normal mucosa compared to the one detected in control rats, thus suggesting that endogenous PGs contribute to enhanced mucosal resistance by ticlopidine. These results indicate that ticlopidine exerts dual effects during the development and healing of gastric lesions induced by EtOH.",M2
17302372,"Indomethacin has a potent antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging, highly transmissible and fatal disease caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Existing in non-identified animal reservoirs, SARS-CoV continues to represent a threat to humans because there is no effective specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections. OBJECTIVES: Starting from the observation that cyclopentenone cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolites are active against several RNA viruses, we investigated the effect of the COX inhibitor indomethacin on coronavirus replication. METHODS: Work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. SARS-CoV was grown in monkey VERO cells and human lung epithelial A549 cells, while canine coronavirus (CCoV) was grown in A72 canine cells. Antiviral activity was analysed by determining infective virus titres by TCID50, viral RNA synthesis by Northern blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR, and viral protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE analysis after 35S-methionine-labelling. Antiviral efficacy in vivo was determined by evaluating virus titres in CCoV-infected dogs treated orally with 1 mg/kg body weight indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we found that INDO has a potent direct antiviral activity against the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and CCoV. INDO does not affect coronavirus binding or entry into host cells, but acts by blocking viral RNA synthesis at cytoprotective doses. This effect is independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. INDO's potent antiviral activity (&gt;1,000-fold reduction in virus yield) was confirmed in vivo in CCoV-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS: The results identify INDO as a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication and suggest that, having both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, INDO could be beneficial in SARS therapy.",M2
17192516,"Infusion of exogenous tumor necrosis factor dose dependently alters the length of the luteal phase in cattle: differential responses to treatment with indomethacin and L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.We examined whether prostaglandins (PGs) and nitric oxide (NO) mediate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) actions in the estrus cycle. On Day 14 of the cycle, the following solutions were infused into the aorta abdominalis of a total of 51 heifers (Experiments 1 and 2): saline; 1 or 10 microg of TNF; 480 mg indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), an inhibitor of prostaglandin H synthase; 800 mg L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase; and TNF (1 or 10 microg) in combination with INDO or L-NAME. TNF at 1 microg infused directly into aorta abdominalis increased the level of PGF(2alpha) and decreased the level of progesterone (P4) in the peripheral blood and shortened the estrus cycle. The high TNF dose stimulated P4 and PGE(2) and prolonged the corpus luteum (CL) lifespan. INDO blocked the effects of both TNF doses on the CL lifespan and hormone output. L-NAME completely blocked the effects of the luteolytic TNF dose, whereas the effects of the luteotropic TNF dose were not inhibited. In Experiment 3 (Day 14), saline or different TNF doses were infused into the jugular vein (n = 9) or into the uterine lumen (n = 18). The CL lifespans of the different groups were not different when TNF was infused into the jugular vein. Although high TNF doses (1 and 10 microg) infused into the uterine lumen prolonged the CL lifespan, low doses (0.01 and 0.1 microg) induced premature luteolysis. We suggest that the actions of exogenous TNF on the CL lifespan depend on PG synthesis stimulated by TNF in the uterus. TNF at low concentrations initiates a positive cascade between uterine PGF(2alpha) and various luteolytic factors, including NO, to complete premature luteolysis.

Because future clinical applications are likely to use these adult stem cells in an autologous fashion, we wished to establish and characterize rat ADSC for pre-clinical tests. In the present study, we showed that rat ADSC expressed stem cell markers CD34 and STRO-1 at passage 1 but only STRO-1 at passage 3. These cells could also be induced to differentiate into adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and neuron-like cells, the latter of which expressed neuronal markers S100, nestin, and NF70. Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), and insulin were the active ingredients in a previously established neural induction medium (NIM); however, here we showed that IBMX alone was as effective as NIM in the induction of morphological changes as well as neuronal marker expression. Finally, we showed that vascular smooth muscle cells could also be induced by either NIM or IBMX to differentiate into neuron-like cells that expressed NF70.",M2
17174609,"Vasorelaxation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor in the human internal mammary artery and radial artery.OBJECTIVES: Due to potential therapeutic value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in coronary artery disease, the effect and mechanism of VEGF in human arteries used as coronary bypass grafts become important but not fully understood. VEGF-mediated endothelial regulation in vasorelaxation was studied in internal mammary artery (IMA) and radial artery (RA), compared with that of the classical agent-acetylcholine (ACh). The role of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) was investigated. METHODS: VEGF- and ACh-induced responses were measured in RA and IMA with or without endothelium and in the absence or presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase or prostacyclin. In addition, the VEGF-induced PGI2 was measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: VEGF induced similar relaxation in RA (59.2+/-9.3%) and IMA (56.1+/-6.4%) that was significantly inhibited by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) plus oxyhemoglobin (HbO) (IMA: 24.9+/-4.3%, P=0.03 vs. RA: 25.0+/-8.6%, P=0.01) or by indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) (IMA: 21.8+/-2.5%, P=0.000 vs. RA: 30.0+/-6.6%, P=0.04) with more inhibition in IMA than RA (P&lt;0.05). In addition, the VEGF-induced PGI2 was significantly higher in IMA than RA (11.5+/-2.1 vs. 4.9+/-1.1 pg/ml/mg, P=0.002). INDO+L-NNA+HbO reduced the VEGF-induced relaxation to 20.8+/-4.6% in RA vs. 4.8+/-1.6% in IMA (P=0.01). In contrast, the maximal relaxation induced by ACh in RA (55.9+/-6.0%) and IMA (48.5+/-5.3%) was largely inhibited by L-NNA in IMA and RA (14.7+/-3.0%, P=0.000 vs. 15.2+/-3.2%, P=0.004) but little affected by INDO. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF induces similar relaxation in IMA and RA with significantly more PGI2-mediated relaxation and higher stimulated PGI2 level in IMA but more EDHF-mediated relaxation in RA. In comparison, ACh-induced relaxation mainly depends on NO. Thus, our study reveals a significant difference in the mechanism of the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by VEGF and ACh.",M2
17138602,"Electromechanical and pharmacomechanical signalling pathways for conducted vasodilatation along endothelium of hamster feed arteries.Conducted vasodilatation (CVD) reflects the initiation and rapid (&gt;mm s(-1)) spread of hyperpolarization along the endothelium and into smooth muscle. The ion channels that initiate CVD remain unclear as do signalling pathways that may complement electromechanical relaxation. Using isolated pressurized (75 mmHg; 37 degrees C) feed arteries (n=63; diameter: rest: 53 +/- 2 microm, maximal: 98 +/- 2 microm) from hamster retractor skeletal muscle, we investigated the contribution of calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) and endothelium-derived autacoids to CVD. Local delivery (1 microm micropipette tip; 500-2000 ms pulse) of acetylcholine (ACh) at the downstream end initiated a local increase in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i (Fura-PE3; Deltaratio 340/380 nm = 0.215 +/- 0.032) that preceded CVD along the entire vessel. During local perifusion with KCa antagonists, iberiotoxin (5 microm) had no effect, but charybdotoxin (CTX, 5 microm) + apamin (APA, 10 microm) abolished CVD reversibly. Remarkably, this local inhibition of KCa unmasked a 'slow-conducted vasodilatation' (SCVD) that spread &gt;1200 microm at approximately 21 microm s(-1) (n=27). Recorded 500 microm upstream from the ACh stimulus, a rise in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i (Deltaratio 340/380 nm) = 0.146 +/- 0.017; P&lt;0.05) preceded SCVD (Deltadiameter = 14 +/- 3 microm) by approximately 10 s. Before KCa inhibition, antagonism of nitric oxide synthase (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, 250 microm; l-NNA) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin, 5 microm; <e>INDO</e>) had no effect on the amplitude of CVD yet response duration decreased by one-third (P&lt;0.05). During local CTX + APA perifusion, L-NNA + INDO abolished SCVD while conducted [Ca2+]i responses remained intact. Thus, ACh triggers electromechanical relaxation of smooth muscle cells along the vessel initiated by local KCa, and the ensuing 'wave' of Ca2+ along the endothelium releases autacoids to promote pharmacomechanical relaxation.",M2
17101575,"Chronic cyclooxygenase blockade enhances the vasopressin responsiveness in collaterals of portal hypertensive rats.OBJECTIVE: Collateral vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors may be crucial in the management of acute variceal bleeding. In an in situ perfusion model, arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to cause a direct vasoconstrictive effect on portal-systemic collaterals and this effect is enhanced by preincubation of indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic INDO administration on the portal-systemic collateral responsiveness to AVP and the degree of portal-systemic shunting in portal hypertensive rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats with partial portal vein ligation randomly received daily subcutaneous injections with INDO (5 mg/kg) or distilled water (control group) 2 days prior to until 7 days after ligation. Systemic and portal hemodynamics was evaluated on the 8th day. Using an in situ collateral perfusion model, AVP (10(-10)-10(-7) M) at a constant flow rate (20 ml/min) was applied. In another series, Krebs solution with different flow rates (5-30 ml/min) was used to obtain flow-pressure curves: the slopes represent collateral vascular resistances--the higher resistances indicate fewer collaterals. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and portal pressure were not significantly different between the INDO-treated group and the control group (p&gt;0.05). In the first series of experiments, INDO treatment increased the collateral perfusion pressure to AVP at 10(-8) M, 3x10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M (p&lt;0.05). In the second series, INDO did not change collateral vascular resistance, which suggests that the degree of shunting was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic INDO treatment improves the collateral vascular responsiveness to AVP without ameliorating portal-systemic shunting in portal hypertensive rats.",M2
17085343,"Influence of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase blockade on expression of cyclooxygenase and hemodynamics in rats with portal hypertension.BACKGROUND: The importance of nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension (PHT) has been extensively studied, but whether or not prostacyclin (PGI(2)) plays a role in formation and development of hyperdynamic circutatory state in PHT has not been verified. The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible interaction between prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) in the hyperdynamic circulatory state of rats with chronic portal hypertension (PHT), by measuring the hemodynamic changes and expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) mRNA in vessels and small intestine after administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) either in the short-term (7 days) or long-term (15 days). METHODS: Ninety-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: intrahepatic portal hypertension (IHPH) induced by injection of CCl(4), prehepatic portal hypertension (PHPH) induced by partial stenosis of the portal vein, and sham-operated controls (SO). Animals of each group received L-NNA or INDO either for 7 or 15 days, with saline as control. Splanchnic hemodynamics was measured by the radioactive microsphere technique. The concentration of NO in serum was determined as the nitrate; nitrite ratio (NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-), micromol/L) by a colorometric method, and that of PGI(2) was measured by specific radioimmunoassay for its stable hydrolysis product 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) (pg/ml). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction measured the levels of COX-1 mRNA in the superior mesenteric artery, thoracic aorta, and small intestine of these rats. RESULTS: Compared with SO rats, COX-1 mRNA expression and the concentrations of plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and serum NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) were enhanced in both IHPH and PHPH rats; splanchnic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased, but portal venous inflow (PVI) markedly increased (P&lt;0.05). Seven or 15 days of L-NNA treatment reduced COX-1 mRNA expression in these vessels and the small intestine, concomitant with a significant decrease in the concentration of plasma PGI(2) and serum NO in IHPH and PHPH rats (P&lt;0.05). At the same time, PVI decreased but SVR increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). In both IHPH and PHPH rats, the COX-1 mRNA expression and the concentration of plasma PGI(2) after No synthase (NOS) blockade for 15 days were higher than those for 7 days, whereas the hyperdynamic circulatory state was improved after NOS blockade for 15 days compared with 7 days. The concentration of PGI(2) treated by INDO for 15 days was not significantly different from that after 7-day COX blockade, and hemodynamics restored hyperdynamic circulatory state. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperdynamic circulatory state in rats with PHT is correlated with the concentration of serum NO. There is a possible interaction between PGI(2) and NO in the hyperhemodynamics of PHT. PGI(2) is probably not the mediator in the formation and development of the hyperdynamic circulatory state in rats with chronic PHT.",M2
16652226,"The action of extracellular NAD+ on gluconeogenesis in the perfused rat liver.In the rat liver NAD+ infusion produces increases in portal perfusion pressure and glycogenolysis and transient inhibition of oxygen consumption. The aim of the present work was to investigate the possible action of this agent on gluconeogenesis using lactate as a gluconeogenic precursor. Hemoglobin-free rat liver perfusion in antegrade and retrograde modes was used with enzymatic determination of glucose production and polarographic assay of oxygen uptake. NAD+ infusion into the portal vein (antegrade perfusion) produced a concentration-dependent (25-100 microM) transient inhibition of oxygen uptake and gluconeogenesis. For both parameters inhibition was followed by stimulation. NAD+ infusion into the hepatic vein (retrograde perfusion) produced only transient stimulations. During Ca2+-free perfusion the action of NAD+ was restricted to small transient stimulations. Inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis with different specificities (<e>indo</e>-methacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, bromophenacyl bromide) either inhibited or changed the action of NAD+. The action of NAD+ on gluconeogenesis is probably mediated by eicosanoids synthesized in non-parenchymal cells. As in the fed state, in the fasted condition extracellular NAD+ is also able to exert two opposite effects, inhibition and stimulation. Since inhibition did not manifest significantly in retrograde perfusion it is likely that the generating signal is located in pre-sinusoidal regions.",M2
16647636,"Role of intraluteal prostaglandin F(2alpha), progesterone and oxytocin in basal and pulsatile progesterone release from developing bovine corpus luteum.The present study examined the role of intra-luteal prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha), progesterone (P4) and oxytocin (OT) on the corpus luteum function by using specific hormone antagonists. Luteal cells from the developing CL (days 5-7 of the estrous cycle) were exposed to P4 antagonist (onapristone, OP, 10(-4)M), OT antagonist (atosiban, AT; 10(-6)M) or indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>; 10(-4)M), for 12h and then stimulated with PGF(2alpha) (10(-8)M) for 4h. Pre-treatment of the cells with OP, AT or INDO resulted in an increase in P4 secretion in response to PGF(2alpha). To examine the temporal effects of P4, OT and PGs on P4 secretion, dispersed luteal cells were pre-exposed to OP, AT or INDO for 1, 2, 4, 6 or 12h. Prostaglandin F(2alpha) stimulated P4 secretion (P&lt;0.05) after 2h of pre-exposition. In the microdyalisis study, the spontaneous release of P4 from developing CL tissue was of pulsatile nature with irregular peaks at 1-2h intervals. Treatment with OP increased the number of P4 peaks (P&lt;0.05), whereas AT and INDO significantly reduced the number of P4 peaks detected (P&lt;0.05). Interestingly, INDO completely blocked the pulsatile nature in the release of P4, but it secretion remained stable throughout the experimental period. These results demonstrate that luteal PGF(2alpha), OT, and P4 are components of an autocrine/paracrine intra-ovarian regulatory system responsible for the episodic (pulsatile) release of P4 from the bovine CL during the early luteal phase.",M2
16624295,"Deoxycorticosterone's anticonvulsant effects in infant rats are blocked by finasteride, but not by indomethacin.Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) is a steroid hormone that suppresses seizures in both humans and animals. At higher doses, DOC's anticonvulsant actions are accompanied by sedation and ataxia. The mechanism of DOC's anticonvulsant actions is not known, although it has been suggested that they may relate to DOC's secondary metabolite 3-alpha-5-alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). The present study was designed to study the relation of DOC's anticonvulsant actions to its primary and secondary metabolites in 15-day-old rats. It was found that DOC's anticonvulsant and ataxic effects were suppressed by finasteride, which blocks the formation of DOC's primary metabolite, 3-alpha-5-alpha-dehydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). They were not suppressed by indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), which blocks the conversion of DHDOC into THDOC. The direct anticonvulsant effects of DHDOC and THDOC were also tested. DHDOC and THDOC were both potent anticonvulsants in 15-day old rats. Both also caused ataxia at high doses. DHDOC had a therapeutic index (TI) of 3.2, however, which was better than either DOC (TI = 1.2) or THDOC (TI = 1.5). It appears that DOC itself is not anticonvulsant, but that its anticonvulsant effects may relate to both its primary and secondary metabolites. DOC's primary metabolite, DHDOC--with its good TI--deserves a test in the treatment of childhood seizures.",M2
16586543,"Role of bile acids, prostaglandins and COX inhibitors in chronic esophagitis in a mouse model.AIM: To develop a new experimental model of esophagitis that serves a complementary tool to clinical investigation in an insight into the mechanism of the damage to the esophagus mucosa by aggressive factors, and role of COX inhibitors in this process. METHODS: The study was conducted in 56 male mice. Animals were divided into seven groups: (1) perfused with HCl, (2) perfused with HCl and physiologic concentration of pepsin (HCl/P), (3) perfused with similar HCl/P solution enriched with conjugated bile acids (glycho- and tauro-sodium salts) designated esophageal infusion catheter under the general anesthesia, (4) perfused as in group 2 treated with indometacin, (5) perfused as in group 2 treated with NS-398, (6) perfused as in group 3 treated with indometacin, and (7) perfused as in group 3 treated with NS-398. The esophagus was divided into 3 parts: upper, middle and lower. The PGE2 concentration was measured in all parts of esophagus using RIA method. Esophagus of sacrificed animals was macroscopically evaluated using a low power dissecting microscope (20x). Specimens, representing the most frequently seen changes were fixed, stained with H&amp;E and assessed microscopically using the damage score, and inflammatory score. RESULTS: The macroscopic changes were significantly severer in HCl/P than those in HCl animals (77%) and in HCl/P/BA group (43%). In HCl/P NS-398 group we noticed significantly less changes than those in not treated group (42%) and in analogical group treated with indometacin (45%). In HCl/P/BA <e>INDO</e> group we observed significantly severer changes than that in not treated group (52%). We noticed less changes in HCl/P NS-398 than that in group with indometacin (46%). In HCl/P/BA NS-398 group we had less changes than that in indometacin group (34%). The microscopic changes observed in HCl/P/BA INDO group were severer than that in not treated group (48%). Esophagitis index in HCl group was significantly lower than in HCl/P and also HCl/P/BA group (32% and 33%). In HCl/P/BA/INDO group the esophagitis surface was larger than that in not treated group (33%). In HCL/P group the surface of esophagus with ulceration was significantly larger (10-fold) than that in HCl/P/BA group. The PGE2 concentration was significantly higher in HCl/P group than in HCl/P/BA group. The PGE2 concentration in lower part of esophagus was also significantly higher in middle than those in HCl and HCl/P/BA groups. In upper part of esophagus the PGE2 concentration was significantly higher in HCl/P/BA group than that in group treated with indometacin (46%). We also observed higher PGE2 concentration in middle part of esophagus in HCl/P/BA group than those in group treated with indometacin and in group treated with indometacin and NS-398 (by 52% and 43% respectively). CONCLUSION: Pepsin is the pivotal factor in the development of chronic esophageal injury. Bile acids diminish chronic esophageal injury induced by HCl/P, indicating its potential negative impact on pepsin proteolytic potential, pivotal for mucosal injury in low pH. The role of selective COX inhibitors is still unclear, and needs more investigations. This novel chronic experimental esophagitis is an excellent model for further study on the role of cytokines in genetically modified animals.",M2
16547381,"[Comparison of the efficacy of ibuprofen and indomethacin in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in prematurely born infants]AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of early treatment with ibuprofen (IBU) and indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. Prospective study with blind trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 35 preterm infants (19 treated with INDO, 16 IBU) (gestation age &lt;33 and birth weight &lt; 1500 g), who had an echocardiographicaly confirmed patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The infants were randomly assigned in two groups to receive INDO (0.2-0.2-0.2 mg/kg) or IBU (10-5-5 mg/kg) in first 72 hours of life (average 2 days of life). The rate of ductal closure, the need for surgical ligation, side effects, complications, and the infants clinical course were recorded. RESULTS: The rate of ductal closure was similar in two groups (15/19, 80% INDO; 11/16, 69% IBU). 27 infants (15 INDO, 12 IBU) were treated per protocol (3 doses). For remaining 8 infants we stopped treatment due to side effects. In the IBU group the main reason to stop treatment was pulmonary hemorrhage (3/16, 19%) and pulmonary hypertension (1/16, 6%), but in the INDO group it was increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations (3/19, 16%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH IV) grade (1/19 5%). In IBU group vs. INDO, urine output decreased (p=0.02), but never before below the level of oliguria (defined as urine output below 1 ml/kg/h). Risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) grade II was similar in two groups, but only patients treated with INDO showed intestinal perforations (p=ns). They received also postnatal hydrocortisone and we showed near significant tendency (p=0.06) for intestinal perforation in patients treated with INDO and hydrocortisone. There were no significant differences with respect to IVH or PVL between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ibuprofen and indomethacin in PDA treatment is similar. Treatment of ibuprofen and indomethacin may cause transient renal dysfunction: diminished urine output and increase of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations. Indomethacin, especially with concomitant treatment with hydrocortisone, may increase the risk of intestinal perforation.",M2
16537180,"Inhibition of tumor progression and paraneoplastic syndrome development in a murine lung adenocarcinoma by medroxyprogesterone acetate and indomethacin.Mice bearing LP07 lung adenocarcinoma present some characteristics similar to those shown in patients with several malignant diseases. LP07 tumor bearers develop paraneoplastic syndromes such as cachexia, leukocytosis, and hypercalcemia, partly due to a systemic inflammatory response. We analyzed some of the mechanisms involved in the effectiveness of the association of the appetite-stimulant medroxiprogesterone acetate (MPA) and the nonselective cyclooxigenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) in LP07 tumor bearing mice. INDO and INDO plus MPA treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth, which was not inhibited by MPA. The number of lung metastatic nodules was decreased with all treatments, being most effective INDO alone and INDO plus MPA. A significant decrease of plasmatic levels of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-2 correlated with these results. Paraneoplastic syndromes, leukocytosis, and cachexia were abolished by all treatments. We determined effects of the treatments on circulating cytokines shown to regulate cachexia and inflammation. Both treatments alone, and INDO plus MPA, reduced circulating IL-6 throughout tumor evolution. A pronounced increase in serum IL-1ss levels was detected in untreated tumor bearers. These levels decreased and were closer to normal serum values when LP07 mice were treated with INDO plus MPA. The combination of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug as INDO and MPA showed to be effective in inhibiting tumor and metastatic growth and diminishing paraneoplastic symptoms and SIR. A variety of specific molecules are implicated as playing a role in cancer-induced cachexia and hematological alterations.",M2
16514196,"Effect of intrafollicular indomethacin injection on gonadotropin surge-induced expression of select extracellular matrix degrading enzymes and their inhibitors in bovine preovulatory follicles.A growing body of evidence supports an obligatory role for intrafollicular prostanoids in the mechanism of ovulation. However, the prostanoid-dependent mediators of the follicular extracellular matrix degradation required for ovulation are unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the cellular compartment(s) in which the gonadotropin surge-induced regulation of select extracellular matrix degrading enzymes and their cognate inhibitors occurs in bovine preovulatory follicles, and to test whether such regulation is blocked by intrafollicular administration of the prostanoid synthesis and ovulation inhibitor, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). Follicular fluid prostaglandin E2 concentrations were elevated in diluent-treated follicles before ovulation (24 h after GnRH injection), but the increase was blocked in INDO-treated follicles. Real-time PCR analysis revealed the specific follicular cell types where gonadotropin surge-induced increases in mRNA abundance for members of the matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase and plasminogen activator families occurred. INDO treatment increased thecal cell mRNA for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 and its protein abundance in the apex of preovulatory follicles before ovulation, but suppressed granulosal cell mRNA and activity for tissue plasminogen activator in follicular fluid and the follicle apex. Plasmin activity was also suppressed in the follicular fluid of INDO-treated follicles. Effects of INDO injection on select matrix metalloproteinases were not observed. The results suggest that gonadotropin surge-induced regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 and tissue plasminogen activator may be prostanoid dependent, and support a potential role for increased tissue plasminogen activator expression and decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 expression in the mechanism of ovulation.",M2
16493584,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ovulation: lessons from morphology.Ovulation constitutes the central event in ovarian physiology, and ovulatory disfunction is a relevant cause of female infertility. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), widely used due to their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, consistently inhibit ovulation in all mammalian species investigated so far, likely due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of COX, that is the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. COX-2 inhibition has major effects on ovulation, fertilization and implantation, and NSAID therapy is likely implicated in human infertility and could be an important, frequently overlooked, cause of ovulatory disfunction in women. Although there is compelling evidence for a role of PGs in ovulation, the molecular targets and the precise role of these compounds in the ovulatory process are not fully understood. Morphological studies from rats treated with indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), a potent inhibitor of PG synthesis, provide evidence on the actions of NSAIDs in ovulation, as well as on the possible roles of PGs in the ovulatory process. Cycling rats treated with INDO during the preovulatory period show abnormal ovulation, due to disruption of the spatial targeting of follicle rupture at the apex. Noticeably, gonadotropin-primed immature rats (widely used as a model for the study of ovulation) show age-dependent ovulatory defects similar to those of cycling rats treated with INDO. These data suggest that NSAID treatment disrupts physiological mechanisms underlying spatial targeting of follicle rupture at the apex, which are not fully established in very young rats. We summarize herein the ovulatory defects after pharmacologic COX-2 inhibition, and discuss the possible mechanisms underlying the anti-ovulatory actions of NSAIDs.",M2
16436092,"Indomethacin disrupts the protective effect of phosphatidylcholine against bile salt-induced ileal mucosa injury.BACKGROUND: Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) exerts local toxic effects on small intestinal mucosa, possibly in association with hydrophobic bile salts. We investigated the potential toxic effects of Indo on ileal mucosa and the role of phosphatidylcholine (PC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transmucosal resistance and Na-fluorescein permeability of ileal mucosa segments from female Wistar rats were determined in Ussing chambers during a 30-min incubation with model systems containing: control-buffer, taurodeoxycholate (TDC), Indo, TDC-Indo, TDC-PC, or TDC-PC-Indo. Decrease of resistance and increase of permeability were considered as parameters for mucosal injury. After incubation in Ussing chambers, the histopathology was examined to quantify the extent of mucosal injury. Also, in CaCo-2 cells, LDH-release was determined as a measure of cytotoxicity, after incubation with various model systems. RESULTS: Decrease of resistance and increase of permeability were highest in systems containing TDC-Indo (P &lt; 0.01). Phosphatidylcholine protected against the cytotoxic effects of TDC in absence of Indo only. Extent of mucosal injury by histological examination was also highest in systems containing TDC-Indo (P = 0.006). Again, PC exhibited protective effects in absence of Indo only. The LDH-release by CaCo2-cells was strongest in TDC-Indo systems (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Indomethacin disrupts protective effects of PC against bile salt-induced ileal mucosa injury. This finding is relevant for small intestinal injury induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",M2
16343878,"Inhibition of prostaglandins does not reduce the cardiovascular changes during endotoxemia in rats.Vasodilatory prostanoids, such as prostacyclin and PGE2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to play a central role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia. This study was undertaken to elucidate whether indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), a non-selective COX inhibitor, has protective effects against the cardiovascular alterations that occur during endotoxemia. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with 15 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS injection led to a prominent decrease in cardiac left ventricular end diastolic area (LVEDA) and increased LV fractional shortening (FS), as measured by echocardigraphy. LPS also led to a significant increase in plasma and myocardial TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels, and elevated plasma and hypothalamic levels of PGE2. Neither the decrease in LVEDA and the increase in FS, nor the elevation in plasma and myocardial cytokine levels were altered by INDO (10 mg/kg). On the other hand, pretreatment with INDO significantly reduced the elevation in PGE2 and the hypothermia induced by LPS. Taken together, this study demonstrates that solely inhibiting the production of PGE2 is not sufficient to reduce the cardiovascular alteration seen in endotoxemia.",M2
16171601,"Suprarenal aortic clamping and reperfusion decreases medullary and cortical blood flow by decreased endogenous renal nitric oxide and PGE2 synthesis.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the hypothesis that clamping the aorta above the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) followed by suprarenal aortic clamping and reperfusion (SRACR) decreases microvascular blood flow by loss of endogenous medullary and cortical nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E(2) synthesis. STUDY DESIGN: Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (350 g) had either microdialysis probes or laser Doppler fibers inserted into the renal cortex to a depth of 2 mm and into the renal medulla at 4 mm. Laser Doppler blood flow was continuously monitored (data reported as percentage of change compared to basal), and the microdialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused in vivo at 3 microL/min with lactated Ringer solution. Dialysate fluid was collected at basal time zero, following 30 minutes of suprarenal aortic clamping (ischemia) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion and compared to a sham operation. Both groups were treated with saline carrier, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) (10 mg/kg, a cyclooxygenase [COX] inhibitor), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg, a NO synthase [NOS] inhibitor), or L-arginine (200 mg/kg, an NO precursor). Dialysate was analyzed for total NO (muM) and PGE(2) (pg/mL) synthesis. The renal cortex and medulla were analyzed for inducible NOS (iNOS) and COX-2 content by Western blot. All data are reported as mean +/- SEM, N &gt; 5 and analyzed by analysis of variance. RESULTS: SRACR caused a marked decrease in medullary and cortical blood flow with a concomitant decrease in endogenous medullary and cortical NO synthesis. Treatment with L-NAME further decreased blood flow and NO synthesis in the medulla and cortex. L-Arginine restored medullary and cortical NO synthesis and blood flow in the cortex but not the medulla. SRACR did not alter renal medullary or cortical PGE(2); however, addition of INDO, COX inhibitor, caused a concomitant decrease in medullary and cortical PGE(2) synthesis and blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: NO is an important endogenous renal vasodilator that, when maintained can help preserve cortical blood flow following SRACR. These data also suggest that avoidance of COX-2 inhibitors can help maintain endogenous renal cortical and medullary PGE(2) synthesis and thus contribute to maintaining normal blood flow. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study is the first to combine in vivo physiologic assays to simultaneously identify clinically relevant intrarenal vasodilators (cortical and medullary) that are required to maintain microvascular blood flow. Identification of endogenous renal cortical and medullary vasodilators responsible for maintaining renal microvascular blood flow will allow development of treatment strategies to preserve these vasodilators following SRACR. Successful preservation of endogenous intrarenal vasodilators will help maintain renal microvascular blood flow and renal function in the treatment of complex aortic pathology that requires SRACR.",M2
16166207,"Peroxynitrite reduces the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor component of coronary flow-mediated dilation in PECAM-1-knockout mice.Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is capable of transducing signals in endothelial cells exposed to shear; however, the biological consequences of this signal transduction are unknown. Because shear stress elicits flow-mediated dilation (FMD), we examined whether steady-state FMD in mouse coronary arteries (MCAs) is affected in the PECAM-1 knockout (KO) mouse. MCAs were isolated from wild-type (WT) or KO mice and prepared for videomicroscopy, histofluorescence, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. FMD was examined in the absence and presence of N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and l-NAME+indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>). FMD was reduced in KO relative to WT MCAs, but the l-NAME-inhibitable portion of FMD was similar between the two. The INDO-sensitive component of FMD was diminished in KO MCAs. In contrast, the residual component of dilation, presumably because of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), was abolished in KO MCAs. Histofluorescence showed relatively more superoxide (O2-.; oxy-ethidium fluorescence) and peroxide production (dihydrochlorofluorescene fluoresecence) in KO MCAs at rest. Flow augmented O2-. and peroxide production in WT MCAs but had little effect on KO MCAs. Enhanced nitric oxide generation was observed in arteries from KO mice, accompanied with increased eNOS S1177 phosphorylation. In vessels from KO mice, treatment with ebselen decreased peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation and improved the reduced FMD, largely due to restoration of the presumed EDHF component. These results suggest that PECAM-1 is necessary for normal FMD in the mouse coronary circulation. In the absence of this adhesion and signaling molecule, ONOO- production is increased concomitant with a reduction in both the EDHF and INDO-sensitive components of FMD.",M2
16141408,"Novel mechanism of vasodilation in inflammatory bowel disease.OBJECTIVE: Endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine (Ach) is reduced in mucosal arterioles from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The contributions of both nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) are decreased. We hypothesized that the remaining dilation results from products of cyclooxygenase. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to isolate eicosanoid vasodilator products and videomicroscopy was used to examine vasomotor responses in human mucosal arterioles from subjects with or without IBD undergoing bowel resection surgeries. In subjects without IBD, Ach constricted (-52%+/-10%) arterioles devoid of endothelium. Indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) had no effect. In contrast, Ach dose-dependently dilated both intact and endothelial denuded arterioles from patients with IBD. The dilation was converted to constriction by INDO (-54%+/-9%; P&lt;0.05 versus non-IBD) or by BWA868C (PGD2 receptor antagonist). Only in arterioles from subjects with IBD did Ach produce an arachidonic acid metabolite that comigrated on HPLC with PG D2 (PGD2). Exogenous PGD2 dilated (max=66%+/-4%) IBD arterioles. CONCLUSIONS: In arterioles from IBD patients, Ach-mediated dilation shifts from endothelial production of NO and EDHF to nonendothelial generation of a PG, likely PGD2. This is a novel dilator mechanism arising from nonendothelial vascular tissue that compensates for loss of endothelium-dependent dilation. PGD2 appears to be important in regulating mucosal blood flow in patients with IBD, implicating potentially detrimental effects from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.",M2
15950196,"Inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin phenethylamide reduces atherosclerosis in apoE-null mice.Non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) has been reported to reduce atherosclerosis in both rabbit and murine models. In contrast, selective inhibition of COX-2 has been shown to suppress early atherosclerosis in LDL-receptor null mice but not more advanced lesions in apoE deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. We investigated the efficacy of the novel COX inhibitor indomethacin phenethylamide (<e>INDO</e>-PA) on the development of different stages of atherosclerotic lesion formation in female apoE(-/-) mice. INDO-PA, which is highly selective for COX-2 in vitro, reduced platelet thromboxane production by 61% in vivo, indicating partial inhibition of COX-1 in vivo. Treatment of female apoE(-/-) mice with 5mg/kg INDO-PA significantly reduced early to intermediate aortic atherosclerotic lesion formation (44 and 53%, respectively) in both the aortic sinus and aorta en face compared to controls. Interestingly, there was no difference in the extent of atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta in apoE(-/-) mice treated from 11 to 21 weeks of age with INDO-PA, yet there was a striking (76%) reduction in lesion size by en face analysis in these mice. These studies demonstrate the ability of non-selective COX inhibition with INDO-PA to reduce early to intermediate atherosclerotic lesion formation in apoE(-/-) mice, supporting a role for anti-inflammatory approaches in the prevention of atherosclerosis.",M2
15818117,"Role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 in the vasodilator response to vascular endothelial growth factor in the neonatal piglet lung.OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates vascular proliferation and causes vasodilation. In the pulmonary circulation, the vasorelaxing effect of VEGF has been attributed to nitric oxide, whereas in other vascular beds, prostacyclin and other mechanisms are also involved. This vascular effect follows binding to two receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), the latter of which is thought to be the main receptor responsible for the vasorelaxing effect of VEGF. The role of VEGFR1 in the neonatal pulmonary vasculature remains to be determined. DESIGN: Prospective randomized laboratory investigation. SETTING: Animal laboratory. SUBJECTS: Newborn Yorkshire-Landrace piglets. INTERVENTIONS: To determine the mechanisms of action of VEGF in the neonatal pulmonary vasculature, the effect of VEGF (10-10 M) was tested in isolated perfused piglet lungs, alone and in the presence of a VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor, N-nitro-l-arginine (L-NNA), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), L-NNA + Indo, and GF109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor. The effect of a VEGFR1 agonist, placenta growth factor (PlGF), was also studied with or without L-NNA. Perfusate was collected, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), as well as 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha and thromboxane B2, the stable metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane, respectively, was measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: VEGF caused vasorelaxation with a concomitant increase in cGMP. PlGF also decreased vascular tone and increased cGMP. VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor did not prevent the reduction in perfusion pressure seen with VEGF but blocked the increase in cGMP. Pretreatment with L-NNA completely inhibited VEGF and PlGF vasodilation and prevented the increase in cGMP seen with both agonists. Pretreatment with Indo or GF109203X did not reduce the dilator response to VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF vasodilation may follow nitric oxide release in the piglet pulmonary circulation. VEGF vasorelaxation may not only occur through binding to VEGFR2, since PlGF, the specific VEGFR1 agonist, also causes vasodilation. Therefore, vasodilator response to VEGF may involve both types of receptor in the neonatal piglet pulmonary vasculature.",M2
15731984,"Continuous indomethacin infusion may be less effective than bolus infusions for ductal closure in very low birth weight infants.The effectiveness of continuous indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) infusion versus bolus infusions for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was investigated. The study design was an open-label case series (continuous INDO) with historic controls matched for gestational age (bolus INDO). Ductal closure rates were determined in two groups: 16 preterm infants with PDA treated with continuous INDO infusion (CONTIN group) and 16 control patients, matched for gestational age, who received bolus INDO infusions (BOLUS group). The total dosage was the same for both groups. PDA closed in seven of 16 preterm infants in the CONTIN group and in 13 of 16 in the BOLUS group ( p = 0.033, Fisher's exact test). In infants &lt; 1000 g it was two of eight in the CONTIN group and 10 of 10 in the BOLUS group ( p = 0.002). Continuous INDO infusion was more likely than bolus infusion to be associated with failure of ductal closure (odds ratio, 19; 95% CI, 1.5 to 247; p = 0.023). This indicates that continuous infusion of INDO may be less effective in closing PDA than bolus infusions, especially in extremely low birth weight infants.",M2
15717178,"A meta-analysis of ibuprofen versus indomethacin for closure of patent ductus arteriosus.Ibuprofen (IBU) has previously been shown to be as effective as indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) in closing the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) of preterm infants, without severely affecting renal hemodynamics or basal cerebral blood flow. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials to compare the efficacy and safety of IBU and INDO for treatment of PDA. Data from the nine relevant trials ( n =566), showed no significant difference in the efficacy of IBU and INDO in PDA closure ( P =0.70). However, five trials ( n =443) provided serum creatinine concentration data that revealed a significantly lower increase favoring IBU ( P &lt; 0.001), and urine output data that showed a significantly lower decrease favoring IBU ( P &lt; 0.001). In two trials ( n =188) the proportion of infants who required postnatal oxygen therapy at 28 days (defined as chronic lung disease) was significantly higher with IBU (52/94; 55.3%) than with INDO (38/94; 40.4%, P &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found in mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, surgical ligation, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, periventricular leukomalacia, length of hospital stay, gastrointestinal bleeding, re-opening of PDA, back-up treatment, surfactant therapy, or days on a ventilator. Conclusion:ibuprofen and indomethacin have similar efficacy in patent ductus arteriosus closure, but preterm infants treated with ibuprofen experience lower serum creatinine values, higher urine output, and less undesirable decreased organ blood flow and vasoconstrictive adverse effects.",M2
15655838,"Role of PGI2 in the formation and maintenance of hyperdynamic circulatory state of portal hypertensive rats.AIM: To investigate the role of prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) in the development and maintenance of hyperdynamic circulatory state of chronic portal hypertensive rats. METHODS: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: intrahepatic portal hypertension (IHPH) group by injection of CCl(4), prehepatic portal hypertension (PHPH) group by partial stenosis of the portal vein and sham-operation control (SO) group. One week after the models were made, animals in each group were subdivided into 4 groups: saline controlled group (n = 23), Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) group (n = 21) group, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) group (n = 22) and high-dose heparin group (n = 24). The rats were administrated 1 mL of saline, L-NNA (3.3 mg/kg.d) and INDO (5 mg/kg.d) respectively through gastric tubes for one week, then heparin (200 IU/Kg/min) was given to rats by intravenous injection for an hour. Splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics were measured using radioactive microsphere techniques. The serum nitrate/nitrite (NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-)) levels as a marker of production of NO were assessed by a colorimetric method, and concentration of 6-keto-PGF1alpha, a stable hydrolytic product of PGI(2), was determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The concentrations of plasma 6-keto-PGF1alpha (pg/mL) and serum NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) (micromol/L) in IHPH rats (1123.85+/-153.64, 73.34+/-4.31) and PHPH rats (891.88+/-83.11, 75.21+/-6.89) were significantly higher than those in SO rats (725.53+/-105.54, 58.79+/-8.47) (P&lt;0.05). Compared with SO rats, total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) and spanchnic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased but cardiac index (CI) and portal venous inflow (PVI) increased obviously in IHPH and PHPH rats (P&lt;0.05). L-NNA and indomethacin could decrease the concentrations of plasma 6-keto-PGF1alpha and serum NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) in IHPH and PHPH rats (P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, CI, FPP and PVI lowered but MAP, TPR and SVR increased (P&lt;0.05). After deduction of the action of NO, there was no significant correlation between plasma PGI(2) level and hemodynamic parameters such as CI, TPR, PVI and SVR. However, after deduction of the action of PGI(2), NO still correlated highly with the hemodynamic parameters, indicating that there was a close correlation between NO and the hemodynamic parameters. After administration of high-dose heparin, plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) concentrations in IHPH, PHPH and SO rats were significantly higher than those in rats administrated vehicle (P&lt;0.05). On the contrary, levels of serum NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) in IHPH, PHPH and SO rats were significantly lower than those in rats administrated Vehicle (P&lt;0.05). Compared with those rats administrated vehicle, the hemodynamic parameters of portal hypertensive rats, such as CI and PVI, declined significantly after administration of high-dose heparin (P&lt;0.05), while TPR and SVR increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: It is NO rather than PGI(2) that is a mediator in the formation and maintenance of hyperdynamic circulatory state of chronic portal hypertensive rats.",M2
15634613,"Optimization of chitosan film as a substitute for animal and human epidermal sheets for in vitro permeation of polar and non polar drugs.The present investigation is aimed at preparing chitosan films capable of simulating the flux of modal drugs, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), across rat, rabbit and human cadaver epidermal sheets. Application of statistical design revealed that the concentration of chitosan, crosslinking time and concentration of crosslinking agent significantly influenced the in vitro flux of 5-FU and INDO across chitosan films. Multiple linear regression revealed a linear influence of all these active variables on 5-FU and INDO flux. It was deduced from atomic absorption spectroscopic analyses, DSC and IR spectroscopic data that 5% (m/V) sodium tripolyphosphate (NaTPP) produced optimum crosslinking of chitosan films. The in vitro permeation of both 5-FU and INDO across optimized film formulations was found to be comparable to that obtained across rat, rabbit and human epidermal sheets. These results indicate that optimized chitosan films have a potential to be developed as a substitute for animal and human cadaver epidermal sheets for preliminary in vitro permeation studies.",M2
15581355,"Molecular basis of the time-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenases by indomethacin.Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are the therapeutic targets of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) was one of the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to be characterized as a time-dependent, functionally irreversible inhibitor, but the molecular basis of this phenomenon is uncertain. In the crystal structure of INDO bound to COX-2, a small hydrophobic pocket was identified that surrounds the 2'-methyl group of INDO. The pocket is formed by the residues Ala-527, Val-349, Ser-530, and Leu-531. The contribution of this pocket to inhibition was evaluated by altering its volume by mutagenesis of Val-349. The V349A mutation expanded the pocket and increased the potency of INDO, whereas the V349L mutation reduced the size of the pocket and decreased the potency of INDO. Particularly striking was the reversibility of INDO inhibition of the V349L mutant. The 2'-des-methyl analogue of INDO (DM-INDO) was synthesized and tested against wild-type COX-1 and COX-2, as well as the Val-349 mutants. DM-INDO bound to all enzymes tested, but only inhibited wt mCOX-2 and the V349I enzyme. Without the 2'-methyl group anchoring DM-INDO in the active site, the compound was readily competed off of the enzyme by arachidonic acid. The kinetics of inhibition were comparable to the kinetics of binding as evaluated by fluorescence quenching. These results highlight binding of the 2'-methyl of INDO in the hydrophobic pocket as an important determinant of its time-dependent inhibition of COX enzymes.",M2
15505501,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced nitric oxide- and PGI2-dependent relaxation in human internal mammary arteries: a comparative study with KDR and Flt-1 selective mutants.The role of the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) receptors (KDR and Flt-1) and their characteristics in VEGF-induced vasodilation in human vessels is unclear. This study investigated the in vitro vasorelaxant effects of KDR-selective (KDR-SM) and Flt-1-selective mutants (Flt-1-SM) in the human internal mammary artery (IMA). IMA segments (n = 183) taken from 48 patients were studied in organ baths. The cumulative concentration (-12 to -8 log10M)-relaxation curves were established for VEGF, KDR-SM, Flt-1-SM, and placenta growth factor (PlGF) in the absence or presence of indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, 7 microM), N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 300 microM), L-NNA + oxyhemoglobin (HbO, 20 microM), or INDO + L-NNA + HbO. The VEGF-induced relaxation was abolished in endothelium-denuded IMA. In the endothelium-intact vessel rings, VEGF (63.2 +/- 3.9%) induced significantly more (P &lt; 0.001) relaxation than Flt-1-SM (28.5 +/- 4.3%, 95% CI 18.1-51.3%), and PlGF (26.0 +/- 4.7%, 95% CI 17.6-56.8%). The maximal relaxation induced by KDR-SM (53.0 +/- 4.0%) was only slightly less than that by VEGF (P = 0.075) but significantly more than that by Flt-1-SM (P = 0.001, 95% CI 7.8-41.1%). Pretreatment of INDO or L-NNA + HbO significantly (P &lt; 0.001) inhibited the relaxation by VEGF (21.2 +/- 3.9% or 23.3 +/- 4.3%) and KDR-SM (9.8 +/- 8.2% or 10.1 +/- 17.8%). INDO + L-NNA + HbO completely inhibited the relaxation by VEGF, KDR-SM, or Flt-1-SM. KDR may be the dominant receptor in mediating the VEGF-mediated relaxation, which is regulated by both PGI2 and nitric oxide but probably not by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, in the human IMA. This study gives insight into the characteristics of the VEGF-mediated vasodilation and provides a scientific basis for potential clinical application of VEGF/KDR-SM in ischemic heart disease.",M2
15345060,"Immature rats show ovulatory defects similar to those in adult rats lacking prostaglandin and progesterone actions.Gonadotropin-primed immature rats (GPIR) constitute a widely used model for the study of ovulation. Although the equivalence between the ovulatory process in immature and adult rats is generally assumed, the morphological and functional characteristics of ovulation in immature rats have been scarcely considered. We describe herein the morphological aspects of the ovulatory process in GPIR and their response to classical ovulation inhibitors, such as the inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) and a progesterone (P) receptor (PR) antagonist (RU486). Immature Wistar rats were primed with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) at 21, 23 or 25 days of age, injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 48 h later, and sacrificed 16 h after hCG treatment, to assess follicle rupture and ovulation. Surprisingly, GPIR showed age-related ovulatory defects close similar to those in adult rats lacking P and PG actions. Rats primed with eCG at 21 or 23 days of age showed abnormally ruptured corpora lutea in which the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) was trapped or had been released to the ovarian interstitum, invading the ovarian stroma and blood and lymphatic vessels. Supplementation of immature rats with exogenous P and/or PG of the E series did not significantly inhibit abnormal follicle rupture. Otherwise, ovulatory defects were practically absent in rats primed with eCG at 25 days of age. GPIR treated with INDO showed the same ovulatory alterations than vehicle-treated ones, although affecting to a higher proportion of follicles. Blocking P actions with RU486 increased the number of COC trapped inside corpora lutea and decreased ovulation. The presence of ovulatory defects in GPIR, suggests that the capacity of the immature ovary to undergo the coordinate changes leading to effective ovulation is not fully established in Wistar rats primed with eCG before 25 days of age.",M2
15308331,"NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenase mediate the ultraviolet B-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in HaCaT human keratinocytes.The detrimental effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation have been connected with the enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by UVB. However, the exact source of ROS produced by UVB has not been clearly revealed yet. In this study, we determined the source of ROS production and its role in the UVB-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in HaCaT human keratinocytes. UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors. In addition, these inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase and COX significantly blocked the UVB irradiation-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. These results suggest that the NADPH oxidase and COX may be major sources for the UVB-induced ROS generation, and play an essential role in the activation of NF-kappaB which is involved in the expression of a variety of genes induced by UVB in HaCaT cells. These results further suggest that these enzymes may be good targets for the preventive strategy of UVB-induced skin injury.",M2
15301937,"Electroacupuncture combined with indomethacin enhances antihyperalgesia in inflammatory rats.Our previous study showed that electroacupuncture (EA), an adjuvant to conventional medicine, significantly attenuated hyperalgesia and inflammation. The present study is an evaluation of the potential synergism of EA and a subeffective dosage of indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) in a rat model. Inflammation and hyperalgesia, manifesting as edema and decreased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious stimulus, were induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. EA treatments were given at acupoint GB30 immediately and 2 h post-CFA. INDO at 2 mg/kg was given (intraperitoneally) 40 min before the second EA. PWL and edema were measured prior to CFA and 2.5 and 5 h post-CFA. Ten and 100 Hz EA significantly inhibited CFA-induced hind paw hyperalgesia. Both low- and high-frequency EA combined with INDO enhanced antihyperalgesia compared to each component alone, and 10 Hz but not 100 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. A combination of low-frequency EA and INDO did not show synergistic inhibitory effects on edema. The results demonstrate that EA combined with INDO synergistically inhibits hyperalgesia and suggest an improved treatment strategy for inflammatory pain.",M2
15172959,"Prostacyclin release and receptor activation: differential control of human pulmonary venous and arterial tone.1. In human pulmonary vascular preparations, precontracted arteries were more sensitive to the relaxant effect of acetylcholine (ACh) than veins (pD(2) values: 7.25+/-0.08 (n=23) and 5.92+/-0.09 (n=25), respectively). Therefore, the role of prostacyclin (PGI(2)) was explored to examine whether this mediator may be responsible for the difference in relaxation. 2. In the presence of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), the ACh relaxations were reduced in arteries but not in veins. On the contrary, an inhibitor (l-NOARG) of the nitric oxide synthase blocked preferentially the relaxation in veins. 3. A greater release of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), the stable metabolite of PGI(2), was observed in arterial preparations than in venous preparations when stimulated with either ACh or arachidonic acid (AA). 4. Exogenous PGI(2) produced a reduced relaxant effect in the precontracted vein when compared with the artery. In the presence of the EP(1)-receptor antagonist AH6809, the PGI(2) relaxation of veins was similar to arteries. 5. In veins, AA (0.1 mm) produced a biphasic response, namely, a contraction peak (0.4-0.5 g) followed by a relaxation. These contractions in venous preparations were abolished either in the absence of endothelium or in the presence of INDO or an EP(1)-receptor antagonist (AH6809, SC19220). In the arterial preparations AA induced only relaxations. 6. In both vascular preparations, COX-1 but not the COX-2 protein was detected in microsomal preparations derived from homogenized tissues or freshly isolated endothelial cells. 7. The differential vasorelaxations induced by ACh may be explained, in part, by a more pronounced production and release of PGI(2) in human pulmonary arteries than in the veins. In addition, while PGI(2) induced relaxation by activation of IP-receptors in both types of vessels, a PGI(2) constrictor effect was responsible for masking the relaxation in the veins by activation of the EP(1)-receptor.",M2
15168317,"Indomethacin therapy for patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants: efficacy of a dosing strategy based on a second-dose peak plasma indomethacin level and estimated plasma indomethacin levels.The objective of this study was to determine the rate of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in premature infants using an adjustable indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) dosing strategy, based on a second-dose peak plasma INDO level. We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of premature infants that were treated with INDO for a PDA, had a second dose peak plasma NDO levels, and followed predetermined guidelines for INDO dosing adjustments, over a 4-year period (1995 to 1998). Of 103 infants treated with the adjustable INDO dosing strategy, 66 (64%) achieved PDA closure whereas 37 (36%) did not. No differences in the second-dose peak plasma INDO levels (830 +/- 339 versus 702 +/- 381 ng/mL), day of life treatment was started (4 +/- 3 versus 4 +/- 2 days), or the number of doses of INDO received (4 +/- 1 versus 5 +/- 2 dose) were observed between responders and nonresponders. However, fourth-dose peak plasma INDO levels, which were available from 38 of 66 (57%) of the responders and 20 of 37 (54%) of the nonresponders, were lower in nonresponders (1553 +/- 413 versus 1829 +/- 609 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.05). Patient demographics, including birth weight and gestational age, were similar between these groups. Using an adjustable INDO dosing strategy, based on a second-dose peak plasma INDO level and estimated plasma levels, PDA closure rates of 64% can be achieved. Although a clear relationship between INDO plasma levels and PDA closure was evident form this study, the rate of PDA closure in our study was lower than has been observed in studies with serial plasma INDO level monitoring.",M2
15106982,"NMR spectroscopic characterization of copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of indomethacin.Molecular diffusion constants were studied by NMR spectroscopy to provide information about the solution structures of a variety of Cu(II) and Zn(II) monomeric and dimeric complexes of indomethacin (IndoH). These studies showed that monomeric Zn(II)-<e>Indo</e> complexes substantially dimerize in DMF-d7 and DMSO-d6 solutions at room temperature, whereas the Cu(II) and Zn(II) dinuclear complexes remain largely intact in these solutions. There is evidence of an equilibrium between monomers and dimers for the Zn(II) complexes in solution, as shown by a reduced diffusion constant and lower average radius compared to the Cu(II) dimer. Such an equilibrium between monomers and dimers for the Zn(II) complexes is also consistent with previous results obtained from XAFS analysis of DMF solutions of such complexes. The greater lability and lower thermodynamic stability of the Zn(II) dimer complex compared to the Cu(II) analogue, as determined from the NMR experiments, is likely to result in the more ready release of free Indo in the GI tract. This is consistent with the previously observed higher GI toxicities of the Zn-Indo pharmaceutical preparations compared to the Cu(II)-Indo counterparts.",M2
15086361,"Effects of endothelin-1 on portal-systemic collaterals of common bile duct-ligated cirrhotic rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) may induce intrahepatic vasoconstriction and consequently increase portal pressure. Endothelin-1 has been shown to exert a direct vasoconstrictive effect on the collateral vessels in partially portal vein-ligated rats with a high degree of portal-systemic shunting. This study investigated the collateral vascular responses to ET-1, the receptors in mediation and the regulation of ET-1 action by nitric oxide and prostaglandin in cirrhotic rats with a relatively low degree of portal-systemic shunting. METHODS: The portal-systemic collaterals of common bile duct-ligated (BDL) cirrhotic rats were tested by in situ perfusion. The concentration-response curves of collaterals to graded concentrations of ET-1 (10(-10)-10(-7) m) with or without BQ-123 (ET(A) receptor antagonist, 2 x 10(-6) m), BQ-788 (ET(B) receptor antagonist, 10(-7) m) or both were recorded. In addition, the collateral responses to ET-1 with preincubation of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (NNA, 10(-4) M), indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, 10(-5) M) or in combination were assessed. RESULTS: Endothelin-1 significantly increased the perfusion pressures of portal-systemic collaterals. The ET-1-induced constrictive effects were inhibited by BQ-123 or BQ-123 plus BQ-788 but not by BQ-788 alone. The inhibitory effect was greater in the combination group. Pretreatment of NNA or NNA plus INDO equivalently enhanced the response of ET-1 while pretreatment of INDO alone exerted no effect. CONCLUSION: Endothelin-1 has a direct vasoconstrictive effect on the collaterals of BDL cirrhotic rats, mainly mediated by ET(A) receptor. Endogenous nitric oxide may play an important role in modulating the effects of ET-1 in the portal-systemic collaterals of BDL cirrhotic rats.",M2
15060681,"Pharmacological modulation of TNF production in macrophages.The quantity and duration of production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is tightly controlled due to its potential to cause serious harm. For example, TNF release in response to overwhelming bacterial infection has been implicated as the first step in potentially lethal septic shock. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are thought to play opposing roles in regulating TNF production by monocytes and macrophages. We investigated the effects of 5 drugs on the production of TNF by cells of the murine macrophage line RAW264 after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS). These drugs were of the following 3 classes: cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (<e>indo</e>) and ibuprofen (ibu); 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors VZ 65 and AA-861; and methylxanthine pentoxyfilline (PTX). While indo and ibu treatment resulted in increased TNF production, PTX, VZ 65, and AA-861 significantly inhibited TNF production, whether administered simultaneously with LPS or 30 min after LPS treatment. VZ 65 and AA-861 also inhibited prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, coupled with an absence of any rise in intracellular cAMP. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels peaked at 15 min and approached background level at 30 min after LPS treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that VZ 65 and AA-861 may inhibit TNF production through mechanism(s) independent of LTB4 production. VZ 65, AA-861, and PTX all diminished the rate of TNF mRNA transcription, yet VZ 65 and AA-861 appeared to enhance message stability. We conclude that while PTX reduced TNF protein levels by inhibiting TNF mRNA transcription, both VZ 65 and AA-861 exerted opposing effects on TNF transcription and increased mRNA stability.",M2
15008823,"The effects of TNF-alpha and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism on human colon HT-29 cells depend on differentiation status.The level of differentiation could influence sensitivity of colonic epithelial cells to various stimuli. In our study, the effects of TNF-alpha, inhibitors of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism (baicalein, BA; indomethacin, <e>INDO</e>; niflumic acid, NA; nordihydroguaiaretic acid, NDGA), and/or their combinations on undifferentiated or sodium butyrate (NaBt)-differentiated human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells were compared. NaBt-treated cells became growth arrested (blocked in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle), and showed down-regulated Bcl-xL and up-regulated Bak proteins and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). These cells were more perceptive to anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha. Both inhibitors of LOX (BA and NDGA) and COX (INDO and NA) in higher concentrations modulated cell cycle changes accompanying NaBt-induced differentiation and induced various level of cell death in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Most important is our finding that TNF-alpha action on proliferation and cell death can be potentiated by co-treatment of cells with AA metabolism inhibitors, and that these effects were more significant in undifferentiated cells. TNF-alpha and INDO co-treatment was associated with accumulation of cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, increased reactive oxygen species production, and elevated caspase-3 activity. These results indicate the role of differentiation status in the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of TNF-alpha, AA metabolism inhibitors, and their combinations, and imply promising possibility for novel anti-cancer strategies.",M2
14767868,"Cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with downregulation of apolipoprotein AI promoter activity in cultured hepatoma cell line HepG2.Prostanoids have been implicated in the transcriptional control of several genes. Since prostanoid synthesis inhibitors are commonly used in subjects with coronary heart disease we studied the effect of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition on apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) expression in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) transfected with full-length apoAI promoter attached to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. To control for transfection efficiency, the cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pCMV.SPORT-beta-gal containing the beta-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Treatment of these cells with varying concentrations of indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, 0, 50, 100, and 300 micromol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in apoAI promoter activity (% acetylation corrected for beta-galactosidase activity: were 46.1 +/- 2.6, 29.9 +/- 1.2, 25.2 +/- 2.9, and 17.2 +/- 2.8, respectively, P &lt;.001). INDO treatment did not cause significant changes in beta-galactosidase activity. A similar reduction in apoAI promoter activity was found after treating the cells with 50 micromol/L acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (31.8 +/- 1.8%, P &lt;.001), suggesting that the effect of INDO is related to COX inhibition rather than a peculiar effect of INDO. Nuclear run-off assays indicated that treatment of cells with 50 micromol/L INDO resulted in 31.4% reduction in apo A1 transcription rate (P &lt;.0002). Northern blot analysis of RNA from HepG2 cells treated with 50 micromol/L of INDO for 72 hours showed that the apoAI mRNA concentration relative to G3PDH mRNA was 4,043.0 +/- 84.6 and 3,064.0 +/- 49.8 in control and INDO-treated cells, respectively (P &lt;.0006). Kinetic studies of apoAI mRNA in HepG2 cells indicated that the half-life of apoAI mRNA was not significantly altered with 50 micromol/L INDO treatment. Apo AI mRNA half-life was 25.3 hours in control cells and 26.9 hours in INDO-treated cells. Western blot analysis of culture media of HepG2 cells treated with 50 micromol/L of INDO for 72 hours showed a significant reduction in apoAI protein (6,760.0 +/- 318.1 v 4,773.0 +/- 112.0 arbitrary units, P &lt;.004). Treatment of cells with either arachidonic acid (COX substrate) or various prostanoids including prostaglandin I(2), thromboxane B(2), (+/-)5-HETE, or (+/-)12-HETE did not significantly alter apoAI promoter activity. However, prostaglandin E(1) and E(2) at the highest concentration tested (50 nmol/L) significantly repressed apoAI promoter activity. COX activity measurements in HepG2 cells verified the efficacy of COX inhibition by INDO. It is concluded that COX inhibition with INDO or ASA downregulates apoAI expression at the transcriptional level. This effect could not be attributed to either arachidonic acid excess or to a deficiency in various prostanoids tested.",M2
14679312,"Renal medullary infusion of indomethacin and adenosine. Effects on local blood flow, tissue ion content and renal excretion.Perfusion of the renal medulla and osmotic hypertonicity of its interstitium are the two important features of this zone which can influence body fluid homeostasis, especially arterial blood pressure. Separate manipulation of the two variables is best obtained with the intramedullary infusion of active agents. In this study, a set-up combining the possibility of infusion into the medulla with measurement of local blood flow (MBF, laser-Doppler flux) and extracellular ion concentration (tissue electrical admittance, Y) was used to determine effects of intramedullary indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) and adenosine (Ado) in anaesthetized rats. Intramedullary Indo, 1 mg kg(-1 )h(-1), significantly increased tissue Y, by 12 +/- 3%, and significantly decreased MBF by 20 +/- 3%. There was also an unexplained increase of sodium excretion (U(Na)V) by 169 +/- 24% and of urine flow (V) by 62 +/- 6% (n = 10, both p &lt; 0.03). Intramedullary Ado, 5 microg kg(-1) h(-1), did not alter Y, MBF or U(Na)V, whereas V increased 45 +/- 6% and urine osmolality decreased 25 +/- 4% (both changes significant). Elevation of medullary interstitial Ado to a level that did not alter MBF or U(Na)V induced a moderate defect of urine concentration that was not due to a decrease in ionic medullary hypertonicity.",M2
14670845,"Estrogen elicits cytochrome P450--mediated flow-induced dilation of arterioles in NO deficiency: role of PI3K-Akt phosphorylation in genomic regulation.This study investigated the mechanisms responsible for the estrogen-dependent, cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated dilator responses to shear stress in arterioles of NO-deficient female rats and mice. Flow-induced dilation (FID) was assessed in isolated arterioles from N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated male and ovariectomized female rats before and after overnight incubation with 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2, 10(-9) mol/L). In control conditions, prostaglandins (PGs) mediated FID, because indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) abolished the responses. After incubation of the vessels with 17beta-E2, the basal tone of arterioles was significantly reduced and FID was augmented. INDO did not affect the dilation of the vessels incubated with 17beta-E2. Dilations of these vessels, however, were eliminated by PPOH and miconazole, inhibitors of CYP/epoxygenase. Simultaneous incubation of the vessels with 17beta-E2 plus ICI, 182,780, an estrogen receptor antagonist, or wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation or the transcriptional inhibitor DRB, prevented the reduced arteriolar tone and the enhanced CYP-mediated FID caused by incubation of vessels with 17beta-E2. Western blot analysis indicated a significantly increased phospho-Akt level in arterioles incubated with 17beta-E2 compared with those without 17beta-E2. The enhanced phospho-Akt in response to 17beta-E2 was localized, by immunohistochemistry, to arteriolar endothelial cells. Moreover, GC-MS analysis indicated a significantly increased production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, vasodilator metabolites of CYP/epoxygenase, in arterioles incubated with 17beta-E2, a response that was prevented by ICI 182780 and wortmannin, respectively. Thus, estrogen, via a receptor-dependent, PI3K/Akt-mediated pathway, transcriptionally upregulates CYP activity, leading to an enhanced arteriolar response to shear stress.",M2
14658913,"XAFS studies of anti-inflammatory dinuclear and mononuclear Zn(II) complexes of indomethacin.Zinc K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experiments were performed in the solid and solution states at low temperature (10 K), on dimeric and monomeric anti-inflammatory Zn(II) complexes of indomethacin [1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetic acid=IndoH] of the formula [Zn2(<e>Indo</e>)4L2] [L=pyridine (Py), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA)], [Zn(Indo)2L2] [L=ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH)], and Zn(II) acetate dihydrate [Zn(OAc)2(OH2)2]. The bond distances and angles obtained from multiple-scattering fits to the XAFS data of the Zn(II) dimeric complexes in the solid and solution states exhibit excellent correspondence with those obtained from single crystal diffraction studies. The Zn...Zn separations of 2.97 and 2.96 A and carboxylate group O-C-O angles of 125 degrees for powdered [Zn2(Indo)4(Py)2] and [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2] agree well with the XRD values of 2.969(1) and 2.9686(6) A and 125.8(4) degrees and 126.1(2) degrees, respectively. The calculated Zn-O(RCOO) and Zn-L bond distances of 2.03 and 2.04 A, or 2.02 and 1.98 A for Py or DMA complexes, respectively, also agree well with crystallographic data. The X-ray powder diffraction data on samples of the monomers exhibited additional reflections apart from those due to the crystallographically characterized cis-[Zn(eta2-O,O'-Indo)2L2], but microanalyses were consistent with this formulation. Therefore, mixed models that contained the cis complex and a second component consisting of a trans-six-coordinate complex, a five-coordinate complex, or a four-coordinate complex were used to model the XAFS. The best fits to the XAFS data were obtained with a mixture of the cis-six-coordinate complex and a four-coordinate complex containing two monodentate Indo ligands. The bond lengths for the six-coordinate structure were consistent with those determined on a single crystal, and those for the four-coordinate complexes were consistent with related four-coordinate structures with two monodentate carboxylate ligands. Dissolution of the dimer (DMA adduct) in DMF resulted in a mixture of dimer and monomer species as shown by MS XAFS fitting. This is the first time that solution structures have been determined for anti-inflammatory Zn(II) complexes, and this is an important first step in understanding the pharmacology of the complexes.",M2
14656710,"Linoleic acid induces interleukin-8 production by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle cells via arachidonic acid metabolites.Previously we reported that linoleic acid (LA), but not oleic acid, caused a marked increase in the secretion of IL-8 by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells. Antioxidants inhibited this response, implicating a role for oxidative stress and NF-kappaB, a transcription factor for IL-8 that is activated by oxidative stress. In this study, we examined two mechanisms whereby LA, the dietary precursor for arachidonic acid (AA), could increase the production of IL-8 via activation of AA pathways: 1) by generation of reactive oxygen species by the AA-pathway enzymes to activate NF-kappaB or 2) by AA metabolites. Normal and Crohn's HISM cells were exposed to LA, oxidizing solution (Ox), or oxidizing solution enriched with LA (OxLA). Exposure of cells to Ox or OxLA induced oxidative stress as determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In normal cells, Ox but not LA activated NF-kappaB as determined by transfection experiments and Western blot. In Crohn's cells, NF-kappaB was spontaneously activated and was not further activated by Ox or LA. In contrast, TNF-alpha markedly increased activation of NF-kappaB in both normal and Crohn's cells. These results indicated that LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, so we evaluated the second mechanism of an effect of AA metabolites. In normal cells, OxLA, but not LA, markedly stimulated IL-8, whereas in Crohn's cells, both OxLA and LA stimulated IL-8. OxLA, also stimulated production of AA metabolites leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) by normal and Crohn's cells. To determine whether AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response, cells were treated with OxLA plus indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both Indo and NDGA blocked the IL-8 response to OxLA. To determine more specifically a role for AA metabolites, AA was used. Similar to OxLA, OxAA stimulated production of IL-8 and AA metabolites. Pinane thromboxane, a selective thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor blocker, inhibited OxAA stimulation of TXB(2) and IL-8 in a dose-response manner. MK886, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited OxAA stimulation of LTB(4) and IL-8 also in a dose-response manner. Analysis of specific gene products by RT-PCR demonstrated that HISM cells expressed receptors for both thromboxane and LTB(4). We conclude that AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response to LA in HISM cells. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways were involved. LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, but NF-kappaB appeared to be involved, because LA increased IL-8 only in situations where NF-kappaB was activated, either spontaneously in Crohn's cells or by Ox in normal cells. We speculate that AA metabolites increased IL-8 production by enhancing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of IL-8.",M2
14643181,"Involvement of eicosanoids in the hypothermic response to lipopolysaccharide during endotoxemia in rats.Hypothermia is one of the prominent features of the acute phase response to endotoxin (LPS). This study was undertaken to elucidate the effects of the COX-inhibitor Indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) and the selective FLAP inhibitor MK-886 on LPS-induced hypothermia, mortality and increase in production of hypothalamic prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene during endotoxemia. It has been demonstrated that INDO and MK-886 significantly attenuate the hypothermia induced by LPS, but MK-886 has a lesser (protective) effect than INDO. Only INDO was found to attenuate significantly the hyperthermic response to LPS. Furthermore, INDO significantly reduced the elevation in hypothalamic PGE(2) levels. MK-886 significantly reduced the elevation in hypothalamic leukotriene production only when LPS was given in a dose of 1mg/kg. Both drugs failed to reduce the elevation in plasma TNF-alpha and mortality induced by LPS. We conclude that in rats, febrile response to endotoxin involves many inflammatory mediators. However, it seems that PGE(2) and leukotrienes do not have a pivotal role in the mechanism of LPS-induced mortality.",M2
14623032,"Cyclooxygenase pathway is involved in the vascular reactivity and inhibition of the Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the tail artery from L-NAME-treated rats.L-NAME (LN) induces hypertension by blocking nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. It produces vascular hyperreactivity to phenylephrine (PHE) associated with a reduced vascular Na+, K+-ATPase activity. The aim of this work was to investigate whether products of the cyclooxygenase pathway are involved in alterations of vascular reactivity and Na+-pump activity in the tail artery from LN-induced hypertension rats. Four groups of rats were used: Control (CT, normotensive), LN (50 mg/kg/day, hypertensive), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>-4 mg/kg/day, normotensive), and LN plus Indo (LN + Indo, partially prevented hypertension). All drugs were administered in drinking water during 7 days. In isolated rat tail vascular beds; the reactivity to PHE, acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the functional activity of the Na+, K+-ATPase (K+-induced relaxation) and the modulation of PHE-induced vasoconstriction by constitutively available NO were evaluated. LN increased vascular sensitivity (pD2) and reactivity (Emax) to PHE and Indo blocked the effect of LN on Emax without changing pD2. Emax and pD2 values for ACh were reduced by LN and partially reverted by Indo. SNP-induced vasodilatation was similar in all groups. LN reduced the activity of Na+, K+-ATPase and Indo prevented LN effects. LN also abolished NO ability to modulate PHE-induced contractions. This effect was partially prevented by Indo suggesting that products from the cyclooxygenase pathway might reduce NO actions. Indo itself did not affect vascular reactivity to PHE, ACh or SNP or the Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Results suggested that products from cyclooxygenase pathway are involved in the genesis or maintenance of LN-induced hypertension, playing a role in the increased vascular reactivity, in the reduction of the endothelium-dependent relaxation and in the inhibition of the functional activity of the Na+, K+-ATPase.",M2
14606964,"Role of prostaglandin E2 and indomethacin in the febrile response of pigeons.Intravenous (i.v.) injection of 10 microg/kg Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), applied at 13:00, evoked in pigeons a biphasic rise of core temperature (T(core)), so that LPS induced with a latency of 30 min first a decrease of T(core), and 90 min after LPS, T(core) increased, obtaining maximum values from 18:00 to 20:00. Prostaglandins have been considered to be importantly involved in fevers in mammals. To investigate an involvement of prostaglandins in the cyclic variations of T(core) in birds, pigeons were injected i.v. with either 10 mg/kg indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) or 100 mg/kg aspirin, or they were treated with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 100 microg/kg INDO at various times before or after LPS. When INDO or aspirin was i.v. injected 30 or 15 min before LPS, it diminished the initial decrease of T(core) by more than 50%, whereas the i.v. injection of these drugs 2 and 4 h after LPS did not affect the febrile rise of T(core). i.c.v. injections of INDO given either before or after LPS neither influenced the initial drop of T(core) nor the following febrile hyperthermia. Both the i.v. injection of 1 mg/kg prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and the i.c.v. injection of 1 microg/kg PGE(2) lowered T(core). Our observations suggest that prostaglandins are not involved in the febrile elevation of T(core) in pigeons, but appear to participate in the decrease of T(core), which shortly follows the i.v. injection of LPS. This initial drop of T(core) following LPS may be caused by a peripheral action of prostaglandins because it was not influenced by the i.c.v. injection of indomethacin.",M2
14597598,"Catalase has negligible inhibitory effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations in mouse isolated aorta and small mesenteric artery.1. The current study examined the hypothesis that endothelial production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mediates relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) in aorta and small mesenteric arteries (SMA) from mice. 2. Relaxations to ACh (0.01-10 microM) and H2O2 (0.1-1000 microM) were produced in aorta and SMA isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and type II diabetic mice (db/db). In SMA, relaxations to ACh were produced in the presence of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 microM) and indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>, 10 microM). 3. 1-H[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-]quinoxalin-1-one (10 microM) significantly reduced ACh-induced relaxations in SMA, abolished responses in aorta, but had no effect on relaxations induced by H2O2. Catalase (2500 U ml-1) abolished responses to H2O2, but did not alter relaxations to ACh in the SMA and only caused a small rightward shift in responses to ACh in the aorta. 4. ACh-, but not H2O2-, mediated relaxations were significantly reduced by tetraethylammonium (10 mM), the combination of apamin (1 microM) and charybdotoxin (100 nM), and 25 mm potassium chloride (KCl). Higher KCl (60 mM) abolished relaxations to both ACh and H2O2. Polyethylene glycolated superoxide dismutase (100 U ml-1), the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT, 50 mM) and treatment with the copper chelator diethyldithiolcarbamate (3 mM) did not affect relaxations to ACh. 5. H2O2-induced relaxations were endothelium-independent and were not affected by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA 0.067 mM), 4-aminopyridine (1 mM), ouabain (100 microM) and barium (30 microM), 3-AT or Indo. 6. Although the data from this study show that H2O2 dilates vessels, they do not support the notion that H2O2 mediates endothelium-dependent relaxations to ACh in either aorta or SMA from mice.",M2
14583658,"Relative roles of nitric oxide, prostanoids and angiotensin II in the regulation of canine glomerular hemodynamics. A micropuncture study.Glomerular hemodynamics are controlled by a variety of physical, nervous and hormonal factors including the potent vasoconstrictors, angiotensin (ANG) II and endothelin-1 (ET-1), and the vasodilator prostanoids (prostaglandin = PG) and nitric oxide (NO). Since no micropuncture data on the canine kidney exist with respect to the relative roles of the endogenous vasoactive hormones/autacoids NO, PG and ANG II in modulating glomerular hemodynamics, in the present study using the micropuncture technique in anesthetized dogs on a normal salt intake, we investigated the relative effects of these hormones/autacoids by means of the L-arginine analog, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), a competitive NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), and the AT(1) receptor blocker EXP 3174. An intrarenal arterial (i.r.a.) bolus (within 5 min) of 2.5 mg of L-NAME led to a significant decrease in total renal blood flow (RBF) and single nephron glomerular blood flow (SNGBF) from 4.46 +/- 0.51 to 3.52 +/- 0.41 ml/min/g kidney weight and from 0.393 +/- 0.041 to 0.341 +/- 0.037 microl/min (p &lt; 0.01), respectively, without a change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The increase in arteriolar resistance was more pronounced at the efferent (+31%) than at the afferent (+13%) arteriole, and K(f) decreased from 4.5 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 nl/min/mm Hg (p &lt; 0.01). INDO (5 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 0.17 mg/kg/min i.v.) had no effect on glomerular hemodynamics. EXP 3174 (30 microg/kg/min i.r.a.) increased RBF and SNGBF from 4.35 +/- 0.45 to 4.99 +/- 0.50 ml/min/g kidney weight and from 0.403 +/- 0.028 to 0.478 +/- 0.039 microl/min (p &lt; 0.01), respectively, without an effect on GFR. It reduced the efferent arteriolar resistance by 25% as compared to 13% at the afferent arteriolar level. EXP 3174 increased K(f) from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 8.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.01) in the presence of a decrease in effective filtration pressure from 13.2 +/- 1.7 to 8.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.01). The glomerular hemodynamic effects of L-NAME were unaltered by pretreatment with INDO or EXP 3174, whereas its tubular effects were restored in the presence of EXP 3174. Thus, from these first micropuncture data in the anesthetized dog on a normal sodium intake we conclude that (1) acute intrarenal inhibition of NOS by L-NAME decreases RBF and SNGBF due to vasoconstriction of the afferent and, more pronounced, efferent arterioles. Since L-NAME simultaneously decreases K(f), GFR remains unaltered. (2) These renal hemodynamic effects of NOS inhibition were not mediated by prostanoids or intrarenal ANG II. Thus, the tonic activity of intrarenal NOS plays an important role in maintaining glomerular hemodynamics in the canine kidney.",M2
14502371,"Decreased gastric tone and delayed gastric emptying precede neutrophil infiltration and mucosal lesion formation in indomethacin-induced gastric damage in rats.Gastric antral dysmotility has been implicated in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced gastric damage, but the relationship between gastric motor abnormalities and mucosal lesions has not been extensively studied. We investigated whether changes in gastric tone and gastric retention correlate with mucosal lesions and neutrophil migration in indomethacin-induced gastric damage in rats. Indomethacin, either 5 or 20 mg/kg (<e>INDO</e>-5 and INDO-20), was instilled into the stomach, and then gastric damage, neutrophil migration, gastric tone and gastric retention were assessed 1 or 3 h later. Gastric damage was calculated as the sum of the lengths of all mucosal lesions, and neutrophil migration was measured by assaying myeloperoxidase activity. Gastric tone was determined by a plethysmometric method, and gastric retention of either saline or Sustacal was evaluated by a scintigraphic method. Gastric damage was detectable 3 h after either INDO-5 or INDO-20, but not after 1 h. Neutrophil migration was significantly higher 3 h after INDO-20 as compared with INDO-5 or control group, but not after 1 h. Values of gastric tone 1 and 3 h after either INDO-5 (1 h = 1.73+/-0.07 ml; 3 h = 1.87+/-0.03 ml) or INDO-20 (1 h = 1.70+/-0.02 ml; 3 h = 1.79+/-0.03 ml) were significantly lower than in controls (1 h = 1.48+/-0.05 ml; 3 h = 1.60+/-0.06 ml). Gastric retention of saline was higher 1 h after INDO-5 (58.9+/-3.3%) or INDO-20 (56.1+/-3.1%) compared to control (45.5+/-1.7%), but not after 3 h. There were no differences concerning gastric retention of Sustacal between the various groups. Indomethacin induced decreased gastric tone and delayed gastric emptying, which precede mucosal lesion and neutrophil infiltration. These results indicate that there is no relationship between these gastric motor abnormalities and mucosal lesion in indomethacin-induced gastropathy.",M2
14500777,"Glutamate-mediated cytosolic calcium oscillations regulate a pulsatile prostaglandin release from cultured rat astrocytes.The synaptic release of glutamate evokes in astrocytes periodic increases in [Ca2+]i, due to the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The frequency of these [Ca2+]i oscillations is controlled by the level of neuronal activity, indicating that they represent a specific, frequency-coded signalling system of neuron-to-astrocyte communication. We recently found that neuronal activity-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations in astrocytes are the main signal that regulates the coupling between neuronal activity and blood flow, the so-called functional hyperaemia. Prostaglandins play a major role in this fundamental phenomenon in brain function, but little is known about a possible link between [Ca2+]i oscillations and prostaglandin release from astrocytes. To investigate whether [Ca2+]i oscillations regulate the release of vasoactive prostaglandins, such as the potent vasodilator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), from astrocytes, we plated wild-type human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells, which respond constitutively to PGE2 with [Ca2+]i elevations, onto cultured astrocytes, and used them as biosensors of prostaglandin release. After loading the astrocyte-HEK cell co-cultures with the calcium indicator <e>Indo</e>-1, confocal microscopy revealed that mGluR-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations triggered spatially and temporally coordinated [Ca2+]i increases in the sensor cells. This response was absent in a clone of HEK cells that are unresponsive to PGE2, and recovered after transfection with the InsP3-linked prostanoid receptor EP1. We conclude that [Ca2+]i oscillations in astrocytes regulate prostaglandin releases that retain the oscillatory behaviour of the [Ca2+]i changes. This finely tuned release of PGE2 from astrocytes provides a coherent mechanistic background for the role of these glial cells in functional hyperaemia.",M2
12964309,"Choline phospholipid metabolites of human vascular endothelial cells altered by cyclooxygenase inhibition, growth factor depletion, and paracrine factors secreted by cancer cells.Magnetic resonance studies have previously shown that solid tumors and cancer cells in culture typically exhibit high phosphocholine and total choline. Treatment of cancer cells with the anti-inflammatory agent, indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>), reverted the phenotype of choline phospholipid metabolites in cancer cells towards a less malignant phenotype. Since endothelial cells form a key component of tumor vasculature, in this study, we used MR spectroscopy to characterize the phenotype of choline phospholipid metabolites in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We determined the effect of growth factors, the anti-inflammatory agent INDO, and conditioned media obtained from a malignant cell line, on choline phospholipid metabolites. Growth factor depletion or treatment with INDO induced similar changes in the choline phospholipid metabolites of HUVECs. Treatment with conditioned medium obtained from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells induced changes similar to the presence of growth factor supplements. These results suggest that cancer cells secrete growth factors and/or other molecules that influence the choline phospholipid metabolism of HUVECs. The ability of INDO to alter choline phospholipid metabolism in the presence of growth factor supplements suggests that the inflammatory response pathways of HUVECs may play a role in cancer cell-HUVEC interaction and in the response of HUVECs to growth factors.",M2
12897037,"Selected Contribution: Aging impairs nitric oxide and prostacyclin mediation of endothelium-dependent dilation in soleus feed arteries.We tested the hypothesis that endothelium-dependent dilation in soleus muscle feed arteries (SFA) is impaired by aging due to attenuated nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation. SFA were isolated from young (4 mo) and old (24 mo) male Fischer 344 rats and cannulated with two glass micropipettes for examination of endothelium-dependent [flow or acetylcholine (ACh)] and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] vasodilator function. Flow- and ACh-induced dilation was significantly attenuated by age, whereas dilation to SNP was not compromised. To determine the mechanism(s) by which aging affected dilator responses to flow and ACh, dilation was assessed in the presence of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; to inhibit NO synthase), indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; to inhibit cyclooxygenase), and L-NNA + Indo. In the presence of L-NNA, Indo, or L-NNA + Indo, flow-induced dilation was inhibited in young SFA, resulting in a response to flow that was no longer greater than old SFA. In the presence of L-NNA or Indo, ACh-induced dilation was not significantly inhibited in young or old SFA; however, double blockade with L-NNA + Indo inhibited ACh-induced dilation in young SFA such that the response to ACh was no longer greater than old SFA. Collectively, these data indicate that aging impairs vasodilator responses in SFA by attenuating NO- and prostacyclin-mediated, endothelium-dependent, dilation.",M2
12866938,"Application of dense gas techniques for the production of fine particles.The feasibility of using dense gas techniques such as rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) and aerosol solvent extraction system (ASES) for micronization of pharmaceutical compounds is demonstrated. The chiral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory racemic ibuprofen is soluble in carbon dioxide at 35 degrees C and pressures above 90 bar. The particle size decreased to less than 2 microm while the degree of crystallinity was slightly decreased when processed by RESS. The dissolution rate of the ibuprofen (a poorly water-soluble compound) was significantly enhanced after processing by RESS. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Cu2(indomethacin)4L2(Cu-<e>Indo</e>); (L = dimethylformamide [DMF]), which possessed very low solubility in supercritical CO2, was successfully micronized by ASES at 25 degrees C and 68.9 bar using DMF as the solvent and CO2 as the antisolvent. The concentration of solute dramatically influenced the precipitate characteristics. The particles obtained from the ASES process were changed from bipyramidal to spherical, with particle size less than 5 microm, as the concentration increased from 5 to 100 mg/g. A further increase in solute concentration to 200 mg/g resulted in large porous spheres, between 20 and 50 micron, when processing Cu-Indo by the ASES method. The dissolution rate of the micronized Cu-Indo was significantly higher than the commercial product.",M2

Secretion of PGE2 and PGF2alpha increased with time in culture (P &lt; or = 0.05). PGE2 and PGE2 + PA increased (P &lt; or = 0.05) secretion of progesterone at 4 and 8 h, progesterone secretion was increased (P &lt; or = 0.05) at 4 h; but not at 8 h (P &gt; or = 0.05) by trilostane, mifepristone, PGF2alpha and PGF2alpha + PA, and was decreased at 8 h by PGF2alpha and PGF2alpha + PA. Indomethacin decreased (P &lt; or = 0.05) secretion of PGE2, PGF2alpha, and progesterone at 4 and 8 h. Trilostane, PA, PGF2alpha, RU-486 and PGF2alpha + PA increased (P &lt; or = 0.05) PGE2 at 4 h only. Palmitic acid decreased (P &lt; or = 0.05) PGF2alpha at 4 h, while trilostane, RU-486, or MER-25 did not affect (P &lt; or = 0.05) PGE2 of PGF2alpha secretion. It is concluded that PGE2 of luteal tissue origin is the luteotropin at mid-pregnancy in cows. Also, it is suggested that PA may alter progesterone secretion by affecting the inter conversion of PGE2 and PGF2alpha.",M2
12693028,"Gastrointestinal toxicity, antiinflammatory activity, and superoxide dismutase activity of copper and zinc complexes of the antiinflammatory drug indomethacin.Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is one of the major problems associated with antiinflammatory drugs. The complexation of the powerful antiinflammatory drug (IndoH) by metal ions, as a means of reducing GI toxicity, has been studied. The in vitro superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, in vivo antiinflammatory activity, and gastrointestinal ulcerogenic properties of IndoH, [Cu2(<e>Indo</e>)4(DMF)2], and [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2] are reported. No SOD activity was observed for IndoH or [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2], but [Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] inhibited the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) at an IC50 value of 0.23 microM. All three compounds exhibited antiinflammatory activity in male Sprague-Dawley rats at an equivalent Indo dose of 10 mg/kg following oral administration of the drugs in 2% CMC solution. The severity of the toxicity (macroscopic ulcerations) in the stomach following oral dosing with [Zn2(Indo)4(DMF)2] was not significantly lower than that induced by IndoH (P = 0.78). Gastric ulcerations induced by [Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] were significantly lower than those induced by IndoH or [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2] (P = 0.0012 and P = 0.0175, respectively) but significantly greater than the control (P = 0.0013). The intestinal ulcerations induced by [Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] or [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2] were approximately 15 times lower than those of IndoH. A further indicator of gastrointestinal toxicity, caecal haemoglobin, increased in the following order: control &lt; [Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] &lt; [Zn2(Indo)4(DMA)2] &lt; IndoH.[Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] exhibited the most promising results of the Indo complexes assayed, in that it exhibited SOD activity and the lowest gastrointestinal damage while also exhibiting antiinflammatory activity that was comparable to that for IndoH. Low-temperature EPR analyses also showed that the formulation used for [Cu2(Indo)4(DMF)2] administration was crucial to the integrity of the complex.",M2
12640010,"Prostaglandins but not nitric oxide protect renal medullary perfusion in anaesthetised rats receiving angiotensin II.Angiotensin II (Ang II) fails to constrict renal medullary vasculature, possibly due to the counteraction of local vasodilators, such as prostaglandins or nitric oxide (NO). The effects of exogenous Ang II on intrarenal circulation were determined in anaesthetised rats that were untreated or pretreated with indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) or L-NAME. The total renal blood flow (RBF), representing cortical perfusion, and outer and inner medullary blood flow (OMBF and IMBF) were measured. In untreated rats, Ang II decreased RBF in a dose dependent manner. Intravenous administration of 30 ng kg-1 min-1 Ang II decreased RBF by 38 % and OMBF by 9 % (both significant); IMBF was unaffected. Indo (5 mg kg-1 I.V.) significantly and similarly decreased OMBF and IMBF without affecting RBF. Ang II decreased IMBF by 27 % in Indo-pretreated rats, but caused no change in rats without pretreatment. The decreases in OMBF and RBF were comparable with or without Indo pretreatment. Inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NAME (0.6 mg kg-1 I.V.) significantly decreased RBF, OMBF and IMBF. Ang II infusion into L-NAME-pretreated rats induced a further significant decrease in RBF and OMBF without changing IMBF. We conclude that within the inner medulla, but not the outer medulla or cortex, prostaglandins effectively counteract the vasopressor effect of circulating Ang II.",M2
12558194,"Effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib in rat acute models of inflammation.OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the action of celecoxib and rofecoxib, two selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in two acute models of inflammation, carrageenan (Cg)-induced rat pleurisy, and paw oedema formation. MATERIAL: Male Wistar rats (N = 4-10 per group) were used. A fixed volume of PBS or carrageenan was injected into the pleural cavity or into the paw. Furthermore, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and PGE2 were also assessed in the paw tissue or in pleural exudate. RESULTS: Dexamethasone (DEX, 0.5 mg kg(-1), s.c., -4 h) and indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, 3 mg kg(-1), p.o., -1 h) suppressed Cg-induced pleural exudate accumulation by 84 and 77% and inflammatory cell influx by 66 and 47%, respectively. In contrast, celecoxib (CLX, 10 mg kg(-1), p.o., -1 h) or rofecoxib (RFX, 10 mg kg(-1) , p.o., -1 h) only reduced the Cg-induced pleural exudate volume by 44 and 40%, respectively, but had no significant effect over inflammatory cell influx. At the same doses used for pleurisy, DEX, INDO, CLX, RFX and SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor, 40 mg kg(-1), p.o., -1 h), inhibited the Cg-induced paw oedema by 49, 31, 21, 21 and 17%. DEX, INDO or SC-560 reduced the level of MPO by 71, 78 and 59%, while CLX or RFX produced a small, but significant increase (28 or 16%) in MPO activity. In the rat model of pleurisy, PGE2 levels in cell-free exudates were significantly attenuated by 91, 89, 57 and 65% in animals treated with DEX, INDO, CLX or RFX. In contrast, INDO reduced significantly the whole bloodTXB, synthesis (59%) while DEX and INDO reduced the pleural content of NOx significantly. Treatment of animals with CLX or RFX did not alter the content of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta or TNF-alpha in the pleural exudate, but CLX reduced IL-1beta levels in the rat paw tissue and RFX increased TNF-alpha in this tissue. CONCLUSION: Together these results provide consistent evidence indicating that the selective COX-2 inhibitors CLX and RFX, in contrast to DEX, INDO or SC-560, despite reducing greatly the Cg-induced pleural exudation, PGE2 content and paw oedema have only partial acute anti-inflammatory properties in two different rat acute models of inflammation.",M2
12517972,"Cyclooxygenase-2 expression by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in human airway smooth muscle cells: role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to modulate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression, but the mechanisms involved are controversial and may be cell specific. We show in this study that indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), flurbiprofen (Flur), and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 induced COX-2 expression and markedly enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. These effects were not reversed by exogenous PGE(2), suggesting that they are prostanoid-independent. Indeed, PGE(2) also induced and enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and PPARgamma (not PPARbeta) were expressed in HASM cells. PPARgamma activators ciglitizone (Cig) and 15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), but not the PPARalpha activator WY-14643, mimicked the effect of NSAIDs on COX-2 expression. Treatment with Flur, NS-398, Cig, and 15d-PGJ(2) alone, but not Indo and WY-14643, elevated COX activity; however, neither enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX activity. Pretreatment with dexamethasone suppressed COX-2 expression, PGE(2) release, and COX activity induced by NS-398, Cig, IL-1beta, alone or in combination. Unlike IL-1beta, NS-398 and Cig did not cause NF-kappaB (p65) nuclear translocation, nor did they further enhance IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB translocation, but they stimulated PPARgamma translocation. Indo, NS-398, Flur, and 15d-PGJ(2), but not WY-14643, induced transcriptional activity of a COX-2 reporter construct containing the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) on their own and enhanced the effect of IL-1beta, but had no effect on a COX-2 reporter construct lacking the PPRE. The results suggest that COX-2 expression by NSAIDs is biologically functional, prostanoid-independent, and involves PPARgamma activation, and provide the first direct evidence that the PPRE in the promoter is required for NSAID-induced COX-2 expression.",M2
12504830,"NO contributes to EDHF-like responses in rat small arteries: a role for NO stores.OBJECTIVES: Responses to EDHF are usually characterised in the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. The contribution of NO to endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of NOS inhibitors was assessed using NO scavengers with the objective of testing (i) whether any residual NO produces endothelium-dependent relaxation in a manner similar to EDHF and (ii) to identify the source of the residual NO. METHODS: Small rat hepatic and mesenteric arteries were mounted in a tension myograph for either isometric or membrane potential measurements. RESULTS: Relaxation to ACh was unaffected by pre-treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 300 microM), and indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>, 5 microM) in the absence or presence of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 1 microM), nitro-L-arginine (300 microM) or L-nitro-mono-methyl-arginine (L-NMMA, 300 microM). Addition of OxyHb (20 microM) or carboxy-PTIO (300 microM) produced a significant suppression of ACh-induced relaxations ( approximately 40%). In L-NAME+Indo treated arteries ACh-induced hyperpolarisation (delta16.3+/-2.1 mV, n=8) was significantly suppressed with the addition of OxyHb (Delta10.2+/-1.6 mV, n=12). ACh-induced relaxation, in the presence of L-NAME+Indo+OxyHb, was abolished by raised extracellular K(+), or the combination of charybdotoxin (CTX, 100 nM)+apamin (100 nM). In contrast whilst L-NAME+indo+barium+ouabain suppressed ACh-induced relaxation, the presence of OxyHb had no additional effect. Ultraviolet light induced a relaxation in arteries treated with L-NMMA+Indo (37.0+/-5.2%, n=9) which was sensitive to OxyHb (15.2+/-10.9%, n=4), and barium+ouabain (6.39+/-2.7%, n=4), but not CTX+apamin (37.8+/-2.4%, n=4). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that NO contributes significantly to the  EDHF-like  response seen in rat small arteries and that the source of this NO may be preformed vascular stores.",M2
12492783,"Role of prostaglandin cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P450 pathways in the mechanism of natriuresis which follows hypertonic saline infusion in the rat.AIM: The prostaglandin cyclooxygenase (COX) and P450 cytochrome (CYP450) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism are functionally interrelated and both engaged in control of sodium excretion; the study focused on their contribution to the natriuresis which follows hypertonic saline infusion in the rat. METHODS: In anaesthetized rats, clearance studies were conducted, supplemented with laser-Doppler measurements of the cortical and medullary blood flow (CBF, MBF), and measurement of medullary tissue admittance (Y), an index of interstitial ion concentration. RESULTS: Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), 5 mg kg(-1) i.v. paradoxically enhanced the natriuresis secondary to intra-aortic suprarenal 5% saline load, further increasing sodium excretion by 385 +/- 73% (P &lt; 0.01). After acute clotrimazole, 10 mg kg(-1) i.v. an inhibitor of CYP450 epoxygenase, the increase in natriuresis was smaller and did not differ from that observed after the drug's ethanol solvent. In rats pre-treated with clotrimazole for 3 days, hypertonic saline loading increased sodium excretion (U(Na)V) to 0.94 +/- 0.22 micromol min(-1) , compared with a significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) increase to 2.76 +/- 0.48 micromol min(-1) measured in untreated controls. Indo increased U(Na)V twofold, similarly in the clotrimazole and in the control group; in the absence or presence of clotrimazole treatment, COX blockade significantly decreased MBF and increased Y. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that blockade of the CYP450 epoxygenase significantly impairs excretion of sodium in rats acutely loaded with hypertonic NaCl solution. The paradoxical post-Indo natriuresis is preserved in clotrimazole treated rats, which speaks against the role of CYP450 pathway in the response.",M2
12470204,"Effect of liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine and indomethacin on hematopoietic recovery in irradiated mice.The effects of liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE/MLV, radioprotective immunomodulator; 10 mg/kg) and indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>, inhibitor of prostaglandin production; 2 mg/kg) on post-irradiation recovery of hematopoietic functions in mice were investigated. Two agents with distinct radioprotective mechanisms were administered alone or in combination 24 h and 3 h before exposure to 7 Gy (60)Co radiation. In the post-irradiation period (3-14 days) combined pre-treatment of mice accelerated recovery of bone marrow cellularity, weight of spleen and myelopoietic and erythropoietic activity in both hematopoietic organs, compared to treatment with MTP-PE/MLV or indomethacin alone. In the peripheral blood, improved radioprotective effects of combined drug administration were found in the recovery of reticulocytes and platelet count. No further significant differences in the recovery of leukocyte count were observed in the examined groups until post-irradiation day 14. Within the first 3-6 post-irradiation days, the bone marrow and peripheral blood smears of mice pre-treated with indomethacin alone or its combination with MTP-PE/MLV more frequently featured blast cells and large cells with abundant cytoplasm which could be considered the hematopoietic stem cells.",M2
12384486,"Sexual dimorphism in prostanoid-potentiated vascular contraction: roles of endothelium and ovarian steroids.The effects of constrictor prostanoid (CP) pathway inhibitors on vascular reactivity to vasopressin (VP) and phenylephrine (PE) were examined in thoracic aortas of male, female, and ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague-Dawley rats. Maximal contractile response of control (Cont) aortas to VP was markedly higher in females (3,885 +/- 332 mg/mg ring wt) than in males (810 +/- 148 mg). Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; 10 microM) attenuated maximal response to VP in females (3,043 +/- 277 mg) but not in males. SQ-29,548 (SQ; 1 microM) attenuated maximal response to VP in females (3,042 +/- 290 mg) to a similar extent as Indo. Dazoxiben (Daz; 10 microM) alone had no effect, but Daz + SQ attenuated maximal contractile response to VP to a similar extent as SQ alone. Removal of the endothelium in female aortas attenuated contractile responses to VP in Cont aortas. OVX attenuated maximal contractile response to VP in Cont aortas (2,093 +/- 329 mg) and abolished the attenuating effects of Indo. Indo, SQ, and Daz exerted identical effects on contractile responses of male, female, and OVX female aortas to PE. These findings establish the following in the rat aorta: 1) CP, probably thromboxane and/or endoperoxide, is responsible for approximately 25-30% of contractile responses of females, but not males, to VP and PE; 2) CP production by the female aorta is primarily endothelial in origin; and 3) ovarian steroids modulate production and/or actions of CP in female aortas.",M2
12193539,"Cyclooxygenase 2 pathway mediates IL-1beta regulation of IL-1alpha, -1beta, and IL-6 mRNA levels in Leydig cell progenitors.Prostanoids are arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites derived from the cyclooxygenase (COX1 and COX2 isozymes) pathway and are involved in signal transduction pathways activated by distinct ILs. Although COX1 is the constitutive isoform of COX, IL-1beta is a potent inducer of COX2 expression in distinct cell types. This study was designed to determine whether cyclooxygenases could mediate endogenous cytokine regulation in rat progenitor Leydig cells. COX and IL (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) mRNAs were measured by PCR and real-time PCR analyses, respectively. COX function was assessed using COX activity inhibitors: indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>; COX1 and COX2 inhibitor) and NS-398 (COX2 selective inhibitor). Our data indicate that endogenous progenitor COX1 mRNA levels are low and are not regulated by IL-1beta. In contrast, COX2 mRNA is induced by IL-1beta at 6, 9, and 24 h. IL-1beta induction of IL mRNAs was in part significantly impaired in the presence of INDO or NS-398. Among the prostanoids tested, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), PGF(2alpha), and carbaprostacyclin reversed the INDO inhibition of IL production. PGs alone have no (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta) or a modest (IL-6) effect on IL mRNA levels. PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and PGI(2) measurements show that IL-1beta treatment significantly increases progenitor Leydig cell production of these PGs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this COX2 cascade is a regulator of cytokines in Leydig progenitors.",M2
12190125,"Comparison of the antisecretory and antiulcer activity of epidermal growth factor, urogastrone and transforming growth factor alpha and its derivative in rodents in vivo.This study investigates the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF), urogastrone (UG) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) and its derivative on dimaprit- and pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion and on acidified ethanol (AE)-evoked ulcer formation in anaesthetized rats. EGF, TGFalpha and UG administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 30 min before dimaprit inhibited gastric acid secretion. Against pentagastrin-stimulated secretion, TGFalpha inhibited, while EGF and UG potentiated, acid secretion dose-dependently. Intraduodenal (i.d.) administration of TGFalpha and UG had no effect, while EGF potentiated, both secretagogue-induced acid secretion in the same dosage schedule. Administration of either EGF, UG or TGFalpha i.v. bolus, in response to continuous infusion of dimaprit resulted in a significant (p &lt; 0.05-p &lt; 0.001) inhibition of acid secretion which was transient and returned to normal within 30-45 min for UG while it slowly returned to normal for EGF and TGFalpha. The truncated form of TGFa (amino acids 34-43) did not show any antisecretory effect when administered parenterally. Acidified ethanol produced gastric haemorrhagic lesions in the rat 1 h after oral administration. The gastric mucosal protective effects of TGFalpha, EGF and UG administered either orally or s.c. 30 min before the administration of AE were dose-dependent against this model of ulcer induction. Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>), administered 15 min before AE to inhibit prostanoids biosynthesis, significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced the cytoprotective effects of TGFalpha, EGF and UG and aggravated the ulcer index when administered s.c. The results show that PGs may be involved in mediating the protective effects of the three growth factors. Administration of NG-nitro-L argininemethylester (L-NAME) 15 min prior to TGFa, EGF and UG s.c. or orally, significantly (p &lt; 0.001) decreased the degree of ulcer indices and was able to reduce the protective effects of TGFalpha, EGF and UG, thus including the role of NO in mediating the protective effects of these growth factors. In conclusion, these results have demonstrated that EGF, UG and TGFalpha have a short and reversible inhibitory effect on dimaprit-stimulated gastric acid secretion and each is effective parenterally but not orally. UG and EGF potentiated, while, TGFa inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. In addition, TGFalpha seems to lose its activity when it is truncated from the C terminus. The present study also suggests that EGF, UG and TGFalpha are equally effective against AE-induced gastric ulcer and bring about their cytoprotective action through their reduction of acid secretion and through PG and NO pathways.",M2
12181138,"ADP-induced pial arteriolar dilation in ovariectomized rats involves gap junctional communication.It was previously shown that, despite the loss of nitric oxide (NO) dependence, ADP-induced pial arteriolar dilation was not attenuated in estrogen-depleted [i.e., ovariectomized (Ovx)] rats. Additional evidence suggested that the NO was replaced by an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-like mechanism. To further characterize the nascent EDHF role in Ovx females, the current study was undertaken to test whether, in Ovx rats, ADP-induced pial arteriolar dilation retained its endothelial dependence and whether gap junctions are involved in that response. A closed cranial window and intravital microscopy system was used to monitor pial arteriolar diameter changes in anesthetized rats. The endothelial portion of the ADP-induced dilation was evaluated using light dye endothelial injury (L/D). The study was organized around three experimental approaches. First, the responses of pial arterioles to ADP before and after L/D exposure in intact and Ovx female rats were tested. L/D reduced the ADP response by 50-70% in both groups, thereby indicating that the endothelium dependence of ADP-induced vasodilation is not altered by chronic estrogen depletion. Second, the NO synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and the prostanoid synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) were coapplied. In intact females, L-NNA-Indo attenuated the response to ADP by 50%, with no further changes upon the addition of L/D. On the other hand, L-NNA-Indo did not affect ADP reactivity in Ovx rats, but subsequent L/D exposure reduced the ADP response by &gt;50%. The NO-prostanoid-independent, but endothelium-dependent, nature of the response in Ovx females is a hallmark of EDHF participation. Third, gap junctional inhibition strategies were applied. A selective inhibitor of gap junctional function, Gap 27, did not affect ADP reactivity in intact females but reduced the the ADP response by 50% in Ovx females. A similar result was obtained following application of a connexin43 antisense oligonucleotide. These findings suggest that the nascent EDHF dependency of ADP-induced pial arteriolar dilation in Ovx females involves connexin43-related gap junctional communication.",M2
12181110,"Effect of gender on endothelium-dependent dilation to bradykinin in human adipose microvessels.We examined the influence of gender and climacteric status, two coronary risk factors, on bradykinin (BK)-induced dilation in adipose arterioles from men and women of different ages [premenopausal women (Pre-W), postmenopausal women (Post-W), and similar aged men (Y-M and O-M), respectively]. We examined the responses from both omental (more closely associated with coronary disease) and subcutaneous fat. Tissues were obtained at surgery and cannulated (60 mmHg) for measurement of internal diameter. In vessels from omental tissue, dilation to BK was more sensitive in Pre-W than other groups, whereas in vessels from subcutaneous tissue, sensitivity to BK was greater in both Pre-W and Post-W compared with Y-M and O-M. Maximal dilation was similar among groups. Indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>; 10(-5) M) alone had no effect on dilation to BK in any groups, but Indo and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10(-4) M) reduced dilation to BK in Pre-W more than in Y-M. L-NAME increased dilation to BK in subcutaneous fat from Y-M but had no effect in Post-W and O-M. Indo- and L-NAME-resistant dilation in all vessels was markedly reduced by 30 mM KCl. There was no difference in sodium nitroprusside-induced dilation among groups. We conclude that gender and climacteric state contribute to mechanisms of microvascular regulation in humans. Functional vascular differences in visceral and subcutaneous fat may underlie the proposed differential influence of these tissues on cardiovascular risk.",M2
12162470,"Effects of meloxicam on platelet function in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), thereby inhibiting platelet function via blockade of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) formation, and COX-2, the enzyme that mediates inflammatory responses. Meloxicam is a relatively COX-2-selective anti-arthritis drug that shows significant TxA2 inhibition, albeit less than traditional NSAIDs. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 79 healthy adults to compare the effects of once-daily therapeutic (7.5 mg, 15 mg) and supratherapeutic (30 mg) doses of meloxicam with extended-release indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>-ER 75 mg once daily) on bleeding time, TxA2 formation, and platelet aggregation. The authors measured platelet aggregation to COX-1-dependent (ADP arachidonate) and COX-1-independent (high-dose collagen) agonists, bleeding time, serum TxB2, and clotting times (aPTT and PT) after 8 days' administration and at 3 and 6 hours after steady-state dosing. Meloxicam significantly decreased TxB2 production compared with placebo in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a peak of 77% inhibition 6 hours after 30 mg meloxicam; Indo-ER blocked TxB2 formation by 96% at the same time point. However, neither acute nor 8 days' administration of meloxicam at any dose caused a significant increase in bleeding time or inhibition of platelet aggregation to any agonist when compared with placebo. By contrast, Indo-ER significantly increased the bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation to COX-1-dependent agonists 6 hours after dosing. Clotting times were unaffected by any drug. It was concluded that unlike nonselective NSAIDs, meloxicam's blockade of TxA2 formation (even at supratherapeutic doses) does not reach levels that result in decreased in vivo platelet function, as measured by bleeding time and aggregometry. In this study of healthy subjects, meloxicam did not interfere with platelet-mediated hemostasis.",M2
12014386,"Safety and efficacy of ibuprofen versus indomethacin in preterm infants treated for patent ductus arteriosus: a randomised controlled trial.Indomethacin (<e>INDO</e>) and, more recently, ibuprofen (IBU) have been used to treat haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. Both are cyclo-oxygenase blockers, but seem to have a different influence on regional circulation. In a prospective, randomised, controlled study, we compared INDO and IBU with regard to efficacy and safety for the early non-invasive treatment of PDA. Doppler echocardiography was used to study 232 preterm infants (gestational age 23-34 weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome of whom 175 had persistent, haemodynamically significant PDA at 48-72 h of life. They were randomised to receive three intravenous doses of either INDO (0.2 mg/kg, at 12 h intervals) or IBU (a first 10 mg/kg dose followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 h intervals), recording rate of ductal closure, need for additional treatment, side-effects and clinical course. The efficacy of the pharmacological treatment was similar in the two groups (56/81, 69% INDO; 69/94, 73% IBU). Patients treated with INDO showed a significant increase in serum creatinine (89 +/- 24 versus 82 +/- 20 mmol/l, P = 0.03) and a near-significant tendency for a lower fractional excretion of sodium (3 +/- 3 versus 4 +/- 2%, P = 0.08); moreover, 12/81 (15%) INDO patients versus 1/94 (1%) IBU patients became oliguric (&lt; 1 ml/kg per h) during treatment (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that, by comparison with indomethacin, ibuprofen has fewer effects on renal function in terms of urine output and fluid retention, with much the same efficacy and safety in closing patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. In particular, no increased incidence of intracranial haemorrhage was observed after ibuprofen treatment.",M2
11954837,"Role of prostacyclin on microcirculation in endotoxin-induced gastroprotection in rats: a microdialysis study.Numerous mechanisms relating to lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) induced gastroprotection have been proposed. The prostaglandin (PG) system is a promising candidate that has received considerable attention. However, the role of prostacyclin (PGI2) remains unclear. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: (1) control, n = 6; (2) LPS (LPS, 10 mg/kg, i.v.), n = 7; (3) LPS + indomethacin (<e>Indo</e>) (LPS, 10 mg/kg and indomethacin 5 mg/kg, i.v.), n = 7; and (4) Indo (indomethacin 5 mg/kg, i.v.), n = 7. Additionally, gastric microcirculation was investigated using in vivo microscopy. Tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione levels were measured at the conclusion of the experiment. Specifically, microdialysis was used to measure the 6-keto-PGF1alpha, a stable metabolite of PGI2, while flow cytometry was used to measure the CD11b/CD18 expression of circulating neutrophils. Compared with LPS alone, LPS with Indo significantly impaired gastric microcirculation and systemic hemodynamics. LPS-induced gastroprotection was lost, as evidenced by the increased adherent leukocyte count, decreased flow velocity in the post-capillary venules, and increased tissue MDA production. Meanwhile, the luminal glucose and protein contents that comprised the gastric mucosa injury index were significantly increased. These effects of Indo are directly associated with the levels of PGI2 in gastric tissue, which increased with LPS alone and significantly decreased with a combination of LPS and Indo. This work demonstrates that PGI2 contributes to LPS-induced gastroprotection.",M2
