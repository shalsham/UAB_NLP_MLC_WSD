19622171,"Drug use patterns among Thai illicit drug injectors amidst increased police presence.Thailand has traditionally pursued an aggressive enforcement-based anti-illicit drug policy in an effort to make the country  drug-free.  In light of this ongoing approach, we sought to assess impacts of enforcement on drug use behaviors among a cohort of injection drug users (IDU) in Thailand. We examined drug use patterns among IDU participating in a cross-sectional study conducted in Bangkok (n = 252). Participants were asked to provide data regarding patterns of drug use in the previous six months, including types of drugs consumed, method of consumption, frequency of use, and weekly income spent on drugs. We also conducted bivariate analyses to identify a possible effect of a reported increase in police presence on measures of drug use and related risk behaviors among study participants. One hundred fifty-five (61.5%) individuals reported injection heroin use and 132 (52.4%) individuals reported injection midazolam use at least daily in the past six months. Additionally, 86 (34.1%) individuals reported at least daily injection Yaba and <e>Ice</e> (i.e., methamphetamine) use. Participants in our study reported high levels of illicit drug use, including the injection of both illicit and licit drugs. In bivariate analyses, no association between increased police presence and drug use behaviors was observed. These findings demonstrate high ongoing rates of drug injecting in Thailand despite reports of increased levels of strict enforcement and enforcement-related violence, and raise questions regarding the merits of this approach.",M1
19207353,"Impact of US and Canadian precursor regulation on methamphetamine purity in the United States.AIMS: Reducing drug purity is a major, but largely unstudied, goal of drug suppression. This study examines whether US methamphetamine purity was impacted by the suppression policy of US and Canadian precursor chemical regulation. DESIGN: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-intervention time-series analysis. SETTING: Continental United States and Hawaii (1985-May 2005). Interventions US federal regulations targeting precursors, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, in forms used by large-scale producers were implemented in November 1989, August 1995 and October 1997. US regulations targeting precursors in forms used by small-scale producers (e.g. over-the-counter medications) were implemented in October 1996 and October 2001. Canada implemented federal precursor regulations in January 2003 and July 2003 and an essential chemical (e.g. acetone) regulation in January 2004. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly median methamphetamine purity series. FINDINGS: US regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with purity declines of 16-67 points; those targeting small-scale producers had little or no impact. Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases of 13-15 points, while its essential chemical regulation was associated with a 13-point decrease. Hawaii's purity was consistently high, and appeared to vary little with the 1990s/2000s regulations. CONCLUSIONS: US precursor regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with substantial decreases in continental US methamphetamine purity, while regulations targeting over-the-counter medications had little or no impact. Canada's essential chemical regulation was also associated with a decrease in continental US purity. However, Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases: these regulations may have impacted primarily producers of lower-quality methamphetamine, leaving higher-purity methamphetamine on the market by default. Hawaii's well-known preference for '<e>ice</e>' (high-purity methamphetamine) may have helped to constrain purity there to a high, attenuated range, possibly limiting its sensitivity to precursor regulation.",M1
18803173," <e>Ice</e>  use and eating disorders: a report of three cases.OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride  ice,  a powerful, synthetic stimulant drug associated with rapid weight loss. METHOD: We report the first three cases of young women  ice  users requiring admission to a specialized eating disorders unit. RESULTS: Case one had no prior history of an eating disorder and became emaciated following regular use of  ice ; she regarded weight gain positively. Case 2 had polysubstance abuse since early adolescence and commenced binge eating and vomiting in response to weight gain when not using  ice ; she learned to maintain her weight without weight losing behaviors. Case 3 developed anorexia nervosa in early adolescence, required numerous inpatient admissions and commenced using stimulant drugs for weight loss in her late teens; she discharged prematurely. All patients had features of personality disorder on interview and drug abuse had impaired their work and social adjustment. DISCUSSION:  Ice  use may be associated with the onset of disordered eating or used as an efficient weight losing behavior in an established eating disorder.",M1

18368603,"The prevalence of methamphetamine and amphetamine abuse in North America: a review of the indicators, 1992-2007.INTRODUCTION: This paper reviews epidemiological information about methamphetamine production and use in North America. METHODS: Information is drawn from a range of sources, including, but not limited to, historical accounts, peer-reviewed papers, population surveys and large national databases. RESULTS: Methamphetamine and amphetamine use in North America is characterised by geographic variations, with different types of the drug, different routes of administration and different types of users at various times. Unlike some other drug use patterns in North America, the nature of methamphetamine use in Canada, Mexico and the United States has been linked closely in terms of production and supply of the drug. According to their national household surveys, the annual prevalence for 'speed' use in Canada was 0.8% in 2004, 0.3% for 'anfetaminas' and 0.1% for 'metanfetaminas' in Mexico in 2002, and 1.4% for 'stimulants' in the United States in 2006. DISCUSSION: Although the data sources in the three North American countries are not consistent in methodology, terminology or frequency of reporting, all show similar trends. The type of stimulant most used has shifted from non-medical use of pharmaceutical amphetamine to use of powder methamphetamine and then to use of '<e>ice</e>'. The indicators show the problem is greatest in the western parts of the countries and is moving eastward, but the decreased availability of pseudoephedrine may have a significant impact on the nature of the epidemic in the future. Nevertheless, use of methamphetamine poses a number of risks for users and specialised treatment resources for these various populations are needed.",M1
18082974,"A comparison of the physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and microglial effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in the mouse.3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH) are amphetamine analogues with similar persistent neurochemical effects in the mouse which some have described as neurotoxicity. We attempted to identify dose regimens of MDMA and METH with similar effects on behavioral and physiological variables in the mouse, then quantified the effects of these dose regimens on neurochemistry and microglial markers. Four discrete injections of saline, MDMA (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg), or METH (5 or 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice at 2 h intervals. Body weight was quantified immediately before each injection, and 2 h after the last injection, while core temperature and locomotor activity were continuously monitored via radiotelemetry. Mice were killed 72 h after the final injection and brains were rapidly dissected on <e>ice</e>. Dopamine content in various brain regions was quantified via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and microglial activation was assessed by saturation binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(3)H]PK11195). Specific dose regimens of MDMA and METH induced similar reductions in body weight, depletions of dopamine and its metabolites, and similar hyperthermic and locomotor stimulant effects, but only METH activated microglia in striatum. These results suggest that repeated high doses of MDMA and METH that produce hyperthermia, locomotor stereotypy, weight loss and neurochemical depletion are not consistently accompanied by microglial activation. The finding that METH, but not MDMA, induces microglial effects in the striatum consistent with neurotoxicity might imply different mechanisms of toxic action for these two psychostimulants.",M1
18021044,"Comparison of crystalline methamphetamine ( <e>ice</e> ) users and other patients with toxicology-related problems presenting to a hospital emergency department.OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic and clinical characteristics of methamphetamine users and patients with other toxicology-related problems requiring medical intervention in a hospital emergency department (ED). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study of toxicology-related presentations to the ED of St Vincent's Hospital (SVH), Sydney, an inner-city tertiary hospital, between 1 October and 31 December 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to the ED in relation to behaviour, mode of arrival, accompaniment, need for scheduling, location of drug use, intravenous drug use history, psychiatric history and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: During the study period there were 10 305 patient presentations to SVH ED; 449 (4%) were toxicology-related presentations, of which 100 (1% of total) were methamphetamine-related. Methamphetamine users were significantly more agitated, violent and aggressive than patients with other toxicology-related presentations and significantly less alert, communicative and cooperative (P &lt; 0.001); 24% of methamphetamine users (24/100) arrived with police accompaniment versus 9% of other toxicology patients (33/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Methamphetamine users were more likely to have a history of intravenous drug use and mental health problems (P &lt; 0.001); 39% of methamphetamine presentations (39/100) required scheduling under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) compared with 19% of other toxicology-related presentations (67/349) (P &lt; 0.001); 43% of methamphetamine-related presentations (43/100) involved drug use on the street compared with 24% of other toxicology-related presentations (83/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Two-thirds of all methamphetamine users were male, and the most common age group for both male and female users was 26-30 years. The mean age and sex distribution of patients with other toxicology-related presentations were not significantly different. Among methamphetamine users, 27% of women (9/33) were in the 21-25-year age group compared with 10% (7/67) of men (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: There were significant differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to SVH ED. Methamphetamine users were more aggressive, violent and dangerous, and thus more likely to pose a risk to health personnel and others. Methamphetamine appeared to be used consistently, rather than as an episodic  party drug .",M1

The results of the study indicated that both male and female adolescents who used methamphetamine were significantly more likely to participate in aggressive behaviors and sexual risks (i.e., numerous sex partners). The inclusion of grade point averages in a logistic regression equation revealed that White adolescents were more likely than other ethnicities to indicate that they had used methamphetamine and the inclusion of student grade point averages reduced male gender to nonsignificance. We also discuss the limitations of the study.",M1
17536161,"Smokable ( <e>ice</e> ,  crystal meth ) and non smokable amphetamine-type stimulants: clinical pharmacological and epidemiological issues, with special reference to the UK. Ice ,  crystal meth , is the smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride. This paper will comment on the pharmacological, epidemiological, clinical and social issues related to smoking the drug as opposed to either its injection or ingestion. Furthermore, some data related to amphetamines/methamphetamines consumption, request for treatment, seizures, related offences and deaths in the UK (1990-2002) will be offered here. Peak rates, for most indicators, were reached at the end of the '90s, to fall down in the following years. The only indicator which seemed not to show any declining rates is number of deaths, but this may be related to a more general increase in stimulant death rates recently observed in the UK. It is argued that methamphetamines, and particularly  crystal meth , could reach the same prevalence levels of use in the UK as it is already in the US but recent reclassification of the drug to Class A in the UK could help to better control this emerging issue.",M1

17364831,"MDMA, methamphetamine and their combination: possible lessons for party drug users from recent preclinical research.The substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') and methamphetamine (METH, '<e>ice</e>', 'speed') are increasingly popular drugs amongst party-drug users. Studies with humans have investigated the acute and possible long-term adverse effects of these drugs, yet outcomes of such studies are often ambiguous due to a variety of confounding factors. Studies employing animal models have value in determining the acute and long-term effects of MDMA and METH on brain and behaviour. Self-administration studies show that intravenous METH is a particularly potent reinforcer in rats and other species. In contrast, MDMA appears to have powerful effects in enhancing social behaviour in laboratory animals. Brief exposure to MDMA or METH may produce long-term reductions in dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain and alterations in the density of various receptor and transporter proteins. However it is still unclear, particularly in the case of MDMA, whether this reflects a 'neurotoxic' effect of the drug. Lasting alterations in social behaviour, anxiety, depressive symptoms and memory have been demonstrated in laboratory rats given MDMA or METH and this matches long-term changes reported in some human studies. Recent laboratory studies suggest that MDMA/METH combinations may produce greater adverse neurochemical and behavioural effects than either drug alone. This is of some concern given recent evidence that party drug users may be frequently exposed to this combination of drugs.",M1
17262233,"[Optic neuropathy induced by prenatal drug or alcohol exposure]PURPOSE: The main aim of this work was to analyse the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in retinal and optic nerve development, and the consequences of methamphetamine  <e>ice</e>  (MA) or alcohol (EtOH) abuse during pregnancy on the developing visual system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed to MA or EtOH during gestation and lactation and their offspring studied. Control isocaloric rats were maintained in parallel. The eyes and optic nerves from pups (at 7, 14 and 21 postnatal days) were processed using morphologic, morphometric and western blot approaches using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP) and neurofilament protein (NFP). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the methamphetamine-exposed and the alcohol-exposed rats, as compared to the controls. The optic nerve cross-sectional area was smaller in the drug or alcohol-exposed animals. The expression of developmental protein markers (GFAP and MBP) in the retina and optic nerve displayed striking alterations related to drug or alcohol abuse during gestation and lactation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychostimulant and alcohol exposure alters the development of the retina and optic nerve.",M1
16769452,"Drug use and risk of HIV/AIDS on the Mexico-USA border: a comparison of treatment admissions in both countries.This study analyzes trends in treatment admissions and summarizes HIV/AIDS risk factors along the US-Mexican border. Data are presented at the national level and at the state level for states along the border. Client data also are compared for treatment programs located in sister cities on the Texas-Mexico border. These data show that methamphetamine admissions are increasing nationally and methamphetamine use is a major problem in the western states on both sides of the border. Use of <e>Ice</e> (smoked methamphetamine) has increased significantly. Use of crack (smoked cocaine) is a growing problem on the border, and injection is the primary route for using black tar heroin in this area. Each of these drugs is a risk factor, either from drug-influenced risky sexual behaviors or from sharing injection equipment. In addition, the availability of drugs on the border and patterns of risky behaviors among migrants mean that drug users on the border are at risk of HIV/AIDS, and this risk is expected to increase with the spreading methamphetamine epidemic and smoking of crack cocaine. Comparable data on HIV/AIDS are needed for further studies of the relationship of drug use and HIV/AIDS on the border.",M1
15061561,"Neighborhood environment and opportunity to try methamphetamine ( <e>ice</e> ) and marijuana: evidence from Guam in the Western Pacific region of Micronesia.Although the American popular press and films might generally lead one to think otherwise, illegal drug use and drug trafficking occur outside the boundaries of disadvantaged American inner-city neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the occurrence of youthful drug involvement may be determined by similar community conditions in many parts of the world. In Spring 1998, a probability sample of 776 high school students living in Guam, Micronesia, completed a self-report anonymous survey, one that assessed their village and metropolitan neighborhood environments as well as drug involvement. On Guam, higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage were associated with youths being more likely to have been offered a chance to try drugs. This study adds new evidence on the potential importance of environmental and psychosocial contexts of neighborhood environment that might help account for the nonrandom distribution of youthful drug involvement.",M1
15011896,"Acute coronary syndrome and crystal methamphetamine use: a case series. <e>Ice</e>  is a form of methamphetamine commonly used as a recreational drug in Hawaii and the Philippines, but seldom encountered in the continental United States. It differs in appearance from methamphetamine tablets, but otherwise has exactly the same molecules, only arranged in a crystalline structure. A sizeable body of in vitro, animal, and autopsy data suggest a linkage between methamphetamine use and myocardial pathology. In this report, we describe a series of eight patients who developed unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction in association with smoking crystal methamphetamine. The findings, to a large extent, resemble those with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. Given the widespread abuse of methamphetamine among young age groups, the recognition and primary prevention of cardiovascular toxic effects is of mounting socioeconomic importance.",M1
12537703,"The emergence of potent forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, Australia: a case study of the IDRS as a strategic early warning system.A striking finding of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) in recent years has concerned the emergence in Sydney of a number of different forms of potent methamphetamine. This paper demonstrates the operation of the IDRS in detecting and documenting an increase in both the availability and use of these forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, and Australia more widely, since 1998. Data from different components of the IDRS are utilized to propose that there are currently at least three forms of methamphetamine available in Sydney that are considered by the market to be distinct commodities: methamphetamine powder ('speed'), base methamphetamine ('base') and crystalline methamphetamine ('<e>ice</e>'/'shabu'/'crystal meth'). Base and ice are more potent forms of methamphetamine than speed, and international experience, along with preliminary data obtained from the IDRS, suggest that their use is associated with harms in a number of domains.",M1
11831497,"Patterns of methamphetamine abuse and their consequences.The abuse of methamphetamine (METH) continues to increase throughout all age groups in different regions of the United States.  <e>Ice</e>,  the popularized jargon for (+) methamphetamine hydrochloride, is the predominant drug form that is now consumed.  Ice  is effectively absorbed after either smoking or snorting and it is this rapid influx of drug that produces effects similar to those after intravenous administration. The intensity of METH actions in the central and peripheral nervous system shows tolerance after chronic administration, indicating that neuroadaptations have occurred. Thus, the physiological processes and corresponding biochemical mechanisms that regulate neuronal function have been changed by METH exposure. These biological alterations contribute to the craving and dependence associated with METH abuse and the withdrawal syndrome upon abstinence. However, these changes in behavior may also result from METH-induced neurotoxicity. This article reviews aspects of METH pharmacokinetics and related molecular pharmacodynamics that represent METH pharmacology and then relates those actions to their potential to produce neurotoxicity in humans.",M1
11224724,"Airway effects of marijuana, cocaine, and other inhaled illicit agents.Several substances besides tobacco are inhaled for recreational purposes, including marijuana, crack cocaine, amyl and butyl nitrites, heroin, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine. Abuse of most of these inhaled substances has risen in recent years, thereby increasing concern about potential pulmonary and other medical complications. Regular marijuana use can lead to extensive airway injury and alterations in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection and respiratory cancer. Crack cocaine use can lead to a variety of acute pulmonary complications, including severe exacerbations of asthma and an acute lung injury syndrome associated with a broad spectrum of histopathologic changes ( crack lung ). Habitual cocaine smoking may also produce more subtle long-term pulmonary consequences due to chronic alveolar epithelial and microvascular lung injury. Heroin inhalation can induce severe and even fatal exacerbations of asthma. Pulmonary consequences of inhaled amyl and butyl nitrites, crystalline methamphetamine (<e>ice</e>), and phencyclidine have been less well documented.",M1
11085306,"Two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344 and Lewis, showed differential behavior and brain expression of corticosterone receptor mRNA induced by methamphetamine.Recently, a role of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis in facilitating the behavioral and neurochemical effects of psychostimulants has been proposed. Two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344/N (F344) and Lewis/N (LEW), have markedly different HPA axes as well as behavioral responses to psychostimulants: F344 rats show hyperresponsive HPA axis and no significant sensitization to cocaine, whereas LEW rats display blunted response in HPA axis and develop cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Corticosterone exerts its biological effects via intracellular receptors, termed type I (mineralocorticoid receptor: MR) and type II (glucocorticoid receptor: GR). The present study examines the development of stereotypy sensitization and the brain expression of mRNAs for MR, GR, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in methamphetamine (MAP)-treated F344 and LEW rats. Animals received i.p. injections with chronic saline (SAL: once daily for 21 days), chronic saline and acute MAP (AM: saline for 20 days and 4 mg/kg MAP on the 21st day), or chronic MAP (CM: 4 mg/kg MAP for 21 days) and were sacrificed three hours after the last injections. Striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were quickly dissected on <e>ice</e> and total RNA was isolated for northern analyses. LEW rats developed stereotypy sensitization significantly earlier than F344 rats. AM significantly decreased GR and MR mRNA expression in hippocampus of LEW, compared to SAL. CM significantly increased GR and MR mRNA expression in striatum of F344 compared to SAL and AM, while it decreased GR mRNA in striatum of LEW and MR mRNA in hippocampus, compared to SAL. AM significantly increased HSP90 mRNA in all brain regions examined, without the hippocampus in LEW. CM significantly increased the expression of HSP90 mRNA in the striatum and cerebellum of F344, but significantly decreased in the striatum and hippocampus of LEW. These contrasting differences between F344 and LEW, in their susceptibility to stereotypy sensitization and striatal expression of GR mRNA by chronic MAP, suggest that some striatal genes, whose transcription is regulated by GR, play a crucial role in the development of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization.",M1

10357249,"Neuroadaptations in the dopaminergic system after active self-administration but not after passive administration of methamphetamine.Methamphetamine is a strong and long-lasting stimulant that can be easily synthesized and is effective when taken either orally, intravenously, or smoked as '<e>ice</e>'. Due to it's escalating abuse, a clear need exists for laboratory procedures to evaluate motivational components of methamphetamine abuse and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In the present experiment, we utilized a 'yoked' procedure in which rats were run simultaneously in groups of three, with two rats serving as yoked controls which received an injection of either 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine or saline which was not contingent on responding each time a response-contingent injection of 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine was self-administered by the third paired rat. Rats that had actively self-administered methamphetamine for 5 weeks and were then withdrawn from methamphetamine for 24 h showed marked decreases in somatodendritic dopamine D2 autoreceptors levels in the ventral tegmental area (34%) and medial (31%) and dorsal (21%) part of the substantia nigra zona compacta with a corresponding down-regulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (15%), as measured by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Since the decreases in levels of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors which occurred in rats self-administering methamphetamine did not occur in littermates that received either yoked injections of methamphetamine or saline, these changes likely reflect motivational states that were present when methamphetamine injection depended on active drug self-administration behavior.",M1
9542724,"Free radicals and the pathobiology of brain dopamine systems.Oxygen is an essential element for normal life. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can also participate in deleterious reactions that can affect lipid, protein, and nucleic acid. Normal physiological function thus depends on a balance between these ROS and the scavenging systems that aerobic organisms have developed over millennia. Tilting of that balance towards a pro-oxidant state might result from both endogenous and exogenous causes. In the present paper, we elaborate on the thesis that the neurodegenerative effects of two drugs, namely methamphetamine (METH, <e>ICE</e>) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) are due to ROS overproduction in monoaminergic systems in the brain. We also discuss the role of oxygen-based species in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and in Parkinson's disease.

The same volunteers were given an intravenous injection of 15.5 mg of S-(+)-methamphetamine hydrochloride. Methamphetamine and its metabolite amphetamine were analyzed in plasma, saliva, and urine by gas chromatography. The bioavailability of smoked methamphetamine was 90.3 +/- 10.4%. (Oral bioavailability calculated from this study and a previous one was 67.2 +/- 3.1%). The geometric mean plasma half-life was 11.1 hr for smoked methamphetamine and 12.2 hr for the intravenous drug. These values agreed with urinary excretion rate data. The volume of distribution in the elimination phase was 3.24 +/- 0.36 liter/kg for the smoked dose and 3.73 +/- 0.59 liter/kg for the intravenous dose. The mean residence times were 11.5 +/- 0.5 hr and 11.3 +/- 1.74 hr for the two routes. Metabolic clearance represented 58 and 55%, respectively, of the total clearance. Significant amounts of the drug (37-45% of the nominal dose) were excreted in urine as methamphetamine and lesser amounts (7% of the nominal molar dose) as amphetamine. Renal clearance was equivalent for the two routes. Methamphetamine concentrations in plasma after inhalation showed a plateau. A model involving both a fast and a slow input function fit the data from 4 of the 6 subjects and indicated a terminal elimination rate that agreed with results from model-independent pharmacokinetic calculations.

20446692,"Release of legacy pollutants from melting glaciers: model evidence and conceptual understanding.Recently, increasing concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been observed in the sediment of glacier-fed Lake Oberaar, Switzerland. Melting glaciers have been suggested as a secondary source of POPs released to Alpine lakes. Here we further investigate whether climate warming may accelerate the release of POPs previously deposited to Alpine glaciers ( glacier hypothesis ). To test this hypothesis, a dynamic multimedia mass balance model is developed for the catchment area of Lake Oberaar and is applied to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT). This lake model is combined with two other models. The first is a dynamic multimedia mass balance model parametrized for the Swiss lowlands that is used to calculate (on the basis of historical emission data) the atmospheric concentrations that are an advective input into the model of the lake catchment. The second is a flow model of Oberaar Glacier that determines the residence time of persistent chemicals in the glacier after their deposition to the glacier surface. According to results from these three models in combination, the release of POPs by the glacier is currently increasing and accounts for the observed increase in concentrations in the lake sediment. The models indicate that approximately half of the amount of PCBs, PCDD/Fs, and DDT initially incorporated into the glacier <e>ice</e> is still stored in the glacier. Under the assumption that the climate is warming, accelerated release of POPs is to be expected for the future; in a model run where no climate warming is assumed, the period of time required for release of the same amount of chemicals is longer by several decades than in the scenario with a changing climate.",M2

Here we report the spectroscopic detection of water ice and organic material on the asteroid 24 Themis, a detection that has been independently confirmed. 24 Themis belongs to the same dynamical family as three of the five known MBCs, and the presence of ice on 24 Themis is strong evidence that it also is present in the MBCs. We conclude that water ice is more common on asteroids than was previously thought and may be widespread in asteroidal interiors at much smaller heliocentric distances than was previously expected.",M2
20428164,"Water <e>ice</e> and organics on the surface of the asteroid 24 Themis.It has been suggested that Earth's current supply of water was delivered by asteroids, some time after the collision that produced the Moon (which would have vaporized any of the pre-existing water). So far, no measurements of water ice on asteroids have been made, but its presence has been inferred from the comet-like activity of several small asteroids, including two members of the Themis dynamical family. Here we report infrared spectra of the asteroid 24 Themis which show that ice and organic compounds are not only present on its surface but also prevalent. Infrared spectral differences between it and other asteroids make 24 Themis unique so far, and our identification of ice and organics agrees with independent results that rule out other compounds as possible sources of the observed spectral structure. The widespread presence of surface ice on 24 Themis is somewhat unexpected because of the relatively short lifetime of exposed ice at this distance ( approximately 3.2 au) from the Sun. Nevertheless, there are several plausible sources, such as a subsurface reservoir that brings water to the surface through 'impact gardening' and/or sublimation.",M2
20426348,"Icing events trigger range displacement in a high-arctic ungulate.Despite numerous studies of how climate change may affect life history of mammals, few have documented the direct impact of climate on behavior. The Arctic is currently warming, and rain-on-snow and thaw-freeze events leading to <e>ice</e> formation on the ground may increase both in frequency and spatial extent. This is in turn expected to be critical for the winter survival of arctic herbivores. Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus plathyrynchus) have small home ranges and may therefore be vulnerable to local  locked pasture  events (ice layers limit access to plant forage) due to ground-ice formation. When pastures are  locked,  Svalbard reindeer are faced with the decision of staying and live off a diminishing fat store, or trying to escape beyond the unknown spatial borders of the ice. We demonstrate that Svalbard reindeer do the latter, as icing events cause an immediate increase in range displacement between 5-day observations. Population-level responses of previous icing events may therefore not accurately predict future responses if the spatial extent of icing increases. The impact of single events may be more severe if it exceeds the maximum movement distances, so that the spatial displacement strategy reported here no longer buffers climate effects.",M2
20423076,"Benzene photolysis on <e>ice</e>: implications for the fate of organic contaminants in the winter.The members of the important class of organic pollutants known as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) do not undergo direct photolysis in natural waters, because their absorption spectra do not overlap that of the solar radiation which reaches the Earth's surface. Recent work has shown that aromatic compounds undergo significant red-shifts in their absorption spectra when they are present at air-ice interfaces, suggesting that BTEX components could undergo direct photolysis at ice surfaces. Using glancing-angle laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) as a probe, we measured benzene photodegradation at lambda &gt; 295 nm having a rate constant of (3 +/- 1 x 10(-4) s(-1)) under our experimental conditions. We predict that the photolysis rate at environmental ice surfaces will be similar, based on the photon flux dependence we measured. This study presents the first report of direct benzene photolysis under environmentally relevant conditions. The results suggest that direct photolysis could be an important removal pathway for organic pollutants such as BTEX in snow-covered regions, for example, in polar or urban areas contaminated by oil spills or leaks.",M2

The O2 absorber reduced the oxygen content in the pack to less than 0.01% corresponding to 99.96% reduction within 24 h. The use of O2 absorber with sodium acetate dip treatment (2% w/v) extended the sensory shelf life up to 25 days compared to only 12 days for control air packs and 20 days for untreated samples with O2 absorber. A prominent lag phase was observed for many bacterium studied, particularly for the sodium acetate treated samples with O2 absorber. On the day of sensory rejection, both the total mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts reached 7.7-8.1 and 7.1-7.9 log cfu/g, respectively.

Some of these organics may be prebiotic compounds that were delivered to early Earth by comets and meteorites and may have triggered the first chemical reactions involved in the origin of life. Ultraviolet irradiation of ices simulating photoprocesses of cold solid matter in astrophysical environments have shown that photochemistry can lead to the formation of amino acids and related compounds. In this work, we experimentally searched for other organic molecules of prebiotic interest, namely, oxidized acid labile compounds. In a setup that simulates conditions relevant to the ISM and Solar System icy bodies such as comets, a condensed CH(3)OH:NH(3) = 1:1 ice mixture was UV irradiated at approximately 80 K. The molecular constituents of the nonvolatile organic residue that remained at room temperature were separated by capillary gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Urea, glycolic acid, and glycerol were detected in this residue, as well as hydroxyacetamide, glycerolic acid, and glycerol amide. These organics are interesting target molecules to be searched for in space.

20392089,"Post 17th-century changes of European PAH emissions recorded in high-altitude Alpine snow and <e>ice</e>.The occurrence of organic pollutants in European Alpine snow/ice has been reconstructed over the past three centuries using a new online extraction method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) followed by liquid chromatographic determination. The meltwater flow from a continuous ice core melting system was split into two aliquots, with one aliquot directed to an inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometer for continuous trace elements determinations and the second introduced into a solid phase C18 (SPE) cartridge for semicontinuous PAH extraction. The depth resolution for PAH extractions ranged from 40 to 70 cm, and corresponds to 0.7-5 years per sample. The concentrations of 11 PAH were determined in dated snow/ice samples to reconstruct the atmospheric concentration of these compounds in Europe for the last 300 years. The PAH pattern is dominated by phenanthrene (Phe), fluoranthene (Fla), and pyrene (Pyr), which represent 60-80% of the total PAH mass. Before 1875 the sum of PAH concentration (SigmaPAH) was very low with total mean concentrations less than 2 ng/kg and 0.08 ng/kg for the heavier compounds (SigmaPAH*, more than four aromatic rings). During the first phase of the industrial revolution (1770-1830) the PAH deposition showed a weak increase which became much greater from the start of the second phase of the industrial revolution at the end of 19th Century. In the 1920s, economic recession in Europe decreased PAH emissions until the 1930s when they increased again and reached a maximum concentration of 32 ng/kg from 1945 to 1955. From 1955 to 1975 the PAH concentrations decreased significantly, reflecting improvements in emission controls especially from major point sources, while from 1975 to 2003 they rose to levels equivalent to those in 1910. The Fla/(Fla+Pyr) ratio is often used for source assignment and here indicates an increase in the relative contribution of gasoline and diesel combustion with respect to coal and wood burning from 1860 to the 1980s. This trend was reversed during the last two decades.",M2
20388912,"Internally mixed sulfate and organic particles as potential <e>ice</e> nuclei in the tropical tropopause region.Cirrus clouds are ubiquitous in the tropical tropopause region and play a major role in the Earth's climate. Any changes to cirrus abundance due to natural or anthropogenic influences must be considered to evaluate future climate change. The detailed impact of cirrus clouds on climate depends on ice particle number, size, morphology, and composition. These properties depend in turn on the nucleation mechanism of the ice particles. Although it is often assumed that ice nucleates via a homogeneous mechanism, recent work points to the possibility that heterogeneous ice nucleation is important in the tropical tropopause region. However, there are very few studies of depositional ice nucleation on the complex types of particles likely to be found in this region of the atmosphere. Here, we use a unique method to probe depositional ice nucleation on internally mixed ammonium sulfate/palmitic acid particles, namely optical microscopy coupled with Raman microscopy. The deliquescence and efflorescence phase transitions of the mixed particles were first studied to gain insight into whether the particles are likely to be liquid or solid in the tropical tropopause region. The ice nucleating ability of the particles was then measured under typical upper tropospheric conditions. It was found that coating the particles with insoluble palmitic acid had little effect on the deliquescence, efflorescence, or ice nucleating ability of ammonium sulfate. Additional experiments involving Raman mapping provide new insights into how the composition and morphology of mixed particles impact their ability to nucleate ice.",M2
20373797,"Formation of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) in electron-irradiated ammonia-water <e>ices</e>.We investigated chemical and physical processes in electron-irradiated ammonia-water ices at temperatures of 10 and 50 K. Chemically speaking, the formation of hydroxylamine (NH(2)OH) was observed in electron-irradiated ammonia-water ices. The synthesis of molecular hydrogen (H(2)), molecular nitrogen (N(2)), molecular oxygen (O(2)), hydrazine (N(2)H(4)), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which was also monitored in previous irradiation of pure ammonia and water ices, was also evident. These newly formed species were trapped inside of the ices and were released into the gas phase during the warm-up phase of the sample after the irradiation. A quantitative analysis of the data showed that the production rates of the newly formed species at 10 K are higher compared to those at 50 K. Our studies also suggest that hydroxylamine is likely formed by the recombination of amino (NH(2)) with hydroxyl (OH) radicals inside of the ices. Considering the physical effects on the ice sampled during the irradiation, the experiments provided compelling evidence that the crystalline ammonia-water ice samples can be partially converted to amorphous ices during the electron irradiation; similar to the chemical processes, the irradiation-induced amorphization of the ices is faster at 10 K than that at 50 K--a finding which is similar to electron-irradiated crystalline water ices under identical conditions. However, the amorphization of water in water-ammonia ices was found to be faster than that in pure water ices at identical temperatures.",M2

ICE-L.A cDNA encoding heat shock protein 70 of Antarctic ice algae Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L (designated as CiHsp70) was identified by RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends approaches. The full-length cDNA of CiHsp70 was 2,232 bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 76 bp, a 3'-terminal UTR of 203 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame of 1,953 bp. The CiHsp70 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 651 amino acids with an ATPase domain of 388 amino acids, the substrate peptide binding domain of 246 amino acids and a C-terminus domain of 17 amino acids. The inducible CiHsp70 cDNA was highly homologous to other plant cytosolic Hsp70 genes and clustered together with green algae and higher plant rather than brown algae, diatom and Cryptophyta. Antarctic ice algae were treated with different stress conditions and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of CiHsp70 were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that both cold and heat shock treatments could stimulate CiHsp70 mRNA expression. Meanwhile, CiHsp70 mRNA expression level increased 2.9-fold in response to UV-B radiation for 6 h, while the expression levels of CiHsp70 were remarkably increased after removing the UV-B radiation and immediately providing additional 6 h visible light. Furthermore, treating with 62 or 93 per thousand NaCl for 2 h, CiHsp70 mRNA expression level increased 3.0- and 2.1-fold, respectively.

20365744,"Theory of <e>ice</e> premelting in porous media.Premelting describes the confluence of phenomena that are responsible for the stable existence of the liquid phase of matter in the solid region of its bulk phase diagram. Here we develop a theoretical description of the premelting of water ice contained in a porous matrix, made of a material with a melting temperature substantially larger than ice itself, to predict the amount of liquid water in the matrix at temperatures below its bulk freezing point. Our theory combines the interfacial premelting of ice in contact with the matrix, grain-boundary melting in the ice, and impurity and curvature induced premelting, with the latter occurring in regions which force the ice-liquid interface into a high curvature configuration. These regions are typically found at points where the matrix surface is concave, along contact lines of a grain boundary with the matrix, and in liquid veins. Both interfacial premelting and curvature induced premelting depend on the concentration of impurities in the liquid, which, due to the small segregation coefficient of impurities in ice are treated as homogeneously distributed in the premelted liquid. Our principal result is an equation for the fraction of liquid in the porous medium as a function of the undercooling, which embodies the combined effects of interfacial premelting, curvature induced premelting, and impurities. The result is analyzed in detail and applied to a range of experimentally relevant settings.",M2
20349841,"Long-term recovery patterns of arctic tundra after winter seismic exploration.In response to the increasing global demand for energy, oil exploration and development are expanding into frontier areas of the Arctic, where slow-growing tundra vegetation and the underlying permafrost soils are very sensitive to disturbance. The creation of vehicle trails on the tundra from seismic exploration for oil has accelerated in the past decade, and the cumulative impact represents a geographic footprint that covers a greater extent of Alaska's North Slope tundra than all other direct human impacts combined. Seismic exploration for oil and gas was conducted on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, USA, in the winters of 1984 and 1985. This study documents recovery of vegetation and permafrost soils over a two-decade period after vehicle traffic on snow-covered tundra. Paired permanent vegetation plots (disturbed vs. reference) were monitored six times from 1984 to 2002. Data were collected on percent vegetative cover by plant species and on soil and ground <e>ice</e> characteristics. We developed Bayesian hierarchical models, with temporally and spatially autocorrelated errors, to analyze the effects of vegetation type and initial disturbance levels on recovery patterns of the different plant growth forms as well as soil thaw depth. Plant community composition was altered on the trails by species-specific responses to initial disturbance and subsequent changes in substrate. Long-term changes included increased cover of graminoids and decreased cover of evergreen shrubs and mosses. Trails with low levels of initial disturbance usually improved well over time, whereas those with medium to high levels of initial disturbance recovered slowly. Trails on ice-poor, gravel substrates of riparian areas recovered better than those on ice-rich loamy soils of the uplands, even after severe initial damage. Recovery to pre-disturbance communities was not possible where trail subsidence occurred due to thawing of ground ice. Previous studies of disturbance from winter seismic vehicles in the Arctic predicted short-term and mostly aesthetic impacts, but we found that severe impacts to tundra vegetation persisted for two decades after disturbance under some conditions. We recommend management approaches that should be used to prevent persistent tundra damage.",M2

20299050,"The 50-year history of the <e>ice</e> water test in urology.PURPOSE: The ice water test was first described in a 1957 study of cold receptors in the bladder. We examined the role of the ice water test in the diagnosis and management of different urological conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed literature searches were performed, spanning 1956 to January 2009. Other studies were identified by reviewing secondary references in the original citations. RESULTS: The ice water test has been shown to be a lower motoneuron segmental reflex involving C-fiber afferents, which are associated with cold receptors. A number of its clinical applications have been described. The test was first thought to be specific to upper motoneuron lesions but patients with other urological conditions have had a positive test, including those with nonneurogenic disorders. The test is almost always negative (contractions less than 15 cm H(2)O) in healthy volunteers and in patients with stress urinary incontinence, lower motoneuron conditions and bladder pain syndrome. In cases of upper motoneuron conditions the positive test rate is 46% to 92% depending on the underlying pathological condition. CONCLUSIONS: The ice water test has several potential applications but it is not needed in routine clinical practice. To date the main interest has been in patients with neurogenic bladder disorders. Further studies to investigate the validity and reliability of the ice water test in patients with idiopathic detrusor overactivity could prove useful.",M2

20215465,"Superheating of <e>ice</e> crystals in antifreeze protein solutions.It has been argued that for antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to stop ice crystal growth, they must irreversibly bind to the ice surface. Surface-adsorbed AFPs should also prevent ice from melting, but to date this has been demonstrated only in a qualitative manner. Here we present the first quantitative measurements of superheating of ice in AFP solutions. Superheated ice crystals were stable for hours above their equilibrium melting point, and the maximum superheating obtained was 0.44 degrees C. When melting commenced in this superheated regime, rapid melting of the crystals from a point on the surface was observed. This increase in melting temperature was more appreciable for hyperactive AFPs compared to the AFPs with moderate antifreeze activity. For each of the AFP solutions that exhibited superheating, the enhancement of the melting temperature was far smaller than the depression of the freezing temperature. The present findings clearly show that AFPs adsorb to ice surfaces as part of their mechanism of action, and this absorption leads to protection of ice against melting as well as freezing.",M2
20185615,"Motor and sensory nerve conduction are affected differently by <e>ice</e> pack, ice massage, and cold water immersion.BACKGROUND: It is well known that reducing tissue temperature changes sensory and motor nerve conduction. However, few studies have compared the effect of different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural (sensorial) and tibial motor nerves. DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters. METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after cooling. RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters. LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.",M2

In the driest ADV, perchlorate correlates with atmospherically deposited nitrate. Far from anthropogenic activity, ADV perchlorate provides unambiguous evidence that natural perchlorate is ubiquitous on Earth. The discovery has significant implications for the origin of perchlorate, its global biogeochemical interactions, and possible interactions with the polar ice sheets. The results support the hypotheses that perchlorate is produced globally and continuously in the Earth's atmosphere, that it typically accumulates in hyperarid areas, and that it does not build up in oceans or other wet environments most likely because of microbial reduction on a global scale.",M2
20154487,"[Evaluation of pain reduction upon injecting goserelin acetate using an <e>ice</e> pack]LH-RH agonist is the key drug in hormonal therapy for premenopausal patients with breast cancer. It is important to reduce the pain related to injecting the LH-RH agonist, because patients must continue the medication for several years. We developed a way to reduce the pain by cooling the needle injecting site with a frozen ice pack. 18 premenopausal postoperated women filled out a questionnaire on the severity of pain upon injecting Goserelin acetate compared with the pain without this cooling method and pretreatment. We estimated the pain by a Numerical Rating Scale(NRS). The NRS scores of this cooling method revealed the pain to be significantly less than by control method(p&lt;0. 005). This cooling method could be useful for the reduction of pain upon injecting the LH-RH agonist.",M2

20128930,"Old divergences in a boreal bird supports long-term survival through the <e>Ice</e> Ages.BACKGROUND: Unlike northern Europe and most of northern North America, the Eastern Palearctic and the northwesternmost tip of North America are believed to have been almost unglaciated during the Quarternary glacial periods. This could have facilitated long-term survival of many organisms in that area. To evaluate this, we studied the phylogeography in east Asia and Alaska of a boreal migratory passerine bird, the Arctic Warbler Phylloscopus borealis, and compared our results with published data on especially North American species. RESULTS: In a sample of 113 individuals from 18 populations we identified 42 haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which separated into three clades: A--Alaska and mainland Eurasia (except Kamchatka); B--Kamchatka, Sakhalin and Hokkaido; and C--Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (i.e. Japan except Hokkaido). The oldest split among these clades, between A/B and C, is estimated to have taken place sometime between the mid Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and the second divergence, between clades A and B, in the early to mid Pleistocene. Within all of the three main clades, there are signs of population expansion. CONCLUSIONS: The Arctic Warbler separated into three main clades in close succession around the Pliocene/Pleistocene border, with the two northern clades diverging last. All three clades probably experienced population bottlenecks during the Pleistocene as a result of range shifts and contractions, but nevertheless survived and maintained their integrities. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic birds are noted to have diversified during the Pliocene. In contrast, avian species or phylogroups presently occupying formerly glaciated North American ground are generally younger. The differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the Arctic Warbler, indicating common causes of their diversifications.",M2

This response has been confirmed in individuals with a history of joint pathology for the soleus but not in the peroneus longus and tibialis anterior. The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of ankle cooling on isokinetic eversion and inversion torque and in peroneus longus, tibialis anterior H-reflex (H(max):M(max)) in subjects with functional ankle instability (FAI). Twenty-four college aged subjects volunteered for this study. Peroneus longus and tibialis anterior H(max):M(max), and concentric eversion and inversion torque were recorded prior to and following each session. This protocol was used to compare FAI to healthy ankle group. There were no significant differences between groups. There were weak and no significant relationships between the corresponding muscles motoneuron excitability and their peak torque measurements. Ice application to the joint did not alter the peroneus longus or the tibialis anterior.",M2
20121260,"308 nm photolysis of nitric acid in the gas phase, on aluminum surfaces, and on <e>ice</e> films.We have studied the photolysis of nitric acid (HNO(3)) in the gas phase at 253 and 295 K, on aluminum surfaces at 253 and 295 K, and on ice films at 253 K, by using 308 nm excimer laser photolysis combined with cavity ring-down spectroscopy. We monitored both the ground-state NO(2) and the electronically excited NO(2), NO(2)*, produced from the HNO(3) photolysis. NO(2)* + OH is a predominant photolysis pathway (if not the only photolysis pathway) from the gas-phase photolysis of HNO(3) at 308 nm. The NO(2)* quantum yields from the HNO(3) photolysis on aluminum surfaces are 0.80 +/- 0.15 at 295 K and 0.92 +/- 0.26 at 253 K, where errors quoted represent 2sigma measurement uncertainty. The corresponding NO(2)* quantum yield from the HNO(3) photolysis on ice films is 0.60 +/- 0.34 at 253 K. The 308 nm absorption cross sections of HNO(3) on Al surfaces and on ice films have been directly measured. Absorption cross sections of HNO(3) on Al surface at 308 nm are (4.19 +/- 0.17) x 10(-18) and (4.23 +/- 0.45) x 10(-18) cm(2)/molecule at 253 and at 295 K, whereas the corresponding absorption cross section of HNO(3) on ice films is (1.21 +/- 0.31) x 10(-18) cm(2)/molecule at 253 K (errors quoted represent 2sigma measurement uncertainty). Atmospheric implications of the results are discussed.",M2
20116441,"<e>Ice</e> crystallization and freeze tolerance in embryonic stages of the tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum.In tardigrades, tolerance to low temperature is well known and allows them to cope with subzero temperatures in their environment. Although the ability to tolerate freezing body water has been demonstrated in some tardigrades, freeze tolerance of embryonic stages has been little studied, although this has ecological significance. In this study, we evaluated the subzero temperature survival of five different developmental stages of the eutardigrade species Milnesium tardigradum after freezing to -30 degrees C. Embryos were exposed to five different cooling rates between room temperature and -30 degrees C at 1 degrees C/h, 3 degrees C/h, 5 degrees C/h, 7 degrees C/h, and 9 degrees C/h followed by a warming period at 10 degrees C/h. The results showed that the developmental stage and the cooling rate have a significant effect on the hatching rate. Less developed embryonic stages were more sensitive to freezing at higher freezing rates than more developed stages. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the temperature of crystallization (Tc) in single embryos of the different developmental stages and revealed no differences between the stages. Based on the calorimetric data, we also conclude that the ice nucleation is homogeneous in embryonic stages in tardigrades, as also recently shown for fully developed tardigrades, and not triggered by nucleating agents.",M2
20110999,"Ensemble reconstruction constraints on the global carbon cycle sensitivity to climate.The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO(2) into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed gamma), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections. Here we quantify the median gamma as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO(2) data from three <e>ice</e> cores, provide robust constraints for gamma on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of &gt;200,000 members, quantification of gamma is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of gamma calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that gamma is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P &lt; 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of approximately 40 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest approximately 80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming.",M2

20092301,"Anthracene photolysis in aqueous solution and <e>ice</e>: photon flux dependence and comparison of kinetics in bulk ice and at the air-ice interface.We report an investigation of the photolysis kinetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous solution, frozen in ice, and at air-ice interfaces. Measurements of PAH photolysis rates in aqueous solution and at air-ice interfaces as a function of lamp power show that the kinetics depend nonlinearly on photon flux. In both media, the rates do not increase when lamp powers are above 0.1 W, which corresponds to total photon fluxes lower than 10(13) photon cm(-2) s(-1) in the actinic region. This suggests that extrapolating laboratory-measured rates to expected atmospheric photon fluxes may not yield accurate lifetimes for some species. In the plateau region of the photon flux dependence, anthracene located within the ice matrix (or in liquid pockets or veins in the ice) undergoes photolysis at a similar rate to that in room temperature aqueous solution, but the rate of anthracene photolysis at air-ice interfaces is five times greater. This indicates that in order to accurately predict the lifetimes of aromatic pollutants in snow and ice, the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) must be treated separately from bulk ice.",M2
20091326,"Biodiversity of air-borne microorganisms at Halley Station, Antarctica.A study of air-borne microbial biodiversity over an isolated scientific research station on an <e>ice</e>-shelf in continental Antarctica was undertaken to establish the potential source of microbial colonists. The study aimed to assess: (1) whether microorganisms were likely to have a local (research station) or distant (marine or terrestrial) origin, (2) the effect of changes in sea ice extent on microbial biodiversity and (3) the potential human impact on the environment. Air samples were taken above Halley Research Station during the austral summer and austral winter over a 2-week period. Overall, a low microbial biodiversity was detected, which included many sequence replicates. No significant patterns were detected in the aerial biodiversity between the austral summer and the austral winter. In common with other environmental studies, particularly in the polar regions, many of the sequences obtained were from as yet uncultivated organisms. Very few marine sequences were detected irrespective of the distance to open water, and around one-third of sequences detected were similar to those identified in human studies, though both of these might reflect prevailing wind conditions. The detected aerial microorganisms were markedly different from those obtained in earlier studies over the Antarctic Peninsula in the maritime Antarctic.",M2
20088486,"Direct observation of proton transfer in <e>ice</e> Ih using femtosecond spectroscopy.We studied proton transfer in ice samples containing the photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid and the base sodium formate using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Pump pulses, centered at a wavelength of 400 nm, electronically excited the photoacid molecules which released their protons. These protons subsequently traveled from the photoacid through the ice lattice to the base and were observed as they arrived at the base using the transient absorption of an infrared probe pulse. Both the temperature and concentration dependence of the proton transfer dynamics were modeled using a discrete set of two intrinsic transfer rates, associated with short and long-range proton transfer, respectively. Proton transfer in configurations where the acid and base were separated by up to about two water molecules, was found to occur on a approximately 1 ps time scale for all temperatures (240-270 K). Long range direct proton transfer through water wires of about four water molecules in length was found to occur on a approximately 300 ps time scale at 270 K. This latter process was observed to slow down significantly with decreasing temperature, with an activation energy of approximately 80 kJ/mol.",M2
20058107,"Determination of end point of primary drying in freeze-drying process control.Freeze-drying is a relatively expensive process requiring long processing time, and hence one of the key objectives during freeze-drying process development is to minimize the primary drying time, which is the longest of the three steps in freeze-drying. However, increasing the shelf temperature into secondary drying before all of the <e>ice</e> is removed from the product will likely cause collapse or eutectic melt. Thus, from product quality as well as process economics standpoint, it is very critical to detect the end of primary drying. Experiments were conducted with 5% mannitol and 5% sucrose as model systems. The apparent end point of primary drying was determined by comparative pressure measurement (i.e., Pirani vs. MKS Baratron), dew point, Lyotrack (gas plasma spectroscopy), water concentration from tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, condenser pressure, pressure rise test (manometric temperature measurement or variations of this method), and product thermocouples. Vials were pulled out from the drying chamber using a sample thief during late primary and early secondary drying to determine percent residual moisture either gravimetrically or by Karl Fischer, and the cake structure was determined visually for melt-back, collapse, and retention of cake structure at the apparent end point of primary drying (i.e., onset, midpoint, and offset). By far, the Pirani is the best choice of the methods tested for evaluation of the end point of primary drying. Also, it is a batch technique, which is cheap, steam sterilizable, and easy to install without requiring any modification to the existing dryer.",M2
20050662,"Thallium as a tracer for preindustrial volcanic eruptions in an <e>ice</e> core record from Illimani, Bolivia.Trace element records from glacier and ice sheet archives provide insights into biogeochemical cycles, atmospheric circulation changes, and anthropogenic pollution history. We present the first continuous high-resolution thallium (Tl) record, derived from an accurately dated ice core from tropical South America, and discuss Tl as a tracer for volcanic eruptions. We identify four prominent Tl peaks and propose that they represent signals from the massive explosive eruptions of the  unknown 1258  A.D. volcano, of Kuwae ( approximately 1450 A.D.), Tambora (1815 A.D.), and Krakatoa (1883 A.D.). The highly resolved record was obtained with an improved setup for the continuous analysis of trace elements in ice with inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). The new setup allowed for a stronger initial acidification of the meltwater and shorter tubing length, thereby reducing the risk of memory effects and losses of analytes to the capillary walls. With a comparison of the continuous method to the established conventional decontamination and analysis procedure for discrete samples, we demonstrate the accuracy of the continuous method for Tl analyses.",M2

These flavonol glycosides have very similar structures, but their supercooling-facilitating activities are very different. In this study, we analyzed the supercooling-facilitating activities of 12 kinds of flavonol glycosides in order to determine the chemical structures that might affect supercooling-facilitating activity. All of the flavonol glycosides tested showed supercooling-facilitating activity, although the magnitudes of activity differed among the compounds. It was clear that the combination of the position of attachment of the glycosyl moiety, the kind of attached glycosyl moiety and the structure of aglycone determined the magnitude of anti-ice nucleation activity. However, there is still some ambiguity preventing the exact identification of features that affect the magnitude of supercooling-facilitating activity.",M2
20039443,"Hepatocyte cryopreservation: is it time to change the strategy?Liver cell transplantation presents clinical benefit in patients with inborn errors of metabolism as an alternative, or at least as a bridge, to orthotopic liver transplantation. The success of such a therapeutic approach remains limited by the quality of the transplanted cells. Cryopreservation remains the best option for long-term storage of hepatocytes, providing a permanent and sufficient cell supply. However, isolated adult hepatocytes are poorly resistant to such a process, with a significant alteration both at the morphological and functional levels. Hence, the aim of the current review is to discuss the state of the art regarding widely-used hepatocyte cryopreservation protocols, as well as the assays performed to analyse the post-thawing cell quality both in vitro and in vivo. The majority of studies agree upon the poor quality and efficiency of cryopreserved/thawed hepatocytes as compared to freshly isolated hepatocytes. Intracellular <e>ice</e> formation or exposure to hyperosmotic solutions remains the main phenomenon of cryopreservation process, and its effects on cell quality and cell death induction will be discussed. The increased knowledge and understanding of the cryopreservation process will lead to research strategies to improve the viability and the quality of the cell suspensions after thawing. Such strategies, such as vitrification, will be discussed with respect to their potential to significantly improve the quality of cell suspensions dedicated to liver cell-based therapies.",M2
20030710,"Comparison of functional properties of two fungal antifreeze proteins from Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and Typhula ishikariensis.Antifreeze proteins are structurally diverse polypeptides that have thermal hysteresis activity and have been discovered in many cold-adapted organisms. Of these, fungal antifreeze protein has been purified and partially characterized only in a species of psychrophilic basidiomycete, Typhula ishikariensis. Here we report a new fungal antifreeze protein from another psychrophile, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus. We examined its biochemical properties and thermal hysteresis activity, and compared them with those of the T. ishikariensis antifreeze protein. The antifreeze protein from A. psychrotrophicus was purified and identified as an extracellular protein of approximately 28 kDa, which halved in size following digestion with glycosidase. The A. psychrotrophicus antifreeze protein generated bipyramidal <e>ice</e> crystals and exhibited thermal hysteresis activity (for example thermal hysteresis = 0.42 degrees C for a 0.48 mM solution) similar to that of fish antifreeze proteins, while a unique rugged pattern was created on the facets of the ice bipyramid. The thermal hysteresis activity of the A. psychrotrophicus antifreeze protein was maximized under alkaline conditions, while that of the T. ishikariensis antifreeze protein was greatest under acidic conditions. The T. ishikariensis antifreeze protein exhibited a bursting ice growth normal to the c-axis of the ice crystal and high thermal hysteresis activity (approximately 2 degrees C), as in the case of insect hyperactive antifreeze proteins. From these results, we speculate that the A. psychrotrophicus antifreeze protein is very different from the T. ishikariensis antifreeze protein, and that these two psychrophiles have evolved from different genes.",M2
20011523,"Synchrotron x-ray visualisation of <e>ice</e> formation in insects during lethal and non-lethal freezing.Although the biochemical correlates of freeze tolerance in insects are becoming well-known, the process of ice formation in vivo is subject to speculation. We used synchrotron x-rays to directly visualise real-time ice formation at 3.3 Hz in intact insects. We observed freezing in diapausing 3(rd) instar larvae of Chymomyza amoena (Diptera: Drosophilidae), which survive freezing if it occurs above -14 degrees C, and non-diapausing 3(rd) instar larvae of C. amoena and Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae), neither of which survive freezing. Freezing was readily observed in all larvae, and on one occasion the gut was seen to freeze separately from the haemocoel. There were no apparent qualitative differences in ice formation between freeze tolerant and non-freeze tolerant larvae. The time to complete freezing was positively related to temperature of nucleation (supercooling point, SCP), and SCP declined with decreasing body size, although this relationship was less strong in diapausing C. amoena. Nucleation generally occurred at a contact point with the thermocouple or chamber wall in non-diapausing larvae, but at random in diapausing larvae, suggesting that the latter have some control over ice nucleation. There were no apparent differences between freeze tolerant and non-freeze tolerant larvae in tracheal displacement or distension of the body during freezing, although there was markedly more distension in D. melanogaster than in C. amoena regardless of diapause state. We conclude that although control of ice nucleation appears to be important in freeze tolerant individuals, the physical ice formation process itself does not differ among larvae that can and cannot survive freezing. This suggests that a focus on cellular and biochemical mechanisms is appropriate and may reveal the primary adaptations allowing freeze tolerance in insects.",M2
20008812,"Microbiological and chemical analyses of <e>ice</e> collected from a commercial poultry processing establishment.A study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological and chemical characteristics of ice collected from a commercial poultry further processing facility.

The overall pattern for lowest to highest numbers of total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae was as follows: unused ice &lt; washed ice &lt; product-contact ice &lt; condemned ice. Mean levels of total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, and Enterobacteriaceae in the unused ice were 0.3, 0.4, and 0.4 log10 cfu/mL, respectively. No E. coli was detected in the unused or washed ice, and levels were 0.5 and 1.5 log10 cfu/mL in the product-contact and condemned ice samples, respectively. Mean levels of bacteria enumerated in condemned ice were 0.8, 1.0, and 0.6 log10 cfu/mL higher than the levels of bacteria found in product-contact ice for coliforms, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Washing and draining the product-contact ice decreased counts by 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.7 log10 cfu/mL for total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. All of the ice samples had similar pH values (pH 6.1 to 6.4). Unused and washed ice were not significantly different for total solids, total suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand. Condemned ice contained the highest concentration of total solids, total suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand, with levels more than 3 times that found in product contact ice. Data from the present study demonstrate that visible contamination in ice corresponds with increased microbiological and chemical contamination. Product-contact ice may be washed and the washing procedure can reduce the bacterial, solids, nitrogen, and organic loads.",M2

The images show numerous impact craters down to the resolution limit of approximately 10 meters per pixel. Small, bright craters within the dark hemisphere indicate a dark blanket thickness on the order of meters or less. Dark, equator-facing and bright, poleward-facing crater walls suggest temperature-driven water-<e>ice</e> sublimation as the process responsible for local albedo patterns. Imaging data also reveal a global color dichotomy, wherein both dark and bright materials on the leading side have a substantially redder color than the respective trailing-side materials.

Deposition of exogenic dark material on the leading side has been proposed as a cause, but this alone cannot explain the global shape, sharpness, and complexity of the transition between Iapetus' bright and dark terrain. We demonstrate that all these characteristics, and the asymmetry's large amplitude, can be plausibly explained by runaway global thermal migration of water ice, triggered by the deposition of dark material on the leading hemisphere. This mechanism is unique to Iapetus among the saturnian satellites because its slow rotation produces unusually high daytime temperatures and water ice sublimation rates for a given albedo.",M2

19937284,"Reduced pressure <e>ice</e> fog technique for controlled ice nucleation during freeze-drying.A method to achieve controlled ice nucleation during the freeze-drying process using an ice fog technique was demonstrated in an earlier report. However, the time required for nucleation was about 5 min, even though only one shelf was used, which resulted in Ostwald ripening (annealing) in some of the vials that nucleated earlier than the others. As a result, the ice structure was not optimally uniform in all the vials. The objective of the present study is to introduce a simple variation of the ice fog method whereby a reduced pressure in the chamber is utilized to allow more rapid and uniform freezing which is also potentially easier to scale up. Experiments were conducted on a lab scale freeze dryer with sucrose as model compound at different concentration, product load, and fill volume. Product resistance during primary drying was measured using manometric temperature measurement. Specific surface area of the freeze-dried cake was also determined. No difference was observed either in average product resistance or specific surface area for the different experimental conditions studied, indicating that with use of the reduced pressure ice fog technique, the solutions nucleated at very nearly the same temperature (-10 degrees C). The striking feature of the  Reduced Pressure Ice Fog Technique  is the rapid ice nucleation (less than a minute) under conditions where the earlier procedure required about 5 min; hence, effects of variable Ostwald ripening were not an issue.",M2
19933523,"Character, distribution and biological implications of <e>ice</e> crystallization in cryopreserved rabbit ovarian tissue revealed by cryo-scanning electron microscopy.BACKGROUND: Ovarian tissue banking is an emerging strategy for fertility preservation which has led to several viable pregnancies after transplantation. However, the standard method of slow cooling was never rigorously optimized for human tissue nor has the extent and location of ice crystals in tissue been investigated. To address this, we used cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) to study ice formation in cryopreserved ovarian tissue. METHODS: Rabbit ovarian tissue slices were equilibrated in 1,2-propanediol-sucrose solution and cooled at either 0.3 degrees C/min or 3.0 degrees C/min after nucleating ice at -7 degrees C, or snap-frozen by plunging in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were fractured, etched and coated with gold or prepared by freeze substitution and sectioning for cryo-SEM. RESULTS: The size, location and orientation of extracellular ice crystals were revealed as pits and channels that had grown radially between freeze-concentrated cellular materials. They represented 60% of the total volume in slowly cooled samples that were nucleated at -7 degrees C and the crystals, often &gt;30 microm in length, displaced cells without piercing them. Samples cooled more rapidly were much less dehydrated, accounting for the presence of small ice crystals inside cells and possibly in organelles. CONCLUSIONS: Cryo-SEM revealed the internal structure of ovarian tissue in the frozen state was dominated by elongated ice crystals between islands of freeze-concentrated cellular matrix. Despite the grossly distorted anatomy, the greater degree of dehydration and absence of intracellular ice confirmed the superiority of a very slow rate of cooling for optimal cell viability. These ultrastructural methods will be useful for validating and improving new protocols for tissue cryopreservation.",M2

Other opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms isolated from the beverages included species of Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Stenotrophomonas, Candida, and Serratia. Most of the identified bacteria showed resistance to one or more of the 11 antibiotics tested.

Natural contributions, mainly from mineral dust, have dominated the atmospheric cycles of As, Mo, Sn, and to some extent Sb during the 700 years prior to the 20th century. Compared to those of the pre-1900 period, pronounced increases of both concentrations and crustal enrichment factors are observed since the 1970s, with the highest increase factor for Sn and the lowest for As. Such increases are attributed to anthropogenic emissions of these elements, largely from stationary fossil fuel combustion and nonferrous metals production, particularly in India. Our central Himalayan ice core record provides an explicit recognition of rising atmospheric As, Mo, Sn, and Sb pollution in response to rapid economic growth in central Asia.",M2
19924318,"Parameterizations for <e>ice</e> nucleation in biological and atmospheric systems.Ice nucleation is an important process in numerous environmental systems such as atmospheric aerosol droplets or biological tissues. Here we analyze two widely used approaches for describing homogeneous ice nucleation in aqueous solutions with respect to their applicability to heterogeneous ice nucleation processes: the lambda approach and the water-activity-based approach. We study experimentally the heterogeneous ice nucleation behaviour of mineral dust particles and biological ice nuclei (Snomax; Pseudomonas syringae) in aqueous solutions as a function of solute concentration for various solutes (sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, glucose, and poly(ethylene glycol) with two different molar masses of 400 and 6000 g mol(-1)). We show that the ice nucleation temperature and the corresponding lambda values depend on both the type of ice nucleus and the type of solute, while the water-activity-based approach depends only on the type of ice nucleus when the solution water activity is known. Finally, we employ both approaches to the study of ice nucleation in biological systems such as the supercooling point of living larvae and insects. We show that the behaviour of freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding species can be described using the two approaches and we discuss how the analysis can be used to interpret experimental results of the freezing behaviour of living species.",M2
19897916,"Effect of the grain boundary of <e>ice</e> crystals in a frozen gelatin solution on the dielectric properties at a subzero temperature.The effect of the grain boundary of ice crystals in a frozen gelatin solution on the dielectric properties was investigated by the combination of a dielectric spectrometer and image analysis. A micro-slicer image processing system (MSIPS) was applied to measure the grain boundary properties as the perimeter density and number density of ice crystals. The perimeter density and number density of the ice crystals increased with increasing freezing rate. The dielectric properties of the frozen gelatin solution at various freezing rates were measured in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz at -40 degrees C. The relaxation time did not affect the grain boundary properties. The perimeter density and number density significantly affected dielectric parameter epsilon(0)-epsilon(infinity) and electrical conductivity sigma(0). These results indicate that the dielectric spectrometer could be used to estimate the grain boundary properties in a frozen gelatin solution.",M2
19888547,"Novel ultramicrobacterial isolates from a deep Greenland <e>ice</e> core represent a proposed new species, Chryseobacterium greenlandense sp. nov.Three novel orange, ultramicrobacterial isolates, UMB10, UMB14, and UMB34(T) were isolated from enrichment cultures inoculated with a melted 3,043 m deep Greenland ice core sample. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolates belonged to a single species within the genus Chryseobacterium. They were most closely related to Chryseobacterium aquaticum (99.3%), Chryseobacterium soli (97.1%), and Chryseobacterium soldanellicola (96.9%). Genomic hybridization showed low levels of relatedness between UMB34(T) and C. aquaticum and C. soldanellicola (19-30%) and C. soli and Chryseobacterium jejuense (45-56%). Comparative genomic fingerprinting analysis using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence showed nearly identical banding patterns for the three isolates and these patterns were distinct from those of C. aquaticum, C. soldanellicola, C. soli, and C. jejuense. The cells were short rods, lacked flagella, had cell volumes of &lt;0.1 mum(3), formed buds and smaller protrusions (blebs), produced copious extracellular material and a flexirubin type pigment. UMB34(T) produced acids from carbohydrates and utilized glucose and maltose although it did not assimilate mannose. The DNA G + C was 39.6-41.6 mol%. Based on the differences from validly named Chryseobacterium species, it was concluded that these isolates represent a new species for which the name, Chryseobacterium greenlandense is proposed. The type strain is UMB34(T) (=CIP 110007T = NRRL B-59357).",M2

In a first step, the mass-spectrometry conditions were optimized to quantify 48 compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, brominated diphenyl ethers, chlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorinated pesticides) at the low pg/L level. In a second step, the performance of this analytical method was evaluated to determine POPs in Arctic cores collected during an oceanographic campaign. Using a calibration range from 1 to 1800 pg/L and by adjusting acquisition parameters, limits of detection at the 0.1-99 and 102-891 pg/L for organohalogenated compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, respectively, were obtained by extracting 200 mL of unfiltered ice water. alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, DDTs, chlorinated biphenyl congeners 28, 101 and 118 and brominated diphenyl ethers congeners 47 and 99 were detected in ice cores at levels between 0.5 to 258 pg/L. We emphasise the advantages and disadvantages of in situ SBSE in comparison with traditional extraction techniques used to analyze POPs in ice.",M2
19878734,"Intracellular <e>ice</e> formation in insects: unresolved after 50 years?Many insects survive internal ice formation. The general model of freeze tolerance is of extracellular ice formation (EIF) whereby ice formation in the haemocoel leads to osmotic dehydration of the cells, whose contents remain unfrozen. However, survivable intracellular ice formation (IIF) has been reported in fat body and certain other cells of some insects. Although the cellular location of ice has been determined only in vitro, several lines of evidence suggest that IIF occurs in vivo. Both cell-to-cell propagation of intracellular ice and inoculation from the haemocoel may be important, although the route of ice into the cell is unclear. It is unclear why some cells survive IIF and others do not, but it is suggested that the shape, size, and low water content of fat body cells may predispose them towards surviving ice formation. We speculate that IIF may reduce water loss in some freeze tolerant species, but there are too few data to build a strong conceptual model of the advantages of IIF. We suggest that new developments in microscopy and other forms of imaging may allow investigation of the cellular location of ice in freeze tolerant insects in vivo.",M2
19853352,"Cold saline infusion and <e>ice</e> packs alone are effective in inducing and maintaining therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest.AIM OF THE STUDY: Hypothermia treatment with cold intravenous infusion and ice packs after cardiac arrest has been described and used in clinical practice. We hypothesised that with this method a target temperature of 32-34 degrees C could be achieved and maintained during treatment and that rewarming could be controlled. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients treated with hypothermia after cardiac arrest were included in this prospective observational study. The patients were cooled with 4 degrees C intravenous saline infusion combined with ice packs applied in the groins, axillae, and along the neck. Hypothermia treatment was maintained for 26 h after cardiac arrest. It was estimated that passive rewarming would occur over a period of 8h. Body temperature was monitored continuously and recorded every 15 min up to 44 h after cardiac arrest. RESULTS: All patients reached the target temperature interval of 32-34 degrees C within 279+/-185 min from cardiac arrest and 216+/-177 min from induction of cooling. In nine patients the temperature dropped to below 32 degrees C during a period of 15 min up to 2.5h, with the lowest (nadir) temperature of 31.3 degrees C in one of the patients. The target temperature was maintained by periodically applying ice packs on the patients. Passive rewarming started 26 h after cardiac arrest and continued for 8+/-3h. Rebound hyperthermia (&gt;38 degrees C) occurred in eight patients 44 h after cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous cold saline infusion combined with ice packs is effective in inducing and maintaining therapeutic hypothermia, with good temperature control even during rewarming.",M2
19846778,"Ultrafast photochemistry of methyl hydroperoxide on <e>ice</e> particles.Simulations show that photodissociation of methyl hydroperoxide, CH(3)OOH, on water clusters produces a surprisingly wide range of products on a subpicosecond time scale, pointing to the possibility of complex photodegradation pathways for organic peroxides on aerosols and water droplets. Dynamics are computed at several excitation energies at 50 K using a semiempirical PM3 potential surface. CH(3)OOH is found to prefer the exterior of the cluster, with the CH(3)O group sticking out and the OH group immersed within the cluster. At atmospherically relevant photodissociation wavelengths the OH and CH(3)O photofragments remain at the surface of the cluster or embedded within it. However, none of the 25 completed trajectories carried out at the atmospherically relevant photodissociation energies led to recombination of OH and CH(3)O to form CH(3)OOH. Within the limited statistics of the available trajectories the predicted yield for the recombination is zero. Instead, various reactions involving the initial fragments and water promptly form a wide range of stable molecular products such as CH(2)O, H(2)O, H(2), CO, CH(3)OH, and H(2)O(2).",M2
19842493,"<e>Ice</e> growth in supercooled solutions of a biological  antifreeze , AFGP 1-5: an explanation in terms of adsorption rate for the concentration dependence of the freezing point.It is widely accepted, and we agree, that the lowering of the temperature at which ice can grow in a water solution of one of the biological antifreezes is a result of adsorption of the antifreeze molecules at the ice surface. However, how this can produce a well-defined  freezing point  that varies with the solution concentration has remained problematical. The results of a series of measurements of ice growing in supercooled solutions of an effective antifreeze are reported and interpreted in terms of this fundamental problem. It seemed that the solution of the problem would have to rely upon adsorption rate, because that appeared to be the only way for the concentration in solution to be so important. The crystal growth results are most unusual, and appear to confirm this. The growth rates over a wide range of antifreeze concentration in solution (about 0.05 to 9 mg ml(-1)) are zero from the thermodynamic freezing point down to the  non-equilibrium  freezing point, where there is a very sudden increase to a plateau value that then remains about constant as the supercooling is increased by about 2 degrees C. The plateau values of growth rate are faster than those from pure water at the lower-supercooling ends of the plateaus, but slower at higher supercooling, until the growth rate starts rising toward that from pure water. These plateau values of growth rate increase markedly with increasing concentration of the antifreeze in solution. Along with these changes there are complex changes in the growth orientations, from c-axis spicules in the plateaus to those more characteristic of growth from pure water at greater supercooling. We conclude that the non-equilibrium freezing point is determined by the adsorption rate. It is the warmest temperature at which the ice growth rate on the basal plane (where the antifreeze does not adsorb) is fast enough to prevent the area of basal face on a growing ice crystal from becoming too small to grow, which is determined in turn by the adsorption rate on non-basal surfaces, which is proportional to the solution concentration. This mechanism answers the question of how the antifreeze stops growth rather than how it prevents growth, a subtle but important difference.",M2
19841917,"Bioprospecting for microbial products that affect <e>ice</e> crystal formation and growth.At low temperatures, some organisms produce proteins that affect ice nucleation, ice crystal structure, and/or the process of recrystallization. Based on their ice-interacting properties, these proteins provide an advantage to species that commonly experience the phase change from water to ice or rarely experience temperatures above the melting point. Substances that bind, inhibit or enhance, and control the size, shape, and growth of ice crystals could offer new possibilities for a number of agricultural, biomedical, and industrial applications. Since their discovery more than 40 years ago, ice nucleating and structuring proteins have been used in cryopreservation, frozen food preparation, transgenic crops, and even weather modification. Ice-interacting proteins have demonstrated commercial value in industrial applications; however, the full biotechnological potential of these products has yet to be fully realized. The Earth's cold biosphere contains an almost endless diversity of microorganisms to bioprospect for microbial compounds with novel ice-interacting properties. Microorganisms are the most appropriate biochemical factories to cost effectively produce ice nucleating and structuring proteins on large commercial scales.",M2
19824639,"Solution conformation of C-linked antifreeze glycoprotein analogues and modulation of <e>ice</e> recrystallization.Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are a unique class of proteins that are found in many organisms inhabiting subzero environments and ensure their survival by preventing ice growth in vivo. During the last several years, our laboratory has synthesized functional C-linked AFGP analogues (3 and 5) that possess custom-tailored antifreeze activity suitable for medical, commercial, and industrial applications. These compounds are potent inhibitors of ice recrystallization and do not exhibit thermal hysteresis. The current study explores how changes in the length of the amide-containing side chain between the carbohydrate moiety and the polypeptide backbone in 5 influences ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity. Analogue 5 (n = 3, where n is the number of carbons in the side chain) was a potent inhibitor of ice recrystallization, while 4, 6, and 7 (n = 4, 2, and 1, respectively) exhibited no IRI activity. The solution conformation of the polypeptide backbone in C-linked AFGP analogues 4-7 was examined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results suggested that all of the analogues exhibit a random coil conformation in solution and that the dramatic increase in IRI activity observed with 5 is not due to a change in long-range solution conformation. Variable-temperature (1)H NMR studies on truncated analogues 26-28 failed to elucidate the presence of persistent intramolecular bonds between the amide in the side chain and the peptide backbone. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on these analogues also failed to show persistent intramolecular hydrogen bonds. However, the simulations did indicate that the side chain of IRI-active analogue 26 (n = 3) adopts a unique short-range solution conformation in which it is folded back onto the peptide backbone, orienting the more hydrophilic face of the carbohydrate moiety away from the bulk solvent. In contrast, the solution conformation of IRI-inactive analogues 25, 27, and 28 had fully extended side chains, with the carbohydrate moiety being exposed to bulk solvent. These results illustrate how subtle changes in conformation and carbohydrate orientation dramatically influence IRI activity in C-linked AFGP analogues.",M2
19799658,"Gel strengthening effect of wood extract on surimi produced from mackerel stored in <e>ice</e>.The effect of ethanolic kiam wood extract (EKWE) and commercial tannin (CT) on the gel properties of surimi produced from mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) stored in ice for different times (0 to 12 d) was studied. During 12 d of iced storage, pH, total volatile base (TVB), trimethylamine (TMA), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble peptide contents as well as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) of mackerel mince increased while myosin heavy chain (MHC) band intensity decreased continuously (P &lt; 0.05). The result suggested that deterioration, protein degradation, and lipid oxidation proceeded with increasing storage time. For corresponding surimi, TVB and TMA were almost removed and TBARS and TCA soluble peptide contents were decreased. Conversely, MHC became more concentrated. Decreases in gel-forming ability of surimi were observed when fish used as raw material were stored in ice for a longer time, regardless of EKWE or CT addition. Whiteness of surimi gel decreased and expressible moisture increased especially when the storage time increased. However, superior breaking force and deformation of surimi gel with 0.15% EKWE or 0.30% CT added, compared to those of the control gel were observed during the first 6 d of the storage. Thereafter, EKWE and CT had no gel enhancing effect on surimi. Therefore, freshness was a crucial factor determining gel enhancing ability of EKWE or CT toward mackerel surimi.",M2
19787712,"The effect of intravesical oxybutynin on the <e>ice</e> water test and on electrical perception thresholds in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity.AIMS: The C-fiber-mediated bladder-cooling reflex and the determination of the current perception thresholds (CPTs) permit to investigate afferent LUT pathways. They have both been proposed to detect and differentiate neurologic bladder dysfunction. This study evaluates, prospectively, the effect of oxybutynin, an antimuscarinic with direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle, on repeated ice water test (IWT) and CPTs in patients with a known incomplete neurogenic bladder. METHODS: Patients with a known incomplete lesion of the bladder innervation, detrusor overactivity during cystometric bladder filling and a continuous positive response to repeated IWT were included. After the initial tests, 30 mg intravesical oxybutynin (1 mg/ml) was instilled and left in the bladder for 15 min. Afterwards CPTs and IWT were re-assessed. RESULTS: After the drug application, the bladder-cooling reflex could not be initiated, even after three instillations, in 16/17 patients. The bladder CPT increased from 29.7 +/- 11.3 to 39.1 +/- 15.7 mA after oxybutynin (P = 0.001). No difference was found in CPT of the left forearm (P = 0.208). CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical oxybutynin blocks the bladder-cooling reflex and increases but does not block CPT sensation in the bladder in most patients with incomplete neurogenic lesion and detrusor overactivity. These results help explain the clinical effect of intravesical oxybutynin in neurogenic patients. They also indicate that a pharmacological local influence on C-fiber-related activity can give different clinical effects.",M2

Near-infrared spectra of the largest example confirm this composition, and repeated imaging showed fading over several months, as expected for sublimating ice. Thermal models of one site show that millimeters of sublimation occurred during this fading period, indicating clean ice rather than ice in soil pores. Our derived ice-table depths are consistent with models using higher long-term average atmospheric water vapor content than present values. Craters at most of these sites may have excavated completely through this clean ice, probing the ice table to previously unsampled depths of meters and revealing substantial heterogeneity in the vertical distribution of the ice itself.",M2
19778279,"Formation of uracil from the ultraviolet photo-irradiation of pyrimidine in pure H2O <e>ices</e>.The detection of nucleobases in carbonaceous chondrites such as Murchison supports the scenario in which extraterrestrial organic molecules could have contributed to the origin of life on Earth. However, such large molecules have not been observed to date in astrophysical environments, in particular, comets and the interstellar medium (ISM). The physico-chemical conditions under which nucleobases and, more generally, N-heterocycles were formed are unknown, as are their mechanisms of formation. In this work, H2O:pyrimidine ice mixtures were irradiated with UV photons under interstellar/cometary-relevant conditions to study the formation of pyrimidine derivatives, including the nucleobase uracil. Liquid and gas chromatography analyses of the samples produced in our experiments revealed the presence of numerous photoproducts among which 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil could be conclusively identified. The photostability of pyrimidine against UV photons was also studied, and we showed that it would survive from the ISM to the solar nebula if formed and preserved in ice mantles on the surface of cold grains. We propose pathways for the formation of 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil under astrophysically relevant conditions and discuss the possibility for such molecules to survive from the ISM to their delivery to Earth and other Solar System bodies.",M2
19778062,"Hofmeister effects of common monovalent salts on the beetle antifreeze protein activity.Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) noncolligatively depress the freezing point of a solution and produce a difference between the melting and freezing points termed thermal hysteresis (TH). While the mechanism of the enhancement effect is not well understood, various low-molecular-mass solutes including neutral salts have been identified to enhance the TH activities of AFPs. Here, the effect of monovalent salts on salting out an AFP from the beetle Dendroides canadensis (DAFP-1) on the <e>ice</e> was treated using a simple classical theory, and the relationship between the TH activity and the salt concentration was developed. The TH activities of DAFP-1 in the presence of the series of monovalent salts were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the salting-out constants of DAFP-1 by these salts were determined. This study demonstrates an indirect way to determine the salting-out constants of AFPs by these salts. The results suggest that the Hofmeister effect is a potential mechanism for the TH enhancement effects of some common monovalent salts.",M2

AFGP prevent ice growth giving rise to thermal hysteresis. The inhibiting action of AFGPs implies that polar fish contain ice to which AFGPs adsorb. Cryopelagic Pagothenia borchgrevinki, inhabiting the ice-laden waters of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, were assayed for ice and ice was found on skin, gills, in the intestine, and in the spleen. Two methods used to assess the number of ice crystals in spleens gave comparable results (12.1+/-1.9 and 22+/-3.8 per spleen). Attempts were made to measure the rate of uptake of ice by P. borchgrevinki held in cages immediately beneath the sub-ice platelet layer in McMurdo Sound; uptake was sporadic. Introduction of ice into fish by spray freezing a small patch of the integument resulted in detection of splenic ice after 1h, illustrating that a mechanism exists for ice transport from the periphery to the spleen. Splenic ice did not seem to be eliminated from fish held in ice-free water at -1.6 degrees C for approximately two months. The relatively small number of splenic ice crystals and the slow rate of ice uptake suggest efficient ice barriers exist in P. borchgrevinki.",M2
19729005,"Measurement of the size of intracellular <e>ice</e> crystals in mouse oocytes using a melting point depression method and the influence of intracellular solute concentrations.Characterization of intracellular ice formed during the cooling procedures of cells significantly benefits the development and optimization design of cryopreservation or cryosurgery techniques. In this study, we investigated the influence of the concentration of extracellular non-permeable and permeable solutes on the melting points of the intracellular ice in mouse oocytes using cryomicroscopy. The results showed that the melting points of the intracellular ice are always lower than the extracellular ice. Based on this observation and the Gibbs-Thomson relation, we established a physical model to calculate the size of intracellular ice crystals and described its relationship with the concentrations of intracellular permeating solutes and macromolecules. This model predicts that the increased concentration of macromolecules in cells, by increasing the extracellular non-permeating solute concentration, can significantly lower the required concentration of permeable solutes for intracellular vitrification. The prediction was tested through the cryomicroscopic observation of the co-existence of intracellular vitrification and extracellular crystallization during cooling at 100 degrees C/min when the extracellular solutions contain 5 molal (m) ethylene glycol and 0.3 to 0.6m NaCl.",M2

The use of centrifuged brine samples allowed to document vertical gradients in ice algal acclimation with 5 cm vertical resolution for the first time. Bottom ice algae (0-5 cm from ice-water interface) expressed low F(v)/F(m) (0.331-0.426) and low alpha (0.098-0.130 (micromol photons m(-2)s(-1))(-1)) in December. F(v)/F(m) and alpha increased in March and May (0.468-0.588 and 0.141-0.438 (micromol photons m(-2)s(-1))(-1), respectively) indicating increased photosynthetic activity. In addition, increases in rETR(max) (3.3-16.4 a.u.) and E(k) (20-88 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)) from December to May illustrates a higher potential for primary productivity as communities become better acclimated to under-ice light conditions.

19727513,"Homogeneous <e>ice</e> freezing temperatures and ice nucleation rates of aqueous ammonium sulfate and aqueous levoglucosan particles for relevant atmospheric conditions.Homogeneous ice nucleation from micrometre-sized aqueous (NH4)2SO4 and aqueous levoglucosan particles is studied employing the optical microscope technique. A new experimental method is introduced that allows us to control the initial water activity of the aqueous droplets. Homogeneous ice freezing temperatures and ice melting temperatures of these aqueous solution droplets, 10 to 80 microm in diameter, are determined. Homogeneous ice nucleation from aqueous (NH4)2SO4 particles 5-39 wt% in concentration and aqueous levoglucosan particles with initial water activities of 0.85-0.99 yield upper limits of the homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients of up to 1x10(10) cm(-3) s(-1). The experimentally derived homogeneous ice freezing temperatures and upper limits of the homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients are compared with corresponding predictions of the water-activity-based ice nucleation theory [T. Koop, B. P. Luo, A. Tsias and T. Peter, Nature, 2000, 406, 611]. It is found that the water-activity-based ice nucleation theory can capture the experimentally derived ice freezing temperatures and homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients of the aqueous (NH4)2SO4 and aqueous levoglucosan particles. However, the level of agreement between experimentally derived and predicted values, in particular for homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients, crucially depends on the extrapolation method to obtain water activities at corresponding freezing temperatures. It is suggested that the combination of experimentally derived ice freezing temperatures and homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients can serve as a better validation of the water-activity-based ice nucleation theory than when compared to the observation of homogeneous ice freezing temperatures alone. The atmospheric implications with regard to the application of the water-activity-based ice nucleation theory and derivation of maximum ice particle production rates are briefly discussed.",M2
19727498,"Cloud condensation nuclei and <e>ice</e> nucleation activity of hydrophobic and hydrophilic soot particles.Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and ice nucleation behavior (for temperatures&lt;or=-40 degrees C) of soot aerosols relevant for atmospheric studies were investigated. Soots were chosen to represent a range of physico-chemical properties, from hydrophobic through a range of hydrophilicity, to hygroscopic. These characteristics were achieved through generation by three different combustion sources; three soots from natural gas pyrolysis (original: TS; graphitized: GTS; and oxidized: TOS), soot from a diffusion flame in an oil lamp burning aviation kerosene (TC1), and soot from a turbulent diffusion flame in an aircraft engine combustor (AEC). All of the samples exhibited some heterogeneity in our experiments, which showed evidence of two or more particle sub-types even within a narrow size cut. The heterogeneity could have resulted from both chemical and sizing differences, the latter attributable in part to particle non-sphericity. Neither GTS nor TS, hydrophobic particles distinguished only by the lower porosity and polarity of the GTS surface, showed CCN activity at or below water supersaturations required for wettable, insoluble particles (the Kelvin limit). TC1 soot particles, despite classification as hydrophilic, did not show CCN activity at or below the Kelvin limit. We attribute this result to the microporosity of this soot. In contrast, oxidized, non-porous, and hydrophilic TOS particles exhibited CCN activation at very near the Kelvin limit, with a small percentage of these particles CCN-active even at lower supersaturations. Due to containing a range of surface coverage of organic and inorganic hydrophilic and hygroscopic compounds, up to approximately 35% of hygroscopic AEC particles were active as CCN, with a small percentage of these particles CCN-active at lower supersaturations. In ice nucleation experiments below -40 degrees C, AEC particles nucleated ice near the expected condition for homogeneous freezing of water from aqueous solutions. In contrast, GTS, TS, and TC1 required relative humidity well in excess of water saturation at -40 degrees C for ice formation. GTS particles required water supersaturation conditions for ice activation even at -51 degrees C. At -51 to -57 degrees C, ice formation in particles with electrical mobility diameter of 200 nm occurred in up to 1 in 1000 TS and TC1 particles, and 1 in 100 TOS particles, at relative humidities below those required for homogeneous freezing in aqueous solutions. Our results suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleation is favored in cirrus conditions on oxidized hydrophilic soot of intermediate polarity. Simple considerations suggest that the impact of hydrophilic soot particles on cirrus cloud formation would be most likely in regions of elevated atmospheric soot number concentrations. The ice formation properties of AEC soot are reasonably consistent with present understanding of the conditions required for aircraft contrail formation and the proportion of soot expected to nucleate under such conditions.",M2

Gutting of hake noticeably affected the development of gram-negative bacteria: counts of Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Pseudomonas throughout ice storage were higher in gutted than in ungutted samples. These differences in microbial loads were also reflected in the lower sensory scores of both raw and cooked hake, in the quicker trimethylamine accumulation, and in the higher contents of putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, and histamine found in gutted hake. All of the fish quality indicators studied showed that gutting made hake more susceptible to spoilage during ice storage and decreased its shelf life by 4 days.",M2
19708368,"A new method for high-resolution methane measurements on polar <e>ice</e> cores using continuous flow analysis.Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Rapid variations of the CH4 concentration, as frequently registered, for example, during the last ice age, have been used as reliable time markers for the definition of a common time scale of polar ice cores. In addition, these variations indicate changes in the sources of methane primarily associated with the presence of wetlands. In order to determine the exact time evolution of such fast concentration changes, CH4 measurements of the highest resolution in the ice core archive are required. Here, we present a new, semicontinuous and field-deployable CH4 detection method, which was incorporated in a continuous flow analysis (CFA) system. In CFA, samples cut along the axis of an ice core are melted at a melt speed of typically 3.5 cm/min. The air from bubbles in the ice core is extracted continuously from the meltwater and forwarded to a gas chromatograph (GC) for high-resolution CH4 measurements. The GC performs a measurement every 3.5 min, hence, a depth resolution of 15 cm is achieved atthe chosen melt rate. An even higher resolution is not necessary due to the low pass filtering of air in ice cores caused by the slow bubble enclosure process and the diffusion of air in firn. Reproducibility of the new method is 3%, thus, for a typical CH4 concentration of 500 ppb during an ice age, this corresponds to an absolute precision of 15 ppb, comparable to traditional analyses on discrete samples.

The kinetics of this ice recrystallization process was studied at temperatures between -6 and -10 degrees C and varying ice volume fractions. Using the theory of Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner (LSW), the diffusion-limited rate constant for ice recrystallization was determined. Also, the effects of synthetic analogues of natural antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGP) were studied. These analogues synAFGPmi (i = 3-5) contained monosaccharide side groups instead of disaccharide side groups that occur in natural AFGP. In order to account for the inhibition effect of the synAFGPmi, we have modified classical LSW theory, allowing for the derivation of inhibition rate constants. It was found that the investigated synAFGPmi inhibit ice recrystallization at concentrations down to approximately 3 microg mL(-1) or, equivalently, approximately 1 micromol L(-1) for the largest synAFGPmi investigated: synAFGPm5. Hence, our new method is capable of quantitatively assessing the efficiency of very similar AFGP with a sensitivity that is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than that typical for quantitative thermal hysteresis measurements.",M2
19688941,"Loss of Arctic sea <e>ice</e> causing punctuated change in sightings of killer whales (Orcinus orca) over the past century.Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are major predators that may reshape marine ecosystems via top-down forcing. Climate change models predict major reductions in sea ice with the subsequent expectation for readjustments of species' distribution and abundance. Here, we measure changes in killer whale distribution in the Hudson Bay region with decreasing sea ice as an example of global readjustments occurring with climate change. We summarize records of killer whales in Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Foxe Basin in the eastern Canadian Arctic and relate them to an historical sea ice data set while accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the data. We find evidence for  choke points,  where sea ice inhibits killer whale movement, thereby creating restrictions to their Arctic distribution. We hypothesize that a threshold exists in seasonal sea ice concentration within these choke points that results in pulses in advancements in distribution of an ice-avoiding predator. Hudson Strait appears to have been a significant sea ice choke point that opened up .approximately 50 years ago allowing for an initial punctuated appearance of killer whales followed by a gradual advancing distribution within the entire Hudson Bay region. Killer whale sightings have increased exponentially and are now reported in the Hudson Bay region every summer. We predict that other choke points will soon open up with continued sea ice melt producing punctuated predator-prey trophic cascades across the Arctic.",M2
19680302,"Preventing winter falls: a randomised controlled trial of a novel intervention.AIM: To investigate the hypothesis that wearing socks over shoes improves traction on icy footpaths. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial involving 30 pedestrians (median age 21 years, range 18-70) travelling in a downhill direction on icy public footpaths at two sites in Dunedin, New Zealand. Intervention: different coloured socks applied over normal footwear or usual practice (unadulterated footwear). Primary outcome: difference in mean self-reported slipperiness on a 5-point scale. Secondary outcomes: falls, observer-rated slipperiness, observer-rated confidence, time to descend study slope. RESULTS: Two-thirds of participants (65%) had previously fallen on <e>ice</e>. Wearing socks over normal footwear was associated with a statistically significant improvement in traction; the difference in mean self-reported slipperiness scores between the control (n=15) and intervention (n=14) groups was 1.3 (95%CI: 0.4-2.3). Agreement between self-rated and observer-rated slipperiness was high (r=0.70). A higher proportion of the intervention group (71% vs 53%) appeared confident. One member of the control group fell. There was no evidence of risk compensation in the intervention group (difference in mean descent times 1.9 seconds, 95%CI: -6.1-10.0). The only adverse events were short periods of indignity for some members of the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Wearing socks over shoes appears to be an effective and inexpensive method to reduce the likelihood of slipping on icy footpaths.",M2
19680220,"Pseudo-outbreak of legionnaires disease among patients undergoing bronchoscopy - Arizona, 2008.Legionnaires disease (LD) is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia acquired by inhalation of aerosolized water containing Legionella bacteria. Legionella is a common cause of health-care--associated pneumonia, particularly in settings with hematopoietic stem-cell or solid-organ transplant recipients. On July 25, 2008, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) notified CDC of four patients who had Legionella cultured from specimens obtained during bronchoscopies performed at a medical center in Arizona. To characterize transmission and identify the source, ADHS and CDC began an investigation on August 1. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which determined that the patients did not have LD and that nonsterile <e>ice</e> used to cool saline-filled syringes for bronchoalveolar lavage was the likely source of Legionella contamination of these clinical specimens. Ice was supplied by two ice machines, which became contaminated by heavy Legionella colonization within the center's potable water supply during a 6-month period (February--July 2008). Findings from the investigation underscore the importance of adherence to recommended infection control practices and surveillance for LD in health-care settings. Clinicians and endoscopy technicians should ensure that nonsterile items are not introduced during bronchoscopy procedures.",M2

19670866,"No confinement needed: observation of a metastable hydrophobic wetting two-layer <e>ice</e> on graphene.The structure of water at interfaces is crucial for processes ranging from photocatalysis to protein folding. Here, we investigate the structure and lattice dynamics of two-layer crystalline ice films grown on a hydrophobic substrate, graphene on Pt(111), with low energy electron diffraction, reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, rare-gas adsorption/desorption, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Unlike hexagonal ice, which consists of stacks of puckered hexagonal  bilayers , this new ice polymorph consists of two flat hexagonal sheets of water molecules in which the hexagons in each sheet are stacked directly on top of each other. Such two-layer ices have been predicted for water confined between hydrophobic walls, but not previously observed experimentally. Our results show that the two-layer ice forms even at zero pressure at a single hydrophobic interface by maximizing the number of hydrogen bonds at the expense of adopting a nontetrahedral geometry with weakened hydrogen bonds.",M2

Such particles are typically found in many astronomical settings and in regions of planet formation. The instrument has participated in four parabolic flight campaigns to date, operating for a total of 2.4 h in reduced-gravity conditions and successfully recording over 300 separate collisions of loosely packed dust aggregates and <e>ice</e> samples. The imparted particle velocities achieved range from 0.03 to 0.28 m s(-1) and a high-speed, high-resolution camera captures the events at 107 frames/s from two viewing angles separated by either 48.8 degrees or 60.0 degrees. The particles can be stored inside the experiment vacuum chamber at temperatures of 80-300 K for several uninterrupted hours using a built-in thermal accumulation system. The copper structure allows cooling down to cryogenic temperatures before commencement of the experiments.

19655907,"Proton transfer and H/D isotopic exchange of water molecules mediated by hydroxide ions on <e>ice</e> film surfaces.The effect of hydroxide ions on proton transfer and H/D isotopic exchange of water molecules was examined at the surface of amorphous ice films at temperatures of 92-140 K. Excess hydroxide ions were provided onto a D(2)O-ice film by the hydrolysis of Na atoms, and H(2)O was adsorbed onto the surface for a submonolayer coverage. The H/D isotopic exchange between H(2)O and D(2)O molecules on the ice film surface was monitored as a function of reaction time and temperature by using the techniques of reactive ion scattering and low-energy sputtering. The result was compared with that obtained on a hydroxide-free ice film. At a temperature of 92 K, proton transfer occurred from water mostly to adjacent hydroxide ions. The proton transfer distance and the H/D exchange reaction rate increased with increase in temperature above 105 K. The H/D exchange reaction propagated to several water molecules on the surface at 100-120 K. Kinetic measurement in this temperature range deduced the Arrhenius activation energy for the reaction, E(a) = 9.6+/-2.0 kJ mol(-1). The study shows that hydroxide ions promote the H/D exchange reaction on the ice surface compared with that on a hydroxide-free ice surface, but the promotion effect is moderate and the H/D exchange occurs on a substantial energy barrier. It is suggested that the stabilization of hydroxide ions at the ice surface produces an energy barrier for the proton transfer.",M2

In addition, 1 outpatient had induced sputum cultured for mycobacteria in the pulmonary function laboratory. Of the samples obtained from these 21 patients, 26 isolates from respiratory samples and 1 isolate from a stool sample were identified as M. paraffinicum. Environmental isolates obtained from an ice machine in the patient care unit where the majority of the patients were admitted were also identified as M. paraffinicum.

19640147,"Effect of controlled <e>ice</e> nucleation on primary drying stage and protein recovery in vials cooled in a modified freeze-dryer.The freezing step influences lyophilization efficiency and protein stability. The main objective of this work was to investigate the impact on the primary drying stage of an ultrasound controlled ice nucleation technology, compared with usual freezing protocols. Lyophilization cycles involving different freezing protocols (applying a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 degrees C/min or 0.2 degrees C/min, putting vials on a precooled shelf, and controlling nucleation by ultrasounds or by addition of a nucleating agent) were performed in a prototype freeze-dryer. Three protective media including sucrose or maltodextrin and differing by their thermal properties and their ability to preserve a model protein (catalase) were used. The visual aspect of the lyophilized cake, residual water content, and enzymatic activity recovery of catalase were assessed after each lyophilization cycle and after 1 month of storage of the lyophilized product at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The freezing protocols allowing increasing nucleation temperature (precooled shelf and controlled nucleation by using ultrasounds or a nucleating agent) induced a faster sublimation step and higher sublimation rate homogeneity. Whatever the composition of the protective medium, applying the ultrasound technology made it possible to decrease the sublimation time by 14%, compared with the freezing method involving a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 degrees C/min. Concerning the enzyme activity recovery, the impact of the freezing protocol was observed only for the protective medium involving maltodextrin, a less effective protective agent than sucrose. Higher activity recovery results were obtained after storage when the ultrasound technology or the precooled shelf method was applied. Controlling ice nucleation during the freezing step of the lyophilization process improved the homogeneity of the sublimation rates, which will, in turn, reduce the intervial heterogeneity. The freeze-dryer prototype including the system of controlled nucleation by ultrasounds appears to be a promising tool in accelerating sublimation and improving intrabatch homogeneity.",M2

19627693,"The effect of quantity of <e>ice</e> and size of contact area on ice pack/skin interface temperature.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of quantity of ice and contact area on ice pack/skin interface temperature during a 20-minute cooling period. DESIGN: Repeated measures. SETTING: Laboratory setting in an educational institution. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy males aged between 18 and 22 years. INTERVENTIONS: An ice pack was applied to the right thigh with compression using an elastic bandage. The effects of three packs measuring 18 cm x 23 cm containing 0.3, 0.6 and 0.8 kg of ice, and one pack measuring 20 cm x 25 m containing 0.6 kg of ice were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The reduction in temperature at the ice pack/skin interface during 20-minute ice applications was monitored at 1-minute intervals. RESULTS: The application of 0.8-kg and 0.6-kg ice packs led to a significantly greater decrease in the interface temperature compared with the 0.3-kg ice pack [0.8 kg vs. 0.3 kg: -2.35 degrees C, 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference -3.36 to -1.34 degrees C; 0.6 kg vs. 0.3 kg: -2.95 degrees C, 95% CI -4.07 to -1.83 degrees C]. No significant difference in temperature was found between the 0.6-kg and 0.8-kg ice packs (0.8 kg vs. 0.6 kg: 0.6 degrees C, 95% CI -0.12 to 1.32 degrees C, P&gt;0.05). The size of the contact area did not alter the degree of cooling significantly (difference between smaller and larger pack: 0.05 degrees C, 95% CI -0.93 to 1.03 degrees C, P&gt;0.05). The lowest temperature during ice application was reached after 8-9 minutes of cooling. CONCLUSION: Application of an ice pack containing at least 0.6 kg of ice leads to a greater magnitude of cooling compared with application of a 0.3-kg ice pack, regardless of the size of the contact area. Thus, clinicians should consider using ice packs weighing at least 0.6 kg for cold treatment.",M2
19624212,"The phase diagram of water at negative pressures: virtual <e>ices</e>.The phase diagram of water at negative pressures as obtained from computer simulations for two models of water, TIP4P/2005 and TIP5P is presented. Several solid structures with lower densities than ice Ih, so-called virtual ices, were considered as possible candidates to occupy the negative pressure region of the phase diagram of water. In particular the empty hydrate structures sI, sII, and sH and another, recently proposed, low-density ice structure. The relative stabilities of these structures at 0 K was determined using empirical water potentials and density functional theory calculations. By performing free energy calculations and Gibbs-Duhem integration the phase diagram of TIP4P/2005 was determined at negative pressures. The empty hydrates sII and sH appear to be the stable solid phases of water at negative pressures. The phase boundary between ice Ih and sII clathrate occurs at moderate negative pressures, while at large negative pressures sH becomes the most stable phase. This behavior is in reasonable agreement with what is observed in density functional theory calculations.",M2
19615991,"Effects of solution composition on the theoretical prediction of <e>ice</e> nucleation kinetics and thermodynamics.Predictions by various mathematical models of intracellular ice formation (proposed by Mazur, Pitt, Toner, and Karlsson, respectively) were compared to the known thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of ice formation in supercooled aqueous systems. The older models (Mazur, Pitt, and Toner) significantly underestimated the magnitude of colligative nonequilibrium freezing point depression in response to increased concentration of solutes, such as salts or cryoprotectants. Furthermore, kinetics predicted using phenomenological models (by Mazur and Pitt) exhibited implausible temperature-dependence, with the probability of intracellular ice formation being allowed to increase even at temperatures below the glass transition point. The Toner model, on the other hand, produced invalid results at temperatures below -48 degrees C. The Karlsson model was the only model that consistently yielded realistic predictions over a wide range of temperatures and solute concentrations, especially in the presence of cryoprotectant additives. To facilitate adoption of the Karlsson model of intracellular ice nucleation, the complete set of model equations has been collected and described in detail.",M2
19604535,"Inverse temperature dependence of Henry's law coefficients for volatile organic compounds in supercooled water.Upon supercooling, water expels volatile organic compounds (VOC), and Henry's law coefficients are increasing concomitant with decreasing temperature. This unexpected observation was found by measuring the VOC partitioning between supercooled water and gas phase in the temperature range from -5 degrees C to -15 degrees C for benzene, toluene, ethlybenzene, m-, p-, o-xylenes (BTEX), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). Aqueous standard solutions were analyzed using a static headspace method in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Dimensionless Henry's law coefficients (K(AW)) were calculated from measurements of the concentration of the VOCs in the headspace above the standard solutions at temperatures between -25 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The results show that the well known temperature dependence of Henry's law coefficients at temperatures above 0 degrees C is inversed upon decreasing the temperature below 0 degrees C and formation of supercooled water while decreasing the temperature to -15 degrees C. Upon further decrease of the temperature to -25 degrees C freezing of the supercooled water occurs. K(AW) values increase from 0.092 (benzene), 0.099 (toluene), 0.098 (ethylbenzene), 0.117 (m/p-xylene), 0.076 (o-xylene), 0.012 (MTBE) and 0.014 (ETBE at 5 degrees C to 0.298 (benzene), 0.498 (toluene), 0.944 (ethylbenzene), 0.327 (m/p-xylene), 0.342 (o-xylene), 0.029 (MTBE) and 0.041 (ETBE) at -25 degrees C, respectively. Inversion of Henry coefficients upon cooling the aqueous solutions to temperatures below 0 degrees C is explained by the increasing formation of <e>ice</e>-like clusters in the water below 0 degrees C. The VOC are expelled from these clusters resulting in enhanced VOC concentrations in the gas phase upon supercooling. Formation of ice upon further cooling to -25 degrees C results in a further increase of the VOC concentrations in the gas phase above the ice. The findings have implications for the partitioning of VOC in clouds between the gas phase, supercooled water droplets, aerosol particles and ice.",M2
19603643,"Sea <e>ice</e>-associated diet change increases the levels of chlorinated and brominated contaminants in polar bears.Two global environmental issues, climate change and contamination by persistent organic pollutants, represent major concerns for arctic ecosystems. Yet, it is unclear how these two stressors interact in the Arctic. For instance, the influence of climate-associated changes in food web structure on exposure to pollutants within arctic ecosystems is presently unknown. Here, we report on recent changes in feeding ecology (1991-2007) in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from the western Hudson Bay subpopulation that have resulted in increases in the tissue concentrations of several chlorinated and brominated contaminants. Differences in timing of the annual sea ice breakup explained a significant proportion of the diet variation among years. As expected from climate change predictions, this diet change was consistent with an increase in the consumed proportions of open water-associated seal species compared to ice-associated seal species in years of earlier sea ice breakup. Our results demonstrate that climate change is a modulating influence on contaminants in this polar bear subpopulation and may pose an additional and previously unidentified threat to northern ecosystems through altered exposures to contaminants.",M2

We investigate the oxygen site disorder by modeling the site displacement, obtained from periodic DFT calculations, as a function of the local hydrogen bond network. Then, using graph invariants to describe hydrogen bond fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit, we perform statistical mechanical calculations using the oxygen site displacement model developed here. We find that the probability distribution of the oxygen atom about its perfect lattice site more closely resembles the 100 model rather than the recently suggested 111 model, although both models represent a simplification of the actual site distribution. We also find a unimodel distribution for the hydrogen bonded oxygen-oxygen distance and a trimodel distribution for the nearest nonbonded oxygen-oxygen distance with a peak separation of approximately 0.1 A.",M2

19559692,"Isochoric preservation: a novel characterization method.Isochoric (constant volume) preservation is an alternative to traditional cryopreservation methods because it requires less cryoprotectant and is simple to operate. In order to validate that this method automatically minimizes the pressure for a given temperature, pressure and temperature data were collected from a specially designed pressure vessel. This vessel was then used to examine the effect of an isochoric environment on freezing point nucleation in an aqueous antifreeze protein solution, and to generate pressure-temperature phase diagrams for various cryoprotectant solutions. Our results show that the isochoric pressure vessel follows the pressure-temperature phase diagram of water, thereby minimizing the pressure for the given temperature. We also show that the nucleation temperature of the antifreeze protein in an isochoric vessel is lower than that of the isobaric method. Furthermore, the nucleation temperature decreased with increasing concentration in the isochoric vessel while the isobaric nucleation temperature showed no change. These results indicate that the isochoric environment imposes additional constraints on <e>ice</e> formation and warrants further study as these results may change when a different type of cryoprotectant is used. Finally, all of the cryoprotectant phase diagrams exhibited a similar pressure-temperature slope indicating that, regardless of the cryoprotectant used or the mechanism by which it suppresses freezing, isochoric freezing affects the molecules in the same manner. Together, all of these results indicate that the isochoric method of preservation is a valuable tool for characterizing the thermodynamic properties of cryoprotectants and has great potential as a cryopreservation method in the field of cryobiology.",M2

We found no temporal trend with muscle THg whereas a curvilinear relationship existed with the length of ice-free season: seals attaimed higher THg in short (2 months) and long (5 months) ice-free seasons. delta 15N and delta13C in muscle tissue did not illustrate significant trends with ice-free days. We estimated that the turnover time of THg in muscle was about twice as long as stable isotope turnover in muscle, possibly explaining the lack of trend with stable isotopes in association with ice-free duration. Our discussion explains how summer environmental conditions may influence the composition of prey (mercury exposure) available to ringed seals.

There was no difference in the rate of H. pylori infection in the iron-deficiency anemia groups, with or without pagophagia. Furthermore, oral intestinal iron absorption was not influenced by pagophagia and/or H. pylori infection.

19538955,"Thermodynamic aspects of vitrification.Vitrification is a process in which a liquid begins to behave as a solid during cooling without any substantial change in molecular arrangement or thermodynamic state variables. The physical phenomenon of vitrification is relevant to both cryopreservation by freezing, in which cells survive in glass between <e>ice</e> crystals, and cryopreservation by vitrification in which a whole sample is vitrified. The change from liquid to solid behavior is called the glass transition. It is coincident with liquid viscosity reaching 10(13) Poise during cooling, which corresponds to a shear stress relaxation time of several minutes. The glass transition can be understood on a molecular level as a loss of rotational and translational degrees of freedom over a particular measurement timescale, leaving only bond vibration within a fixed molecular structure. Reduced freedom of molecular movement results in decreased heat capacity and thermal expansivity in glass relative to the liquid state. In cryoprotectant solutions, the change from liquid to solid properties happens over a approximately 10 degrees C temperature interval centered on a glass transition temperature, typically near -120 degrees C (+/-10 degrees C) for solutions used for vitrification. Loss of freedom to quickly rearrange molecular position causes liquids to depart from thermodynamic equilibrium as they turn into a glass during vitrification. Residual molecular mobility below the glass transition temperature allows glass to very slowly contract, release heat, and decrease entropy during relaxation toward equilibrium. Although diffusion is practically non-existent below the glass transition temperature, small local movements of molecules related to relaxation have consequences for cryobiology. In particular, ice nucleation in supercooled vitrification solutions occurs at remarkable speed until at least 15 degrees C below the glass transition temperature.",M2

19502432,"Characterization of airborne microbial communities at a high-elevation site and their potential to act as atmospheric <e>ice</e> nuclei.Bacteria and fungi are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. The diversity and abundance of airborne microbes may be strongly influenced by atmospheric conditions or even influence atmospheric conditions themselves by acting as ice nucleators. However, few comprehensive studies have described the diversity and dynamics of airborne bacteria and fungi based on culture-independent techniques. We document atmospheric microbial abundance, community composition, and ice nucleation at a high-elevation site in northwestern Colorado. We used a standard small-subunit rRNA gene Sanger sequencing approach for total microbial community analysis and a bacteria-specific 16S rRNA bar-coded pyrosequencing approach (4,864 sequences total). During the 2-week collection period, total microbial abundances were relatively constant, ranging from 9.6 x 10(5) to 6.6 x 10(6) cells m(-3) of air, and the diversity and composition of the airborne microbial communities were also relatively static. Bacteria and fungi were nearly equivalent, and members of the proteobacterial groups Burkholderiales and Moraxellaceae (particularly the genus Psychrobacter) were dominant. These taxa were not always the most abundant in freshly fallen snow samples collected at this site. Although there was minimal variability in microbial abundances and composition within the atmosphere, the number of biological ice nuclei increased significantly during periods of high relative humidity. However, these changes in ice nuclei numbers were not associated with changes in the relative abundances of the most commonly studied ice-nucleating bacteria.",M2

Cells of strain UMB49(T) were small thin rods with a mean volume of 0.043 mum(3) and possessed 1 or 2 polar and/or 1-3 lateral very long flagella. The original colony pigmentation was brown-purple but after recultivation the colonies were translucent white to tan coloured. Strain UMB49(T) grew aerobically and under microaerophilic conditions. The strain produced catalase and oxidase, but did not reduce nitrate. Sole carbon sources included citrate, succinate, malate, lactate and alanine. The strain produced acid from l-arabinose, d-arabinose, l-xylose, d-xylose and d-ribose. The DNA G+C content was 59.0 mol%. Based on differential characteristics of strain UMB49(T) and recognized Herminiimonas species, it was concluded that strain UMB49(T) represents a novel species of the genus Herminiimonas, for which the name Herminiimonas glaciei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is UMB49(T) (=ATCC BAA-1623(T)=DSM 21140(T)).",M2
19492339,"<e>Ice</e> nucleation temperature influences recovery of activity of a model protein after freeze drying.The objective of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between ice nucleation temperature and recovery of activity of a model protein, lactate dehydrogenase, after freeze drying. Aqueous buffer systems containing 50 microg/mL of protein were frozen in vials with externally mounted thermocouples on the shelf of a freeze dryer, then freeze dried. Various methods were used to establish a wide range of ice nucleation temperatures. An inverse relationship was found between the extent of supercooling during freezing and recovery of activity in the reconstituted solution. The data are consistent with a mechanism of inactivation resulting from adsorption of protein at the ice/freeze-concentrate interface during the freezing process.",M2
20047158,"<e>ICE</e>/caspase 1 inhibitors and IL-1beta receptor antagonists as potential therapeutics in epilepsy.Epilepsy is a disabling neurological disorder that is characterized by recurring, unprovoked seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy affects approximately 30% of individuals with epilepsy; thus, one of the main challenges for epilepsy therapy is the development of alternative anticonvulsant approaches. The discovery that inflammatory mediators contribute significantly to the onset and recurrence of seizures in experimental models, as well as the presence of inflammatory molecules in human epileptogenic tissue, highlight the possibility of targeting specific inflammation-related pathways to control seizures that are otherwise resistant to the available anti-epileptic drugs. This review summarizes the proof-of-principle evidence, obtained in experimental disease models, demonstrating the anticonvulsant activity of specific anti-inflammatory drugs, such as inhibitors of IL-1-converting enzyme/caspase 1 and antagonists of IL-1beta receptors. Drugs that block IL-1beta actions have entered clinical trials as potential therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies, and may also have therapeutic potential in epilepsies associated with proinflammatory processes in the brain.",M3
19834516,"Imaging and therapy of experimental schwannomas using HSV amplicon vector-encoding apoptotic protein under Schwann cell promoter.Schwannomas are benign tumors forming along peripheral nerves that can cause deafness, pain and paralysis. Current treatment involves surgical resection, which can damage associated nerves. To achieve tumor regression without damage to nerve fibers, we generated an HSV amplicon vector in which the apoptosis-inducing enzyme, caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>), was placed under the Schwann cell-specific P0 promoter. Infection of schwannoma, neuroblastoma and fibroblastic cells in culture with ICE under the P0 promoter showed selective toxicity to schwannoma cells, while ICE under a constitutive promoter was toxic to all cell types. After direct intratumoral injection of the P0-ICE amplicon vector, we achieved marked regression of schwannoma tumors in an experimental xenograft mouse model. Injection of this amplicon vector into the sciatic nerve produced no apparent injury to the associated dorsal root ganglia neurons or myelinated nerve fibers. The P0-ICE amplicon vector provides a potential means of 'knifeless resection' of schwannoma tumors by injection of the vector into the tumor with low risk of damage to associated nerve fibers.",M3
19737897,"Bacillus anthracis capsule activates caspase-1 and induces interleukin-1beta release from differentiated THP-1 and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.The poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid (PGA) capsule is one of the major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis, which causes a highly lethal infection. The antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance and allows unimpeded growth of bacilli in the host. Recently, efforts have been made to include PGA as a component of anthrax vaccine; however, the innate immune response of PGA itself has been poorly investigated. In this study, we characterized the innate immune response elicited by PGA in the human monocytic cell line THP-1, which was differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hMoDCs). PGA capsules were isolated from the culture supernatant of either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a. PGA treatment of differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs led to the specific extracellular release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in a dose-dependent manner. Evaluation of IL-1beta processing by Western blotting revealed that cleaved IL-1beta increased in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after PGA treatment. Enhanced processing of IL-1beta directly correlated with increased activation of its upstream regulator, caspase-1, also known as IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). The extracellular release of IL-1beta in response to PGA was ICE dependent, since the administration of an ICE inhibitor prior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1beta. These results demonstrate that B. anthracis PGA elicits IL-1beta production through activation of ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, suggesting the potential for PGA as a therapeutic target for anthrax.",M3
19618605,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 exerts inhibitory effect on neointimal formation after vascular injury.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) on neointimal formation after vascular injury in the mouse, and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Vascular injury was induced by polyethylene cuff placement around the left femoral artery of IRF-1-deficient mice and C57BL/6J mice. The mRNA expressions of IRF-1, IRF-2, angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Neointimal formation after vascular injury was significantly greater in IRF-1-deficient mice than that in C57BL/6J mice (P&lt;0.05). In contrast, TUNEL-positive nuclei to total nuclei in the neointima and media in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) in the injured artery significantly attenuated in IRF-1-deficient mice compared to C57BL/6J mice (P&lt;0.05). The expressions of AT2 receptor as well as pro-apoptotic genes such as ICE and iNOS in C57BL/6J mice were up-regulated in response to vascular injury, but this upregulation was attenuated in IRF-1-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IRF-1 induces VSMC apoptosis and inhibits neointimal formation after vascular injury at least partly due to the upregulation of AT2 receptor, ICE and iNOS expressions. These results indicate that IRF-1 exerts an inhibitory effect on neointimal formation through the induction of apoptosis in VSMCs.",M3
19386010,"Use of gene profiling to evaluate the effects of a feed additive on immune function in periparturient dairy cattle.Objectives were to investigate mechanisms by which a nutritional supplement alters immunity in dairy cattle. Our hypothesis was that feeding this product to dairy cattle altered neutrophil gene expression. Eight periparturient Jersey cattle were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: control and treated. Control animals were fed a dry cow ration for 1 month prior to calving. The treated cows were fed the same ration supplemented with OmniGen-AF. Following calving, blood samples were taken and neutrophils were prepared after which RNA was extracted. Gene expression in neutrophils of treated versus control-fed animals was then assessed using bovine-total leukocyte (BOTL-5) arrays. Eighteen genes were differentially regulated in the experimental group and of these, twice as many were up-regulated as down-regulated. Patterns of changes indicated that the additive might alter neutrophil apoptosis, signaling and sensitivity. Two of the regulated genes [interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R)] were investigated in more detail using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Each was found to be elevated by the feeding of experimental product. Increased expression of ICE indicates potential for enhanced neutrophil expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a cytokine which plays roles in the inflammatory response and which stimulates adaptive immunity following innate immune activation. Altered expression of IL-4R indicates potential for changes in neutrophil apoptosis. The experiment identified mechanisms by which the additive altered neutrophil gene expression. While many nutrients support the immune system, we have shown that a non-traditional nutritional approach may also have utility in modulating immune function.",M3
19120479,"Inflammasomes: guardians of cytosolic sanctity.The innate immune system is critical in recognizing bacterial and viral infections to evoke a proper immune response. Certain members of the intracellular nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family detect microbial components in the cytosol and trigger the assembly of large caspase-1-activating complexes termed inflammasomes. Autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-1 zymogens within these inflammasomes leads to maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-18. The NLR proteins <e>ICE</e> protease-activating factor (IPAF), NALP1b (NACHT domain-, leucine-rich repeat-, and PYD-containing protein 1b), and cryopyrin/NALP3 assemble caspase-1-activating inflammasomes in a stimulus-dependent manner. Bacterial flagellin is sensed by IPAF, whereas mouse NALP1b detects anthrax lethal toxin. Cryopyrin/NALP3 mediates caspase-1 activation in response to a wide variety of microbial components and in response to crystalline substances such as the endogenous danger signal uric acid. Genetic variations in Nalp1 and cryopyrin/Nalp3 are associated with autoinflammatory disorders and increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Further understanding of inflammasomes and their role in innate immunity should provide new insights into the mechanisms of host defense and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",M3
19046143,"LPS increases the expression levels of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in mouse testes.PROBLEM: This study examined the effect of intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to adult male mouse on the expression levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and the IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) (IL-18 family) in their testes and spleen (control). METHOD OF STUDY: Adult mice were injected (intraperitoneally; i.p.) with saline (control) or LPS (2, 20, 100 microg/mL; 100 microL/mouse). After 3 and 24 hr, testes and spleen were collected. Testicular tissue was examined for IL-18 (by ELISA, real time PCR, and western blot analysis), IL-18R and ICE (western blot and real time PCR analysis) and spleen tissue was examined for the IL-18 family by real time PCR analysis. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Homogenates of mouse testes contain and express basal levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18 R. The expression levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18R were significantly increased 3 and 24 hr after intraperitoneal injection of LPS to mature mouse, as examined by ELISA, western blot and real time PCR analysis. However, the expression levels of IL-18, ICE and IL-18Ralpha in the spleen increased significantly only after 24 hr of LPS stimulation, as examined by real time PCR. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LPS increases the expression levels of the IL-18 family in mouse testis and spleen, but the time of expression differs between the two organs. The presence of IL-18 in the testes might be involved in the regulation of physiological and infection/inflammatory processes, and may be part of the autocrine/paracrine factors that control spermatogenesis. Further studies should be performed to confirm this possibility.",M3
18980715,"Protective effect of estrogen on apoptosis in a cell culture model of Parkinson's disease.OBJECTIVES: The protective effect of estrogen on the neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen on the apoptosis and dopaminergic function on a cultured cell model of PD. METHODS: The PD model was established by addition of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to PC12 cell culture. Estrogen was added to cell groups with MPP+ (Estrogen+MPP+), and without MPP+ (Estrogen only group). Cell viability, content of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), apoptosis ratio, expression of apoptosis-suppression protein Bcl-x and apoptosis-acceleration protein IL-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) were measured. RESULTS: Cell viability in the Estrogen+MPP+ group was similar to the control group but was higher than in the MPP+ group (P &lt; 0.05). The apoptosis ratios in the Estrogen+MPP+ group (33.6%), and the control group (31.3%), were also similar, but it was lower than in the MPP+ group (63.5%, P &lt; 0.05). Concentrations of Bcl-x were higher in the Estrogen+MPP+ group, whereas ICE concentrations were lower than in the MPP+ group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen suppresses apoptosis and improves cell viability in MPP+ induced injuries in the PC12 cells. The beneficial effects of estrogen on the PD model are due to the suppression of pro-apoptotic protein ICE, and stimulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x.",M3
18946358,"Helicobacter pylori infection upregulates interleukin-18 production from gastric epithelial cells.BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection induces a biased T helper type 1 (Th1) response that produces IFN-gamma and Fas ligand (FasL). Th1 cytokines are associated with apoptosis in the gastric epithelial cells. AIM: We aimed to define the role of the recently cloned IL-18, a IFN-gamma inducing factor, in gastric mucosal injury induced by H. pylori infection. METHODS: Twenty-seven gastric ulcer (GU) patients and 20 functional dyspepsia (FD) patients were enrolled in this study. Mucosal biopsy samples were obtained from the gastric antrum and GU site during endoscopy. Samples were used for histological examination, H. pylori culture and in-situ stimulation for 48 h in the presence of 10 microg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P. IL-18, IFN-gamma, and soluble FasL (sFasL) levels in culture supernatants were assayed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. IL-18, IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and caspase-3 were evaluated by western blotting in gastric cancer cell lines (MKN45) cocultured with H. pylori. RESULTS: All 27 GU patients and ten out of 20 FD patients were found to be H. pylori-positive, whereas ten FD patients were H. pylori-negative. Antral mucosal tissues from H. pylori-positive FD patients contained (P&lt;0.01) higher levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL than those from uninfected FD patients. IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL levels at the ulcer site were significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher than those at distant sites in the antrum. A significant relationship was seen between IL-18 and IFN-gamma levels at the ulcer site (r=0.7, P&lt;0.01). H. pylori eradication led to a significant decrease in the levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma, and sFasL at the ulcer site. Western blotting showed that IL-18, ICE, and caspase-3 were activated in gastric cancer cell lines cocultured with H. pylori. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that H. pylori infection enhanced mucosal injury by stimulating a Th1 response, which was mediated by IL-18 upregulation as well as activation of ICE and caspase-3.",M3
18831059,"Monoamine oxidase-B activity is not involved in the neuroinflammatory response elicited by a focal freeze brain injury.Cryolesion of the frontoparietal cortex in mice is a well-described brain injury paradigm that results in increased astrogliosis surrounding the lesion site and is accompanied by a prominent increase in the MAO-B levels in astrocytes. Whether these increased MAO-B levels contribute to cellular damage or modulate reactive astrocytosis remains unclear. MAO-B activity may contribute to cellular damage, since its metabolism products are highly toxic to the cells. Additionally, it has been suggested that MAO-B inhibition may regulate astrocytic reaction. In this study, we have determined the relative contribution of MAO-B activity to the outcome following freeze injury. Freeze injury induced a prominent increase of several inflammatory markers, including ICAM, Mac-1, EB22, and GFAP. Inhibition of MAO-B activity using the selective inhibitor PF9601N did not reduce this cryolesion-induced inflammatory response. Additional data revealed that the expression of several cryolesion-induced cell death genes, such as Fas, Rip, p53, and <e>ICE</e>, was not reduced in PF9601N-treated mice, evidencing that MAO-B activity did not contribute to cryolesion-induced cell death. Definitive functional analysis of the mice using the ladder beam task revealed that MAO-B inhibition did not improve the cryolesion-induced motor impairment. These data strongly suggest that, although MAO-B is highly expressed in the area surrounding the lesion site, its activity does not contribute to the cellular damage or play any role in regulating astrocytic reactivity.",M3
18705842,"Lipopolysaccharide increased the expression levels of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in murine Leydig cells.PROBLEM: This study examined the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the capacity of Leydig cells to produce and express interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and the IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) (IL-18 family), under in vitro conditions. METHOD OF STUDY: Primary Leydig cells (LCs) were isolated from murine testis by the Percoll technique, and cultured both in the presence and absence of LPS (0.1, 1, 5 microg/mL) for 3 and 24 hr. LCs were examined for their capacity to produce and express IL-18 family molecules by using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Leydig cells were shown to constitutively express IL-18, as examined by IHC, ELISA, Western blot and real-time PCR analysis. Addition of LPS to LC cultures was shown to significantly increase the basal levels of IL-18, in a dose- and time course-dependent manner, as examined by ELISA, Western blot and real-time PCR analysis. In addition, LPS increased LC cultures to express ICE and IL-18 R, as examined by real-time PCR analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LPS increased the capacity of murine LCs to produce the IL-18 family molecules. IL-18, in the testis, might be involved in the regulation of physiological and infection/inflammatory processes, and thus, could be a component of the autocrine/paracrine factor net that controls steroidogenesis and male fertility; further studies are needed to confirm this possibility.",M3
18632279,"Interleukin Converting Enzyme inhibition impairs kindling epileptogenesis in rats by blocking astrocytic IL-1beta production.An enhanced production of IL-1beta in glia is a typical feature of epileptogenic tissue in experimental models and in human drug-refractory epilepsy. We show here that the selective inhibition of Interleukin Converting Enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), which cleaves the biologically active form of IL-1beta using VX-765, blocks kindling development in rats by preventing IL-1beta increase in forebrain astrocytes, without interfering with glia activation. The average afterdischarge duration was not altered significantly by VX-765. Up to 24 h after kindling completion and drug washout, kindled seizures could not be evoked in treated rats. VX-765 did not affect seizures or afterdischarge duration in fully kindled rats. These data indicate an antiepileptogenic effect mediated by ICE inhibition and suggest that specific anti-IL-1beta pharmacological strategies can be envisaged to interfere with epileptogenic mechanisms.",M3
18304957,"Genetic variation in the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme associates with cognitive function. The PROSPER study.Inflammation is thought to play an important role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia in old age. The interleukin-1 signalling pathway may play a prominent role in this process. The gene encoding for interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) is likely to influence IL-1 beta levels. Inhibition of ICE decreases the age-related increase in IL-1 beta levels and may therefore improve memory function. We assessed whether genetic variation in the ICE gene associates with cognitive function in an elderly population. All 5804 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) were genotyped for the 10643GC, 9323GA, 8996AG and 5352GA polymorphisms in the ICE gene. Cross-sectional associations between the polymorphisms and cognitive function were assessed with linear regression. Longitudinal associations between polymorphisms, haplotypes and cognitive function were assessed with linear mixed models. All associations were adjusted for sex, age, education, country, treatment with pravastatin and version of test where appropriate. Subjects carrying the variants 10643C and 5352A allele had significantly lower IL-1 beta production levels (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, we demonstrated that homozygous carriers of the 10643C and the 5352A allele performed better on all executive function tests at baseline and during follow-up compared to homozygous carriers of the wild-type allele (all P &lt; 0.02). The haplotype with two variants present (10643C and 5352A) was associated with better executive function (all P &lt; 0.02) compared to the reference haplotype without variants. For memory function the same trend was observed, although not significant. Genetic variation in the ICE gene is associated with better performance on cognitive function and lower IL-1 beta production levels. This suggests that low levels of IL-1 beta are protective for memory and learning deficits. Inhibition of ICE may therefore be an important therapeutic target for maintaining cognitive function in old age.",M3
18299270,"Over-expression of IL-18, <e>ICE</e> and IL-18 R in testicular tissue from sexually immature as compared to mature mice.In this study we examined the cellular origin and the expression levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), which activates pro-IL-18, during normal maturation of murine testis. The levels of IL-18, IL-18R and ICE were significantly higher in testicular tissues and homogenates (but not in the spleen or liver) from sexually immature than mature mice. Immunohistochemical staining of testicular tissues from sexually immature and mature mice shows that testicular germ cells and Leydig cells/interstitial cells express higher levels of IL-18, as compared to other testicular cells. Peritubular cells of sexually immature and mature mice also expressed IL-18. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, over-expression of the IL-18 family in testicular tissues of sexually immature mice, as compared to mature mice, as well as the expression of IL-18 in the different stages of differentiation of testicular germ cells. Thus, our results may indicate involvement of the endocrine system (gonadotropins and testosterone) in the regulation of the testicular IL-18 family, which could be involved in the regulation of testicular functions, development and spermatogenesis under physiological conditions.",M3

17805543,"Regulatory molecules involved in inflammasome formation with special reference to a key mediator protein, ASC.The recent identification of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with leucine-rich repeats, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), has been garnering considerable attention. Activated PRRs form molecular complexes called inflammasomes, consisting of related proteins that include procaspase 1[interleukin (IL) 1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)]. Inflammasomes have been shown to facilitate molecular proximity, stimulate activation of procaspase 1, which consequently produces inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 and ultimately lead to the initiation of innate immunity. An adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), which recruits PRRs carrying the pyrin homologous domain (PYD) and procaspase 1 through PYD and CARD, respectively, is responsible for the formation of some inflammasomes and also activation of procaspase 1. In this review, our main attention will be directed to PYD region analysis of ASC to understand the interaction between PYD-carrying PRRs and ASC. Taking into consideration the other aspects of the ASC gene in the proapoptotic ability and down-regulation by methylation, the biological function of ASC will be discussed in relation to the epigenetic aspects of infection, inflammation, and cancer.",M3
17678975,"Evidence implicating matrix metalloproteinases in the mechanism underlying accumulation of IL-1beta and neuronal apoptosis in the neocortex of HIV/gp120-exposed rats.Neuroinflammation is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is one of the main mediators of inflammation, and IL-1beta expression in the brain is rapidly upregulated in response to acute and chronic insults. IL-1beta is synthesized as biologically inactive precursor (pro-IL-1beta), which is classically processed by caspase-1 [also known as interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)] into the active, mature cytokine. However, caspase-1/ICE-independent mechanisms of IL-1beta processing have recently been suggested. Here we report that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate in the maturation process (cleavage and activation) of IL-1beta in an in vivo model of HIV-associated neurodegeneration based on the intracerebroventricular injection of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. We show that, following gp120 exposure, MMP-9 and MMP-2, but not caspase-1/ICE, are rapidly induced. Pharmacological manipulation of MMPs activity, using the broad spectrum MMPs inhibitor GM6001, reduces the increase in IL-1beta immunoreactivity and the neuronal apoptosis induced by gp120. Taken together, these findings point to a critical role for MMPs in IL-1beta increase and consequent neurotoxicity triggered by gp120 in the neocortex of rat and suggest new links between IL-1beta processing and MMP activation during the neuroinflammatory process.",M3
17658666,"Expression of interleukin-18 is increased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.The inflammatory cytokines can initiate nerve cell degeneration and enhance the plaque production typically found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an inflammatory cytokine, which can induce the expression of interferon-gamma. This interleukin shares similarities with the IL-1 family of proteins. Like IL-1 beta, IL-18 is cleaved by caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>) to an active secreted form. We examined the expressions of IL-18, -1 beta and ICE in different brain regions from AD patients that were categorized with respect to the Braak stage, and age-matched with non-demented controls. The levels of total-RNA and protein of IL-18 and ICE were increased, especially in the frontal lobe of AD patients and this change was not modified by ApoE genotype. Immunohistochemistry of AD brain samples detected IL-18 in microglia, astrocytes, and surprisingly in neurons, and it is also co-localized not only with amyloid-beta plaques but also with tau. In CSF, elevated IL-18 level was detected only in men and it also correlated with CSF tau in MCI. IL-18 may thus be a potential biomarker for men. Plasma levels of IL-18 showed no correlation with the disease. In conclusion, amyloid-beta may induce the synthesis of IL-18, and IL-18 kinases involved in tau phosphorylation as a part of the amyloid-associated inflammatory reaction.",M3
17650954,"Insulin and IGF-1 mediated inhibition of apoptosis in CHO cells grown in suspension in a protein-free medium.When Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in suspension and deprived of serum, 40% of them became apoptotic after 72 hours, as determined by flow cytometry analysis of TUNEL-labelled cells. Cell viability, assessed by erythrocin B staining, decreased correspondingly. An increase in the total fraction of cells expressing interleukin converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; caspase 1), B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2,) and Bcl-2 associated x protein (Bax) was shown by antibody probing and subsequent flow cytometry. The p53 tumour suppressor gene product level remained low within the cell population. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) inhibited cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, and at 20 ng/ml, cell viability was maintained close to 100% and no apoptotic cells were detected. Also, insulin was shown to inhibit cell death - at 1.0 microg/ml, cell viability was 95%, whereas 10% of the cells stained for apoptosis. At the highest concentrations of IGF-1 and insulin, the expression of ICE, Bcl-2 and Bax was fully suppressed, whereas the p53 product level increased, despite still being detectable in a minority of cells. Under these conditions, IGF-1 may increase p53 expression to restrain abnormal cell proliferation. It is concluded that special attention should be paid to exposure and culture conditions that induce acquired susceptibility to a toxic insult, during the development and validation of cell-based assays.",M3
17572009,"The synthetic tellurium compound, AS101, is a novel inhibitor of IL-1beta converting enzyme.The organotellurium compound, trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O') tellurate (AS101) has been shown previously to exert diverse biologic activities both in vitro and in vivo. This compound was recently found to react with thiols and to catalyze their oxidation. This property of AS101 raises the possibility that it may serve as a cysteine protease inhibitor. In the present study, using a substrate-specific enzymatic assay, we show that treatment of caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta [IL-1beta] converting enzyme [<e>ICE</e>]) with AS101 inhibits its enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the results show that AS101 treatment causes a significant reduction in the active form of IL-18 and IL-1beta in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in human HaCat keratinocytes. We further demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of AS101 does not involve nitric oxide (NO) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), two possible regulators of IL-18 production, and does not occur at the mRNA level, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism of action. More importantly, AS101 downregulates IL-18 and IL-1beta serum levels in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, resulting in increased survival. Recent studies emphasize the pathophysiologic role of IL-18 and IL-1beta in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Thus, their blockage by the nontoxic compound, AS101, currently used in clinical studies, may provide clinical advantage in the treatment of these diseases.",M3

In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a caspase from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, named Hearm caspase-1. The 1,350 bp full-length cDNA contains an 885 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a Hearm caspase-1 proenzyme of 294 amino acids. The deduced protein is highly homologous to Spodoptera frugiperda Sf caspase-1 and Drosophila melanogaster <e>ICE</e> and has the highly conserved pentapeptide QACQG, the recognized catalytic site of caspases, suggesting that it is an effector caspase of the cotton bollworm. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that Hearm caspase-1 is expressed in embryos and the fat body, midgut and haemocytes of feeding and wandering larvae. Expression of Hearm caspase-1 in the haemocytes appears to be correlated with the pulse of ecdysone, and it is up-regulated by ecdysone agonist RH-2485, implying that Hearm caspase-1 activation is regulated by ecdysone.",M3
17473225,"Cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin converting enzyme inhibition in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of the interleukin converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) on cardiac inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and left ventricular function in an animal model of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in 24 Sprague-Dawley rats by injection of streptozotozin (STZ) (70 mg/kg). Diabetic animals were treated with the interleukin converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor (ICEI) (n = 12) or with a placebo (n = 12). Nondiabetic rats served as controls (n = 12). Left ventricular function was documented 6 weeks after induction of diabetes. Cardiac tissue was analyzed for the expression of cytokines, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, leukocyte and macrophage integrins, and collagen. Phosphorylation of Akt was analyzed by Western blot and apoptosis by Blc-2 and Bax measurements. RESULTS: Left ventricular function was significantly impaired in diabetic animals. This was accompanied by a significant increase of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, leukocytes and macrophages, and collagen content. In addition, the phosphorylation state of Akt was reduced. These changes were significantly attenuated in the diabetic group treated with ICEI. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac dysfunction is associated with cardiac inflammation in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both of these--cardiac dysfunction and inflammation--are attenuated after treatment with ICEI. These data suggest that anticytokine-based therapies might be beneficial in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",M3
17461983,"Elevated levels of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 in acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and apoptosis-specific immune activation play a major role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The role of systemic and coronary obtained inflammatory plasma protein interleukin-1beta precursor (IL-1betap), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and the apoptosis-specific caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (ccCK-18) are not known in ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from stable angina (SA, n = 34), unstable angina (UA, n = 37) and patients with AMI (n = 39). Coronary blood was acquired by means of thrombectomy devices (X-sizer) in AMI patients. IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Group comparisons were evaluated by parametric Tukey test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive values of IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 as compared to creatine kinase (CK) and troponin T (TnT) in order to relate these markers with the occurrence of myocardial damage. RESULTS: IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were identified to be significantly altered in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from AMI as compared to SA and UA. ROC curves were plotted and revealed that ccCK-18 is a novel sensitive marker for the detection of myocardial damage as compared to TnT or CK. (AUC ccCK-18 0.925, TnT AUC 0.62 and CK AUC 0.858.) Moreover, ICE and ccCK-18 were significantly increased at the site of coronary occlusion as compared to peripheral blood samples in AMI patients (both P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ACS is related to increased concentration of systemic soluble ICE and ccCK-18. Moreover, soluble ccCK-18 was identified to be a superior marker as compared to TnT or CK, for detection of myocardial damage.",M3
17393315,"The <e>ICE</e> inhibitor pralnacasan prevents DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice and suppresses IP-10 mRNA but not TNF-alpha mRNA expression.Previously we demonstrated an ameliorating effect of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor pralnacasan on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. This study investigates the effects of pralnacasan on cytokine expression in DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was induced by oral administration of DSS. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with the ICE inhibitor pralnacasan (50 mg/kg body weight twice daily). Body weight as well as the presence of occult blood or diarrhea was monitored daily. Subgroups were sacrificed at days 4, 8, and 11 after the beginning of DSS application. Cytokine profiles in colonic tissue were analyzed on the protein level by ELISA and on the mRNA level by real time RT-PCR. Administration of DSS led to an increase in IL-18, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma protein as well as IP-10 and TNF-alpha mRNA. The increase in IL-18 and IFN-gamma was reduced by ICE inhibition. Pralnacasan prevented DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. In C57BL/6 mice, the DSS-induced increase in IP-10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA, was completely prevented by ICE inhibition. In conclusion, prevention of colitis in C57BL/6 mice was associated with a suppresion of IP-10 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA expression, indicating that IL-18-mediated cytokine production is a key element in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis.",M3
17292624,"A novel role of interleukin-1-converting enzyme in cytokine-mediated inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression: Implications for neuroinflammatory diseases.Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-derived NO plays an important role in several neurological disorders. Understanding of mechanisms involved in the regulation of iNOS induction is of particular interest. Here, we investigated mechanisms of iNOS induction in rat astrocytes (AC) and in brain endothelial cells (BEC). We find that activation of AC or BEC with pro-inflammatory cytokines reveals a different cell-specific activation pattern for iNOS expression. Despite these differences, in both cell types iNOS expression and activity exclusively depends on the endogenous availability of bioactive IL-1beta as inhibition of <e>ICE</e> activity significantly decreases iNOS promoter activity, iNOS expression and enzyme activity. In summary, we here provide evidence that ICE represents a target for modulating iNOS expression and high-output NO formation in AC and BEC, to our knowledge the first report of a role of ICE in iNOS expression and the advantage of ICE inhibition in attenuating NO mediated inflammation and pathology.",M3
17278232,"Therapeutic effects of caspase-1 inhibitors on acute lung injury in experimental severe acute pancreatitis.AIM: To assess the therapeutic effect of Caspase-1 inhibitors (<e>ICE</e>-I) on acute lung injury (ALI) in experimental severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Forty-two SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: healthy controls (HC, n = 6); SAP-S group (n = 18); SAP-ICE-I group (n = 18). SAP was induced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate into the bile-pancreatic duct. HC rats underwent the same surgical procedures and duct cannulation without sodium taurocholate infusion. In SAP-S group, rats received the first intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline 2 h after induction of acute pancreatitis and a repeated injection after 12 h. In SAP-ICE-I group, the rats were firstly given ICE inhibitors intraperitoneally 2 h after induction of pancreatitis. As in SAP-S group, the injection was repeated at 12 h. Serum IL-1beta was measured by ELISA. Intrapulmonary expression of Caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The wet/dry weight ratios and histopathological changes of the lungs were also evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IL-1beta levels in SAP-S group were 276.77 +/- 44.92 pg/mL at 6 h, 308.99 +/- 34.95 pg/mL at 12 h, and 311.60 +/- 46.51 pg/mL at 18 h, which were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01, vs HC). In SAP-ICE-I group, those values were decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01, vs SAP-S). Intrapulmonary expression of Caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were observed in the HC group, while they were increased significantly in the SAP-S group (P &lt; 0.01, vs HC). The expression of IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA were decreased significantly in the SAP-ICE-I group (P &lt; 0.01, vs SAP-S), whereas Caspase-1 mRNA expression had no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The wet/dry weight ratios of the lungs in the SAP-S group were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05 at 6 h, P &lt; 0.01 at 12 h and 18 h, vs HC) and they were decreased significantly in the SAP-ICE-I group (P &lt; 0.05, vs SAP-S). Caspase-1 inhibitors ameliorated the severity of ALI in SAP. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1 activation, and overproduction of IL-1beta and IL-18 play an important role in the course of ALI, and Caspase-1 inhibition is effective for the treatment of ALI in experimental SAP.",M3
17215863,"Interleukin-1 superfamily genes expression in normal or impaired human spermatogenesis.Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that may play a role in contributing to the specific immune environment of mammalian testis and in regulating cell differentiation. We have determined the transcription activity of the IL-1 gene family (using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in two main functional testicular compartments (interstitial and intratubular ones), and in tissue homogenates obtained from patients with fertility disorders (spermatogenic arrest and testicular tumors). We observed the prominent expression of gene coding for IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) in a purified fraction of gametogenic cells (normal gonad). Caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e> - IL-1beta-converting enzyme) was highly expressed (on mRNA level) in interstitial compartments as well in testicular tumors (immune enhancement?). In addition we found, that the activity of IL-1RA gene decreased along spermatogenic alteration in an inversely related manner with IL-1alpha (from normal gonad through spermatogenic arrest to Sertoli cell only syndrome). Therefore, the quotient value of IL-1alpha/IL-1RA could potentially serve as the diagnostic molecular probe for spermatogenesis assessment. The precise level of mRNA for IL-1-IL-18 cytokines and their receptors, and specifically of the receptor antagonist in immune privileged gonad, could be one of the main factors responsible for maintaining testicular homeostasis, thus enabling generation of the mature spermatozoa.",M3
17138058,"sCD30, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentrations in heart transplant recipients.sCD30 and <e>ICE</e>/caspase-1 as apoptosis-regulating factors are suspected to be involved in the survival rate of immunocompetent cells during immunosuppression after allotransplantation. Serum CD30 and ICE/caspase-1 concentrations were estimated and associated with unspecific serum apoptosis marker--anti-Annexin V antibodies and myocardial biopsies results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 28 clinically stabile patients--heart transplant recipients at least 3 months after cardiac transplantation performed due to heart failure caused by ischaemic and/or congestive cardiomyopathy or/and primary valvular heart disease (26 men and 2 women, mean age=36.8 years, S.D.=7.6) with normal heart function assessed by use of ultrasound scan--were involved in the trial. The patients were divided and analyzed in two ways: first according to the results of elective endomyocardial biopsies and second to main immunosuppressive agent used. The enzyme immunoassay (CD30, Dako; interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/Caspase-1 ELISA and anti-Annexin V BENDER MedSystem) for soluble CD30, caspase-1 and anti-Annexin V autoantibodies serum levels was used. RESULTS: sCD30 and caspase-1 concentrations were non-significantly up-regulated in all analysed groups--with or without rejection signs or immunosuppressed with cyclosporine or especially tacrolimus. In contrast anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentration was non-significantly down-regulated also in all studied groups. Moreover in the group with signs of transplant rejection, strong negative correlation between anti-Annexin antibodies and rejection grade was observed (-0.65, p&lt;0.05). Biopsy results were comparable in groups treated with tacrolimus and cyclosporine A. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing tendency of sCD30 and caspase-1 as well as the decrease in anti-Annexin V autoantibodies concentrations in heart recipients could be the result of post-transplant apoptosis disturbances. This tendency seems to be inhibited in a greater degree by tacrolimus than by cyclosporine. Anti-Annexin V autoantibodies might be considered as negative rejection markers due to their strong negative correlation with the rejection grade.",M3

The caprolactam ring was used to constrain the P3 region of our inhibitors. This strategy proved to be effective for the synthesis of ICE inhibitors, maintaining key hydrogen bond interactions with the enzyme and invoking a preferred conformation for binding. Several compounds exhibited IC(50) values less than 10nM in a caspase-1 enzyme assay and less than 100nM in a THP-1 whole cell assay measuring IL-1beta production.

17107775,"Developmental and hormonal regulation of midgut remodeling in a lepidopteran insect, Heliothis virescens.Midgut tissue undergoes remodeling during metamorphosis in insects belonging to orders Lepidoptera and Diptera. We investigated the developmental and hormonal regulation of these remodeling events in lepidopteran insect, Heliothis virescens. In H. virescens, programmed cell death (PCD) of larval midgut cells as well as proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells began at 108 h after ecdysis to the final larval instar (AEFL) and proceeded through the pupal stages. Expression patterns of pro- cell death factors (caspase-1 and <e>ICE</e>) and anti-cell death factor, Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) were studied in midguts during last larval and pupal stages. IAP, Caspase-1 and ICE mRNAs showed peaks at 48 h AEFL, 96 h AEFL and in newly formed pupae, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis substantiated high caspase-3 activity in midgut at 108 h AEFL. Application of methoprene, a juvenile hormone analog (JHA) blocked PCD by maintaining high levels of IAP, downregulating the expression of caspase-1, ICE and inhibiting an increase in caspase-3 protein levels in midgut tissue. Also, the differentiation of imaginal cells was impaired by methoprene treatment. These studies demonstrate that presence of JHA during final instar larvae affects both midgut remodeling and larval-pupal metamorphosis leading to larval/pupal deformities in lepidopteran insects, a mechanism that is different from that in mosquito, Ae. aegypti where JHA uncouples midgut remodeling from metamorphosis.",M3
17020759,"Oxidized ATP decreases beta-actin expression and intracellular superoxide concentrations in RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes independently of P2X7 receptor.Periodate-oxidized 2',3'-dialdehyde ATP (oxidized ATP) has been used extensively as a selective antagonist at P2X(7) receptors, although P2X(7)-independent actions on pro-inflammatory cytokine release have also been reported. Because P2X(7) receptors in astrocytes have been suggested as potential targets of anti-inflammatory drug therapy, we examined the effect of oxidized ATP on beta-actin expression and superoxide production of RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes known to possess P2X(7) receptors. Oxidized ATP per se decreased beta-actin expression time and dose dependently. Treatment with oxidized ATP for 8 h caused an approximately 50% decrease in beta-actin expression whereas other P2 receptor antagonists, brilliant blue G (BBG), suramin and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), were not effective. In addition, oxidized ATP per se decreased the intracellular superoxide concentration, whereas ATP and the P2X(7) receptor-selective agonist 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) stimulated intracellular superoxide production, an effect inhibited by oxidized ATP. In addition, oxidized ATP neither affected cellular viability nor affected interleukin-1beta, converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)-like protease activity in these astrocytes. To further elucidate the mechanism, the effects of oxidized ATP on intracellular superoxide concentration and beta-actin expression were examined in a P2X(7) receptor-negative astrocyte cell line, IA-1g1. Oxidized ATP-induced a time-dependent decrease in intracellular superoxide concentration whereas oxidized ATP had no effect on beta-actin expression. Nevertheless, oxidized ATP altered f-actin cytoskeleton arrangement in IA-1g1 astrocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that oxidized ATP per se caused a cell specific decrease in beta-actin expression in RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes. In addition, oxidized ATP decreased intracellular superoxide concentrations and altered f-actin cytoskeleton arrangement in both P2X(7) receptor-positive and -negative astrocytes. Thus, we conclude from these results that the effects of oxidized ATP on actin and superoxide are mediated through mechanisms that are at least in part, independent of P2X(7) receptors.",M3

16886979,"Inactivation of caspase-1 in rodent brain: a novel anticonvulsive strategy.PURPOSE: Cytokines and related inflammatory mediators are rapidly synthesized in the brain during seizures. We previously found that intracerebral administration of interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta has proconvulsant effects, whereas its endogenous receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) mediates potent anticonvulsant actions in various models of limbic seizures. In this study, we investigated whether seizures can be effectively inhibited by blocking the brain production of IL-1beta, by using selective inhibitors of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>/caspase-1) or through caspase-1 gene deletion. METHODS: Caspase-1 was selectively blocked by using pralnacasan or VX-765. IL-1beta release was induced in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures by proinflammatory stimuli [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + adenosine triphosphate (ATP)] and measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL-1beta production during seizures was measured in the rat hippocampus by Western blot. Seizures were induced in freely moving mice and rats by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and recorded by EEG analysis. RESULTS: Caspase-1 inhibition reduced the release of IL-1beta in organotypic slices exposed to LPS+ATP. Administration of pralnacasan (intracerebroventricular, 50 microg) or VX-765 (intraperitoneal, 25-200 mg/kg) to rats blocked seizure-induced production of IL-1beta in the hippocampus, and resulted in a twofold delay in seizure onset and 50% reduction in seizure duration. Mice with caspase-1 gene deletion showed a 70% reduction in seizures and an approximate fourfold delay in their onset. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of caspase-1 represents an effective and novel anticonvulsive strategy, which acts by selectively reducing the brain availability of IL-1beta.",M3

METHODS: Rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model was developed by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and bilateral common carotid arteries (CCAs) 1 h after reperfusion. Using flow cytometry (FCM) and Northern blot hybridization, we calculated the number of apoptotic bodies and detected the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) mRNA. RESULTS: The apoptotic bodies in hippocampus analyzed by FCM peaked at appeared 24 h after reperfusion, and decreased about 54% and 40%, respectively, after treatment with isoflurane and sevoflurane, as compared with ischemic group. There was no significant difference in the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and ICE mRNA between the inhaled anesthetic groups and ischemic group in hippocampus 24 h after MCA/CCAs occlusion.

16817903,"Involvement of caspase 1 and its activator Ipaf upstream of mitochondrial events in apoptosis.PTP-S2/TC45 is a nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates p53 and induces caspase 1-dependent apoptosis. We analyzed the role of <e>ICE</e> protease-activating factor (Ipaf), an activator of caspase 1 in p53-dependent apoptosis. We also determined the sequence of events that lead to apoptosis upon caspase 1 activation by Ipaf. PTP-S2 expression induced Ipaf mRNA in MCF-7 cells which was dependent on p53. PTP-S2-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of Ipaf and also by an Ipaf-directed short-hairpin RNA. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was potentiated by the expression of caspase 1 (but not by a catalytic mutant of caspase 1) and required endogenous Ipaf. Doxorubicin treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in activation of exogenous caspase 1, which was partly dependent on endogenous Ipaf. An activated form of Ipaf induced caspase 1-dependent apoptosis that was inhibited by Bcl2 and also by a dominant inhibitor of caspase 9 (caspase 9s). Caspase 1-dependent apoptosis induced by doxorubicin was also inhibited by Bcl2 and caspase 9s, but caspase 1 activation by activated Ipaf was not inhibited by Bcl2. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was induced by caspase 1 and activated Ipaf, which was inhibited by Bcl2, but not by caspase 9s. Expression of caspase 1 with activated Ipaf resulted in the activation of Bax at mitochondria. Our results suggest that Ipaf is involved in PTP-S2-induced apoptosis and that caspase 1, when activated by Ipaf, causes release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c and Omi) through Bax activation, thereby functioning as an initiator caspase.",M3

These protein preparations are expensive to manufacture and administer, need to be injected and can cause allergic reactions. An alternative approach to lowering the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in inflammatory disease, is to inhibit the enzymes that generate these cytokines using cheaper small molecules. This paper is a broad overview of the progress that has been achieved so far, with respect to small molecule inhibitor design and pharmacological studies (in animals and humans), for the metalloprotease Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha Converting Enzyme (TACE) and the cysteine protease Caspase-1 (Interleukin-1beta Converting Enzyme, <e>ICE</e>).

16283677,"Small molecular anti-cytokine agents.The recent successful introduction of the anti-cytokine biologicals Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Anakinra has stimulated the search for anti-cytokine small-molecules. A number of molecular targets have been identified for the development of such small molecular anti-cytokine agents. The focus of this review will be on those inhibitors of cytokine production, which target either p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), or IL-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). P38 MAP kinase occupies a central role in the signaling network responsible for the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha, and regulates their biosynthesis at both the transcriptional and translational level. TACE and ICE are two proteases required for the processing of proTNF-alpha and proIL-1beta, respectively into their mature, proinflammatory form. Since the mid-1990s, a plethora of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, TACE, and ICE has been characterized in vitro, and individual representatives from all three inhibitor classes have in the meantime been advanced into clinical trials. This review will highlight the correlation between effective inhibition at the molecular target and cellular activity in functional assays of cytokine, particularly TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, production. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) will be discussed regarding activity at the respective enzyme target, but also with regard to properties required for efficient in vitro and in vivo cellular activity (e.g., oral availability, solubility, cell penetration, etc.).",M3

METHODS: Mouse models of ischemic ARF were treated with the specific ICE inhibitor AC-YVAD-CMK. A renal function assay and renal morphological studies were employed to estimate the renal protective effect of AC-YVAD-CMK. The survival rate of mouse models was also analyzed by a time series test. Furthermore, renal ICE activity, mature interleukin-18 (IL-18) protein expression and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA expression were also detected by fluorescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISA, and semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) increased remarkably in the model controls compared with the sham-operated groups (P&lt;0.01). Typical renal tubular necrosis was found in the model controls. Renal ICE activity, mature IL-18 protein expression, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were also increased significantly in the model controls compared with the sham-operated groups. The levels of BUN and Scr in the AC-YVAD-CMK therapy group were decreased significantly compared with the untreated model controls (P&lt;0.01). Renal tubulointerstitial lesion was also attenuated significantly (P&lt;0.05). AC-YVAD-CMK therapy alleviated the clinical features of ARF, and increased the survival rate (P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, AC-YVAD-CMK therapy also decreased ICE activity, mature IL-18 protein expression, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in renal tissue (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The selective ICE inhibitor AC-YVAD-CMK can effectively protect the kidney from acute ischemic lesions.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the activity of apoptosis in patients infected with hepatitis C before and during antiviral treatment. METHODOLOGY: 23 patients with hepatitis C were treated with Rebetron for 12 months. The concentration of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL in the serum and liver tissue was analyzed before treatment was begun. The concentrations of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment were also analyzed. The concentrations of IL-1beta, ICE and sFasL in the liver tissue of patients with hepatitis C were compared with the concentrations in liver tissue of patients with alcohol related liver damage, but not HBV or HCV infected. RESULTS: Only 35% of the patients eliminated HCV-RNA from the blood six months after treatment had ended. The concentration of ICE and IL-1beta in the liver tissue of patients with hepatitis C was compared to concentrations in the liver tissue of patients with alcohol related liver damage. The concentration of sFasL in the liver tissue was twice as high among patients with alcohol related liver damage in comparison to the patients with infected hepatitis C. In the control group sFasL and ICE were not confirmed in the serum. After antiviral therapy the number of patients with sFas ligand in the blood increased (before beginning treatment 1 patient, after 12 weeks 8 patients). The high concentrations of ICE and IL-1beta in the serum showed a tendency to decrease during 12 weeks of therapy in the successfully treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The HCV seems to be a mild stimulator of apoptosis. There was only a slight correlation between the morphology changes in the liver tissue and apoptosis in patients with HCV. There was no correlation between the success of the therapy and the apoptosis activity.",M3
16106098,"Release of IL-1beta via IL-1beta-converting enzyme in a skin dendritic cell line exposed to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene.We used a mouse fetal skin dendritic cell line (FSDC) to study the effect of the strong allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) on interleukin (IL)-1beta release and IL-1beta receptor immunoreactivity. Stimulation with DNFB (30 minutes) increased IL-1 release without changing the mRNA levels of the protein. Furthermore, DNFB increased transiently the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) activity, as measured with its fluorogenic substrate Z-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-AFC. The ICE inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK prevented the release of IL-1beta evoked by DNFB. Incubation of the cells with DNFB (30 minutes) strongly increased IL-1beta receptor immunoreactivity. The rapid effect of DNFB on the release of mature IL-1beta, without inducing an increase of IL-1beta mRNA in FSDC, suggests a posttranslational modification of pro-IL-1beta by ICE activity.",M3
16103071,"Caspase-1 is a direct target gene of ETS1 and plays a role in ETS1-induced apoptosis.ETS1, the founding member of Ets transcriptional factor family, plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, lymphoid cell development, transformation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Previous work has shown that ETS1 represses tumorigenicity of colon carcinoma cells in vivo, and that the p42-ETS1 protein bypasses a defect in apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells through the up-regulation of caspase-1 expression. In this report, we show that expression of p42-ETS1 inhibits tumorigenicity of colon cancer DLD-1 cells through induction of apoptosis in vivo. In support of the hypothesis that caspase-1 might be a target involved in the sensitization of DLD-1 cells to Fas-induced apoptosis by ETS1, overexpression of caspase-1 bypasses Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells as well. Furthermore, ETS1-mediated apoptosis was observed in MOP8 cells, a transformed mouse NIH3T3 cell line. To determine whether ETS1 activates the transcription of caspase-1, luciferase reporters driven by the wild-type and mutant caspase-1 promoters were generated. Both p51-ETS1 and p42-ETS1 transactivated the caspase-1 transcription and a functional Ets binding site is identified in the caspase-1 promoter. Wild-type caspase-1 promoter (pGL3-<e>ICE</e>) was strongly transactivated by ETS1 and this transactivation was dramatically diminished by the mutation of the potential Ets binding site (-525 bp). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed complex formation between this binding site and ETS1 proteins. Taken together, ETS1 transcriptionally induces the expression of caspase-1; as such, the regulatory control of caspase-1 expression by ETS1 may underlie the apoptotic susceptibility modulated by ETS1 in specific tumor cells.",M3

The synthesis of the tricyclic scaffold and conversion of it to a variety of target ICE inhibitors were accomplished in 4-5 steps.

15858021,"The Nef-mediated AIDS-like disease of CD4C/human immunodeficiency virus transgenic mice is associated with increased Fas/FasL expression on T cells and T-cell death but is not prevented in Fas-, FasL-, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-, or interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-deficient or Bcl2-expressing transgenic mice.CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-T-cell death is a frequent immunological dysfunction associated with the development of human AIDS. We studied a murine model of AIDS, the CD4C/HIV transgenic (Tg) mouse model, to assess the importance of the apoptotic pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis. In these Tg mice, Nef is the major determinant of the disease and is expressed in immature and mature CD4(+) T cells and in cells of the macrophage/myeloid lineage. We report here a novel AIDS-like phenotype: enhanced death, most likely by apoptosis (as assessed by 7-aminoactinomycin D and annexin V/propidium iodide staining), of Tg thymic and peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also more susceptible to cell death after activation in vitro in mixed lymph node (LN) cultures. However, activation-induced cell death was not higher in Tg than in non-Tg-purified CD4(+) T cells. In addition, expression of Fas and FasL, assessed by flow cytometry, was increased in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from Tg mice compared to that of non-Tg littermates. Despite the enhanced expression of Fas and FasL on Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Fas (lpr/lpr) and FasL (gld/gld) mutant CD4C/HIV Tg mice developed an AIDS-like disease indistinguishable from lpr/+ and gld/+ CD4C/HIV Tg mice, including loss of CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, CD4C/HIV Tg mice homozygous for mutations of two other genes implicated in cell death (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme [<e>ICE</e>], tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR-1]) developed similar AIDS-like disease as their respective heterozygous controls. Moreover, the double-Tg mice from a cross between the Bcl2/Wehi25 and CD4C/HIV Tg mice showed no major protection against disease. These results represent genetic evidence for the dispensable role of Fas, FasL, ICE, and TNFR-1 on the development of both T-cell loss and organ disease of these Tg mice. They also provide compelling evidence on the lack of protection by Bcl2 against Tg CD4(+)-T-cell death. In view of the high resemblance between numerous phenotypes observed in the CD4C/HIV Tg mice and in human AIDS, our findings are likely to be relevant for the human disease.",M3
15845887,"Proapoptotic effects of caspase-1/interleukin-converting enzyme dominate in myocardial ischemia.Caspase-1/interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) is a cysteine protease traditionally considered to have importance as an inflammatory mediator, but not as an apoptotic effector. Because of the dual functions of this caspase, the pathophysiological impact of its reported upregulation in hypertrophy and heart failure is not known. Here, the consequences of increased myocardial expression of procaspase-1 were examined on the normal and ischemically injured heart. In unstressed mouse hearts with a 30-fold increase in procaspase-1 content, unprocessed procaspase-1 was well tolerated, without detectable pathology. Cardiomyocyte processing and activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 occurred after administration of endotoxin or with transient myocardial ischemia. In post-ischemic hearts, procaspase-1 overexpression was associated with strikingly increased cardiac myocyte apoptosis in the peri- and noninfarct regions and with 50% larger myocardial infarctions. Tissue culture studies revealed that procaspase-1 processing/activation is stimulated by hypoxia, and that caspase-1 acts in synergy with hypoxia to stimulate caspase-3 mediated apoptosis without activating upstream caspases. These data demonstrate that the proapoptotic effects of caspase-1 can significantly impact the myocardial response to ischemia and suggest that conditions in which procaspase-1 in the heart is increased may predispose to apoptotic myocardial injury under conditions of physiological stress.",M3
15590467,"Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection in IL-1 beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, caspase-1) deficient mice.PURPOSE: Antibody neutralization studies have shown that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection, IL-1 beta is critical to regulation of the host inflammatory response, but mechanisms remain undetermined. To elucidate these mechanisms, caspase-1 knockout (ICE(-/-)) mice, that do not release mature IL-1 beta after endotoxin challenge, were tested. METHODS: Clinical scores, MPO activity (for PMN quantitation), bacterial plate count, semiquantitative RT-PCR, ELISA and TUNEL staining were used to characterize the inflammatory response after infection in knockout and C57BL/6 (B6) wild type mice. RESULTS: Clinical scores were significantly reduced in ICE(-/-) vs. B6 mice at 3, 5 and 7 days postinfection (p.i.). The decreased inflammatory response of ICE(-/-) mice was striking at 1 day p.i., and bacterial load also was significantly reduced in the cornea of the knockout mice at 3-7 days p.i. Knockout mice exhibited significantly increased mRNA and protein levels for IL-1Ra, the physiological regulator of IL-1 activity, and in addition, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells were quantitated in the corneal epithelium of ICE(-/-) vs. B6 mice at 1 day p.i. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that bacterial infection in the cornea of ICE(-/-) mice induces a reduced inflammatory response by: reduction in PMN and cytokines and chemokines that attract these cells to the cornea; enhanced apoptotic cell death in the infected epithelium; and increased IL-1Ra levels. The data also confirm the importance of IL-1 regulation in this model and suggest that ICE inhibition may be an attractive ancillary therapeutic strategy to control the host response to this pathogen.",M3
15517889,"Immunotherapy by gene transfer with plasmids encoding IL-12/IL-18 is superior to IL-23/IL-18 gene transfer in a rat osteosarcoma model.BACKGROUND: Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumors of bone or soft parts arising from bone-forming mesenchymal cells. Despite dramatic therapeutic advances, namely neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, progress is at a plateau. Cytokine-mediated gene therapy might represent a further advance in the therapy of the osteosarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We transfected UMR 108 osteosarcoma cells with different plasmids encoding IL-12, IL-23, proIL-18 and <e>ICE</e> (Interleukin-converting enzyme). IFN-gamma induction, which is known to induce antitumor effects mediated by the immune system, and cytotoxic effects of various cytokine combination were investigated. RESULTS: Our results show that local secretion of IL-12 by UMR 108 cells led to an induction of cytotoxic effects mediated by mononuclear cells, which were enhanced by additional administration of recombinant IL-18. In contrast to IL-18, IL-23 showed a moderate increase of IFN-gamma induction when transfected alone and could only slightly increase the IFN-gamma induction mediated by IL-12. IL-18 enhanced IFN-gamma induction when applied alone and was able to increase the IFN-gamma production that was induced by IL-12. CONCLUSION: IL-23 seems to be a less effective immuno-therapeutic for adjuvant treatment of osteosarcomas than IL-12 and IL-18, when taking only IFN-gamma induction into consideration.",M3
15383541,"INCA, a novel human caspase recruitment domain protein that inhibits interleukin-1beta generation.Using in silico methods for screening the human genome for new caspase recruitment domain (CARD) proteins, we have identified INCA (Inhibitory CARD) as a protein that shares 81% identity with the prodomain of caspase-1. The INCA gene is located on chromosome 11q22 between the genes of COP/Pseudo-<e>ICE</e> and ICEBERG, two other CARD proteins that arose from caspase-1 gene duplications. We show that INCA mRNA is expressed in many tissues. INCA is specifically upregulated by interferon-gamma in the monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937. INCA physically interacts with procaspase-1 and blocks the release of mature IL-1beta from LPS-stimulated macrophages. Unlike COP/Pseudo-ICE and procaspase-1, INCA does not interact with RIP2 and does not induce NF-kappaB activation. Our data show that INCA is a novel intracellular regulator of procaspase-1 activation, involved in the regulation of pro-IL-1beta processing and its release during inflammation.",M3

METHODS: Clinical score, histopathology, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, bacterial counts, and ELISA analysis were used to assess the efficacy of treatment initiated at 18 hours postinfection (p.i.) with ICE inhibitor versus placebo; and with ICE inhibitor plus ciprofloxacin versus placebo plus ciprofloxacin. Efficacy of the ICE inhibitor was also tested and evaluated for clinical score in experimental corneal infection induced by a clinical isolate and a ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial strain. RESULTS: Clinical scores were reduced at 3, 5, and 7 days p.i. in ICE inhibitor versus placebo-treated mice; reduced scores also were observed with a combined treatment (ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin). Further testing (MPO assay) revealed reduced PMN number, particularly striking in ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin versus placebo and ciprofloxacin-treated mice. Corneal protein levels for IL-1beta and MIP-2 also were reduced in mice treated with the ICE inhibitor versus placebo and in ICE inhibitor and ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin and placebo-treated mice. Treatment with ICE inhibitor also reduced clinical scores after corneal infection with a clinical isolate, KEI-1025, and with a ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa strain. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of IL-1beta by ICE together with ciprofloxacin to kill bacteria may provide alternate therapy to current treatment.",M3
15306164,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, but not caspase-1, prevents apoptosis and improves spatial memory of rats with twice-repeated cerebral ischemia.The effect of inhibition of PARP [(poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase], caspase-3 and caspase-1 on twice-repeated ischemia-induced apoptosis and memory impairment were examined. The twice repeated ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion method in which a 10 min ischemic episode was repeated once after 60 min. The spatial memory was assessed using 8-arm radial maze. The results of this study showed that the repeated ischemia impaired memory and induced apoptosis in hippocampus CA1 field after 7 days. Moreover, 3-aminobezamide (10 mg/kg i.v.), a PARP inhibitor, and Ac-DEVD-CHO (8.4 microg/5 microL i.c.v., bilaterally), a caspase-3 inhibitor, decreased apoptosis by 45% and 58% respectively. Both drugs reduced the error choices, but 3-aminobezamide additionally increased the correct choices and improved the memory when either drug was injected immediately after the ischemic insult. The results also showed that inhibition of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, <e>ICE</e> (caspase-1) by Z-ASP-DCB-CH2 (100 microg/kg i.c.v., bilaterally) neither decreased apoptosis (13% reduction) nor improved memory of the ischemic rats.

15140398,"A novel method for imaging apoptosis using a caspase-1 near-infrared fluorescent probe.Here we describe a novel method for imaging apoptosis in cells using a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe selective for caspase-1 (interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme, <e>ICE</e>). This biocompatible, optically quenched ICE-NIRF probe incorporates a peptide substrate, which can be selectively cleaved by caspase-1, resulting in the release of fluorescence signal. The specificity of this probe for caspase-1 is supported by various lines of evidence: 1) activation by purified caspase-1, but not another caspase in vitro; 2) activation of the probe by infection of cells with a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector (HGC-ICE-lacZ) expressing a catalytically active caspase-1-lacZ fusion protein; 3) inhibition of HGC-ICE-lacZ vector-induced activation of the probe by coincubation with the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD-cmk, but not with a caspase-3 inhibitor; and 4) activation of the probe following standard methods of inducing apoptosis with staurosporine, ganciclovir, or ionizing radiation in culture. These results indicate that this novel ICE-NIRF probe can be used in monitoring endogenous and vector-expressed caspase-1 activity in cells. Furthermore, tumor implant experiments indicate that this ICE-NIRF probe can be used to detect caspase-1 activity in living animals. This novel ICE-NIRF probe should prove useful in monitoring endogenous and vector-expressed caspase-1 activity, and potentially apoptosis in cell culture and in vivo.",M3
15067075,"Janus kinase 3 down-regulates lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1 beta-converting enzyme activation by autocrine IL-10.ProIL-1 beta processing by IL-1 beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and the subsequent release of mature IL-1 beta are highly regulated events in the monocyte/macrophage response to pathogens. This process occurs in a controlled way through the activation of the constitutively expressed 45-kDa ICE precursor (proICE). To characterize the signaling pathways involved in ICE regulation in human monocytes/macrophages, we analyzed ICE activation in the presence of specific inhibitors of classic signaling pathways. Although LPS-induced ICE activity was not significantly affected by interruption of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 kinase, or phosphoinositol 3-kinase, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibition produced a significant dose-dependent enhancement of LPS-induced ICE activity. Support for the inhibitory role of JAK3 was shown by the fact that IL-4 (which uses JAK1 and JAK3 signaling) suppressed LPS-induced ICE activity and by the finding that JAK3 knockout macrophages have increased LPS-induced ICE activation. To understand how JAK3 down-regulates LPS-induced ICE activity in monocytes, we hypothesized that JAK3 signaling enhances IL-10 production. In support of this model we show that LPS-induced IL-10 expression was synchronous with ICE deactivation, IL-4 induced the release of IL-10, exogenous IL-10 suppressed LPS-induced ICE activity, a neutralizing IL-10 Ab increased LPS-induced ICE activity, and, finally, JAK3 knockout macrophages displayed significantly reduced LPS-induced IL-10 production. These findings support a model in which JAK3 signaling enhances IL-10 production leading to down-regulation of ICE activation and suppression of IL-1 beta processing and release.",M3
15031635,"Gold sodium thiomalate and chloroquine inhibit cytokine production in monocytic THP-1 cells through distinct transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms.Gold sodium thiomalate (GST), chloroquine (CQ), and methotrexate have been widely used in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Using the human monocytic cell line THP-1 we have analyzed effects of these drugs on cytokine production and intracellular signaling. GST and CQ were equally effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1 beta release while CQ was a more effective inhibitor of TNF-alpha production than GST. Methotrexate did not affect production of these cytokines. CQ reduced IL-1 beta mRNA expression and strongly inhibited phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, and to a lesser extent c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In contrast, GST did not affect cytokine mRNA expression or MAPK activation. However, GST selectively inhibited the activity of the interleukin-1 converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1. These data demonstrate that CQ inhibits IL-1 beta release from monocytes by interfering with pretranscriptional signaling and TNF-alpha release by posttranslational events whereas GST downregulates IL-1 beta secretion by interfering with posttranslational IL-1 beta processing.",M3

15010463,"Anthrax lethal toxin rapidly activates caspase-1/<e>ICE</e> and induces extracellular release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18.Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor for Bacillus anthracis, has been demonstrated to cleave and to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) that propagate prosurvival signals in macrophages (1-5). Whether this action of anthrax LT leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages has been more controversial (6, 7). We now report that anthrax LT treatment leads to the specific extracellular release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 by the murine macrophage cell lines, RAW264.7 and J774A.1. Studies of the processing of IL-1beta reveal that the levels of activated/cleaved IL-1beta in RAW264.7 and J774.A1 cells are increased following treatment with anthrax LT. Enhanced processing of IL-1beta directly correlates with increased levels in the activation of its upstream regulator, IL-1beta-converting enzyme/Caspase-1 (ICE). The extracellular release of IL-1beta and IL-18 in response to anthrax LT is ICE-dependent, as an ICE-specific inhibitor blocks this process. These data indicate that ICE, IL-1beta, and IL-18 are downstream effectors of anthrax LT in macrophages, providing the basis for new bioassays for anthrax LT activity and representing potential therapeutic targets.",M3

14734619,"Roles of caspase-1 in Listeria infection in mice.Caspase-1 [IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)] processes substrate precursor molecules to yield the biologically active form of IL-1beta and IL-18, both of which are considered to play important roles in the host defense by activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. We evaluated the immune response of caspase-1(-/-) mice to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection. LM eradication in the early phase of infection was impaired in the mutant mice with a prominent decrease in IL-18 and IFN-gamma production, but not in IL-12. Caspase-1(-/-) spleen cells including dendritic cells and NK cells produced less IFN-gamma in response to heat-killed LM than wild-type cells in vitro. IFN-gamma production and bactericidal activity in LM-infected caspase-1(-/-) mice was reconstituted to normal levels by adding back IL-18 at the initial phase of infection, suggesting that the lack of this cytokine is primarily responsible for the susceptibility of caspase-1(-/-) mice against LM infection. Moreover, IFN-gamma injection of caspase-1(-/-) mice corrected the deficiency in pathogen clearance. In contrast, LM-specific acquired immunity in caspase-1(-/-) mice was normal and they successfully cleared the pathogen following secondary infection, in spite of a moderate skewing of cytokine profile to T(h)2 when compared to wild-type mice. These data shed light on the importance of caspase-1-mediated IL-18 processing in innate immunity against facultative intracellular pathogens.",M3

DESIGN: 80 consecutive patients with stable (n = 40) or unstable (n = 40) angina pectoris were studied. Serum concentrations of soluble CD95 (sCD95), soluble CD95 ligand (sCD95L; CD178), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, soluble TNFalpha receptor type 1 (sTNFR1), and interleukin 1beta converting enzyme (ICE; caspase 1) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Significant increases in the concentrations of sCD95 and ICE (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.023, respectively) were found in the serum from patients with unstable angina relative to those with stable angina. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of sCD95L, TNF alpha, and sTNFR1 between the groups.

Since both cytokines are constitutively expressed in the brain, we investigated whether this is also the case for caspase-1. Using an antibody raised against the p10-subunit of the active enzyme, constitutive expression of caspase-1 immunoreactivity was found in nerve cells in the arcuate nucleus and in nerve fibres throughout the brain.

The distribution pattern of caspase-1 immunoreactive structures is consistent with a role to produce mature IL-1beta in regions where IL-1beta mediates fever and sleep.",M3
14673996,"Gene deletion of either interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase, or stromelysin 1 accelerates the development of knee osteoarthritis in mice after surgical transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the development of osteoarthritis (OA) after transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy in mice in which genes encoding either interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), stromelysin 1, or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were deleted. METHODS: Sectioning of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy were performed on right knee joints of wild-type and knockout mice. Left joints served as unoperated controls. Serial histologic sections were obtained from throughout the whole joint of both knees 4 days or 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after surgery. Sections were graded for OA lesions on a scale of 0-6 and were assessed for breakdown of tibial cartilage matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan) and type II collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases with immunohistochemistry studies using anti-VDIPEN, anti-NITEGE, and Col2-3/4C(short) neoepitope antibodies. Proteoglycan depletion was assessed by Alcian blue staining and chondrocyte cell death, with the TUNEL technique. RESULTS: All knockout mice showed accelerated development of OA lesions in the medial tibial cartilage after surgery, compared with wild-type mice. ICE-, iNOS-, and particularly IL-1beta-knockout mice developed OA lesions in the lateral cartilage of unoperated limbs. Development of focal histopathologic lesions was accompanied by increased levels of MMP-, aggrecanase-, and collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitopes in areas around lesions, while nonlesional areas showed no change in immunostaining. Extensive cell death was also detected by TUNEL staining in focal areas around lesions. CONCLUSION: We postulate that deletion of each of these genes, which encode molecules capable of producing degenerative changes in cartilage, leads to changes in the homeostatic controls regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism, favoring accelerated cartilage degeneration. These observations suggest that these genes may play important regulatory roles in maintaining normal homeostasis in articular cartilage matrix turnover.",M3

It has been shown that the env gene of these viruses harbors the determinant of neurovirulence. It appears that neuronal loss occurs by an indirect mechanism, since the target motor neurons have not been found to be infected. However, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Several lymphokines, cytokines, and other cellular effectors have been found to be aberrantly expressed in the brains of infected mice, but whether these are required for the development of the neurodegenerative lesions is not known. In an effort to identify the specific effectors which are indeed required for the initiation and/or development of spongiform myeloencephalopathy, we inoculated gene-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice with ts-1 MuLV. We show here that interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), ICE, Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-R1 KO mice still develop signs of disease. However, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in neurons (NSE/Bcl-2) were largely protected from hind limb paralysis and had less-severe spongiform lesions. These results indicate that motor neuron death occurs in this disease at least in part by a Bcl-2-inhibitable pathway not requiring the ICE, iNOS, Fas/FasL, TNF-R1, and IL-6 gene products.",M3
14642889,"Production and mechanism of secretion of interleukin-1beta from the marine fish gilthead seabream.Mammalian interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a secretory cytokine lacking a signal peptide, which does not follow the classical endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi pathway of secretion. Its post-translational processing by IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and subsequent release from activated macrophages requires ATP acting on P2X7 receptors. Little information is available on the production and release of fish IL-1beta, but the IL-1beta gene sequences reported to date lack a conserved ICE recognition site. We show for the first time that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/macrophage-activating factor/bacterial DNA (VaDNA)-primed immune cells of the marine fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) accumulate intracellular IL-1beta as a approximately 30 kDa polypeptide (proIL-1beta). The combination of LPS and VaDNA was found to be synergistic, suggesting that each ligand is recognized by a different pattern recognition receptor. More importantly, addition of extracellular ATP does not promote IL-1beta secretion by immune cells and fails to induce phosphatidylserine flip. In contrast, gilthead seabream SAF-1 fibroblasts shed microvesicles containing a 22 kDa IL-1beta form within 30 min of activation with ATP. Notably, the post-translational processing of IL-1beta by SAF-1 cells is abrogated by a specific ICE inhibitor.",M3

Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium dissolved in drinking water for 10 days. Pralnacasan was administered either intraperitoneally or orally every day. To assess in vivo efficacy, a clinical disease activity score was evaluated daily. Colon length, expression of IL-18 in colonic tissue, expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in paraaortal lymphocytes, and systemic production of IFN-gamma in splenocytes were analyzed post mortem. Intraperitoneally administered pralnacasan significantly reduced the clinical score compared with the dextran sulfate sodium control group from day 6 to day 10. Oral administration of pralnacasan also significantly reduced the clinical score at days 8 and 9. Administration of pralnacasan i.p. reduced the expression of intracolonic IL-18 significantly. Furthermore, pralnacasan reduced the number of IFN-gamma-positive lymphocytes in paraaortal lymph nodes. IFN-gamma synthesis in stimulated splenocytes was significantly suppressed in all pralnacasan-treated groups. No side effects of pralnacasan were observed. In conclusion, pralnacasan is effective in the prevention of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. This effect is probably mediated by suppression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma.",M3
14598973,"Impaired interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) activity in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.We measured the activity of IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) of monocytes from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were collected from PTB patients (n = 16) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Serum IL-18 levels were significantly higher in PTB patients (515.9 +/- 326.5 pg/ml) than in controls (108.7 +/- 65.2 pg/ml) (P &lt; 0.01), but gradually decreased with tuberculosis therapy. ICE activity was significantly lower in TB patients (65.3 +/- 34.4 vs. 142.2 +/- 75.6 U/mg) (P &lt; 0.05). Serum IL-18 levels inversely correlated with ICE activity (P &lt; 0.05). Altered ICE activity may explain why there is reduced IFN-gamma production from PBMCs; however, serum IL-18 is probably not regulated by ICE in monocytes in TB patients.",M3
14584052,"Gingival and dermal fibroblasts produce interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme and interleukin-1 beta but not interleukin-18 even after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.Epithelial cells play a critical role in periodontal disease through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). However, the role played by fibroblasts is still unclear. The rationale of this study was to throw light on the role of gingival fibroblasts in periodontal disease. We thus investigated the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and <e>ICE</e> mRNA and the secretion of the corresponding proteins by human normal gingival fibroblasts before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ICE mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA. We demonstrated that gingival fibroblasts expressed ICE mRNA. Basal expression of ICE was modulated following cell stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (5 mug/ml). However, gingival fibroblasts expressed low levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. The expression was potentiated by LPS. The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was followed by the secretion of IL-1 beta but not IL-18 protein. Our study suggests that fibroblasts may be involved in the defense against infections via an IL-1 beta-mediated but not an IL-18-mediated mechanism.",M3
14515361,"Cycloheximide and actinomycin D delay death and affect bcl-2, bax, and <e>Ice</e> gene expression in astrocytes under in vitro ischemia.An in vitro ischemia model was established and the effect of the metabolic inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (ActD) on apoptosis in astrocytes under ischemia studied. CHX decreased by 75% the number of cells dying after 6 hr of ischemia compared with control cultures. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining of comparable cultures was reduced by 40%. ActD decreased cell death by 60% compared with controls. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced by 38%. The nuclear shrinkage in TUNEL-positive astrocytes in control cultures did not occur in ActD-treated astrocytes, indicating that nuclear shrinkage and DNA fragmentation during apoptosis are two unrelated processes. Expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta), bax, and Ice in astrocytes under similar ischemic conditions, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indicated that ischemia down-regulated bcl-2 (alpha and beta) and bax. Ice was initially down-regulated from 0 to 4 hr, before returning to control levels after 8 hr of ischemia. ActD decreased the expression of these genes. CHX reduced the expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta) but increased bax and Ice expression. It is hypothesized that the balance of proapoptotic (Bad, Bax) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl) proteins determines apoptosis. The data suggest that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bad in astrocytes following ActD and CHX treatment does not decrease as much in untreated cells during ischemia. Our data indicate that it is the ratio of Bcl-2 family members that plays a critical role in determining ischemia-induced apoptosis. It is also important to note that ischemia-induced apoptosis involves the regulation of RNA and protein synthesis.",M3

13129693,"Pralnacasan, an inhibitor of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme, reduces joint damage in two murine models of osteoarthritis.OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of pralnacasan, the orally bioavailable pro-drug of a potent, non-peptide inhibitor of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), RU 36384/VRT-18858, on joint damage in two mouse models of knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: In a collagenase-induced OA model, pralnacasan was given orally by gavage to female Balb/c mice at 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg twice a day. In the second study, pralnacasan was tested in male STR/1N mice, which develop OA spontaneously, by administering food-drug mixtures ad libitum at concentrations of 0, 700 and 4200 ppm (mg/kg food). OA joint damage was assessed by a semi-quantitative histopathological score in both studies. In the STR/1N mouse study, urinary levels of collagen cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment and RU 36384/VRT-18858 plasma concentrations was measured after 6 weeks. RESULTS: In both studies, the mice developed moderate to severe knee joint OA in the medial joint compartments (tibial plateau and femoral condyle), the non-treated control groups showing median histopathological scores from 18 to 21 of a maximal score of 32. Pralnacasan was well tolerated. At the doses of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg in collagenase-induced OA and at the high dose of 4200 ppm in STR/1N mice pralnacasan treatment significantly reduced OA by 13-22%. In the STR/1N mice, urinary levels of HP cross-links and the ratio of HP/LP, which are indicators of joint damage in OA, were significantly reduced in the high dose group by 59 and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ICE inhibitor pralnacasan reduced joint damage in two experimental models of OA and has the potential to become a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of OA.",M3
12969109,"Pancuronium bromide, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant which promotes apoptosis of blood lymphocytes in vitro.BACKGROUND: Several compounds used in anesthesia practice have demonstrated to impair immune function and to influence the process of apoptotic death in T cell population following surgical trauma. We designed this study to test in vitro the impact of neuromuscular blocker, such as pancuronium, at clinically relevant concentration on lymphocyte apoptosis, death factor expression and mitochondrial function. METHODS: Following isolation, lymphocytes were incubated with pancuronium bromide at a clinically relevant concentration (0.136 micro mol l-1) for 3 h at 37 C in a 5% carbon-dioxide-humidified atmosphere and the frequency of apoptotic lymphocytes was then measured. We also investigated crucial steps in the apoptotic process, including Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) phenotype, intracellular expression of the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) p20, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and glutathione (GSH) levels. Control experiments were performed incubating cells in the complete culture medium added with the dilution medium of the drug without addition of the drug. RESULTS: Expression of Fas, FasL and ICEp20 was six-fold, four-fold, and five-fold increased, respectively, among pancuronium-treated lymphocytes with respect to control cultures (P = 0.0001). The percentage of cells exhibiting either dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential or increased production of reactive oxygen species was seven-fold increased following exposure to pancuronium compared with untreated lymphocytes (P = 0.0001). These findings were associated with a decrease in GSH level. In addition, the frequency of apoptotic cells was 10-fold greater among lymphocytes cultured in the presence of the drug with respect to control cultures. (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest an apoptogenic effect of pancuronium in vitro at clinically relevant concentration on peripheral blood lymphocytes. This could be implicated in the transient immune suppression following a surgical operation.",M3
12929137,"Early NFkappaB activation is inhibited during focal cerebral ischemia in interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme deficient mice.Our previous study demonstrated that the inhibition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) reduces ischemic brain injury; however, the molecular mechanism of the action of IL-1 in cerebral ischemia is unclear. We are investigating currently the role of NFkappaB during focal cerebral ischemia, using mutant mice deficient in the interleukin-1 converting enzyme gene (<e>ICE</e> KO) in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Adult male ICE KO and wild-type mice (n = 120) underwent up to 24 hr of permanent MCAO. Cytoplasmic phospho-NFkappaB/p65 expression in ischemic brain was examined using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. NFkappaB DNA-binding activity was detected using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression was examined in both the ICE KO and wild-type mice (WT). Western blot analysis and immunostaining showed that the level of cytosolic phosphorylated NFkappaB/p65 increased after 2 and 4 hr of MCAO in WT mice; however, NFkappaB/p65 was significantly reduced after MCAO in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05). EMSA showed that NFkappaB DNA-binding activity increased after MCAO in WT mice; but this effect was reduced in the ICE KO mice. The number of ICAM-1-positive vessels in the ischemic hemisphere was greatly attenuated in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05), which paralleled the results of immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that NFkappaB phosphorylation is reduced in ICE KO mice, suggesting that ICE or IL-1 are involved in early NFkappaB phosphorylation. Because cerebral ischemia induced infarction is significantly reduced in ICE KO mice, we conclude that early NFkappaB phosphorylation plays a disruptive role in the ischemic process.",M3

Fifteen non-dialysed (ND), 15 haemodialysed (HD), 15 patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 15 healthy controls were included. T cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. Apoptosis and cell phenotype were determined by FACS. sTNF-R1, sCD95, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (sICE), and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by ELISA. PHA and CD3-driven T cell proliferation were significantly decreased in ESRD patients. CD3(+), CD19(+) B cells, and percentage of CD4(+) T cells were significantly reduced. Percent memory T cells (CD45RO(+)) and cells undergoing apoptosis (CD95(+)/Annexin V+) were significantly increased in ESRF. Moreover, sCD95, sTNFRI, and <e>ICE</e> were significantly increased. Serum level of IL-10, a Th2 cytokine, was enhanced. These findings strongly suggest that in ESRD patients Th1 T cells are selectively susceptible to undergo apoptosis.

12829320,"Hypoxic induction of caspase-11/caspase-1/interleukin-1beta in brain microglia.Caspase-11 is an inducible protease that plays an important role in both inflammation and apoptosis. Inflammatory stimuli induce and activate caspase-11, which is required for the activation of caspase-1 or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Caspase-1 in turn mediates the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, which is one of the crucial mediators of neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Here, we report that hypoxic exposure of cultured brain microglia (BV-2 mouse microglia cells and rat primary microglial cultures) induces expression and activation of caspase-11, which is accompanied by activation of caspase-1 and secretion of mature IL-1beta and IL-18. Hypoxic induction of caspase-11 was observed in both mRNA and protein levels, and was mediated through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Transient global ischemia in rats also induced caspase-11 expression and IL-1beta production in hippocampus supporting our in vitro findings. Caspase-11-expressing cells in hippocampus were morphologically identified as microglia. Taken together, our results indicate that hypoxia induces a sequential event-caspase-11 induction, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1beta release-in brain microglia, and point out the importance of initial caspase-11 induction in hypoxia-induced inflammatory activation of microglia.",M3
12810350,"Role of Fas/Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis in murine contact hypersensitivity.Apoptosis plays an important role in immune responses, but little is known about its involvement in contact hypersensitivity (CH). In this study, we have investigated the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CH. Mice were sensitized by one topical application of 100 microl of 3% oxazolone to shaved skin of the abdomen. Six days later, CH was provoked by challenging both sides of sensitized mouse right ear with 15 microl of 1% oxazolone. Using a DNA ladder assay, we found that apoptosis was induced in the skin of oxazolone-sensitized mice 24-96 h after allergen challenge. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(-)), but not late apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(+)), increased in the inflamed skin of mice with CH. Moreover, the expressions of mRNAs for T helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4), Th1 cytokine (interferon (IFN)-gamma) and proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Fas, FasL and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1) were significantly elevated in the oxazolone-sensitized mouse skin 6-72 h after allergen challenge. Dramatic increase in IL-10 mRNA was only observed in the sensitized mouse skin 6 and 12 h after allergen challenge. Furthermore, CH was significantly inhibited with decreased apoptosis and early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in inflamed skin in Fas mutant lpr/lpr mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas there were no significant differences in IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, Bax and ICE mRNAs in the inflamed skin of CH between lpr/lpr and wild-type mice. Our results thus suggest that Fas/FasL pathway partially contributes to apoptosis in murine CH and that Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays a partial role in the development of CH. The contribution of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis to CH appears independent of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.",M3
12796490,"Maturation and release of interleukin-1beta by lipopolysaccharide-primed mouse Schwann cells require the stimulation of P2X7 receptors.The P2X7 receptor, mainly expressed by immune cells, is a ionotropic receptor activated by high concentration of extracellular ATP. It is involved in several processes relevant to immunomodulation and inflammation. Among these processes, the production of extracellular interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays a major role in the activation of the cytokine network. We have investigated the role of P2X7 receptor and of an associated calcium-activated potassium conductance (BK channels) in IL-1beta maturation and releasing processes by Schwann cells. Lipopolysaccharide-primed Schwann cells synthesized large amounts of pro-IL-1beta but did not release detectable amounts of pro or mature IL-1beta. ATP on its own had no effect on the synthesis of pro-IL-1beta, but a co-treatment with lipopolysaccharide and ATP led to the maturation and the release of IL-1beta by Schwann cells. Both mechanisms were blocked by oxidized ATP. IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>), the caspase responsible for the maturation of pro-IL-1beta in IL-1beta, was activated by P2X7 receptor stimulation. The specific inhibition of ICE by the caspase inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde blocked the maturation of IL-1beta. In searching for a link between the P2X7 receptor and the activation of ICE, we found that enhancing potassium efflux from Schwann cells upregulated the production of IL-1beta, while strongly reducing potassium efflux led to opposite effects. Blocking BK channels actually modulated IL-1beta release. Taken together, these results show that P2X7 receptor stimulation and associated BK channels, through the activation of ICE, leads to the maturation and the release of IL-1beta by immune-challenged Schwann cells.",M3

12639813,"Reduced apoptosis by pentoxiphylline among patients with HIV infection.BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a significant cause of CD4(+) T cell death. Caspase 8 (FLICE) is involved in apoptosis mediated by Fas and p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor ligation. It is also partially mediated by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; caspase 1). We and others have shown that pentoxiphylline inhibits TNF-alpha. We used it among patients with HIV infection to determine if 24 weeks of therapy altered the levels of caspase 1 and caspase 8. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen HIV-infected patients having no opportunistic infection at the time of recruitment were administered pentoxiphylline 400 mg thrice daily for 24 weeks. Caspase levels were measured using a single-step ELISA using commercially available monoclonal antibodies against caspase 1 and caspase 8. RESULTS: Mean CD4 counts of the patients were 202.6+/-111.6 (/mm(3)). Mean OD value of caspase 1 among patients before therapy was 0.302+/-0.197 and was higher than that of controls (0.287+/-0.064), but this was not statistically significant. Following 24 weeks of therapy with pentoxiphylline, the OD value declined significantly to 0.164+/-0.028 among patients (p&lt;0.001). Mean OD value of caspase 8 among patients prior to therapy was 0.927+/-0.249. This was significantly higher than that of controls, whose level was 0.0074+/-0.004 (p&lt;0.001). Following 24 weeks of therapy with pentoxiphylline, the OD value declined to 0.199+/-0.064 among patients and this was significantly lower than the value at the start of treatment (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Therapy with pentoxiphylline for 24 weeks is associated with a decline in the levels of caspase 1 and caspase 8. Since the drug is known to produce TNF inhibition, this might result in reduced apoptosis and an improved CD4 lymphocyte survival.",M3
12628757,"Caspase-1 inhibitors abolish deleterious enhancement of COX-2 expression induced by HIV-1 gp120 in human neuroblastoma cells.The human CHP100 neuroblastoma cell line has been shown to provide an useful in vitro model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gp120 neurotoxicity. Here we report western blotting evidence demonstrating that exposure to a cytotoxic concentration of the viral coat protein up-regulates expression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in neuroblastoma cells and this seems to be due to the previously observed increase in secreted IL-1beta. In fact, here we show that acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD-CMK) and t-butoxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid benzyl ester-chloromethylketone (Boc-Asp-(OBzl)-CMK), two inhibitors of Interleukin-1 Converting Enzyme (<e>ICE</e>; also referred to as caspase-1), abolish COX-2 expression enhanced by gp120 and consequent cell death. In addition, NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 activity, affords neuroprotection strengthening the role of COX-2 in the mechanisms of death. In conclusion, the present data support the notion that IL-1beta is the signal through which gp120 elevates COX-2 expression and the latter is strongly implicated in the mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity.",M3
12597888,"A bicistronic expression system for bacterial production of authentic human interleukin-18.Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is activated and released from immune effector cells to stimulate acquired and innate immune responses involving T and natural killer (NK) cells. The release of IL-18 from mammalian cells is linked to its proteolytic activation by caspases including interleukin 1 converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). The absence of a signal peptide sequence and the requirement for coupled activation and cellular release have presented challenges for the large-scale recombinant production of IL-18. In this study, we have explored methods for the direct production of authentic human IL-18 toward the development of a large-scale production system. Expression of mature IL-18 directly in Escherichia coli with a methionine initiating codon leads to the production of MetIL-18 that is dramatically less potent in bioassays than IL-18 produced as a pro-peptide and activated in vitro. To produce an authentic IL-18, we have devised a bicistronic expression system for the coupled transcription and translation of ProIL-18 with caspase-1 (ICE) or caspase-4 (ICE-rel II, TX, ICH-2). Mature IL-18 with an authentic N-terminus was produced and has a biological activity and potency comparable to that of in vitro processed mature IL-18. Optimization of this system for the maximal production yields can be accomplished by modulating the temperature, to affect the rate of caspase activation and to favor the accumulation of ProIL-18, prior to its proteolytic processing by activated caspase. The effect of temperature is particularly profound for the caspase-4 co-expression process, enabling optimized production levels of over 150 mg/L in shake flasks at 25 degrees C. An alternative bicistronic expression design utilizing a precise ubiquitin IL-18 fusion, processed by co-expressed ubiquitinase, was also successfully used to generate fully active IL-18, thereby demonstrating that the pro-sequence of IL-18 is not required for recombinant IL-18 production.",M3
12396474,"Increased apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with perennial allergic asthma/rhinitis: relation to serum markers of apoptosis.BACKGROUND: The goal of our study was to examine spontaneous and stimulated apoptosis of peripheral blood MNC from allergic patients, sensitized to Der p I antigen as compared to cells from non-atopic subjects. Furthermore we aimed to investigate which populations of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, monocytes) undergo the apoptosis and to determine relations between apoptosis and serum levels of sFas/APO-1, <e>ICE</e>/caspase-1 or TNF-alpha. METHODS: The study included 17 patients with perennial, allergic asthma and/or allergic rhinitis [6 male and 11 female; mean age 29,5 years; (range 15-49)]. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence technique and confirmed by flow-cytometric method and DNA ladder. Serum levels of sFas, ICE/caspase-1 or TNF-alpha were determined by immunoassays (ELISA). RESULTS: Apoptotic index of unfractionated mononuclear cells (MNC) and lymphocytes (but not monocytes) were significantly higher in allergic patients as compared to non-allergic subjects after 48 and 72 hours of culture (p&lt;0.05). Incubation of cells with ConA (10 microg/ml) resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells in all populations once the apoptotic index for MNC and lymphocytes (but not monocytes) was again significantly higher in allergic as compared to non-allergic subjects after 24, 48 and 72 hour of culture. In allergic patients, mean serum sFas level, was significantly lower then in non-allergic group (mean value 624.8 pg/ml +/- 25.67 versus 802.0 pg/ml +/- 31.91; p = 0.003) and in both groups sFas level correlated inversely with apoptosis of MNC. The mean ICE/caspase-1 concentration was significantly higher in sera of allergic patients as compared to non-allergic group (mean value 27.71 pg/ml +/- 3.79 vs 23.54 pg/ml respectively; p&lt;0.01). ICE/caspase-1 levels in allergic patients correlated with apoptotic index of mononuclear cells (r = 0.57; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increased spontaneous and mitogen-induced apoptosis of MNC from peripheral blood of atopic patients as well as different serum levels of sFas and ICE/caspase-1 correlating with apoptosis, suggest different regulation of apoptotic process in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with allergic asthma and/or rhinitis.",M3
12384922,"The in situ up-regulation of chondrocyte interleukin-1-converting enzyme and interleukin-18 levels in experimental osteoarthritis is mediated by nitric oxide.OBJECTIVE: To investigate in situ the relationship between 2 key mediators implicated in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage: nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-1-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was also studied and served as reference for the effects of ICE. METHODS: An OA model was created in dogs by sectioning (stab wound) the anterior cruciate ligament of the right stifle joint. Three experimental groups were studied: unoperated untreated dogs, operated untreated dogs (OA), and OA dogs treated with oral N-iminoethyl-L-lysine (L-NIL), a specific inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (10 mg/kg twice a day starting immediately after surgery). At 12 weeks after surgery, cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus were processed for immunohistochemistry for ICE, IL-18, and protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9), a natural inhibitor of ICE, followed by morphometric analysis. Cartilage specimens from the femoral condyles of untreated OA dogs were dissected and incubated with specific inhibitors of different signaling pathways likely to be involved in the OA process: SB 202190 (10 microM; a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] inhibitor), PD 98059 (100 microM; a MAPK kinase 1/2 [MEK-1/2] inhibitor), NS-398 (10 ng/ml; a specific cyclooxygenase 2 [COX-2] inhibitor), and L-NIL (50 microM). RESULTS: Both ICE and IL-18 were present in situ in the canine cartilage, with a significant increase in the level of these 2 proteins in OA cartilage. In contrast, the level of PI-9 was lower in OA than in normal cartilage (difference not statistically significant). Compared with untreated OA cartilage, oral treatment with L-NIL significantly decreased ICE and IL-18 levels in cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, to values similar to those in normal dogs. L-NIL also increased the PI-9 level in normal dogs compared with OA dogs, reaching statistical significance for femoral condyle cartilage. Interestingly, in vitro experiments demonstrated significant inhibition of ICE levels by p38, MEK-1/2, and COX-2 inhibitors, but not by the iNOS inhibitor. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that in situ in OA cartilage, the stimulation of chondrocytes by NO is at least partly responsible for the up-regulation of ICE and IL-18 synthesis while decreasing the level of the ICE inhibitor PI-9. The ICE level is controlled by the activation of at least 2 MAPK pathways, p38 and MEK-1/2. Interestingly, it appears that ICE synthesis is not regulated by the endogenous production of NO. These data highlight the role played by iNOS in regulating the synthesis of major catabolic factors involved in OA cartilage degradation.",M3
12322783,"Similar time-course of interleukin-1 beta production and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in permanent focal brain ischemic injury.The present study investigated the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the potential role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the brain's response to focal brain ischemia in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model. Phosphorylated ERK p44 and p42 were increased time-dependently and significantly 18- and 28-fold, respectively, at 24-h post-pMCAO. Similarly, IL-1beta protein levels were significantly increased with the peak at 24 h in the lesioned core of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side. Previous studies using various stimuli have shown ERK-dependent IL-1 induction. The results from our study suggest that this relation may also exist in vivo in ischemic brain tissue. Based on the progressive nature of IL-1 induction, we hypothetized that inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) could provide an extended time-window for neuroprotection. Therefore, we applied N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD x fmk), an ICE blocker 3 or 6 h after pMCAO. Reductions of infarct volume, however, were not observed. Taken together with previous results, where we showed protective activity of zVAD x fmk when given immediately after pMCAO, we conclude that the time window for zVAD x fmk is less than 3 h.",M3

Culturing cytokine-activated AEC in the presence of 1.25 microg/ml AmB, a concentration equivalent to serum levels during patient treatment, we find increases in iNOS promoter activity up to 120%, in iNOS mRNA or protein expressions by factors of up to 3.5 +/- 1.1, and in iNOS activity of up to 180% compared with cells with cytokines only. In parallel, a strong increase in endothelial interleukin (IL)-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) and IL-1beta expression and activity was observed. Specific inhibition of ICE activity or IL-1beta functionality significantly reduces expression and activity of the iNOS to control values. Because ICE activity is essential for the endogenous synthesis of active IL-1beta, ICE overexpression represents the key signal in the AmB-induced and IL-1beta-mediated effects on iNOS activity. In summary, in endothelial cells, AmB strongly augments cytokine-induced iNOS expression and activity by increasing the expression and activity of the ICE. This adjuvant activity for augmented endogenous cytokine processing adds to the efficacy of the antimycotic activity of AmB. Furthermore, our data underline the relevance of the endothelial iNOS as a potent effector of the innate immune system.",M3
12168884,"Serum concentrations of APO-1/Fas and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme in osteosarcoma correlate with response to chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic drugs used in neoadjuvant chemotherapy may exert their effect by activation of apoptosis. Both APO-1/Fas and Interleukin-1beta-converting (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1 are believed to act as mediators of apoptotic cell death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sera of 21 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma were tested at the time of diagnosis by ELISA and compared with clinical data. RESULTS: The mean APO-1 serum levels were 844 +/- 344 pg ml(-1) and the mean ICE serum levels were 212 pg ml(-1) +/- 155 pg ml(-1) for all patients. Furthermore, both serum levels were found to be statistically significantly higher in patients with good regression grades compared to those in patients with bad regression grades. CONCLUSION: In highly-malignant osteosarcoma elevated serum levels of both APO-1 and ICE seem to be predictive of good response to chemotherapy.",M3
12123203,"Expression of apoptosis-related genes in chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in mice.To define the mechanism of cyclosporine (CsA)-induced apoptosis, we investigated the expression of apoptosis-related genes in experimental chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. Mice on a low-salt (0.01%) diet were given vehicle (VH, olive oil, 1 mg/kg/day), or CsA (30 mg/kg/day), and sacrificed at 1 and 4 weeks. Apoptosis was detected with deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain, and the expressions of apoptosis-related genes were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot or immunohistochemistry. The activity of caspase 1 and 3 was also evaluated. The CsA group showed increases in apoptotic cells compared with the VH group (54 +/- 41 vs. 3 +/- 3, p &lt; 0.05), and the number of apoptotic cells correlated well with interstitial fibrosis scores (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.01). The CsA group showed a significant increase in Fas-ligand mRNA (0.20 vs. 0.02 amol/microgram total RNA, p &lt; 0.05) and Fas protein expression (146% vs. 95%, p &lt; 0.05), compared with the VH group. The CsA group showed significant increases in <e>ICE</e> mRNA (0.21 vs. 0.03 amol/microgram total RNA at 4 weeks, p &lt; 0.05) and CPP32 mRNA (0.18 vs. 0.03 amol/microgram total RNA at 4 weeks, p &lt; 0.05), compared with the VH group. The enzymatic activity of ICE (16.6 vs. 7.9 rho mol/microgram/h, p &lt; 0.05) and CPP32 protease (15.6 vs. 2.7 rho mol/microgram/h, p &lt; 0.05) proteases were increased in the CsA group, compared with the VH group. The ratio between bax and bcl-2 protein increased significantly in the CsA group (5.3-fold), compared with the VH group. Levels of p53 protein also increased in the CsA group. Immunohistochemical detection of Fas, Fas-ligand, ICE and CPP32 revealed strong immunoreactivity in renal tubular cells in areas of structural injury. These findings suggest that local activation of the apoptosis-related genes is associated with CsA-induced apoptotic cell death.",M3
12106600,"Interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (caspase-1) in intestinal inflammation.An imbalance of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) versus type 2 (Th2) polarization in favor of Th1 cell subsets appears to be a key pathogenic mechanism in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular in Crohn's disease. The interferon gamma-inducing factor interleukin (IL)-18 acts in strong synergism with the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12. Recent studies provide evidence for the participation of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of IBD: IL-18 expression is increased in inflamed lesions of Crohn's disease patients and neutralization of IL-18 in different models of experimental colitis resulted in a dramatic amelioration of disease severity. IL-18 and IL-1beta are cleaved and thereby activated by the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>). Activation of ICE also occurs during different types of infectious colitis, and ICE expression and subsequent release of IL-1beta and IL-18 significantly contribute to intestinal inflammation. ICE knockout mice as well as mice treated with the ICE inhibitor pralnacasan are protected against experimental mucosal inflammation. Thus, inhibition of ICE represents an intriguing new target that requires further investigation in animal models.",M3
12052343,"High level expression and purification of bioactive bovine interleukin-18 using a baculovirus system.Bioactive recombinant bovine interleukin-18 (rboIL-18) was expressed using a baculovirus system. Normally, IL-18 is translated as a precursor form of a 24kDa polypeptide and processed by IL-1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>) to a mature bioactive form of 18kDa protein. Hence, to express active form IL-18, we constructed two recombinant baculoviruses containing boIL-18 and human ICE (hICE) genes, respectively, and superinfected these viruses into insect cells. Superinfection of both recombinant viruses into the cells resulted in the expression of a 24kDa precursor form and an 18kDa mature form detectable in the supernatant by immunoblotting using anti-porcine IL-18 antibody. Culture supernatant from the superinfected cells showed a synergistic effect with recombinant boIL-12 for production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in bovine peripheral mononuclear cells. By addition of histidine hexamer at the C-terminal of boIL-18, the mature IL-18 was purified. Bioactivity remained after purification.",M3
12010237,"Apoptosis-related proteins in the testes of infertile men with varicocele.OBJECTIVES: To assess immunohistochemically the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the testes of infertile men, to determine which of these proteins were related to hypospermatogenesis, as a previous report suggested that apoptosis was suppressed in infertile men with varicocele. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-1 (<e>ICE</e>) and caspase-3 (CPP32) were examined in bilateral testicular specimens from 26 infertile men with varicocele and six normal testicular specimens, using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Clinical variables were also assessed. RESULTS: Bax, ICE, and CPP32 were expressed in germ cells, while Bcl-2 was not. Differences in staining in left or right testes were not significant. In both testes of infertile patients with varicocele, significantly fewer germ cells stained for CPP32 than in controls (P &lt; 0.001). For Bax and ICE, total germ cell staining was similar between these groups. Staining was less frequent in infertile patients for both CPP32 and ICE when the analysis was restricted to spermatogonia. Serum luteinizing hormone levels correlated positively with CPP32 staining (P = 0.0457). CONCLUSIONS: The reduced expression of CPP32 participates in regulating apoptosis in the testes of infertile men with varicocele.",M3
11948692,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 mediates interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells.Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as one of interferon family that regulates antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory responses, has been implicated for the growth regulation of ovarian cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully defined. To analyze detailed mechanisms, the ovarian cancer cell lines (2774, PA-1, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3) were treated with IFN-gamma. The growth of 2774 was most effectively suppressed than that of other cells in both time-course and dose-dependent experiments. The order of sensitivity in other cells was PA-1 &gt;&gt; OVCAR-3 &gt; SKOV-3 (not responded at all). The DNA fragmentation and DAPI staining assays suggested that the IFN-gamma-mediated cytotoxicity could be triggered by apoptosis. The treatment induced IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in two IFN-gamma-sensitive cells (2774, PA-1), whereas IRF-1 was not induced in two IFN-gamma-resistant cells (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3). The levels of p53 and p21WAF1 were not strikingly changed in all four cells. Interestingly, the expression of interleukin-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, or caspase-1) was increased by the treatment in a kinetically consistent manner to the induction of IRF-1. However, CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was not changed. Apoptosis was greatly induced, when IRF-1 was transiently expressed in PA-1 without the treatment of IFN-gamma. However, it was repressed when IRF-1 together with IRF-2, an antagonist of IRF-1, were coexpressed. In addition, the effect of IFN-gamma was reduced in the 2774 and PA-1 cells stably expressing either IRF-1 antisense or IRF-2 sense, as shown by the cytotoxicity and FACS analysis. Furthermore, the IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was greatly reduced, when inhibitors of ICE were treated into PA-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that IRF-1 directly mediates the IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis via the activation of caspase-1 gene expression in IFN-gamma-sensitive ovarian cancer cells.",M3
11948465,"Expression of interleukin-18 in human ovarian carcinoma and normal ovarian epithelium: evidence for defective processing in tumor cells.Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory monokine structurally related to IL-1beta that stimulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. IL-18 is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-IL-18, which is cleaved by IL-1beta-converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>)/caspase-1 in a mature protein. In view of the proposed use of IL-18 in cancer immuno/gene therapy, we have studied the expression of IL-18 in tumor cells. IL-18 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in all human ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested (9/9) and in one-half of tumor cell populations obtained from ovarian carcinoma patients (4/8). ICE mRNA was expressed in a smaller fraction of samples (3/9 cell lines and 3/8 samples from patients). IL-18 protein was also found in 7/13 ovarian carcinoma solid tumors by immunohistochemic analysis. In tumor cell lines we were able to detect abundant intracellular pro-IL-18 (24 kDa) by Western blotting, whereas the mature form of IL-18 was undetectable, irrespective of the presence of ICE mRNA and protein. Only pro-IL-18 was also found in the ovarian carcinoma cell supernatants, which did not display any IL-18 biologic activity in functional assays. Normal cultured ovarian epithelial cells revealed the presence of both IL-18 and ICE mRNA in all samples (5/5) and IL-18 protein was expressed by the thin epithelial cell layer surrounding normal ovary. More importantly, normal ovarian epithelial cells released low but detectable amounts of mature IL-18 in the culture supernatant, which displayed IL-18-like biologic activity in functional assays. These data suggest that mature biologically active IL-18 production is a feature of the normal ovarian surface epithelium lost during neoplastic transformation.",M3

11890646,"Novel targets for interleukin 18 binding protein.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 18 (IL18) is related to the IL1 family by structure, receptors, signalling molecules, and function. IL18 induces gene expression and synthesis of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL1, Fas ligand, several chemokines, and vascular adhesion molecules. Similar to IL1beta, IL18 is synthesised as a biologically inactive precursor molecule lacking a signal peptide. The IL18 precursor requires cleavage into an active, mature molecule by the intracellular cysteine protease, IL1beta converting enzyme (<e>ICE</e>, or caspase-1). Inhibitors of ICE activity limit the biological activity of IL18 in animals and may be useful in reducing the activity of IL18 in human disease. However, a constitutively secreted IL18 binding protein (IL18BP) exists which functions as a natural inhibitor of IL18 activity. IL18BP binds IL18 with a high affinity (Kd of 400 pM) and, at equimolar ratios, inhibits 50-70% of IL18; at twofold molar excess, IL18BP neutralises nearly all IL18 activity. METHOD: IL18 was investigated for its role in human myocardial function. An ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) model of suprafused human atrial myocardium was used to assess myocardial contractile force. RESULTS: The addition of IL18BP to the perfusate during and after I/R resulted in improved post-I/R contractile function from 35% of control to 76% with IL18BP. Also, IL18BP treatment preserved intracellular tissue creatine kinase levels (by 420%). Because active IL18 requires cleavage of its precursor form by ICE, inhibition of ICE attenuated the depression in contractile force after I/R (from 35% of control compared with 75.8% in treated atrial muscle, p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Myocardial ischaemia is a target for IL18BP and use of IL18BP may thereby reduce ischaemia-induced myocardial dysfunction.",M3
