20077654,"[Analysis epidemiological and pathogen characters of mumps in China from 2004 to 2006]OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of mumps in China (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan excluded) from 2004 to 2006 and to provide basic data for mumps control. METHODS: Descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted based on the data of epidemic <e>parotitis</e> from National Notifiable Disease Reporting System and mumps virus surveillance database from Nation Measles Lab. RESULTS: The annual incidence rates of parotitis cases during 2004-2006 were 17.45/100, 000, 22.40 /100, 000, 20.76 /100, 000 respectively. All the provinces had parotitis cases report. In all parotitis cases during 2004-2006, the percentage of case number of children (&lt; 15 years old) were 89.77%, 87.87%, 85.15% respectively, while the children between 5-9 years old were 49. 16%, 46.90%, 43.26% respectively. The homology based on 316 nucleotides of the Chinese mumps virus isolated during 2004 - 2006 was 95.4%-100%. CONCLUSION: To prevent and control mumps, the mumps surveillance for serology, virology and eoidemiology should be strengthened in China.",M1
19830379,"Genotyping of mumps virus circulating in Turkey in the 2006-2007 winter season.In the winter of 2006-2007, several <e>parotitis</e> cases were reported in different provinces of Turkey. Serological and virological studies were undertaken to investigate these cases with the aim of determining the genotype of the mumps virus (MuV) circulating in Turkey. Samples from 23 cases-Ankara (n:5), Kirklareli (n:4), Mugla (n:10), Isparta (n:3), Trabzon (n:1)-with a diagnosis of clinical parotitis were investigated. Serum samples were tested against mumps IgM and IgG, nested PCR amplification of a 639-bp fragment encompassing the entire SH gene was performed using buccal swabs, and PCR products were sequenced. Of 18 serum samples, 16 (88.9%) were positive for mumps IgM. Seven (30.4%) of 23 buccal swab samples were positive by PCR. In five PCR-positive cases, the sample was also positive for mumps IgM, and serum samples were not available from two of the PCR-positive cases. There was 98% identity between the different sequences, and all were identified as genotype H. The sequences were most similar to sequences identified in Spain, Japan, Switzerland and the UK, and less closely related to the H strains identified in Belarus, Korea and Russia. This is the first report of the mumps virus genotypes circulating in Turkey. Turkey is, geographically, a bridge between Europe and Asia, and therefore, a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of MuV in Turkey may led to improved tracking of the circulation of strains between the two continents. Moreover, there is a need to further investigate the existence of other genotypes in Turkey.",M1

19697404,"Investigation of a mumps outbreak among university students with two measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, Virginia, September-December 2006.Following the clinical diagnosis of the first case of mumps on September 22, 2006 at the University of Virginia (UVA), 52 suspected cases were identified through active surveillance for mumps by the end of December 2006. Samples were collected from 47 students who presented with <e>parotitis</e> despite a documented history of two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Six of 47 serum samples (13%) were positive for mumps IgM, and 46/47 specimens were positive for mumps IgG. Endpoint titration of acute phase serum samples from laboratory-confirmed cases did not provide evidence that elevated serum IgG is a consistent marker for infection among cases due to secondary vaccine failure. Buccal swab samples from 39 of the 47 students were tested by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or viral culture. Mumps virus or mumps RNA was detected in 12 of 39 buccal samples (31%). Genetic analysis of the virus from the outbreak at UVA indicated that the outbreak was not linked to the large mumps outbreak in the Midwestern US that occurred earlier in 2006. Our findings support the use of viral detection to improve laboratory diagnosis of mumps among persons who have received two doses of MMR.",M1
19445418,"Risk factors for mumps at a university with a large mumps outbreak.OBJECTIVES: Routine measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine use has greatly decreased the incidence of mumps in the U.S. However, a resurgence of mumps occurred in 2006. We investigated the large outbreak at a university and assessed risk factors for disease. METHODS: We described the outbreak and conducted a case-control study. We interviewed case students (identified from student health service and health department records) and control students (selected from a randomly ordered administrative list) and assessed their vaccination status. We compared case students with &gt; or = 2 MMR doses and control students with &gt; or = 2 MMR doses in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The mean age of the 174 case students was 20.9 years; 65% were women. Ninety-seven case students and 147 control students were enrolled in the study. Two-dose MMR coverage was 99% among case and control students with complete records. Only 33% of case students reported exposure to someone with mumps. Case students were more likely than control students to be aged 18 to 19 years (vs. aged 22 years, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09, 14.74), to report exposure to mumps (AOR=2.31, 95% CI 1.13, 4.73), and to have worked/volunteered on campus (AOR=2.91, 95% CI 1.33, 6.33). Also, women in dormitories had increased odds of mumps compared with men in dormitories. CONCLUSION: High two-dose MMR coverage was not sufficient to prevent the outbreak. Further study is needed to better understand the effects of dormitory residency and gender on mumps transmission. Clinicians should be vigilant for mumps in young adults presenting with <e>parotitis</e> regardless of immunization history.",M1
18790262,"Case of adult mumps infection after renal transplantation.Viruses are the most common cause of opportunistic infections, important complications of transplantation. Mumps infection in renal transplant recipients is uncommon. This report focused on a 23-year-old woman who received immunosuppressive therapy based on tacrolimus, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil for renal transplantation. Sixteen months after transplantation, she was admitted with pain and swelling in both infra-auricular areas. Laboratory findings demonstrated positive mumps IgM and IgG antibodies and an increased serum amylase level. Computed tomography revealed both parotid glands to be diffusely enlarged. After the diagnosis of mumps <e>parotitis</e>, the patient's immunosuppression was reduced and the clinical course was satisfactory.",M1
18539365,"Mumps vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness in a large outbreak among college students--Iowa, 2006.Following implementation of a routine childhood two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccination strategy, mumps disease levels dropped dramatically in the US and an elimination goal was set for 2010. However, a 2006 epidemic involved &gt;5700 cases nationwide, with many reported among fully vaccinated college students. In an outbreak in two Iowa colleges, we investigated: (1) vaccination coverage using electronic records verified by provider records and (2) vaccine effectiveness assessed by comparison of dose-specific attack rates. Mumps was classified as typical (<e>parotitis</e>/orchitis) or atypical (parotid tenderness or submandibular/sublingual adenitis). Two-dose mumps vaccination coverage was 90% both for the student population (2128/2363) and case-students (97/108). Two-dose vaccine effectiveness was 76-88% with no significant difference for attack rates between one and two doses. Among two-dose vaccine recipients, 74% of the population (1482/2009) and 79% of the case-students (75/95) had received the second dose &gt;10 years before. A large mumps outbreak occurred despite high two-dose vaccination coverage in a population most of whom had received the second dose &gt;10 years before. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness was similar to previous one-dose estimates. Further studies are needed to examine the persistence of two-dose mumps vaccine-induced immunity and to determine whether US mumps elimination can be achieved with the current vaccination strategy.",M1

Forty-eight patients with EP were examined. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with EP complicated by AP; Group 2 consisted of 18 patients with non-complicated EP. The serum samples from 21 healthy donors were used as controls. DC and MDA concentrations were measured after first clinical signs of AP (days 5th to 8th) appeared and before discharge. Serum samples from patients without AP were taken also on days 5th to 8th and before discharge. Lipid peroxidation (LP) proved to be activated in patients with EP, and in patients with complicated EP the increase in the concentration of primary LP products (DC) and intermediate (MDA) LP products was greater.",M1

17711045,"[Mumps--infectious disease with various faces]Mumps is a world-wide distributed human infectious disease. The causative agent is mumpsvirus, a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae. Mumpsvirus causes a variety of illnesses, which depend in part on humans' age and sex. <e>Parotitis</e> and meningitis as well as respiratory tract infection in children and orchitis in pubertal and postpubertal males are very common. Asymptomatic infections have also been frequently described. The treatment for mumps infection is symptomatic, there is no specific antiviral therapy. Immune prophylaxis with an attenuated life vaccine is the most important strategy of mumps prevention. During the last years, an increased number of mumps cases have been observed in several countries with a general recommendation for mumps vaccination. Young adults have been most frequently affected. The lack of immunity in this population is likely to be responsible for the increasing number of mumps cases.",M1

An increase of the number of cases in the years: 1994, 1997/1998, 2003 has been indicated, especially in boys in the pre-school and school age. The most frequent complication in the course of mumps was meningitis, pancreatitis et orchitis. The only permament complication of the mumps was unilateral hypoacusis present in 5 patients. We observed that lumbar puncture is less frequently performed in cases of clinical mild neuroinfections in the course of mumps at the same we observed a tendency to shorten the time of hospitaliz ation to one week. In the light of conducted researches, the introduction of suggested vaccines against mumps does not seem to have had significant influence on the epidemiology of this disease.",M1
17524197,"Are we missing mumps epididymo-orchitis?Mumps epididymo-orchitis has not been recorded as a cause of testicular symptoms without systemic features (including <e>parotitis</e>). The aim of the present study was to assess if we were missing cases in the genitourinary clinic during a previous outbreak of mumps in the community. During a prospective pilot study from November 2005 to February 2006, all patients presenting with symptoms or signs of epididymo-orchitis were studied. These patients were assessed for previous exposure to mumps virus or vaccine, and any current evidence of systemic illness. All patients included had a full sexual health screen (loop test, chlamydia polymerase chain reaction [PCR], gonorrhoea culture, HIV and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [test]/Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay), urinary tract infection excluded by urinalysis and mid-stream specimen of urine (MSSU) and mumps serology (Immunoglobulin M [IgM] and Immunoglobulin G [IgG]) performed. Twenty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Their ages ranged from 16 to 50 years, average 30.8 years. All had symptoms of these, 18 had testicular pain, eight swelling, (four had both pain and swelling) and three also had dysuria. On examination, 12 had tenderness, seven swelling, (two both tenderness and swelling) and six had no signs. Seventeen denied history of mumps, one patient had a record of vaccination and five described fever. None had parotid swelling. Three patients were chlamydia PCR positive, two had candida cultured, three had non-specific urethritis (&gt;10 polymorphonuclear leucocyte/high powered field) and 13 had negative sexually transmitted infection screen (one known HIV-positive). Three had positive IgM mumps serology and two were IgG-positive. It is important to include mumps in the differential of epididymo-orchitis and to be aware of outbreaks in the community that may present with genital symptoms, as the management and partner notification will be different.",M1

17078860,"Sensitivity and specificity of immunoglobulin G titer for the diagnosis of mumps virus in infected patients depending on vaccination status.The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of serological detection of mumps IgM and titration of IgG in patients with acute <e>parotitis</e> according to their vaccination status. The detection of mumps virus RNA in saliva by RT-PCR was used as reference. 116 patients (109 of them previously vaccinated) with mumps RT-PCR-negative results and 21 (19 vaccinated) with mumps RT-PCR-positive results were studied. Mumps-specific IgM and IgG were assayed by EIA (Enzygnost, Dade Behring, Germany). IgM results were expressed as positive or negative. For IgG, several cut-offs were calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Seven RT-PCR-positive and five RT-PCR-negative patients showed IgM-positive results (sensitivity 33.3% and specificity 95.7%). Among vaccinated patients, the sensitivity and specificity of IgM were 26.3% (5/19) and 99.1% (108/109). For IgG, a titer of 5,000 in all the patients showed a sensitivity of 76.2% (16/21) and a specificity of 83.6% (97/116). In vaccinated patients, the corresponding figures for this cut-off were 84.2% (16/19) and 83.5% (91/109), respectively. Although IgM detection against mumps is highly specific, its sensitivity is very low in immunized subjects. In this group, the titration of IgG could serve as an additional diagnostic tool.",M1

Both patients were from regions in which clustering of patients with clinical signs of mumps has been seen. Interestingly, a number of patients with confirmed mumps had been fully vaccinated. Possible explanations for the increase in mumps cases include low vaccination and immunity levels, primary and secondary vaccine failure and the emergence of genetically disparate mumps viruses.",M1
16829613,"Evaluation of two enzyme immunoassays for detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to mumps virus.To determine suitability for national serosurveys, we compared two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for mumps antibody, Enzygnost Anti-<e>Parotitis</e>-Virus/IgG (which uses a whole-virus antigen) and Microimmune Mumps IgG Screen ELISA (which uses a recombinant nucleoprotein antigen), by testing 1,915 opportunistically collected sera submitted to diagnostic laboratories across Australia in 1997 to 1998. The proportion of positive results increased with age in both ELISAs but was significantly higher with the Microimmune than with the Enzygnost ELISA overall (88% versus 63%; P &lt; 0.01) and in all age groups. However, the proportion of equivocal results was significantly higher with the Enzygnost than with the Microimmune ELISA (9% versus 4%; P &lt; 0.01). Of the 572 sera with discrepant or equivocal results, 508 had sufficient sample remaining to perform the neutralization test (NT). A proportion with concordant results in both ELISAs were also tested by the NT. For sera with discrepant results, there was significantly better agreement between the NT and Microimmune than between the NT and Enzygnost (310/444 [70%] versus 135/348 [39%]; P &lt; 0.01). Of 64 sera with equivocal Microimmune results, 45 (70%) were positive in the NT compared with 140 of 160 (88%) equivocal Enzygnost results (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the NT, the Microimmune ELISA is more sensitive (96% versus 80%) but apparently less specific (36% versus 85%) than the Enzygnost ELISA. However, this is likely to be due to the generally lower sensitivity of the NT, since the Microimmune results reflect expected seroprevalence, based on vaccine uptake in the age groups studied. We conclude that the Microimmune ELISA is a more appropriate assay than the Enzygnost ELISA for estimation of mumps seroprevalence.",M1

The selected clone, Y125, showed stable temperature-sensitivity in Vero cells. Intraspinal inoculation of marmosets with the Y125 produced only minimal histopathological changes, while intracerebral inoculation of neonatal rats revealed that the Y125 did not cause hydrocephalus. Both these effects of the Y125 were similar to those of the non-neurovirulent Jeryl Lynn strain. Furthermore, subcutaneous inoculation of the Y125 induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in all Cercopithecus monkeys examined. Although the safety and immunogenicity should be confirmed in further field trials in humans, the present results indicate that the Y125 could be a promising vaccine candidate.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the 8 months before April 2005, patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency/Urology Departments of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital with a diagnosis of epididymo-orchitis were identified from the emergency urological admission database. RESULTS: Of 195 males presenting with an acute history of testicular pain and swelling, 25 gave a history of mumps <e>parotitis</e> 4-11 days earlier. Three had bilateral orchitis and two needed scrotal exploration to exclude torsion. Scrotal ultrasonography findings varied from increased vascularity to abnormal testicular echo texture. Treatment included analgesia, scrotal support, re-hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Of the 10 patients followed-up to date, four had testicular abnormalities; one had persistent testicular pain, one a change in testicular consistency, one a noticeably reduced size of one testis, and one significant testicular atrophy. CONCLUSION: As postpubertal mumps in males is associated with a 40% incidence of orchitis, parents should be made aware that failing to immunize their children threatens the future fertility of their sons. Young men not immunized as children should be counselled and offered urgent vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that epididymo-orchitis may be secondary to mumps infection even with no history or clinical evidence of parotitis.",M1
16235361,"Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children.BACKGROUND: Public debate over the safety of the trivalent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the resultant drop in vaccination rates in several countries, persists despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of effectiveness and unintended effects associated with MMR. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1974 to December 2004), Biological Abstracts (from 1985 to December 2004), and Science Citation Index (from 1980 to December 2004). Results from reviews, handsearching and from the consultation of manufacturers and authors were also used. SELECTION CRITERIA: Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective trials testing the effects of MMR compared to placebo, do-nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. These studies were carried out or published by 2004. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified 139 articles possibly satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 31 in the review. MAIN RESULTS: MMR was associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, and similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo. The vaccine was likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura, <e>parotitis</e>, joint and limb complaints, febrile convulsions within two weeks of vaccination and aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Urabe strain-containing MMR). Exposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Jeryl-Lynn strain-containing MMR). We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with MMR cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.",M1

The assay was capable of detecting five copies of standard plasmid containing cDNA from the mumps virus F gene. No cross-reactions were observed with other members of Paramyxoviridae, or with viruses or bacteria known to be meningitis pathogens. Seventy-three clinical samples consisting of throat swabs collected from patients with <e>parotitis</e>, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients with aseptic meningitis, were examined with a real-time PCR assay developed by the authors, reverse-transcription nested-PCR (RT-n-PCR), and virus isolation using cell culture. Like the RT-n-PCR assay, the real-time PCR assay could detect mumps virus RNA in approximately 70% of both throat swabs and CSF samples, while, by tissue culture, mumps virus was isolated from only approximately 20% of CSF and 50% of throat swab samples. In addition, the real-time PCR assay could be developed easily into a quantitative assay for clinical specimens containing more than 1,800 copies of mumps virus RNA/ml by using serial dilutions of the standard plasmid. The results suggest that the real-time PCR assay is useful for identification of mumps virus infections, not only in typical cases, but also in suspected cases, which show only symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis.",M1

The intensity of the epidemic process of measles and epidemic parotitis is higher in those cities where a higher total level of pollution has been established. A high level of morbidity in these infections is due to disturbances in the immunological resistance of children living in such cities and, as a consequence, having insufficient postvaccinal immunity. A higher percentage of seronegative children among those immunized against the corresponding infections and a higher morbidity level among this category of the population have been established. To decrease morbidity in measles and epidemic parotitis to the level, sporadic for such cities, a greater coverage of children with immunization (up to 99-99.5%) is necessary.",M1
12696119,"Identification of a new genotype H wild-type mumps virus strain and its molecular relatedness to other virulent and attenuated strains.A single clinical isolate of mumps virus designated 88-1961 was obtained from a patient hospitalized with a clinical history of upper respiratory tract infection, <e>parotitis</e>, severe headache, fever and lymphadenopathy. We have sequenced the full-length genome of 88-1961 and compared it against all available full-length sequences of mumps virus. Based upon its nucleotide sequence of the SH gene 88-1961 was identified as a genotype H mumps strain. The overall extent of nucleotide and amino acid differences between each individual gene and protein of 88-1961 and the full-length mumps samples showed that the missense to silent ratios were unevenly distributed. Upon evaluation of the consensus sequence of 88-1961, four positions were found to be clearly heterogeneous at the nucleotide level (NP 315C/T, NP 318C/T, F 271A/C, and HN 855C/T). Sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences for the NP, M, and the L protein were the most conserved, whereas the SH protein exhibited the highest variability among the compared mumps genotypes A, B, and G. No identifying molecular patterns in the non-coding (intergenic) or coding regions of 88-1961 were found when we compared it against relatively virulent (Urabe AM9 B, Glouc1/UK96, 87-1004 and 87-1005) and non-virulent mumps strains (Jeryl Lynn and all Urabe Am9 A substrains).",M1

Lymphocytic meningitis caused by epidemic <e>parotitis</e>]OBJECTIVE: We examined whether an acute phase reaction could occur in children with lymphocytic meningitis of homogeneous etiology (parotitis epidemic from the Paramyxoviridae family), a sign of which would be an increase in concentrations of acute phase proteins (APP's) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or in blood serum. We also tested the usefulness of the determination of selected APP's concentrations in CSF and serum in diagnosis and monitoring of the course of the disease, provided that an increase in concentrations of selected APP's were discernible. METHODS: Cases were 78 children with lymphocytic meningitis as a complication of parotitis epidemic. Controls were 30 healthy children (control group K1) and 19 children hospitalized with suspected meningitis (control group K2). The following APP's presence in CSF and serum were tested: C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-2-haptoglobin (HPT), alpha-1-antitripsin (AAT) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), alpha-2-ceruloplasmin (CER) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (AMG). The results were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The results of the research show a significant increase in all APP's determined, except for CRP and AAG, in children with parotidal meningitis.

The total registered number of cases was about 11.000 of a total of 3,7 million inhabitants in Lithuania (29,7 cases/10,000). Virus-containing samples were collected from 80 patients treated at the hospital of Kaunas from October 1999 until the end of the epidemic. Out of the 80 patients with <e>parotitis</e>, meningitis was observed in 11 patients and orchitis in 22 of 69 male patients. Twenty-seven virus strains were genotyped by nucleotide sequencing of the small hydrophobic (SH) protein gene, and the 57 amino acid sequences of the gene were deduced. Twenty-five virus strains belonged to the C genotype and two were of the D genotype. By phylogenetic analysis the virus strains causing meningitis grouped in a separate cluster, designated C1, within the C genotype. Another group of ten of the 25 genotype C strains exhibited an amino acid triplet at amino acid positions 28 to 30 of the protein, consisting of valine, alanine and serine, instead of the previously recognised valine, valine and serine combination of genotype C. The amino acid alanine at position 29 was found in combination with the amino acid serine at position 48. This variant was designated C2 and it was associated with parotitis. The amino acid alanine at position 29 and serine in position 48 of the C2 genotype may constitute a marker of low neurovirulence compared to other genotype C strains.",M1

Entry of the virus into the CNS is caused by slight penetration of antiparotitis antibodies through the blood-brain barrier and by poor formation of specific immune complexes at the site of primary virus reproduction and in the liquor. Interferon therapy of patients with parotitis virus infection corrects the chain of processes in the pathogenesis. In parotitic meningitis neovir stimulates gamma-interferon, which blocks the synthesis of parotitis antigen in the cell and stimulates (through antibody stimulation) the formation of specific immune complexes released with the saliva in the gland. Viferon is more active in parotitic orchitis due to prolongation of alpha-interferon activity.",M1

The comparative analysis of the number of IP cases with and without complications in the groups of children, divided according to their immunization history and the type of IR, revealed that postvaccinal immunity in children vaccinated on epidemic indications (less than a month ago) or 3-6 years before infection had protective potential, sufficient for the prevention of complicated forms of IP. Immunity obtained 7-9 years ago was effective for the protection from IP complications only in cell-mediated, but not humoral IR.

Five groups of patients were tested. Group 1 consisted of 29 patients with primary mumps infections; group 2 was 20 children and adults with a definite history of natural infection; group 3 was 7 patients with a recent mumps vaccination, 1 of whom developed parotid gland swelling and aseptic meningitis; group 4 was 14 patients with mumps vaccine failure; and group 5 was 6 patients with recurrent episodes of parotitis in addition to a history of vaccination. On the basis of the results of groups 1 and 2, an avidity of &lt;/=31% was determined to be low, and &gt;/=32% was determined to be high. Avidity maturation from low to high appears to occur around 180 days after the acute illness. The results of group 3 showed that the vaccine-induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) had very low avidity. Among the 14 patients in group 4, 12 patients, including 7 with a positive IgM response, were diagnosed as having secondary vaccine failures. The results of group 5 suggested the possibility that the avidity of the mumps vaccine-induced IgG remains low or borderline. These results showed that secondary mumps vaccine failure occurs not infrequently, even among school age children under condition in which the vaccine coverage is low (i.e., 33% in our study population), and therefore, vaccinees are prone to be exposed to wild-type viruses.

While in the past cases of mumps have only been seen occasionally at our institution, recently there has been a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1995 and April 1996, 11 patients with severe mumps orchitis were hospitalized at our clinic. Medical history, therapeutic measures and clinical outcome were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: All patients showed marked scrotal swelling with a temperature above 38.5 C. Serum C-reactive protein was significantly elevated (mean 140 mg./l.). The vaccination status of 1 of the 11 patients (9%) was unknown. Medical records from the remaining 10 patients indicated that they had not been vaccinated. Nine patients (82%) had a typical mumps <e>parotitis</e> preceding the orchitis. In 2 patients the clinical diagnosis of parotitis was uncertain but mumps serology was positive. None of the patients showed other manifestations of mumps. Antibodies to the mumps virus (IgG and IgM) were determined in 6 patients and positive in all cases. The average interval between parotitis and onset of orchitis was 10 days. All patients were hospitalized for an average of 6 days. Treatment included bed rest with local cooling, scrotal support and systemic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Ciprofloxacin or clavulanic acid/amoxicillin was administered as bacterial orchitis could not be excluded at initial presentation. The mean time to cessation of fever was 3.6 days (range 3 to 5).

METHODS: The study was carried out in health care students during the academic year of 1992-1993. Demographic and geographic variables were obtained as were vaccination and history of diseases. Antibodies against measles, rubella, and parotiditis were determined by ELISA techniques with commercial reagents. RESULTS: Three hundred and six individuals of 21.3 +/- 2.2 years (range 17-36 years) with 27.5% being males were studied. Past history of measles, rubella and parotiditis was reported in 43.5, 30.7 and 37.3%, respectively, with vaccination being 23.2, 43.8 and 20.6%, respectively. The prevalence of antibodies was 93.1% (measles), 96.4% (rubella) and 92.1% (parotiditis). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of infection of measles, rubella and parotiditis in the young population studied is mainly due to infection by wild type virus. The foreseeable growth of susceptibility groups in this population which should be adequately evaluated by extensive seroepidemiologic questionnaires, favors the appearance of epidemic outbreaks.

7747525,"[Mumps epidemiology in Switzerland: results from the Sentinella surveillance system 1986-1993. Sentinella Work Group]Since 1990, there have been reports of an increasing number of mumps cases in Switzerland, in particular among vaccinated children, and of local outbreaks of mumps. Using data from the Sentinella reporting system, a network of voluntary participating doctors (general practitioners, internists and paediatricians, yearly average: n = 141), trends and factors influencing mumps incidence in the general population were assessed during the last seven years. Following an initial decline in mumps reports, since 1990, there has been a continuous and marked increase in reports from a minimum of 0.7 cases per physician and year in 1989/90 to a near five-fold increase of 3.3 cases in the last reporting period from June-December 1993 (calculated for one year). Half of this increase, which is reflected in a doubling of the number of cases reported in 1986/87, is explained by an increase in cases among vaccinated children. The trend in mumps cases contrasts with that of measles and rubella, where there has been a clear decline in these reports since 1986 (approximately 70-80%). Complications were reported in 75 (4.0%) of the total number of mumps patients (n = 1894); in 2/5 of the cases this was a meningitis, in 1/3 an orchitis. Based on available data on vaccination coverage, the estimated efficacy of the mumps vaccines against <e>parotitis</e> is between 47-77%; this is clearly lower than the corresponding figure for measles (91-97%) and rubella (89-97%) vaccines. The relatively low efficacy against parotitis is mainly due to a protective level of 13-73% of the vaccines containing the Rubini strain. The estimated efficacy of the Rubini vaccines against complications is 50-81%; it is nearly 60-90% if a possible reporting bias is taken into consideration. Conclusions: 1. The Rubini strain vaccines, which are the most commonly used in Switzerland, seem to have played an important role in the clear increase in mumps cases since 1990. 2. The situation seems more favourable concerning the efficacy against complications of the vaccines used. 3. Our data support the high efficacy of all measles and rubella vaccines. 4. The surveillance of MMR by the Sentinella reporting system provides a useful and effective manner to evaluate the MMR vaccination programme.",M1

The etiology remained unknown in 9.8%. There were clinical symptoms of meningitis or orchitis in some and lymphadenopathy in several of the parainfluenza-virus caused parotitis patients. The authors conclude, that the parainfluenza-viruses are the second most frequent etiological agents of parotitis next to mumps-virus. They found that the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) also play etiological role in parotitis. This observation should be confirmed in the future by some other kind of virological tool too.

They emphasize the contemporaneous increase in volemia, even with oedema present, and the poor permeation of the capillary wall found with the Landis test, contrary to what happens in glomerulonephrosis with minimal changes which features increased systematic capillary permeation with hypovolemia. The look of the oedema, together with the hypervolemia, led to the suspicion that the nephritic oedema was a sign of mainly intracellular oedema. In the opinion of the Authors these nephritic forms would seem to show systemic cellular respiratory suffering sensitive to the action of chlorpromazine, which has also dealt swiftly and cleanly with the oligoanuresis. The Authors consider 52 cases of Schöenlein-Henoch vasculitis which showed very rapid detumescence of periarticular swelling and those on the back of the hands and feet, as well as the disappearance of skin petechias and melena following treatment with chlorpromazine.

The significant difference (t = 3.35) in the epidemiological effectiveness indices was due to the presence of a large number of persons having had inapparent and faintly pronounced forms of epidemic parotitis among school children, as well as due to more close contacts of children with the foci of infection at preschool institutions. The study showed that among children immunized with some lots of parotitis vaccine elevated morbidity in epidemic parotitis was registered. In the foci of infection children, immunized in the presence of low initial titers of specific hemagglutinins in their sera, responded by a booster effect with different duration of stimulation of antibody formation.

It is therefore all the more important to gain exact and extensive insight into general and special aspects of pathological changes of the salivary glands in these age groups.

Swellings of the salivary glands may be caused by acute and chronic inflammatory processes, by autoimmune diseases, by duct translocation due to sialolithiasis, and by tumors of varying dignity. Clinical examination and diagnosis has also to differentiate between salivary gland cysts and inflammation or tumors. CONCLUSION: Salivary gland diseases are rare in childhood and adolescence. Their pattern of incidence differs very much from that of adults. Acute and chronic sialadenitis not responding to conservative treatment requires an appropriate surgical approach.

Using a rat based model of mumps neurovirulence, we demonstrate that this latter virus is significantly attenuated compared to a virus isolated from a patient with post-vaccination meningitis. Complete sequence analysis of the genomes of the two viruses identified sixteen genetic differences, some or all of which must be responsible for differences in virulence. These same genetic differences also account for changes in tropism in cell culture.",M2
18976271,"Classification and management of chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland.Saliva has numerous oral functions and multiple functions in relation to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Chronic salivary hypofunction can lead to severe adverse health outcomes. Chronic sialadenitis is one of the major conditions that can cause salivary hypofunction. A correct diagnosis and management of chronic sialadenitis is essential for the recovery of salivary hypofunction. Chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland is often seen in the clinic, sometimes also referred to as recurrent pyogenic <e>parotitis</e>, recurrent parotitis, non-obstructive parotitis, sialadenitis or obstructive parotitis, among other terms. The literature describes several different classifications and denominations for chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland. These various classifications and denominations complicate the definition and diagnostic criteria, and if chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland can develop into Sjogren's syndrome remains unclear. Treatment of this condition is also a challenging problem. Here, we review the presented classification and denomination of chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland, proposing a classification based on the disease entities identified in a long-term follow-up investigation, and discuss the treatment principles for the condition.",M2
18949350,"Acute postsurgical suppurative <e>parotitis</e>: current prevalence at Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo University Medical School.Postsurgical acute suppurative parotitis is a bacterial gland infection that occurs from a few days up to some weeks after abdominal surgical procedures. In this study, the authors analyze the prevalence of this complication in Hospital das Clínicas/São Paulo University Medical School by prospectively reviewing the charts of patients who underwent surgeries performed by the gastroenterological and general surgery staff from 1980 to 2005. Diagnosis of parotitis or sialoadenitis was analyzed. Sialolithiasis and chronic parotitis previous to hospitalization were exclusion criteria. In a total of 100,679 surgeries, 256 patients were diagnosed with parotitis or sialoadenitis. Nevertheless, only three cases of acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis associated with the surgery were identified giving an incidence of 0.0028%. All patients presented with risk factors such as malnutrition, immunosuppression, prolonged immobilization and dehydration. In the past, acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis was a relatively common complication after major abdominal surgeries. Its incidence decreased as a consequence of the improvement of perioperative antibiotic therapy and postoperative support. In spite of the current low incidence, we believe it is important to identify risks and diagnose as quick as possible, in order to introduce prompt and appropriate therapeutic measures and avoid potentially fatal complications with the evolution of the disease.",M2
18926735,"Image interpretation for squamous cell carcinoma of Stensen duct.A case of squamous cell carcinoma presumed to have arisen from the right Stensen duct is reported. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was referred to our hospital with swelling in the right cheek. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including contrast-enhanced MRI, and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) enabled diagnosis of a solitary mass in the Stensen duct. Fat-suppressed T(2)-weighted imaging, in particular, demonstrated a mass-like lesion in the dilated Stensen duct and obstructive <e>parotitis</e> where the duct transitions into the parotid gland. Gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging demonstrated the mass-like lesion surrounded by signal-hyperintense layer showing continuous transition from the thickened Stensen duct wall, which was also hyperintense. The CECT revealed peripheral annular enhancement surrounding the tumorous mass, with no enhancement of the duct wall itself, reflecting an increase in micro blood vessels in the stroma of the neoplasm. These image findings correlated well with subsequent histopathologic findings. A mass with rim enhancement and dilated Stensen duct accompanied by parotitis and no salivary calculus may suggest a differential diagnosis of malignant tumor of Stensen duct.",M2

18645120,"Juvenile recurrent <e>parotitis</e>: sialendoscopic approach.OBJECTIVE: To assess the relevance of sialendoscopy as a diagnostic and interventional procedure in juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP). DESIGN: Prospective case series study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Sialendoscopy was used to examine 10 children (age range, 1.8-13.0 years) with symptomatic JRP for recurrent swelling of the parotid glands between January 2003 and January 2005. Diagnostic sialendoscopy allowed classification of ductal lesions, and interventional sialendoscopy was used to treat the lesions. Initial data analyzed included the type of endoscope used as well as the size and form of the main duct of the parotid gland. Outcome variables were resolution of symptoms and endoscopic enlargement of the ductal tree. RESULTS: Initial ultrasound evaluation of the diseased gland revealed a white Stensen duct without the natural proliferation of blood vessels in all 10 cases. This finding was associated with a true stenosis of the Stensen duct. Two cases of suspected stones according to ultrasonography were subsequently diagnosed as localized stenoses. The sialendoscope was used to dilate the duct with pressurized saline solution in all cases as well as to dilate the 2 cases of stenoses. There were no major complications. The average length of follow-up was 11 months (range, 2-24 months). Seventeen parotid glands were dilated in all 10 patients, with a success rate of 89%. One patient needed repeated sialendoscopies for recurrent symptoms. Two patients presented with a second episode of JRP contralateral to the side initially treated. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic sialendoscopy is a new procedure that can be used in children for reliable evaluation of salivary ductal disorders, with low morbidity. Sialendoscopic dilation of the main parotid ducts appears to be a safe and effective method for treating JRP.",M2

Initially, there was no facial paralysis and the signs and symptoms were suggestive of acute parotitis, for which medical treatment was initiated. Three days later, left-sided facial palsy of HB (House-Brackmann) grade 5 developed. Ultrasonography revealed a pretragal, hypoechoic mass, 10x8 mm in size, causing inflammation in the surrounding tissue. Fine needle aspiration biopsy obtained from the mass revealed polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. No malignant cells were observed. The lesion was diagnosed as an occult parotid abscess. After a week, the mass disappeared and facial paralysis improved to HB grade 4. At the end of the first month, facial paralysis improved to HB grade 1. At three months, facial nerve function was nearly normal.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-three JRP patients were included. Involvement of parotid gland was assessed by sialography. Parotid saliva was assayed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography. Medical charts were examined for number of recurrences, disease laterality, and time of follow-up. Logistic regression analysis between occurrence of either MMP, the clinical parameters, and sialographic staging was conducted. RESULTS: None of the clinical parameters under analysis were found to be associated with degree of sialographic involvement. Statistical associations were found between presence of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in parotid saliva and sialographic stage (P = .017; odds ratio [OR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-30.4; and P = .009; OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.6-23.7; respectively).

Using a DW-EPI sequence at 1.5 T, parotid glands of 19 consecutive patients with acute (n=14) and chronic (n=5) inflammation of parotid glands and 52 healthy volunteers were examined. Magnetic-resonance (MR) images were obtained before and after gustatory stimulation with 5 cc of lemon juice. In volunteers mean ADC values of 1.14 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s before and 1.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s after gustatory stimulation were observed. In acute inflammation ADC values were higher before [1.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (p=0.006)] and after stimulation [1.32 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (p&lt;0.001)]. Before stimulation ADC differences between chronic inflammation (1.05 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and healthy volunteers (p=0.04) as well as between acute and chronic inflammation (p=0.005) were statistically significant. No differences were detected after stimulation between chronic inflammation (1.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and healthy volunteers (p=0.94) and between acute and chronic inflammation (p=0.15), respectively. DW-EPI seems to display the physiological changes of the parotid gland in patients suffering from acute or chronic inflammation and might be useful for discriminating healthy from affected glands.",M2

OBJECTIVES: To describe the cause, exploration, and combined management of chronic obstructive parotitis using sialoendoscopy. STUDY DESIGN: Between October 2004 and June 2006, 23 patients with obstructive symptoms were diagnosed by sialography and explored by diagnostic sialoendoscopy. The obstructions were then removed by interventional sialoendoscopy. After obstructions were removed successfully, 0.25% chloramphenicol was used to lavage the duct continuously, and then 40% iodized oil was perfused into duct. The results of follow-up were evaluated by visual analog scales (VAS) of the clinical appearances at different stages. RESULTS: Twenty of the 23 patients were found with various types of stenosis and dilatation of duct on sialography, and 21 patients were explored using sialoendoscopy successfully. The features of these 21 cases found endoscopically were of 4 types: sialolith (n = 4; 19.0%), duct polyps (n = 5; 23.8%), stenosis (n = 3; 14.3%), and mucus plug (n = 9; 42.9%). Seventeen cases were treated successfully, removing obstructions via sialoendoscopy, giving a success rate of 80.9% (17 out of 21).

We evaluated seven patients with tuberculous parotitis together with clinical and histopathologic findings, and management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a period of 13 years, seven patients (5 males, 2 females; mean age 32 years; range 23 to 47 years) were diagnosed and treated for tuberculous parotitis. All the patients had a clinical suspicion of a parotid gland tumor. RESULTS: The lesions were localized on the left in four patients, and on the right in three patients. The duration of disease varied from seven months to three years. The masses were localized, mobile, and measured 3 to 6 cm in diameter; one was fistulized. There was no evidence for active pulmonary tuberculosis. Chest radiograms showed old tuberculous lesions in two patients. The PPD skin test results were positive (&gt;12 mm induration) in five patients (71%). Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging obtained in five patients showed mass formation suggesting a benign parotid gland tumor. Fine-needle aspiration cytology performed in three patients and cultivation performed in the fistulized case were all non-diagnostic. Superficial parotidectomy was performed in six patients and enucleation was performed in one patient. Histopathologic examination showed tubercles composed of macrophages, epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, and central caseous necrosis. Following diagnosis, all patients were treated with a four-drug chemotherapy regimen. There was no evidence for recurrence within a mean of 15-month follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical picture, treatment, and prognosis of children with a parotid abscess in a search for optional clinical guidelines for treatment. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for 10 children (age&lt;or=17) with a parotid abscess between January 1996 and December 2005. RESULTS: Of the 10 cases of parotid abscess found, 4 children had had parotid-related symptoms before; bacterial culture was positive in 6; 4 had aerobic Gram-positive pathogens, and 1 girl had parotid tuberculosis. All patients received intravenous antibiotic therapy. The initial diagnostic method was ultrasound in nine cases and MRI in one. Four children underwent surgical drainage, and in three cases there was an ultrasound guided needle aspiration of the abscess. Neither surgical drainage nor aspiration led to fistula formation or any other complication. The abscess ruptured spontaneously through the skin of the periauricular area in two cases and into the ear canal in one. During follow-up, all were symptom-free except for two girls diagnosed with first brachial cleft fistulas. One of these also had a reoccurrence of the parotid abscess. Both later underwent superficial parotidectomy due to persistent symptoms.

16854383,"Differential responses of rostral subnucleus caudalis and upper cervical dorsal horn neurons to mechanical and chemical stimulation of the parotid gland in rats.Blockage of the salivary duct can produce pain and inflammation from the build up of saliva in the parotid gland. The processing of parotid inflammation-induced pain, however, is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify the functional involvement of the trigeminal subnucleus interpolaris/caudalis transition region (Vi/Vc) and upper cervical spinal cord (C1/C2) in processing nociceptive input relevant to <e>parotitis</e>. The effect of capsaicin-induced parotitis was examined on a total of 37 nociceptive neurons isolated from the Vi/Vc (n = 23) and C1/C2 (n = 14) regions. Eight of 23 Vi/Vc neurons responded to mechanical distention of the parotid gland, whereas no C1/C2 neurons responded to the parotid distention. Receptive field characteristics in all neurons were examined following capsaicin injections into the parotid gland. Mechanical and cold responses increased significantly in C1/C2 but not Vi/Vc neurons following capsaicin. Receptive field sizes also increased in C1/C2 but not Vi/Vc neurons. At the Vi/Vc transition region, pinch-evoked activity increased in neurons receiving convergent inputs from the parotid gland and facial skin when compared to non-convergent neurons. The present data indicate that the hyperalgesia and referred pain associated with parotitis may result from sensitization of C1/C2, but not Vi/Vc nociceptive neurons.",M2

The causative agent of parotid abscess was Candida albicans, which is an unusual cause of salivary gland pathology. The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. Acute parotitis occurs most often in elderly patients who are debilitated by systemic disease or are in a state of dehydration following major surgical procedures. Despite the high prevalence of oral candida carriage, there have been few previous reports of candida sialoadenitis in the literature. This is due to the toxicity of saliva to fungi under normal conditions. The diagnosis of candidiasis in our patient was made by culturing the purulent discharge from Stensen's duct and by culture of the pus obtained at surgical drainage of the abscess. After incision and drainage, the patient was treated with intravenous and then oral fluconazole for a total of 4 weeks with complete resolution of his condition. This case is interesting in light of recent and ongoing investigations of salivary proteins as potential new antifungal agents.",M2

16564390,"Acute <e>parotitis</e> as a complication of fine-needle aspiration in Warthin's tumor. A unique finding of a 3-year experience with parotid tumor aspiration.OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is an accurate, cost-effective tool for the study of salivary gland lesions. Although complications are extremely rare, salivary gland FNA can lead to hemorrhage, facial nerve injury, and cellulitis at the needle puncture site. Some studies suggest that FNA can cause infarction or metaplastic transformation of benign Warthin's tumors. We review our recent experience with FNA of the parotid gland, focusing on possible complications and pitfalls. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The medical records of all patients who underwent FNA of the parotid gland from 2000 to 2002 in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of a major tertiary-care referral center were reviewed. Cytological results were compared to the histological diagnosis and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 256 lesions aspirated, 99 patients (39%), were cytologically diagnosed as benign tumors, including 31 (12%) Warthin's tumors, of which 16/17 resected and confirmed histologically. Five patients with Warthin's tumor had post-FNA parotitis and were treated accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cystic spaces surrounded by oncocytic cells and a poor blood supply makes the tumor susceptible to infarction and inflammation. Our findings indicate that FNA is a strong and reliable tool in the investigation of the salivary glands. Nevertheless, when Warthin's tumor is clinically suspected on the basis of its location (tail of the parotid gland), cystic texture, patient sex (male) and age, one should consider parotitis as a possible complication.

Sixty-six patients at our institute were treated with TBI followed by BMT. All of the patients received a total TBI dose of 12 Gy given in 6 fractions over 3 days and were divided into 3 groups according to the radiation dose rate and lung dose: group A, lung dose of 8 Gy (n = 18); group B, lung dose of 12 Gy at 8 cGy/min (n = 25); and group C, lung dose of 12 Gy at 19 cGy/min (n = 23). The overall survival rate, the cumulative incidence of relapse, and the cumulative incidence of IP were evaluated in relation to various potential indicators of future IP. There were no significant differences in survival and relapse rates between patient group A and combined groups B and C. Clinically significant IP occurred in 13 patients. The cumulative incidence of IP was significantly higher in patients who developed acute parotitis as indicated by either an elevation in the serum amylase level or parotid pain of grade 1 to 2. There was no difference in IP incidence among groups A, B, and C. There was no significant difference in IP incidence between lung dose values of 8 Gy (with lung shielding) and 12 Gy (without lung shielding) and between dose rate values of 8 cGy/min and 19 cGy/ min, at least when TBI was given in 6 fractions.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of RP of childhood. METHODS: Retrospective study from 1983 to 2004 of children diagnosed with RP of childhood at a tertiary children's hospital. RESULTS: We identified 53 children, 37 (70%) male and 16 (30%) female. The age of onset was biphasic, with peaks at 2-5 years of age and at 10 years. The commonest symptoms were swelling (100%), pain (92.5%) and fever (41.5%). Symptoms usually lasted 2-7 days with a median of 3 days. The mean frequency was 8 episodes per year. The diagnosis was often delayed, &gt;1 year in 70% of patients, maximum 8 years. The most common diagnoses, before the definitive diagnosis of RP, were mumps (21%), 'infection' (15%) and stones (11%). Sialogram (57%) and/or ultrasound (41%) showed sialectasis in 81% of patients. Over half the patients (54%) were given antibiotics at least once to treat the parotitis. Two children had hypogammablobulinaemia, one child had human immunodeficiency virus infection, and one child had Sjogren's syndrome. Two children had high titre antinuclear antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent parotitis had a biphasic age distribution. The major clinical features that distinguish it from other causes of parotid swelling are the lack of pus and recurrent episodes. A clinical diagnosis can often be confirmed by ultrasound. Antibiotics do not have a role in treatment. Affected children should be screened for Sjogren's syndrome and immune deficiency.",M2

METHODS: The clinical records of all children admitted to the Helsinki University Hospital during 1995 to May 2003 because of swelling in the parotid gland were reviewed. A questionnaire on possible recurrences and on familial cases was mailed. As disturbances in trypsin inhibition might be involved in the pathogenesis, we assessed the SPINK1 gene encoding for Kazal-type trypsin inhibitor in voluntary patients. The study group comprised 133 children (boys 82 girls 51) with juvenile parotitis. The median age at presentation of first symptoms was 6.0 y (range 1-19 y). RESULTS: Recurrent symptoms in the parotid gland were common (57%), and 29% of the children (38/133) had suffered from four or more episodes. A young age at the first episode of symptoms increased the likelihood of recurrences (p&lt;0.0001). Familial cases of parotid swelling were common (22%; response rate 67%). A total of 47 patients (35%) agreed to testing for SPINK1 status. Four children had a major mutation (N34S or P55S), corresponding to an 8.5% (4/47) prevalence, but this was not different from the controls (5%). CONCLUSION: It is likely that inherited factors are involved in the manifestation of juvenile parotitis in a subset of patients. It is tempting to speculate that disturbed proteolytic balance may play a role in the development of symptoms.",M2

METHODS: Charts of 7 children with pSS seen at British Columbia's Children's Hospital (BCCH) and data on 128 children identified through Medline in the English language literature between 1963 and 2003 were reviewed for pediatric and AECG criteria for pSS. The presence of &gt; or = 4 criteria was required to satisfy the respective classification criteria. The expert clinical opinion of pediatric rheumatologists was considered the gold standard for diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 24/62 (39%) cases satisfied the AECG criteria; 47/62 (76%) satisfied the proposed pediatric criteria. Inclusion of recurrent <e>parotitis</e> increased the sensitivity of the pediatric clinical criteria. From the cases, 78/133 (59%) satisfied the pediatric oral symptom criteria; only 6/78 (8%) had xerostomia in the absence of recurrent parotitis. There was no reported case of recurrent conjunctivitis in the absence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. We found 101/130 (78%) cases had at least one positive autoantibody test result [antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), SSA, SSB]; 78/123 (63%) had autoantibodies to SSA or SSB. CONCLUSION: The AECG adult criteria for pSS should not be applied to children as the sensitivity is unacceptably low. The inclusion of recurrent parotitis increases the sensitivity of the pediatric criteria, and recurrent parotitis should alert the clinician to the possibility of pSS. The inclusion of recurrent conjunctivitis did not improve the sensitivity over the AECG ocular criteria. The addition of ANA and RF to the AECG criteria did not change the number of patients satisfying the criteria for pediatric pSS.",M2

METHODS: This study involved 27 patients with a long history of parotid swelling. All patients were examined by X-ray, sialography, and were diagnosed as COP without sialolithiasis. Sialoendoscopy was used to observe the ductal system and irrigation treatment performed. The irrigated liquid was centrifuged and the deposits of fluid were stained and observed under microscopy. The sialographic changes were classified as previous studies and compared with sialoendoscopic and irrigation fluid findings. RESULTS: The sialographic changes of COP in 27 patients included 9 cases with type I, 5 cases with type II, 9 cases with type III and 3 cases with type IV changes, 1 case was normal. Marked obstructive factors such as stricture of ductal system were revealed in 21 cases on the sialogram. Sialoendoscopic examination showed that the ductal system was filled with fiber-like substances and hyperaemia of ductal wall in all cases. While few and thin fiber-like substances were found in the COP with sialographic type I and type II changes, many thick wadding or mass fiber-like substances were revealed in COP with sialographic type III and IV changes. Microstones were found in 2 COP with sialographic type III changes which were stained and identified by microscopy. Foreign body (drug bar) was found in one COP with sialographic type I changes with sialoendoscopy. Irrigation fluid examination showed fiber-like substance was composed of desquamative duct epithelial cells, neutrophil, lymphocytes, acidophile. Some epithelial cells were found in two microliths. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological basis of fiber-like substance on sialoendoscopy is desquamative duct epithelial cells. Fiber-like substance in the lumen of ductal system is considered as one of the obstructive factors in COP. Sialoendoscopic findings is related to sialographic changes.",M2

OBJECTIVES: To characterize pediatric parotitis in a tertiary care setting, with the goal of clarifying management recommendations and outcomes. METHODS: The charts of all pediatric patients with a diagnosis of parotitis treated at a tertiary care academic institution from 1999 to 2004 were reviewed. The management of inpatients and outpatients were characterized to define differences in presentation and care. RESULTS: Twenty-one children (6 months-15 years) with a diagnosis of parotitis were identified. Thirteen (62%) children were treated as inpatients, of which seven (54%), had significant medical co-morbidities. The most common clinical presentations of the inpatient group included dehydration (46%), fever (38%) and leukocytosis (46%). Two inpatients (15%) required surgical drainage due to abscess formation. Eight children (38%) were treated as outpatients, none with associated co-morbidity, fever, leukocytosis, or complication due to infection. All outpatients were treated with oral antibiotics or conservative therapy with eventual resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Parotitis in the pediatric population is uncommon. The presence of a significant co-morbidity, fever, or leukocytosis may require inpatient therapy and imaging if patients fail to improve with medical therapy. Other than abscess drainage, surgery for parotitis in children is not routinely recommended.",M2

The median duration of symptoms before these patients sought medical help was 6 months. Except for 1 patient with bilateral TB parotitis, all had unilateral involvement; complications included draining sinuses in 4 patients (8%) and facial palsy in 2 patients (4%).

It arose from recent pancreatitis research that some cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with mutations of the serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type-1 (SPINK1). We tested the hypothesis that the pancreatitis-associated N34S mutation of SPINK1 is also a risk factor for chronic parotitis. METHODS: Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate SPINK1 transcription in the parotid gland. Forty-five blocks of formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissues with chronic parotitis of unknown cause were analyzed for the SPINK1-N34S mutation. RESULTS: The SPINK1 gene is transcribed in the parotid gland. Two of the 45 patients (4.4%) with chronic parotitis carried the N34S mutation heterozygously. Of 82 healthy blood donors, 3 subjects (3.7%) were identified as carrying this mutation heterozygously (p = 0.83). CONCLUSION: The SPINK1-N34S mutation is not associated with chronic parotitis.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: The sialographic changes were classified according to previous studies and related to sialoendoscopic and irrigation fluid findings. METHODS: This study included 26 patients with a long history of parotid swelling. All patients were examined by radiography and sialography and were diagnosed as having chronic obstructive parotitis without sialolithiasis. Sialoendoscopy was used to observe the ductal system and perform an irrigation treatment. The irrigated liquid was centrifuged, and the fluid deposits were stained and observed using light microscopy. RESULTS: In all cases, sialoendoscopic examination showed the ductal system was filled with fiber-like substances and hyperemia of the ductal wall. Although a few of the thin and short fiber-like substances were found in the chronic obstructive parotitis patients with sialographic type I and type II changes, many thick and long wadding or lumpy fiber-like substances were revealed in chronic obstructive parotitis patients with sialographic type III and IV changes. Microstones were found in two chronic obstructive parotitis patients with sialographic type III changes, which were stained and identified using light microscopy. Irrigation fluid examination showed that the fiber-like substance was composed of desquamative duct epithelial cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and acidophils. Also, some epithelial cells were found in two microliths. CONCLUSIONS: Sialoendoscopy can provide direct and more detailed observation of the ductal system compared with sialography. Fiber-like substances in the lumen of the ductal system are considered one of the obstructive factors associated with chronic obstructive parotitis.",M2
