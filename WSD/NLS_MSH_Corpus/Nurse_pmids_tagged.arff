20527656,"Promoting motivation towards community health care: a qualitative study from <e>nurses</e> in Pakistan.Based on the extensive health care needs of Pakistani population, the idea of Community Health Nursing was introduced in 1985. The educational nursing institutes adopted nursing curriculum in order to produce competent nurses to meet the rising demands of society. However, very few numbers of nurses choose community health nursing as their career pathway in Pakistan. Based on the current observation, enhancing motivation among graduate nurses has always been viewed as a great challenge for the academic nursing institutions. This study was intended to explore motivating and de motivating factors in nurses towards community Health Nursing. By utilizing self concept based model of motivation, semi structured interviews were conducted with newly graduated nurses, nurse educators and nursing students. The findings revealed that certain traits, values and competencies are required to motivate nurses as well as to build their capacity towards working effectively in the community setting. Moreover, through this study several realistic recommendations by the participants are highlighted that could foster motivation among future nurses towards this field.",M1

20525464,"[Triage in acute medical admission units]INTRODUCTION: Many emergency departments use validated triage tools. It is currently undocumented if such a practice is common in Danish medical admission units (MAU). The current study was conducted in order to clarify this. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Questionnaire survey with data collected from the intern on call at the medical departments of all Danish hospitals listed on sundhed.dk. RESULTS: We received 87 answers from 60 individual MAUs covered by a total of 83 interns on call. The MAUs had a median of eight beds and 14 admissions a day. An intern was on call 24 hours a day at 95% of the MAUs. At 87% of the MAUs, a doctor was contacted by the admitting physician, while the contact was the responsibility of a <e>nurse</e> in 13% of MAUs. None of the contacted MAUs used a validated triage tool and 95% answered that they triaged on the basis of individual clinical assessment of patients. However, 22% answered that selected groups of patients were routinely assessed by a senior physician. CONCLUSION: None of the Danish MAUs uses a validated triage tool to prioritize acutely admitted medical patients.",M1

20505462,"U.S.-based recruitment of foreign-educated <e>nurses</e>: implications of an emerging industry.OBJECTIVES: Despite an increase in the number of foreign-educated nurses (FENs) working in U.S. hospitals and nursing homes, very little is known about the industry that brought them here. Our objectives were to learn more about the size and scope of the international nurse recruitment industry, its business models, and the range of countries where companies actively recruit. Based on reports from focus groups of FENs in New York City, we also sought to identify some of the problems that have occurred in the areas of contracting and clinical orientation. METHODS: We used a combination of qualitative methods and secondary data sources, which included U.S.-based international nurse recruitment company Web sites, interviews with 20 executives from international nurse recruitment companies, two focus groups with FENs in New York City, and letters sent to the Philippine Nurses Association of America by FENs seeking legal advice. RESULTS: Through a July 2007 Internet search, we found that at least 273 U.S. companies were actively recruiting FENs. While most such companies focused on the Philippines and India, about 20 companies were active in Africa. (A second search revealed that, as of January, at least 211 U.S. companies were actively recruiting FENs abroad.) Within the industry there is growing use of the staffing-agency model, which typically requires nurses to sign 18-to-36-month contracts and imposes high breach-of-contract fees. The focus group discussions with FENs in New York City revealed inadequate orientation programs and several types of labor abuses. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about recruitment practices, which were expressed by many industry executives and FENs, reveal the need for accountability within the industry.",M1

20486478,"The Greek <e>Nurses</e>' job satisfaction scale: development and psychometric assessment.The growing literature relating to job satisfaction among nurses concludes that more research is required to understand the organizational, professional, and personal variables that improve nurse satisfaction and retention. This study developed and psychometrically tested a nurse satisfaction questionnaire, suitable for the nurses' working conditions in Greece. A cross-sectional survey, in Greek, was conducted in three public hospitals. Two-hundred and twenty-five Greek nurses evaluated the psychometric properties of the Greek Nurses' Job Satisfaction Scale (GNJSS). The 18-item questionnaire showed a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.907) and revealed four factors that are consistent with the predetermined subscales and the conceptual base of the GNJSS. The factors, which explain 62.420% of variance, are associated with interaction and recognition, leadership style and organizational policies, self-growth and responsibility, and remuneration and work itself. Although it would be useful to carry out further analyses to assess time-based properties of reliability, the GNJSS questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument to assess nurses' job satisfaction.",M1
20484308,"To have and to hold: personnel shortage in a Finnish healthcare organisation.AIMS: Retirements of baby boomers will create a talent shortage in Finnish health care. Concurrently, difficulties exist in recruiting new personnel. This paper provides an overview concerning the bottlenecks in talent management in a Finnish hospital, and finds solutions for recruitment and retention problems of healthcare professionals (<e>nurses</e> and physicians). Because the healthcare staffing shortage is worldwide, the results of this paper are also useful internationally. METHODS: The research was a qualitative case study and the research method used was group interview. Background data was gathered from the public media and healthcare trade organisations. RESULTS: The bottlenecks of talent management in hospital organisation seem to relate to retaining actions of senior personnel. Concurrently, the organisation should develop new practices for attracting new personnel. Very few efforts on image marketing and recruitment have been done. The Internet has not been fully exploited and recruitment information has not been sent even to the neighbouring nursing college. Job rotation has not been used as a help in recruitment and competence development. Difficulties exist in transmitting tacit knowledge from a retiring nurse to a junior nurse. Leadership skills of the superior seem to be important when retaining and committing senior personnel. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention problems encourage organisations to develop new recruitment and commitment practices as well as management and leadership skills.",M1

20431458,"Implementing a fatigue countermeasures program for <e>nurses</e>: a focus group analysis.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the structural, organizational, and environmental factors associated with the implementation a fatigue countermeasures program for nurses (FCMPN). BACKGROUND: The industrial sector has developed fatigue management programs to improve safety for employees and customers. However, fatigue management programs have not been developed for nurses. METHODS: The oral descriptions of 46 staff nurses and 8 nurse managers participating in an FCMPN were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed. RESULTS: Staff nurses identified awareness, restfulness, and lifestyle control as FCMPN benefits, whereas challenges included work culture, physical environment, and emotional turmoil. Nurse managers perceived ease of program implementation, employee-employer partnerships, and research engagement as benefits. Challenges included lack of support, nursing/organizational culture, and dissonance in staff levels and organizational policies. CONCLUSION: Although FCMPNs are feasible and sustainable in healthcare, a paradigm shift may be needed for a robust implementation of an effective FCMPN that improves patient safety.",M1
20431454,"The effect of a nursing labor management partnership on <e>nurse</e> turnover and satisfaction.OBJECTIVE: The effects of a nursing labor management partnership (NLMP) on nurse turnover and nurse satisfaction were examined. BACKGROUND: Job satisfaction and retention are among the factors related to the nursing shortage. The NLMP was a specific intervention where nursing leaders, both nonbargaining and bargaining, worked collaboratively to improve patient care and outcomes. METHODS: The study was conducted in a large, Magnet-designated urban academic medical center in the Northeastern United States. The hospital has more than 1,000 inpatient beds and more than 2,200 registered nurses, 2,107 of whom are members of a nursing union. Nurse turnover and satisfaction were studied before (2005) and after (2008) the implementation of the NLMP model. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in nurse turnover and a significant increase in nurse satisfaction (from moderate to high) post-NLMP. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a basis for further nursing research on the implementation of an NLMP in union environments.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To improve the quality of intravenous heparin use. METHODS: A pre-post intervention design assessed the number of patients who reached a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), time to aPTT goal, and complications. Fifty traditional care patients were compared with 50 nurse-driven intravenous heparin protocol patients. The data were used to assess the effectiveness of a developed intervention package to improve the quality of intravenous heparin use. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of the preintervention group never reached the therapeutic goal compared with 8% in the postintervention group (P &lt; .05). Mean time to achieve first therapeutic aPTT was 18.6 hours in the preintervention group compared with 15.2 hours in the postintervention group (P = .33). Neither group noted complications. CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary team approach produced improved patient care outcomes and important lessons for improving the quality of intravenous heparin use.",M1

The objective of the study was to delineate the profile of the nurse in a management position according to personal and professional characteristics. The research was performed in 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the descriptive method, applying a questionnaire to 66 nurses in managerial positions. The predominant age group was 44 to 48 years, in a stable relationship and having one child. Most participants (89.39%) have two public jobs, graduated from 21 to 25 years ago (39.39%), have theoretical preparation for leadership (80.39%), and have postgraduate diplomas either lato sensu (36.36%) or stricto sensu (36.06%). In conclusion, nurses in leadership roles have, predominantly, specialization in clinical areas and leadership is essential for the care process. Future studies should correlate their profile to managerial styles and to leadership dimensions.",M1
20393364,"<e>Nurse</e> and patient perceptions of discharge readiness in relation to postdischarge utilization.BACKGROUND: Prevention of hospital readmission and emergency department (ED) utilization will be a crucial strategy in reducing health care costs. There has been limited research on nurse assessment and patient perceptions of discharge readiness in relation to postdischarge outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of nurse and patient assessments of discharge readiness with postdischarge readmissions and ED visits. RESEARCH DESIGN: Hierarchical regression analysis of readmission or ED utilization using independent nurse and patient assessments of discharge readiness and patient characteristics as explanatory variables, with hospital and unit fixed effects. SUBJECTS: A total of 162 adult medical-surgical patients and their discharging nurses from 13 medical-surgical units of 4 Midwestern hospitals. MEASURES: Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale completed independently by patients and their discharging nurses within 4 hours before hospital discharge; Postdischarge utilization (unplanned readmission or ED visit within 30 days postdischarge). RESULTS: Correlations between nurse assessment and patient perceptions of discharge readiness were low (r = 0.15-0.32). Nurses rated patient readiness higher than patients themselves. Controlling for patient characteristics, nurse readiness for hospital discharge scale score (odds ratio = 0.57, P = 0.05) but not patient readiness for hospital discharge scale score was associated with postdischarge utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse assessment was more strongly associated with postdischarge utilization than patient self-assessment. Formalizing nurse assessment of discharge readiness could facilitate identification of patients at risk for readmission or ED utilization before discharge when anticipatory interventions could prevent avoidable postdischarge utilization.",M1
20378222,"Should I stay or should I go? Career change and labor force separation among registered <e>nurses</e> in the U.S.Efforts to retain nurses within the profession are critical for resolving the global nursing shortage, but very little research explores the phenomenon of nursing workforce attrition in the U.S. This study is the first to simultaneously investigate the timing of attrition through survival analysis, the exit path taken (career change vs. labor force separation), and the major socioeconomic, family structure, and demographic variables predicting attrition in this country. Using nationally representative U.S. data from the 2004 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (N=29,472), we find that the rate of labor force separation is highest after the age of 60, a typical pattern for retirement. However, a non-trivial proportion of career change also occurs at older ages (50+ years old), and the rate of labor force separation begins to climb at relatively young ages (30-40 years old). Particularly strong predictors of early labor force separation include being married and providing care to dependents in the home (young children or elderly parents). Career change is predicted strongly by higher levels of education, male gender, and current enrollment in a non-nursing degree program. Having an Advanced Practice credential reduced the hazards of attrition for both exit paths. The results suggest a fruitful path for future research and a number of policy approaches to curbing nurse workforce attrition.",M1

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in eight PCUs in Ubonratchatanee and Chachoengsao provinces in Thailand. Hazardous drinkers were identified using the World Health Organization-recommended Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Of 117 eligible participants (91% male), 59 were randomized to the intervention group to receive MET in three individual appointments with a trained nurse and 58 to an assessment-only control group. Outcome evaluations were carried out after 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available on 84, 94 and 91% of subjects, respectively, at the three intervals. Self-reported drinks per drinking day, frequency of hazardous drinking assessed either on a daily or weekly basis, and of binge drinking sessions were reduced in the intervention group more than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) after both 3 and 6 months. The groups did not generally differ at 6 weeks. However, although self-reported consumption in both groups fell from baseline to 6-month follow-up, serum gamma-glutamyl transferase increased in both groups, which raises doubts about the validity of this marker in this sample and/or the validity of the self-reported data in this study. CONCLUSION: MET delivered by nurses in PCUs in Thailand appears to be an effective intervention for male hazardous drinkers. Uncertainties about the validity of self-reported data jeopardize the safety of this conclusion.",M1

20210369,"Adherence to medicines in the older-aged with chronic conditions: does intervention by an allied health professional help?Adherence to medicines is a major determinant of their effectiveness. However, estimates of non-adherence in the older-aged (defined as those aged &gt;or=65 years) with chronic conditions vary from 40% to 75%. The problems caused by non-adherence in the older-aged include residential care and hospital admissions, progression of the disease and increased costs to society. The reasons for non-adherence in the older-aged include items related to the medicine (e.g. cost, number of medicines, adverse effects) and those related to the person (e.g. cognition, vision, depression). It is also known that there are many ways adherence can be increased (e.g. use of blister packs, cues). Although it is assumed that interventions by allied health professionals (i.e. other than the prescriber/doctor), including a discussion of adherence, will improve adherence to medicines in the older-aged, the evidence for this has not been reviewed. There is some evidence that telephone counselling concerning adherence by a <e>nurse</e> or pharmacist improves short- and long-term adherence. However, face-to-face intervention counselling at the pharmacy or during a home visit by a pharmacist has shown variable results, with some studies showing improved adherence and some not. Broad-based education programmes during hospital stays have not been shown to improve medication adherence following discharge, whereas education programmes specifically for subjects with hypertension have been shown to improve adherence. In combination with an education programme, both counselling and a medicine review programme have been shown to improve short-term adherence in the older-aged. Thus, there are many unanswered questions about the most effective interventions for promoting adherence. More studies are needed to determine the most appropriate interventions by allied health professionals, and such studies need to consider the disease state, demographics and socioeconomic status of the older-aged subject, and the intensity and duration of intervention required.",M1

20190532,"[Utility and improvement of liposome injections AmBisome for clinical use]We have studied AmBisome, which is amphotericin B containing liposomes, used in the treatment of mycosis. Any potential problems regarding the liposome formulation remain unknown because it is a new dosage form. AmBisome is useful in that it can decrease adverse reactions while maintaining a therapeutic effect. However, it is doubtful whether AmBisome is suitable in a busy clinical environment. For example, this formulation should be filtered with an established filter. We then carried out a questionnaire survey involving medical staff (doctors and <e>nurses</e>) to clarify the problems regarding the liposome formulation and its practical utilization. Most doctors were satisfied with the effect of AmBisome, but about 90% of nurses who had used the preparation answered that it was troublesome to use the filter. On the other hand, only 40% of doctors understood how to use the filter when AmBisome was made up; 14% of nurses also did not know how to use the filter. We thought this was because they were not shown how to use it; actually, 30% of doctors were shown the preparation method by medical representatives (MR), although no nurse received an explanation. The residual rate of amphotericin B on 100 used filter pieces differed 50-fold between the minimum and maximum values. AmBisome is effective as an antifungal agent. However, pharmaceutical companies must liaise with medical staff for its effective clinical use. We hope that such companies will have exchanges with medical staff to develop safe and simple medicines, and that liposomes will be effective for many patients.",M1
20185400,"Physician order entry or <e>nurse</e> order entry? Comparison of two implementation strategies for a computerized order entry system aimed at reducing dosing medication errors.BACKGROUND: Despite the significant effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) in reducing nonintercepted medication errors among neonatal inpatients, only a minority of hospitals have successfully implemented such systems. Physicians' resistance and users' frustration seem to be two of the most important barriers. One solution might be to involve nurses in the order entry process to reduce physicians' data entry workload and resistance. However, the effect of this collaborative order entry method in reducing medication errors should be compared with a strictly physician order entry method. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a collaborative order entry method consisting of nurse order entry (NOE) followed by physician verification and countersignature is as effective as a strictly physician order entry (POE) method in reducing nonintercepted dose and frequency medication errors in the neonatal ward of an Iranian teaching hospital. METHODS: A four-month prospective study was designed with two equal periods. During the first period POE was used and during the second period NOE was used. In both methods, a warning appeared when the dose or frequency of the prescribed medication was incorrect that suggested the appropriate dosage to the physicians. Physicians' responses to the warnings were recorded in a database and subsequently analyzed. Relevant paper-based and electronic medical records were reviewed to increase credibility. RESULTS: Medication prescribing for 158 neonates was studied. The rate of nonintercepted medication errors during the NOE period was 40% lower than during the POE period (rate ratio 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] .50, .71;P &lt; .001). During the POE period, 80% of nonintercepted errors occurred at the prescription stage, while during the NOE period, 60% of nonintercepted errors occurred in that stage. Prescription errors decreased from 10.3% during the POE period to 4.6% during the NOE period (P &lt; .001), and the number of warnings with which physicians complied increased from 44% to 68% respectively (P &lt; .001). Meanwhile, transcription errors showed a nonsignificant increase from the POE period to the NOE period. The median error per patient was reduced from 2 during the POE period to 0 during the NOE period (P = .005). Underdose and curtailed and prolonged interval errors were significantly reduced from the POE period to the NOE period. The rate of nonintercepted overdose errors remained constant between the two periods. However, the severity of overdose errors was lower in the NOE period (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: NOE can increase physicians' compliance with warnings and recommended dose and frequency and reduce nonintercepted medication dosing errors in the neonatal ward as effectively as POE or even better. In settings where there is major physician resistance to implementation of CPOE, and nurses are willing to participate in the order entry and are capable of doing so, NOE may be considered a beneficial alternative order entry method.",M1

Two hundred five nurses employed at a pediatric hospital completed surveys on site that examined perceptions of nurse-physician and physician-patient communication, job satisfaction, and nurse-physician collaboration. Nurse reports of physicians who listened effectively and used clear, humorous, immediate, and empathic messages were strongly related to nurses' satisfaction in several contexts. Physicians' use of empathic messages emerged as a significant predictor of nurses' satisfaction with communication, relationships, and collaborative medical practices. Physician humor and clarity were significant predictors of nurses' job satisfaction. There was a significant positive correlation between nurses' perceptions of physicians' use of nurse-centered communication practices and patient-centered communication practices.",M1
20176663,"When policy meets the personal: general practice <e>nurses</e> in Australia.OBJECTIVE: A significant focus of current health policy in Australia is to expand both the number and role of general practice nurses. Multiple new payment incentives have been instituted to encourage the use of practice nurses. This study explored the way these policies have framed their work. METHODS: Multimethod research using observation, workspace photographs and interviews with nurses, doctors and managers collected through rapid appraisal in 25 practices in two states, followed by case studies of the role of nurses in seven practices over one year. RESULTS: Many respondents reported unanticipated benefits in general practice functioning and teamwork as a result of employing a nurse, though this had not been a policy aim. Within funding constraints, nurses created new roles and manipulated old roles to fit their personal understanding of patient care. Policy initiatives targeting practice nurses are often based around tasks and system issues, rather than the personal creation of care and quality that patients require and nurses seek. Incentives in this study were targeted at both the uptake of nurses and specific nursing activities. CONCLUSION: Policy development and funding structures would benefit from better understanding of nurses as agents of connectivity (rather than simply as performers of tasks) as well as the nature of teamwork in practices.",M1
20170327,"Asthma knowledge and asthma management behavior in urban elementary school teachers.BACKGROUND: Although schools are an important setting for asthma care in youth, teachers' asthma knowledge and symptom management is poor. This study investigated the knowledge, prevention and management behaviors, and communication regarding asthma of teachers of low-income, ethnic minority students. It was hypothesized that relative to colleagues whose students did not have active asthma (i.e., did not have symptoms during the day), teachers of students with active asthma would have better asthma knowledge and that more would take asthma prevention steps and communicate with parents and school <e>nurses</e>. METHODS: Drawing from 25 elementary schools in New York City, 320 pre-Kindergarten through 5th grade classroom teachers with at least one student with asthma completed measures assessing their asthma knowledge, steps taken to manage asthma, communication with the school nurse or parents, information they received about asthma, and whether or not they had at least one student in their class experience asthma symptoms. t test and chi-square were used to test hypotheses. RESULTS: Asthma knowledge varied among teachers. Most could identify potential triggers, yet few knew that medication taken prior to exercise could prevent symptoms and that students with asthma need not avoid exercise. Communication between teachers and school nurses and between teachers and parents was lacking. Relative to colleagues whose students did not have active asthma, teachers whose students had active asthma had better asthma knowledge, more took steps to prevent students from having asthma symptoms, communicated with parents, and more initiated communication with the nurse. CONCLUSIONS: Teachers' knowledge about asthma and asthma management is limited, especially among those whose students did not have active asthma. Teachers respond reactively to students who have symptoms in class by increasing prevention steps and communications with parents and the school nurse. A more proactive approach to managing asthma in schools is warranted.",M1

METHODS: Missouri Nurses Association members (1,528) were studied in the summer of 2006 to assess their bioterrorism knowledge and the perceived benefits of education as well as barriers to education. RESULTS:The response rate was 31%. Most respondents (60%, n = 284) received no bioterrorism education. Nurses who were nurse practitioners (t = -2.42, p &lt; .05), were male (t = -2.99, p &lt; .01), or were on a planning committee (t = -1.96, p = .05) had received more education than other nurses. The most commonly cited barrier to education (46.6%, n = 221) was not knowing where to obtain training. One third of respondents (31.2%) reported no interest in receiving bioterrorism education in the future. Nurses' average score on the knowledge test was 73%. The most commonly missed questions pertained to infection control and decontamination procedures.

METHODS: Women with NVP were asked to complete an online survey of 12 questions assessing the extent of NVP and the perspective on the importance of different healthcare professionals for their improvement. RESULTS: A total of 121 pregnant women completed the survey. The median maternal age was 29 years and the average gestational age was 12.4+/-7.6 weeks. Sixty-four of the women (52.9%) had NVP in their previous pregnancy, which resulted in an average of 14.6+/-21.1 lost days of paid work. NVP necessitated admission to the emergency room in 36 (29.7%).

METHODS: Children with all stages of Hodgkin disease, their parents, and the clinic nurse were all asked to complete 4 different HRQL measures at 4 time points: 2 weeks after the first course of chemotherapy, on the third day of the second course of chemotherapy, during the third week of radiation, and 1 year after diagnosis. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients from 12 centers across Canada were enrolled in the study between May 1, 2002 and March 31, 2005. Two patients were excluded. The children's Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) generic scores increased from 64 at base line to 81 at the end of the study. There was substantial agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient &gt;0.6) among the participants' scores at most time points except when the child was actively receiving inpatient chemotherapy. At that time, there was only fair to moderate agreement between the child and parent, with the parents on average rating the PedsQL generic score 5 points lower than the child. The nurses still had substantial agreement at that time point with the PedsQL generic and cancer module as well as the EuroQol EQ-5D visual analogue scale visual analogue scale. CONCLUSIONS: Over the course of treatment for Hodgkin disease, there was substantial agreement among the parent's, nurse's, and children's reported HRQL scores.

There have been few studies done addressing the relationship between work values and nurse turnover intention. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between work values, professional commitment and turnover intention among clinical nurses. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 1st to March 10th, 2008 on a convenience sample of nurses, all of whom had at least a half year of work experience at one of four teaching hospitals in Taiwan. RESULTS: A total of 289 valid responses were received, with a response rate of 96.3%. Major findings included: (1) Nurses who were older, had more years of school, had worked more years, held specific job duties, earned a higher salary, held Buddhist beliefs, or were married with two or more children presented higher work values and professional commitment and lower turnover intention; (2) As a group, total work values and professional commitment scores corresponded negatively with turnover intention scores; (3) Significant factors affecting turnover intent in clinical nurses included professional commitment, institution characteristics, Buddhist beliefs and salary. These four variables accounted for 52.2% of the variation in turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study indicated that nurses with higher work values and professional commitment tend to exhibit less turnover intention. It is highly recommended to develop strategies to bolster the teaching of altruistic values and professional commitment in nursing education in order to reduce turnover intent.

20116298,"Does perceived HIV stigma contribute to <e>nurses</e>' intent to migrate in five African countries?Nurse migration out of low-resource countries has occurred for many years, resulting in workforce shortages, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of HIV. A cross-sectional survey of 1,374 nurses from five African countries (Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, and Tanzania) was conducted. A logistic regression analysis resulted in a profile of odds ratios predicting increased odds of intent to migrate for nurses who were more experienced and working in urban hospitals. These data provide the first support that HIV stigma experienced by nurses through their association as providers for people living with HIV may also be contributing to their intent to migrate. The study contributes to a greater understanding of the complexity of nurse migration in Africa.",M1
20112663,"New <e>nurses</e>' views of quality improvement education.BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) is a focus of hospital managers and policymakers. The role of registered nurses (RNs) in QI in hospitals is vital because most hospital-based RNs provide direct care to patients. QI skills are necessary to identify gaps between current care and best practice and to design, implement, test, and evaluate changes and are essential for R.N.s to participate effectively in QI. Newly licensed registered nurses' (new nurses') positions as direct caregivers could have an impact on QI if nurses lack sufficient knowledge, concepts, and tools required for QI. METHODS: Data came from the 436 respondents (69.4% response rate) to a 2008 eight-page mailed survey to participants in a nationally representative panel survey of new nurses who graduated between August 1, 2004, and July 31, 2005. RESULTS: Overall, 159 (38.6%) of new nurses thought that they were  poorly  or  very poorly  prepared about or had never heard of  QI. Their perceptions of preparation varied widely by the specific topic. Baccalaureate (B.S.) graduates reported significantly higher levels of preparation than associate degree (A.D.) graduates in evidence-based practice; assessing gaps in practice, teamwork, and collaboration; and many of the research-type skills such as data collection, analysis, measurement, and measuring resulting changes. DISCUSSION: Registered-nurse educational programs need to improve education about and application of QI concepts and to consider focusing QI content into a separate course to have some confidence that faculty will teach it. Despite the strong focus on QI in hospitals, new nurses do not see the connection between QI education and successfully performing their hospital jobs. Both nursing programs and hospitals should help new nurses make the connection.",M1

Leprosy, fraught with prejudice and stigma in the early 20s was treated for decades with stringent policies of compulsory isolation of patients in hospitals colonies. Because of prejudice, there was difficulty in hiring staff to maintain these establishments. The stories of the individuals came from taped interviews with seven residents of the colony, by the method of oral history. The research results partially presented in this paper reported the life histories of individuals, their struggles, sorrows and dreams.

20096659,"Suboptimal quality of type 2 diabetes care discovered through electronic feedback led to increased <e>nurse</e>-GP cooperation. A qualitative study.AIM: To understand the influence of electronic feedback system (EFS) on providing type 2 diabetes care in general practice using a qualitative approach embedded in a randomized controlled trial. METHOD: All 160 general practitioners (GPs) randomized to receive EFS were invited. Thirteen GPs from two solo and two partnership practices were interviewed about their experience with the EFS which provided data on the quality of diabetes care in their practices. Data was analysed using a qualitative descriptive approach. RESULTS: All participants found the insight into the overall quality of their diabetes care beneficial. While the two solo practices reported of no changes, the EFS catalysed organisational changes in the two partnership practices by allocating a number of diabetes controls to nurses. Limited time and a lack of real-time data were main barriers towards using the system. CONCLUSION: EFS used at an overall level provided an overview of the diabetes population which made GPs aware of the need to improve the quality of diabetes care. The EFS influenced partnership practices, but not solo practices, to hire nurses and allocate parts of diabetes care to them. The findings are important in the interpretation of the effect of EFS.",M1
20093997,"Clinician perceptions of an electronic medical record during the first year of implementaton in emergency services.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to measure clinician perceptions of the recently implemented electronic medical record (EMR) system in a pediatric emergency department and off-site urgent care centers and to determine how user perceptions changed over time. METHODS: Physicians and <e>nurses</e> from the emergency department/urgent care center were recruited to complete an online survey at 3 points in time: 30 to 89 days (wave 1), 90 to 179 days (wave 2), and 180 to 270 days after implementation (wave 3). Potential predictors of initial satisfaction studied included effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social support, and facilitating conditions, along with user demographics and general attitudes toward technology. Bivariate relationships with satisfaction were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and correlation analysis. A final multivariate linear regression model was calculated. Change in satisfaction over time was tested using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: A total of 71 clinicians completed the surveys. Initial satisfaction was strongly associated with perceptions of training and support (facilitating conditions) and with perceived usefulness (performance expectancy). Satisfaction was not associated with user sex, age, or role (physician vs nurse). No significant change was found in any satisfaction measure at wave 2 or 3; however, satisfaction with functionality trended higher and satisfaction with reliability trended lower over the course of use. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with an EMR at its launch generally persisted through the first year of use. Implementation plans must maximize the likelihood of achieving positive early impressions of training, support, and performance to engender high user satisfaction with the EMR.",M1

20089139,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders among <e>nurses</e> in Ibadan, South-west Nigeria: a cross-sectional survey.BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant occupational problem among nurses; however, data on musculoskeletal health of nurses in Sub-Sahara Africa are sparse. This study sought to determine the lifetime, 12-months period and point prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs); the associated job risk factors and the coping strategies toward reducing the risk among nurses from selected hospitals in Ibadan, South-west Nigeria METHODS: A previously validated self administered questionnaire which sought information on demographics, prevalence and pattern of WMSDs, associated job risk factors and coping strategies was employed as the survey instrument. A total of 160 questionnaires were distributed to nurses in the different hospitals but 128 questionnaires were returned yielding an 80% response rate. 10 of the returned questionnaires were excluded because of incomplete data. RESULTS: Eighty-four point four percent of the nurses have had WMSDs once or more in their occupational lives. The 12-months period and point prevalence rate of WMSDs at any body region was 78% and 66.1% respectively. WMSDs occurred mostly in low back (44.1%), neck (28.0%), and knees (22.4%). 30.3% treated themselves or had visited other health practitioners for care. Nurses with &gt; 20 years of clinical experience are about 4 times more likely to develop WMSDs (OR 3.81; CI 1.08-13.4) than those with 11-20 years experience. Working in the same positions for long periods (55.1%), lifting or transferring dependent patients (50.8%) and treating an excessive number of patients in one day (44.9%) were the most perceived job risk factors for WMSDs. Getting help in handling heavy patients (50.4%), modification of nursing procedures in order to avoid re-injury (45.4%), and modifying patient's/nurse position (40.3%) were the top three coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of Nigerian nurses reported WMSDs at some body site in their occupational lives with the low back being injured most often. Education programmes on prevention and coping strategies for musculoskeletal disorders are recommended for nurses in order to reduce the rate of occupational hazards and also promote efficiency in patient care.",M1

METHOD: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all nurses (n=589) employed in palliative care in Flanders, Belgium. A total of 70.5% of the nurses (n=415) responded. RESULTS: Four meaningful factors were found: the ideological dimension, the intellectual dimension, the ritualistic dimension, and the experiential dimension. Five religious or ideological clusters were found: atheists/agnostics (n=66, 18.3%), 'doubters' (n=64, 17.8%), church-going respondents (n=106, 29.4%), religious but not church-going respondents (n=64, 17.8%), and devout church-going respondents (n=60, 16.7%). Older nurses were more committed to the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Many nurses take the freedom to compose their own religious or ideological identity.

METHODS: The morphine NCA regimen and monitoring was according to standard hospital protocols. Data were collected prospectively and subsequently entered by trained personnel into a secure database. Patient demographics, effectiveness and satisfaction rates, morphine requirements, side effects, and serious complications were recorded. RESULTS: 10,079 patients were included. The average age was 4 years old (range 1 day to 20.5 years, median 2.3 years). There were 510 neonates. The average NCA duration was 43.7 h. 1.8% of morphine NCAs were replaced by other methods because analgesia was unsatisfactory. Satisfaction ratings were 'good' or 'very good' for 98% of the remainder. Average daily morphine requirement (mcg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) was related to age, surgical category, and postoperative time. Side effects included PONV (25%), itching (9.4%), depression of respiration, and sedation (4.5%); incidences varied with age, morphine dose, and type of surgery. Serious, potentially life-threatening adverse effects (SAE) were 0.4%. There were no deaths. SAE were significantly greater in neonates (2.5%), relative risk 9.4, P &lt; 0.001. Morphine dose in neonates who experienced SAE was not significantly different from other neonates. CONCLUSION: NCA with morphine is an acceptable, safe, and effective method of postoperative analgesia for a wide range of ages and types of surgery in our practice. Morphine requirements increase with age, but there was also considerable inter-individual variation within age groups. PONV, itching, sedation, and respiratory depression are expected side effects. SAE are uncommon but the incidence is greatest in neonates.",M1

Further compounding the problem is the lack of a standard definition of violence to guide reporting procedures, interventions, legislation, and research. While there are certain risk factors that not only predispose the nurse and the patient to WPV, research continues to attempt to parse out which risk factors are the key determinants of WPV and also which interventions prove to be significant in reducing WPV.

20067083,"Russian romances: emotionalism and spirituality in the writings of  Eastern Front  <e>nurses</e>, 1914-1918.The nursing work of the First World War is usually associated with the trench warfare of the Western Front. Nurses were based within fairly permanent casualty clearing stations and field hospitals, and patients were moved  down the line  to base hospitals, and then to convalescent hospitals  at home.  The nurses and volunteers who worked on the Eastern Front and offered their services to the letuchka or  flying columns  of the Russian medical services had a very different experience. They worked with highly mobile units, following a rapidly moving  front line.  The diaries of three British (one Anglo-Russian) nurses who worked alongside Russian nursing sisterhoods in three different flying columns-Violetta Thurstan (Field Hospital and Flying Column), Florence Farmborough (With the Armies of the Tsar) and Mary Britnieva (One Woman's Story)--stand as an important corpus of nursing writing. Written in a highly romantic style, they take up similar themes around their work on the Eastern Front as a heroic journey through a dreamlike landscape. Each nurse offers a portrayal of the Russian character as fine and noble. The most important themes deal with the romance of nursing itself, in which nursing work is portrayed as both character-testing and a highly spiritual pursuit.",M1
20053620,"Irritant vocal cord dysfunction and occupational bronchial asthma: differential diagnosis in a health care worker.OBJECTIVES: Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is an uncommon respiratory disease characterized by the paradoxical adduction of vocal cords during inspiration, that may mimic bronchial asthma. The pathogenesis of VCD has not been clearly defined but it is possible to recognize non-psychologic and psychologic causes. The majority of patients are female but, interestingly, a high incidence of VCD has been documented in health care workers. A misdiagnosis with asthma leads to hospitalisation, unnecessary use of systemic steroids with related adverse effects, and sometimes tracheostomy and intubation. In a subset of VCD patients, the disease can be attributed to occupational or environmental exposure to inhaled irritants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman, working as a <e>nurse</e>, who complained of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea related to inhalation of irritating agents (isopropylic alcohol, formaldehyde, peracetic acid). She underwent chest radiography, pulmonary function assessment both in the presence and in the absence of symptoms, bronchial provocation with methacholine and bronchodilation test with salbutamol to recognize asthma's features, allergy evaluation by skin prick tests and patch tests and video-laryngoscopy. RESULTS: VCD diagnosis was made on the basis of video-laryngoscopy, that visualized the paradoxical motion of the vocal cords during symptoms, in the absence of other pathologic processes. CONCLUSIONS: This case fulfils the proposed criteria for the diagnosis of irritant VCD (IVCD). This is the first report of VCD onset following exposure to several irritants: formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, sopropylic alcohol, peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture. These substances are used as cleaning and antiseptic agents in healthcare settings and some ones can also be found in many indoor environments.

METHODS: We identified from the 1990-2006 Finnish Medical Birth Registry all singleton births to nurses (n=109,542), midwives (n=3,009), and teachers (n=23,454) (referents). The main outcomes were sexual differentiation, low and high birth weight, preterm and postterm delivery, small and large for gestational age, and perinatal death. RESULTS: The prevalence of low birth weight (2.9% vs. 2.5%), preterm delivery (4.4% vs. 4.1%), postterm delivery (4.7% vs. 4.1%), small for gestational age (1.8% vs. 1.4%), perinatal death (0.45% vs. 0.41%) and stillbirth (0.30% vs. 0.25%) was higher among the newborns of nurses than those of teachers. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) from generalized estimating equations was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.26) for low birth weight, 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.16) for preterm delivery, 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.18) for postterm delivery, 1.17 (95% CI 1.05-1.30) for small for gestational age, 1.12 (95% CI 0.90-1.35) for perinatal death, and 1.27 (95% CI 0.98-1.56) for stillbirth. For midwives, the risk of small for gestational age (OR=1.25, 95% CI 0.95-1.55) was elevated, but the 95% CI included unity. There was no substantial difference in the sex distribution. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that work as a nurse may reduce fetal growth and duration of pregnancy. The inference is based on the newborns of teachers as the reference group. However, the prevalence of most of the outcomes was higher among the newborns of all other working women combined than in the newborns of both nurses and teachers.",M1
20029168,"<e>Nurse</e>-administered propofol sedation: feasibility and safety in bronchoscopy.BACKGROUND: Propofol is a fast-acting intravenous sedative that has advantages as a procedural sedative over traditional regimens. It has been shown to have a similar safety profile to traditional sedating medications in the setting of gastroenterologic endoscopy. Nurse-administered propofol sedation is given by a specially-trained nurse, without anesthesiologist involvement. OBJECTIVES: We have used nurse-administered propofol sedation in our bronchoscopy suite for several years. In this report, we summarize our experience with nurse-administered propofol sedation, and demonstrate it to be feasible and safe for bronchoscopic procedures. METHODS: Procedure reports and nursing notes for 588 bronchoscopic procedures performed between July 2006 and June 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, procedure type and indication, procedure time, medication doses, and adverse events were noted and analyzed. RESULTS: Nurse-administered propofol sedation was used in 498/588 (85%) procedures. Patients utilizing nurse-administered propofol sedation had an average age of 53 years (range 18-86) with an average weight of 80 kg. 56% of the patients were male, and 57% of the procedures were performed on outpatients. Average procedure duration was 25 min (range 3-123). The average propofol dose was 3.13 mg/kg (range 0.12-20 mg/kg). Adverse events attributable to sedation were noted in 33 (6.6%) procedures. Of the 14 (2.8%) major adverse events (death, need for intubation, ICU stay, or hospitalization), only 6 (1.2%) were potentially attributable to the sedation regimen. There were 2 deaths, neither of which was related to sedation. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-administered propofol sedation is a feasible and safe sedation method for bronchoscopic procedures.",M1
20022601,"Development and validation of an instrument to measure <e>nurse</e>-patient bonding.BACKGROUND: Most instruments on nurse-patient relationship determine the caring behavior of the nurse, but have minimal consideration of the patient's role in the interaction. Moreover, it is the patients that complete many of those instruments, thus leaving out the perspective of the nurse. There is then a need to account for the contributions that both the nurse and the patient bring into their encounter where bonding is formed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument that determines the degree of bonding between nurse and patient based on their openness to each other and their engagement in patient care. SETTINGS: Data were collected from nurses and patients in the wards of four public and private tertiary hospitals in Manila, Philippines, where most Filipino nurses render care to patients before getting employed in other countries. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 420 nurses and patients (i.e., 210 dyads) participated in this research conducted in 2008. Most of the nurses were young females with beginning clinical experience, while the patients had a wider age range with the majority having no college education and no employment. METHODS: The Nurse-Patient Bonding Instrument (NPBI), which dimensions were generated from qualitative observations and interviews, and corroborated by literature, was validated at the bedside setting. To determine interrater reliability, two trained raters unobtrusively observed actual nurse-patient interactions and ticked on the NPBI behavioral indicators of openness and engagement. Construct validity was established using known-groups technique. Moreover, bonding score was correlated with patient satisfaction for predictive validity. RESULTS: Reliability ranged from r=.80 to .95 (p&lt;.01). Factor analysis demonstrated that the subscale scores of patient openness, nurse openness, patient engagement, and nurse engagement all loaded on one factor, the bonding factor, demonstrating a unified structure of the NPBI. Nurses and patients had higher bonding scores in interactions of longer duration than shorter duration, controlling for number of previous encounters. This provided evidence for construct validity using known-groups technique. The NPBI was likewise shown to distinguish groups based on age, education, and civil status. Patient satisfaction correlated positively with bonding score, providing evidence suggestive of the predictive validity of the NPBI. CONCLUSION: The NPBI was shown to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing nurse-patient bonding, and can possibly predict patient satisfaction. The openness and engagement of nurse and patient were demonstrated to result in a structure, a nurse-patient dyad. This finding invites further investigations on the characteristics and development of this dyad.",M1

20018149,"[The significance of appearance in physician-<e>nurse</e> collaboration]INTRODUCTION: According to nurses' assessment, physician-nurse collaboration is problematic. The aim of the study was to investigate whether nurses believe physicians' appearances is significant for their ability to collaborate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-blinded, quasi-experimental intervention study. All physicians included will undergo a total plastic surgical body makeover. Half of the included physicians are to be operated with a view to enhance their physical features, half to weaken their physical features. Multifactorial ANOVA analysis will be used to secure the division. The Jefferson Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Nurse Collaboration will be used for baseline and follow-up study of the nurses' assessment. RESULTS: Due to ethical considerations, researchers had difficulties finding surgeons prepared to perform procedures aiming at weakening the physicians' physical features. Furthermore, it proved difficult to find physicians willing to undergo surgery with a view to weaken their physical features. Consequently, the study was never realized. Additionally, the study experienced difficulties raising the funding needed to cover surgery costs for all included physicians. CONCLUSION: We conclude that physicians often have difficulties collaborating with nurses, regardless of their appearance. It seems that physicians are not interested in improving the collaboration with nurses, and further studies are therefore needed to improve physician-nurse collaboration. We recommend in-depth interviews to achieve harmonic interaction leading to a prolific and close future collaboration.",M1

20010179,"Health promotion in Kenya: a volunteer <e>nurse</e>'s experience.This article presents a case study describing how nurses can improve the health behaviors of people living in developing countries. Difficulties and potential solutions are presented. Health promotion allows people to exert control over their health to improve it. A primary difficulty of health promotion in developing countries is communication between care providers and patients. One solution is the utilization of an interpreter; however, in the present study, no professional interpreters were available, thereby complicating the comprehension of new health-related concepts. Another challenge is to understand the patients' perspectives as related to healthcare values. Additionally, as a result of a dearth of evidence-based research in developing countries, difficulties arise in implementing, assessing, and evaluating health promotion programs. Despite these obstacles, nurses continue to travel to developing countries to promote health. Recommendations include respect for a community's health values and incorporation of these values into healthcare planning. To be accepted as a teacher by the local population, the nurse must be able to set aside his/her personal beliefs relating to healthcare, well-being, and disease. Health promotion initiatives should include the means for implementation, thereby enabling the local population to develop skills that will allow them to carry out health promotion projects.",M1

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A family health network with 8 family physicians, 5 nurses, and 11 administrative personnel serving 10 000 patients in a rural area near Ottawa, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 50 years of age and older at risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes (N = 241). INTERVENTIONS: At-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care from their family physicians or Anticipatory and Preventive Team Care (APTCare) from a collaborative team composed of their physicians, 1 of 3 nurse practitioners, and a pharmacist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of care for chronic disease management (CDM) for diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Controlling for baseline demographic characteristics, the APTCare approach improved CDM QOC by 9.2% (P &lt; .001) compared with traditional care. The APTCare intervention also improved preventive care by 16.5% (P &lt; .001). We did not observe significant differences in other secondary outcome measures (intermediate clinical outcomes, quality of life [Short-Form 36 and health-related quality of life scales], functional status [instrumental activities of daily living scale] and service usage). CONCLUSION: Additional resources in the form of collaborative multidisciplinary care teams with intensive interventions in primary care can improve QOC for CDM in a population of older at-risk patients. The appropriateness of this intervention will depend on its cost-effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT00238836 (CONSORT).",M1
20002950,"Validity, reliability and acceptability of the Imperial Nutritional Screening System (INSYST): a tool that does not require the body mass index.BACKGROUND: Nutritional screening tools are central to identifying malnourished patients, but their efficacy is often reduced as a result of difficulties in obtaining height for body mass index (BMI) calculations. The present study aimed to evaluate the validity, reliability and acceptability of the Imperial Nutritional Screening System (INSYST); a tool that does not require the BMI. METHODS: Patients were screened by the researcher within 72 h of admission using INSYST I &amp; II, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), including taking height and weight. Routine INSYST data, completed by nursing staff, were subsequently collected. At risk and malnourished patients were combined for statistical analysis. Inter-tool and inter-rater agreement (kappa, kappa) was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. <e>Nurses</e> were timed using INSYST. Acceptability, including ease and speed of use, was evaluated. RESULTS: Kappa (agreement) scores (all P &lt; 0.001) were substantial for INSYST I versus MUST and MNA (kappa = 0.73 and kappa = 0.76, respectively) and moderate for INSYST II (both kappa = 0.53). The sensitivity of INSYST I and II was high (95-100%), whereas specificity was lower (65-83%). The agreement between dietitian and nurse for INSYST I was substantial kappa = 0.77 and that for INSYST II was fair kappa = 0.39 (both P &lt;or= 0.001). There was little disagreement for INSYST I, although nurses tended to underestimate malnutrition risk when using INSYST II. INSYST I took a median of 60 s to complete, INSYST II took 102 s and weighing took 100 s, giving a total time of approximately 5 min. Likert scales showed that the majority of nurses scored INSYST as being fast and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: INSYST has shown promising levels of concurrent validity (versus MUST and MNA), inter-rater reliability and acceptability, suggesting that BMI (and therefore height) is unnecessary for identifying malnourished patients.",M1

Case 1: A patient suffering from terminal stage cancer was bed-ridden because of a pathological fracture of the femur. After palliative rehabilitation, the patient was able to get out of the bed and improved her daily living activity level through physical therapy. She spent some days at home according to the results of the pre-discharge home visit guidance to her family. Case 2: A patient suffering from terminal stage cancer manifested symptoms of fatigue and generalized muscular weakness. After palliative rehabilitation, her muscle strength and physical endurance were improved by physical therapy and adjustment of the bed height.

METHODS: A randomized controlled experimental design included intervention participants (n = 147) enrolled in a nurse-managed, lay-led protocol that incorporated nicotine replacement and behavioral counseling. Control participants (n = 155) received a personalized letter from their clinic physician, who advised them to quit smoking and requested they schedule a clinic appointment to discuss cessation. RESULTS: Self-reported and cotinine-validated quit rates were significantly higher among intervention group participants compared with control group participants at 3-and 6-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.02). At 12 months, self-reported abstinence was 19.1% (intervention group) and 9.0% (control group), with cotinine-validated rates of 12.2% and 7.1%, respectively (P = 0.13). Prolonged abstinence rates were significantly different between groups at 3, 6, and 12 months (P &lt; 0.02). Logistic regression analyses indicated adjusted odds of cotinine-validated quitting was associated with cigarette consumption per day (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.99) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score &gt; or = 16 (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.90).

Recognizing and overcoming traditional roles and barriers for nurse faculty on university campuses are essential parts of the political activism that must be assumed. Opening the doors for increased patient access will result in higher utilization of health care providers, and if the nursing shortage is not abated, then bottlenecking of qualified students in programs with critical faculty shortages will create immense pressure in an overloaded care delivery system. The full impact of legislated health reform changes on academe may not be fully realized until after the fact-and as often experienced in the past, this may come too late for policy makers to adequately address questions that should have been raised by the faculty corps beforehand.

Data were collected through participant observation, the researcher's field notes and journal and through semi-structured critical conversations. Data were analysed by the application of a trifocal analytic method (Glass &amp; Davis, 2004; Savage, 2000b). This approach, consistent with the methodology, examined the data at multiple levels by applying realist, feminist and feminist postmodern lens which allowed the data to remain relevant to each participant, avoided objectifying the participants and uncovered knowledge relevant to the nursing profession. The findings revealed what it meant to be a nurse functioning within a corporate setting. Three culturally-constructed discourses emerged: values attributed to nursing, bureaucratic managerialism and medical science. The first was found to be empowering but the other two revealed evidence of patriarchal and oppressive behaviours by both medical staff and senior nurses. The findings also revealed that the nurses were sometimes unaware of the oppression they were subject to. The nurses avoided confronting their oppressors preferring strategies revealed as creep up/creep in. Discussion focuses upon the implications of the research project findings for senior and executive nurse leaders and managers and which may evoke a sense of commonality for women in general. The implications are that nurses could apply self-managing strategies in order to resist gendered oppression in senior-level workplace relationships. The authors recommend that more research and publications are needed that reveal and celebrate women's every-day exemplar empowering leadership practices.",M1

One study group comprised 185 patients who were undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF while the other comprised 170 physician and <e>nurse</e> fertility experts. A key study objective was to identify which aspects of ovarian-stimulation treatment contribute to the physical and psychological burden on patients. Ovarian-stimulation treatment was considered by 55% (n = 102) of patients to impact upon daily life, while 31% (n = 57) felt that daily injections limited their everyday activities. The most frequent questions from patients to physicians and nurses concerned fertility drug-related side effects, followed by concerns about how to perform their injections. More than half of patients (57%, n = 106) had concerns about the injection process. Within the fertility expert group, almost half (47%, n = 80) expressed concern about whether their patients injected themselves correctly, with 26% (n = 44) raising concerns about patient compliance.

The majority of patients with rheumatic diseases require several drugs every day. Adherence is highest among patients who have repeatedly been given drug information by a nurse from the start of the treatment. When developing patient information, it is essential to utilize patients' experiences. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe variations in how patients with rheumatic diseases perceive drug information given by a rheumatology nurse. METHODS: The study had a descriptive qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Fifteen inpatients with rheumatic diseases who had received a new drug agreed to take part in the study and were interviewed. RESULTS: Three descriptive categories emerged: autonomy, power and security. Autonomy was based on patients' experiences of taking responsibility and participating. Power meant gaining knowledge and being motivated to take the drug. Security involved trust, experiencing care and access to a rheumatology nurse. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with a rheumatic disease, drug information from a rheumatology nurse gave them autonomy, power and security. These factors could explain why information from a nurse increases adherence to drug treatment.",M1

METHODS: A total of 123 APNs and nurse specialists working in five major hospitals in Seoul were surveyed from July 15 to August 20, 2007. RESULTS: Fourteen skills out of 126 items were reported as being performed on a regular basis by participants. The majority of these skills involved general observation. Forty-six skills were rarely used. Some participants showed a lack of confidence in certain assessment skills, such as in doing a rectal or pelvic exam, and the use of some assessment equipment. Over 90% of participants required in-depth education on health assessment provided by specialists or nursing professional organizations. CONCLUSION: More educational opportunities in physical assessment should be provided including education programs based on the nurses' skill levels and needs.

Verbal protocols offer a method by which to record these processes. While concurrent and retrospective verbal reporting of cognitions have been used extensively within nursing and other domains, the use of this methodology in nursing has been characterized by inconsistencies in its application. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to describe and compare the content of concurrent and retrospective verbal reports provided by nurses during and after administering care in a simulated task environment. DESIGN: The study utilized a laboratory based quasi-experimental research design. SETTING: The study was based in a simulation laboratory designed specifically for use in studies designed to measure nursing performance. The laboratory integrated extensive instrumentation that facilitated the comprehensive audio and video recording of participant actions. PARTICIPANTS: The participants (N=15) were recruited from a College of Nursing at a large university in the Southeastern United States. METHODS: Research participants were asked to admit a patient experiencing an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in a simulated task environment, during which they were required to prioritize and provide care. Participants were trained in the method for providing verbal reports of thoughts, and concurrent and retrospective report data were collected during and after the simulation exercise. The data were then coded for the purposes of descriptive analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that the concurrent verbal reports provide a more complete representation of the cognitions of research participants providing care in a simulated task environment. However, the results reflect that additional unique data is present in the retrospective reports, exclusive of the concurrent reports. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the utility of concurrent and retrospective verbal reports as a method of gathering data in studies that address nursing performance in a clinical context.",M1

As more older adults live longer with multiple chronic conditions, primary care has been confronted with complex psychosocial problems that interact with medical problems pointing to a potential role for a social worker. From a policy perspective, the lack of strong evidence documenting the benefits that will accrue to patients and providers is a key barrier preventing the wider use of social workers in primary care.

DESIGN: A longitudinal preimplementation and postimplementation study design was used. SETTING: Healthcare workers in a 156-bed, extended-care facility (nursing home) participated in the study. SAMPLE: Participants at the onset of the study included 52 healthcare workers who participated in the study preimplementation and postimplementation of the SMP. Attrition resulted in a final sample of 46. METHODS: Data were collected on healthcare workers' perceptions of injuries as well as existing incident reports and workers' compensation records preimplementation and postimplementation of the study. FINDINGS: Outcomes included major reduction in healthcare worker injuries and related workers' compensation cost savings. The number of healthcare workers who thought an injury occurred as a result of lifting or transferring a resident was reduced by 75%, and perceptions of lifting and transfer injuries resulting in a back strain were reduced by 80%. The number of times in a month healthcare workers felt lifting or transferring a resident was  too much  for them was reduced by 73%. Workers' compensation insurance was reduced by 93%. CONCLUSIONS: A CNS-initiated SMP reduces injuries and costs and may recoup the cost of the program in 5 years. IMPLICATIONS: Job-related musculoskeletal injuries are a critical problem. As the healthcare workforce continues to age, a comprehensive SMP needs to be implemented to ensure safety of employees in the clinical practice setting.

19853339,"Routine checks for HIV in children attending primary health care facilities in South Africa: attitudes of <e>nurses</e> and child caregivers.Management of HIV-infected and exposed children is challenging for health workers in primary care settings. Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) is a WHO/UNICEF strategy for improving morbidity and mortality in under 5 children attending first level facilities in developing countries. In high HIV-prevalence settings, IMCI includes an HIV component for identification and management of HIV-infected and exposed children, which requires health workers to ask all mothers about their HIV status and check all children for signs of HIV. Effective implementation of the HIV component depends on the ability and willingness of health workers to take every opportunity to identify HIV-infected children during routine care, and implementation in South Africa is poor. In 2006, we conducted 10 focus groups in two provinces in South Africa with IMCI-trained nurses, and with mothers attending first level facilities, to determine their attitudes towards, and experiences of, routine checks for HIV during consultations with sick children. Nurses were frequently unwilling to check for HIV in all children, believing it was unnecessary, unacceptable to mothers, and that they lack skills to implement HIV care. Nurses feared mothers would become upset or make a complaint. Mothers consistently recognised the importance of checking children for HIV and supported implementation of routine checks, although the attitude of the nurse was important in determining the acceptability of HIV-related questions. Mothers expressed fears about lack of confidentiality from nurses, and that receiving HIV-related services could lead to unintentional disclosure of their HIV status. Nurses lack the skills in HIV management and communication skills to implement the HIV component of IMCI. We identify issues relate to improved training, clear policies on record keeping, and organization of health services to respect privacy and confidentiality, to improve the willingness of health workers to provide HIV care and mothers to accept it.",M1

METHODS: Healthy women &gt; or =15 years of age receiving routine obstetrical care from <e>nurses</e> and nurse midwives at the outpatient clinic of MacDonald Women's Hospital, Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH were surveyed using a questionnaire interview including Likert-scaled and open-ended questions. All responses to the six open-ended queries were transcribed. Content analysis was used to categorize these responses into three to seven descriptive themes for each question. The authors and two other clinically experienced reviewers participated in theme development, which involved categorization by individual reviewers and then by the group; a full consensus was achieved at each stage. University Hospitals Institutional Review Board approved the study. RESULTS: Of 186 eligible women, 179 (96%) consented, and 176 (95%) were interviewed. Median age was 22 years (range, 15-41 years), 68 (41%) had greater than a high school education, 167 (95%) were African-American, 167 (non-identical 95%) were unmarried, and 87 (49%) were multiparous.

19781433,"Effectiveness and tolerability of pharmacologic and combined interventions for reducing injection pain during routine childhood immunizations: systematic review and meta-analyses.BACKGROUND: Immunization is the most common cause of iatrogenic pain in childhood. Despite the availability of various analgesics to manage vaccine injection pain, they have not been incorporated into clinical practice. To date, no systematic review has been published on the effectiveness of pharmacologic and combined interventions for reducing injection pain. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article were to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of various pharmacologic and combined interventions for reducing the pain experienced by children during immunization. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs pertaining to pharmacologic and combined interventions to reduce injection pain in children 0 to 18 years of age using validated child self-reported pain or observer-reported assessments of child pain and distress. We included trials that (1) investigated the effects of pharmacologic interventions (ie, topical local anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions, vapocoolants, and oral analgesics [acetaminophen or ibuprofen]); (2) compared 2 different analgesic interventions; and (3) evaluated combinations of &gt;or= 2 analgesic interventions, including breastfeeding. Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies, involving 3856 infants and children 2 weeks to 15 years of age, were included in this systematic review; 23 of these trials were included in meta-analyses. Ten trials, including 1156 infants and children, evaluated topical local anesthetics. In a meta-analysis of 2 trials, including 276 children, child self-reported pain ratings were lower in children who received topical local anesthetics than in those who received a placebo. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.25 (95% CI, -0.49 to -0.01; P = 0.04). The use of topical local anesthetics was associated with less pain than was placebo in 4 trials (527 infants) based on the difference between Modified Behavioral Pain Scale scores (range, 0-10) before and after vaccination: the weighted mean difference (WMD) was -0.79 (95% CI, -1.10 to -0.48; P &lt; 0.001) and the SMD was -0.43 (95% CI, -0.60 to -0.26; P = 0.001).

Eleven trials (1452 infants and children) evaluated sweet-tasting solutions. In a meta-analysis of 6 studies (665 infants), administration of sucrose with or without non-nutritive sucking (NNS; use of a pacifier) was associated with less pain than no intervention or sterile water with or without NNS; the SMD was -0.56 (95% CI, -0.72 to -0.40; P &lt; 0.001). Total cry duration was lower in infants who received sucrose than in those who received sterile water (WMD, -9.41 sec; 95% CI, -13.18 to -5.64; P &lt; 0.001; and SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.25; P &lt; 0.001).

In 3 trials that evaluated sweet-tasting solutions longitudinally, administration of sucrose or glucose (vs sterile water, with or without NNS) was associated with reduced pain based on cry duration or the University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital Pain Scale (all, P &lt; 0.05). Data were pooled for 2 studies conducted in 100 children who received a spray with a vapocoolant or placebo at the injection site before the procedure. Child self-rated pain (4-point scale) was lower in the group treated with the vapo-coolant (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.83 to -0.02; P = 0.04); significant heterogeneity was reported for this outcome (chi(2) = 5.51; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%). In 2 studies (117 children), no significant difference was found between vapocoolants and typical care (no treatment) based on child self-reports; significant heterogeneity was reported for this outcome (chi(2) = 9.89; P = 0.02; I(2) = 90%). None of the studies identified in the literature search evaluated oral analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Four studies (318 infants and children) compared 2 different analgesic interventions; there was insufficient evidence to suggest superiority of 1 intervention over another. Combinations of &gt;or=2 analgesic interventions were more effective than the individual interventions used alone. Child self-reported pain ratings were combined for 4 studies (350 children); the SMD was -0.52 (95% CI, -0.73 to -0.30; P = 0.001). Data on cry duration were pooled for 3 studies (229 infants and children); the WMD was -18.87 seconds (95% CI, -32.05 to -5.69; P = 0.005). Parent-rated child pain (VAS) scores were combined for 3 studies (365 infants and children); the WMD was -15.66 mm (95% CI, -19.74 to -11.57; P &lt; 0.001). <e>Nurse</e>- or physician-rated child pain (VAS) scores were combined for 3 studies (368 infants and children); the WMD was -17.85 mm (95% CI, -21.43 to -14.28; P &lt; 0.001). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies (474 infants), infants who were breastfed before, during, and after the procedure had less pain than did those who were not breastfed (SMD, -2.03; 95% CI, -2.26 to -1.80; P &lt; 0.001). A meta-analysis of 3 studies (344 infants) found a shorter cry duration for infants who were breastfed than for those who were not breastfed (WMD, -38.00 sec; 95% CI, -42.27 to -33.73; P &lt; 0.001; and SMD, -2.00; 95% CI, -2.27 to -1.73; P &lt; 0.001). The NNT to prevent 1 infant from having clinically significant pain, using the Facial Pain Rating Scale (pain vs no pain), was 7.7 (95% CI, 4.5 to 25.0) from 1 study. CONCLUSION: Topical local anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions, and combined analgesic interventions, including breastfeeding, were associated with reduced pain during childhood immunizations and should be recommended for use in clinical practice.",M2
19751378,"Evaluation of a feasibility study addressing risk factors for childhood obesity through home visits.AIM: This pilot study aimed to explore the feasibility of addressing risk factors for childhood obesity through a home-based early intervention program. METHOD: A pilot study was conducted with 56 first-time mothers, recruited through the antenatal and delivery units of an inner western Sydney hospital. The study offered five home visits by a community early childhood health <e>nurse</e> during the child's first year of life. At each visit, the intervention was tailored to the appropriate developmental stage of the child. One-to-one consultation was provided with a focus on sustained breastfeeding, appropriate introduction of solids, avoiding food rewards and promoting the drinking of water and the use of a cup. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program. RESULTS: The results indicate that the program was very well received by the participating mothers, with a retention rate of 95%. Compared with the state population average, the rate of breastfeeding at 12 months was significantly higher (36% vs. 18%, chi(2)= 8.21, P &lt; 0.01), there was a lower rate of the introduction of solids before 4 months (2% vs. 13%, chi(2)= 8.73, P &lt; 0.01), and there was a high rate of cup usage at 12 months (98%). CONCLUSIONS: The early onset of childhood overweight and obesity requires health promotion intervention programs to commence as early as possible. A home-based intervention through multiple home visits is feasible in addressing the risk factors for childhood obesity.",M2
19397436,"Evaluating <e>nurses</e>' implementation of an infant-feeding counseling protocol for HIV-infected mothers: The Ban Study in Lilongwe, Malawi.A process evaluation of nurses' implementation of an infant-feeding counseling protocol was conducted for the Breastfeeding, Antiretroviral and Nutrition (BAN) Study, a prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV clinical trial in Lilongwe, Malawi. Six trained nurses counseled HIV-infected mothers to exclusively breastfeed for 24 weeks postpartum and to stop breastfeeding within an additional four weeks. Implementation data were collected via direct observations of 123 infant feeding counseling sessions (30 antenatal and 93 postnatal) and interviews with each nurse. Analysis included calculating a percent adherence to checklists and conducting a content analysis for the observation and interview data. Nurses were implementing the protocol at an average adherence level of 90% or above. Although not detailed in the protocol, nurses appropriately counseled mothers on their actual or intended formula milk usage after weaning. Results indicate that nurses implemented the protocol as designed. Results will help to interpret the BAN Study's outcomes.",M2
19259990,"Nipple preference and contests in suckling kittens of the domestic cat are unrelated to presumed nipple quality.We studied the development of suckling behavior and weight gain in 11 litters (52 kittens) of free-ranging domestic cats until postnatal day 28 just before the start of weaning. In six of these litters, we also recorded milk intake and contests for access to nipples. Already within 12 hr of birth kittens showed a preference for posterior nipples, and by postnatal day 3 each had developed a preference for particular nipples. In fact, 86% of kittens used one particular nipple most often, and even when the mother changed the side she lay on to <e>nurse</e>. Contests for access to nipples occurred throughout the study period at an average rate of one to two contests per kitten per hour of nursing. Contrary to suggestions in the literature that kittens compete for more productive nipples, we found no relation between kittens' use of particular nipples and their weight gain, milk intake, or involvement in contests during suckling. We suggest that kittens' preference for posterior nipples as well as their establishment of an individual  teat order  might function to optimize the number of nipples remaining productive across lactation, and to reduce energetically costly scrambles and potentially injurious contests among littermates.",M2
19243262,"Breastfeeding and WIC enrollment in the <e>Nurse</e> Family Partnership Program.OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have raised the issue of lower breastfeeding rates for mothers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). We wanted to explore this association of WIC and lower breastfeeding in Nurse Family Partnership Program (NFP), a national representative group of mother-baby pairs on which extensive background data are available. Our aim was to compare breastfeeding rates at 6 and 12 months in NFP high-risk mothers who were enrolled in WIC to those who were not enrolled in WIC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis in mothers and infants from this cohort for 2000-2005 (n = 3,570). RESULTS: We found that at 6 months of age, 87.8% of mothers who were not breastfeeding were enrolled in WIC as compared to 82.6% of mothers who were breastfeeding (p &lt; 0.001). However, in the multivariate analysis, WIC was no longer a significant predictor of breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective evaluation of this issue is warranted particularly with the implementation of changes in the WIC Food Package and Breastfeeding Promotion.",M2
19148114,"Attitudes of NICU professionals regarding feeding blood-tinged colostrum or milk.OBJECTIVE: Mothers of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients sometimes bring expressed milk that is blood tinged to the NICU. In certain instances, the blood contamination appears minimal, whereas in others, the milk is quite dark pink. We have observed inconsistencies in practice regarding whether or not to feed blood-tinged colostrum or milk to NICU patients. We know of no evidence that establishes best practice in this area, and thus we sought to determine attitudes of NICU professionals on which to base a potentially best practice. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a web-based anonymous survey of attitudes of NICU professionals at Intermountain Healthcare regarding feeding blood-tinged expressed milk to NICU patients. These professionals included neonatologists, neonatal <e>nurse</e> practitioners, NICU nurses, NICU dieticians and lactation consultants. RESULT:Survey results were returned from 64% (426 of 667) of those to whom it was sent. A total of 75% of respondents reported that their practice was NOT to feed the blood-tinged milk illustrated in the figure as sample 2, and nearly all respondents (98%) reported that they would NOT feed the milk illustrated as sample 3. The majority of the neonatologists (56%) and the lactation consultants (58%) recommended feeding moderately bloody milk (sample 2), whereas only 22% of the neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs), NICU nurses and NICU dieticians recommended feeding such samples (&lt;0.001). The most frequently selected reason for NOT feeding blood-tinged milk was that it would likely cause gastrointestinal upset and feeding intolerance (selected by 77%). The majority (87%) overestimated the amount of blood contaminating a milk sample (sample 3). CONCLUSION: As colostrum and human milk feedings can be of value to NICU patients, evidence should be assembled to document whether feeding blood-tinged samples indeed have the problems listed by the survey respondents. Such evidence is needed to enable informed decisions involving the benefits vs risks of feeding blood-tinged expressed milk to NICU patients.",M2
19131433,"Early discharge with tube feeding at home for preterm infants is associated with longer duration of breast feeding.OBJECTIVE: Mothers of preterm infants are more likely to discontinue breast feeding early than mothers of term infants. We evaluated the effect of early discharge with tube feeding of preterm infants under close supervision by paediatric <e>nurse</e> specialists on the duration of breast feeding. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Medium/high-care neonatal unit of a large district general hospital. SUBJECTS: Preterm infants (&lt;37 weeks' gestational age). INTERVENTIONS: Early discharge with tube feeding under close supervision by paediatric nurse specialists or regular follow-up of preterm infants discharged with oral feeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Duration of breast feeding assessed by telephone interview 6 months after birth. RESULTS: There were 50 preterm infants in the early discharge group and 78 in the control group. Mothers in the early discharge group continued to breast feed longer than mothers in the control group (log rank test, p = 0.028). Four months after discharge, 63% of preterm infants in the control group were fed formula compared to 36% in the early discharge group (95% CI for difference 9% to 43%, p = 0.04). The relative risk of breast feeding cessation 6 months after birth in the early discharge group compared to the control group was 0.63 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.96). After adjustment for smoking, gestational age and birth weight, this relative risk was 0.67 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Close supervision and follow-up by paediatric nurse specialists of preterm infants discharged early with tube feeding appears to increase duration of breast feeding. A randomised controlled trial to confirm these findings is warranted.",M2
19065966,"Birth to breast--a feeding care map for the NICU: helping the extremely low birth weight infant navigate the course.Breast milk has been shown to contribute significantly to positive neurodevelopmental and medical outcomes in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant population. It is crucial that ELBW infants receive their mother's colostrum as a first feeding, followed by expressed breast milk for as long as possible. Evidence-based literature supports the difficult challenges both mothers and ELBW infants face if they are to succeed at breast pumping and breastfeeding. Influencing factors include the medical fragility of the infant, limited frequency and duration of kangaroo care between mother and infant, lack of an adequate volume of breast milk, as well as inconsistent or incorrect information surrounding the use of breast milk and breastfeeding. A feeding care map as described in this article can help the bedside <e>nurse</e> assist the mother-ELBW infant dyad in optimizing breast milk volumes, laying the groundwork for breastfeeding. Displaying supportive practices and preterm infant developmental milestones, the map categorizes infant, maternal, and dyad feeding issues along a progressive time line from admission to discharge.",M2
19033740,"The breast-feeding conversation: a philosophic exploration of support.<e>Nurses</e> play a vital role in mothers' early experiences with breast-feeding. Literature enumerates both supportive and nonsupportive behaviors, as well as the  interpersonal  aspect of breast-feeding support, although little direction is given to nurses about how to facilitate the relationship. This article conceptualizes breast-feeding support within Gadamerian hermeneutics as a conversation among nurses, mothers, and their newborns. Hermeneutically, breast-feeding conversation encompasses a text (a particular feeding at the breast), conversational partners (a mother, her newborn, and a nurse), and a dialogue that facilitates effective breast-feeding and maternal breast-feeding confidence through interpretation or understanding of the text. History and language are essential as a partnership is formed.",M2
18956963,"Influence of sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics on breastfeeding duration of mothers attending breastfeeding support groups.AIM: Duration of breastfeeding, socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics of the mothers attending breastfeeding support groups were investigated. METHODS: All examined mothers were cared for according to the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. The investigated group of mothers attended a breastfeeding support group (BSG) led by a community <e>nurse</e> and women experienced in breastfeeding without additional training. Data on breastfeeding duration were collected retrospectively by self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 980 eligible, 393 mothers were included to the study: 210 attended BSG, while 183 did not. The following differences between the two groups were found: time when the decision to breastfeed was made, smoking during lactation and social support while breastfeeding. More mothers in the investigated group continued breastfeeding at least six months postnatal (83.8% vs. 48.1%, P&lt;0.001), with exclusive breastfeeding until the age of three months (56% vs. 23.5%, P&lt;0.001). After logistic regression analysis, the following factors were found to be positively associated with the duration of breastfeeding for at least six months: time when the decision to breastfeed was made, intended duration of breastfeeding and household income. Maternal smoking during pregnancy affected duration of breastfeeding inversely. CONCLUSION: Characteristics which positively influenced the duration of breastfeeding are the time when the decision to breastfeed was made, intended duration of breastfeeding, household income, and smoking during pregnancy. Mothers who attended BSG more often continued breastfeeding for at least six months if they decided to breastfeed after birth, intended to breastfeed for longer than six months, had higher monthly household income and did not smoke during pregnancy.",M2

METHODS: This quasi experimental study was designed with a nonequivalent control group post test. The subjects of this study were 55 mothers who were hospitalized in the delivery room of a university hospital which was selected as a BFH in Daegu from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006. Twenty nine mothers were assigned to the experimental group and 26 mothers to the control group. Postpartum breast-feeding support by nurses' telephone calls to the experimental group was provided once a week for 4 weeks postpartum and then once a month for 16 weeks postpartum. Four post tests were given at postpartum week 4, 8, 12, and 16. The control group was given a telephone call at postpartum week 4, 8, 12, and 16. RESULTS: The breastfeeding prevalence of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group for each period. CONCLUSION: Postpartum breast-feeding support by nurses may be a useful intervention to increase breast-feeding prevalence.",M2
20027741,"Breasts for hire and shared breastfeeding: wet nursing and cross feeding in Australia, 1900-2000.Wet nursing and cross-nursing both involve the breastfeeding of a baby by someone who is not the baby's mother. They differ in that wet <e>nurses</e> were usually employees in paid situations and the breastfeeding was not reciprocated, whereas cross-nursing was between peers and was usually unpaid and could be reciprocal. In Australia at the turn of the twentieth century wet nurses were employed in private homes or institutions. By the 1920s, finding a wet nurse had become extremely difficult, but informal cross-feeding existed long after this. This study examines both practices in twentieth century Australia, 1900-2000, and includes a discussion of the decline of human milk banks, another means of sharing mothers' milk.",M2

Evaluation of an educational intervention in a level III perinatal unit]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the educational intervention provided in a perinatal unit to support mothers of preterm babies who intend to breastfeed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was prospective and included all the infants born between 30 and 34 weeks of gestation at the Jeanne-de-Flandre university hospital in Lille and whose mothers intended to breastfeed. The studied period extended from January to December 2005, comparing the first and the last semester. The different actions were guided by the formation of the staff and lactation counselling to mothers, especially in the initiation of lactation. They were provided by one full-time <e>nurse</e> who was lactation consultant. The main outcome measure was the time to the first breast milk expression. Secondary outcome was the rate of infants breastfed at discharge. RESULTS: Twenty-one educational interventions were organised for all the people working in the unit. One hundred thirty-two nurses and 17 doctors attended to these sessions. During the study period, 175 babies were born preterm at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks: 81 during the first semester and 94 during the second. The two populations were comparable for gestational age and the social class of the mothers, but the birth weight was higher during the second semester (1681+/-140 vs 1774+/-216 g, P=0, 01). Mothers of 65.1% of the neonates intended to breastfeed. The time of the first breast milk expression decreased significatively during the second semester (37,5 vs 30,7 h, P&lt;0, 01). The rate of exclusively or partially breastfed neonates at discharge was stable (88,5 vs 91,9%, ns). CONCLUSION: The program improved the initiation of lactation. This work emphasises the difficulties and the different steps necessary to promote breastfeeding in preterm babies with respect to developmental care.",M2
17991800,"Breastfeeding information in nursing textbooks needs improvement.The objective of this study was to determine if breastfeeding information in maternal-child (nursing) textbooks used in the United States is accurate and up to date. Six nursing textbooks, all published since 1999, were reviewed using a standardized scoring sheet. Five reviewers (1 pediatrician, 2 lactation consultants, 1 <e>nurse</e>, and 1 research assistant) examined breastfeeding content in each text. Each textbook was graded for inclusion of 20 basic breastfeeding facts derived from recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization. Of the 20 criteria scored, the mean number present was 17 (range, 14-19). For each category, the mean number of criteria was correct (11.8; range, 10-15) incorrect (5.2; range, 2-8), and omitted (3.0; range, 1-6). The scores were Pilliteri 10/20 (50%), Ladewig 11/20 (55%), Leifer 11/20 (55%), Ball 12/20 (60%), London 12/20 (60%), and Klossner 15/20 (75%). Thus, breastfeeding information in these nursing textbooks, when not omitted, was at times found to be inaccurate and inconsistent.",M2
17686796,"Infant feeding in the time of HIV: rapid assessment of infant feeding policy and programmes in four African countries scaling up prevention of mother to child transmission programmes.OBJECTIVE: To assess the infant feeding components of prevention of mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programmes. METHODS: Assessments were performed across Botswana, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda. 29 districts offering PMTCT were selected by stratified random sampling with rural and urban strata. All health facilities in the selected PMTCT district were assessed. The facility level manager and the senior <e>nurse</e> in charge of maternal care were interviewed. 334 randomly selected health workers involved in the PMTCT programme completed self-administered questionnaires. 640 PMTCT counselling observations were carried out and 34 focus groups were conducted amongst men and women. RESULTS: Most health workers (234/334, 70%) were unable to correctly estimate the transmission risks of breastfeeding irrespective of exposure to PMTCT training. Infant feeding options were mentioned in 307 of 640 (48%) observations of PMTCT counselling sessions, and in only 35 (5.5%) were infant feeding issues discussed in any depth; of these 19 (54.3%) were rated as poor. Several health workers also reported receiving free samples of infant formula in contravention of the International Code on Breastmilk Substitutes. National HIV managers stated they were unsure about infant feeding policy in the context of HIV. Finally, there was an almost universal belief that an HIV positive mother who breastfeeds her child will always infect the child and intentional avoidance of breastfeeding by the mother indicates that she is HIV positive. CONCLUSION: These findings underline the need to implement and support systematic infant feeding policies and programme responses in the context of HIV programmes.",M2
17599074,"Therapy insight: the use of antirheumatic drugs during nursing.In 90% of cases, women with rheumatoid arthritis suffer a disease flare within 3 months of delivery of their baby. Drug treatment is, therefore, required; however, such therapies have implications for mothers who decide to <e>nurse</e> their infants. Unfortunately, because of a paucity of data, little is known about the transfer of antirheumatic drugs into breast milk, and even less is known about whether small amounts of these agents ingested during nursing could harm the infant. Our review of the literature indicates that paracetamol, prednisone, antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine and most NSAIDs can safely be used by lactating mothers. Expert opinions differ regarding the use of azathioprine, ciclosporin, and methotrexate during lactation because of varying views on the potential for short-term and long-term adverse effects. Evidence regarding the transfer of leflunomide and biologic drugs into breast milk is insufficient; therefore, until more studies are conducted, the use of these drugs in breastfeeding mothers should be restricted. At present, many patients feel they have to choose between postpartum disease control and lactation. Extended studies of the transfer of antirheumatic drugs into breast milk and the resulting consequences are, therefore, urgently needed.",M2

The growing evidence base regarding nipple feeding readiness and progression, contingent caregiving, and nurse autonomy in decision making prompted our Level III NICU to reconsider our process. A literature review and discussions resulted in new protocols for initiating and advancing nipple feedings for three distinct groups: healthy preterm infants, preterm infants with complicated medical courses, and sick term or posttcrm infants.

17220391,"Adolescents' perceptions of inpatient postpartum nursing care.The authors used a transcendental phenomenological approach to describe adolescent mothers' satisfactory and unsatisfactory inpatient postpartum nursing care experiences. They analyzed data from 14 in-depth interviews and found that adolescent mothers' satisfaction is dependent on their perceptions of the <e>nurse</e>'s ability to place them  at ease.  Nursing care qualities that contributed to satisfactory experiences included nurses' sharing information about themselves, being calm, demonstrating confidence in mothers, speaking to adolescent and adult mothers in the same way, and anticipating unstated needs. Nursing care was perceived to be unsatisfactory when it was too serious, limited to the job required, or different from care to adult mothers, or when nurses failed to recognize individual needs. In extreme cases, unsatisfactory experiences hindered development of an effective nurse-client relationship. These findings illustrate the value of qualitative inquiry for understanding patients' satisfaction with care, can be used for self-reflection, and have implications for nursing education programs.",M2

17093377,"Breast-feeding. The roots.Although breast milk provides the best nutrition for the infant, breast-feeding has been decreasing with the growth in use of prepared milk formulas. This paper evaluates the available biblical literature dealing with breast-feeding. The research is unique in character, as it combines contemporary medical knowledge with presentation of cases taken from ancient history. We include no commentaries, but refer only to the words of the Bible exactly as written. Biblical texts relating to breast-feeding were examined and the cases of biblical characters who were breast-fed were studied. The great historical figures such as Isaac, Rebecca, Moses, Samuel, and Joash were breast-fed, openly or secretly. If the biological mother was unable to <e>nurse</e> her child, a wet nurse took over the feeding. Breast-feeding was the only way infants could survive at that time. Weaning day was very important and was celebrated. The wet nurse played an important role in family life, in some cases remaining to live with the infant after weaning, through childhood and even into adulthood. In spite of advanced technology that provides artificial infant formulas, contemporary mothers, just like biblical mothers, should be encouraged to breast-feed their infants.",M2

A questionnaire addressing breast-feeding issues was sent to family practitioners (FP), obstetric-gynecologists (OB/GYN), and <e>nurse</e> midwives (NM) in Iowa, USA. All NM, 97% of FP, and 85% of OB/GYN reported asking infant feeding preference-usually only at the first prenatal visit. NM (73%) were most likely to provide extensive breast-feeding counseling. OB/GYN (68%) and FP physicians (90%) reported doing their own breast-feeding counseling. Breast examinations targeting future breast-feeding problems were done in 82% to 84% of patients. NM practices shared more information supportive of breast-feeding. Nearly all providers offered prenatal classes, but only 41% of FP offered breast-feeding classes. Free formula samples were available in 73% of FP, 54% of OB/GYN, and 36% NM offices. Pamphlets on formula feeding and also breast-feeding were readily available. Overall NM (64%) reported being strong breast-feeding advocates compared to only 13% of FP and 7% of OB/GYN.

Because studies have demonstrated consistently that breastfeeding is associated with lower rates of infant illness, and that full-time maternal employment decreases breastfeeding duration, establishing an onsite lactation program within a corporation or organization could assist employees in maintaining ideal nutrition for their infants. Net gains for the organization, such as decreased absenteeism and fewer healthcare benefit claims can occur. The author suggests that the establishment of such a program by a <e>nurse</e> can be a successful nursing intervention.",M2

A rant on the state of lactation advice today.Grandmothers often find that their children parent differently, or get parenting advice different from what they themselves learned as young mothers. When that happens, it can give the grandmother a feeling that what she did as a mother was invalid. When I became a grandmother, I considered myself lucky. I was a practicing paediatric <e>nurse</e>-practitioner and teaching in a university; as new studies came along that suggested making changes in the way people parented, I could understand and accept them from a medical point of view without feeling invalidated as a mother.",M2
16958719,"Policies and practices for maternal support options during childbirth and breastfeeding initiation after cesarean in southeastern hospitals.OBJECTIVE: To describe policies, practices, and associated rationales of hospital obstetric units regarding mothers' support person options during childbirth and to explore practices concerning support of breastfeeding initiation after cesarean delivery. DESIGN: Descriptive telephone survey. SETTING: Hospitals in the southeastern region of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 154 obstetric <e>nurse</e> manager and nurse representatives employed by the participating hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Types of policies regarding mothers' support person options during childbirth and immediate postpartum stage, initiation of breastfeeding after cesarean birth, and attitudes about policies. RESULTS: All hospitals allowed two or more support persons during vaginal births, 89% permitted only one support person during nonemergent cesareans, and 58.0% of the nurse representatives believed that mothers should be allowed a second support person. Less than one third (31.2%) of the hospitals considered a mother's request to breastfeed in the operating room, and most (78.6%) allowed mothers to breastfeed in the recovery room. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, maternal support policies, practices, and nurse representatives' attitudes were mother and family friendly, particularly related to vaginal births. Though breastfeeding initiation after cesarean birth was encouraging, support person options during nonemergent cesarean births and related rationales warrant further examination.",M2

16732696,"A breastfeeding study in a rural population in South Australia.INTRODUCTION: The benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and babies are well recognised; however, challenges to its establishment and maintenance exist in rural locations. METHOD: This study in a rural community aimed to: (1) collect rates of any breastfeeding at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postpartum; and (2) seek women's postnatal breastfeeding needs and discern how they were met. Fifty-eight women, most of whom had planned to birth at one of two rural hospitals with fewer than 50 births a year were interviewed face-to-face or by telephone. Questions included whether they were still breastfeeding, reasons for stopping, and their breastfeeding support needs in hospital and after discharge on eight domains: establishment; attachment; engorgement; sore nipples; cracked nipples; ongoing support; supply and mastitis. RESULTS: The number breastfeeding at 3 months (55%) compared poorly with South Australia (62%) or nationally (63%). Midwives met most of the needs of the women in hospital while, at home, midwives and GPs remained the main sources of support. At home, small numbers contacted the Australian Breastfeeding Association, child and youth health service <e>nurse</e>; a midwife employed by a pharmacist and family members such as mothers and mothers-in-law for support. Overall, 25% of women who had an identified need did not seek help. Of those who did, 36% had the need met well and 28% poorly. After discharge, 52 (90%) would have welcomed a visit from a community midwife had it been available. In the regional town, facilities to breastfeed and change babies' nappies were rated poor or non-existent. CONCLUSION: Since this study, a part-time community midwife has been employed and a new project initiated that educates and assists older women volunteers to support and promote breastfeeding for isolated new mothers.",M2

They often wonder what they can do to help their infant during the critical newborn period. Providing breast milk is one of the most important physiologic benefits a mother can give her premature infant. The advantages of breast milk are numerous. It is the responsibility of those who care for premature infants and their families to provide parents with the support they need to supply the best possible nutrition for their infant. Breastfeeding a premature infant can challenge both the mother and her health care team, however. Infants should be assessed individually for readiness to proceed through the steps leading to successftil breastfeeding.

16537985,"Factors associated with exclusive breast-feeding in Japan: for activities to support child-rearing with breast-feeding.BACKGROUND: Benefits of breast-feeding are not only limited to nutrition and sanitation in developing countries but also extend to cost-saving health care and alleviation of anxiety related to childrearing in developed countries. This study aims to elucidate factors associated with exclusive breast-feeding in Japan and use this information to achieve child-rearing support worldwide by promoting breast-feeding. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from a survey conducted by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the Japanese government, the First Longitudinal Survey of Babies in 21st Century. All subjects were infants (n=53,575) born in Japan in 2001 between January 10 and 17 and between July 10 and 17. According to the data, the exclusive breast-feeding rate in Japan during the first 6 months of life was 21.0%. We examined the factors associated with exclusive breast-feeding using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among the factors examined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for exclusive breast-feeding was low for late childbearing, low birth weight infants, multiple births, smoking parents, living with grandparents, and feeling burdened by childrearing. The adjusted OR was high for factors that included sufficient childcare leave and consultation about childrearing with the spouse, a birth attendant and/or <e>nurse</e>, and a peer in a child-rearing circle. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breast-feeding is associated not only with medical factors but also with social factors. This study clarifies the necessity of social support to reduce the child rearing burden and a political system to promote paternal participation in childrearing and to improve the childcare leave system.",M2
16496220,"Policies and practices related to breastfeeding in massachusetts: hospital implementation of the ten steps to successful breastfeeding.BACKGROUND: Hospital policies and practices related to breastfeeding may have long-term health effects. The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (WHO/UNICEF) provide an evidence-based standard, which may be used to assess individual hospitals. We assessed implementation, and factors related to implementation, of the Ten Steps in Massachusetts hospitals. METHODS: We surveyed postpartum <e>nurse</e> managers at 43 (88%) of the 49 Massachusetts maternity hospitals by telephone. Survey items characterized hospital policies, breastfeeding education, and support practices. We classified hospital implementation of the Ten Steps as high, moderately high, partial, or low and used Massachusetts Department of Public Health hospital data to analyze factors related to implementation. RESULTS: Levels of implementation of the Ten Steps ranged from high to partial. Overall, we classified implementation of 2% of hospitals as high, 58% moderately high, 40% partial, and 0% as low. Hospitals with high/moderately high levels of implementation significantly differed from hospitals with partial implementation with respect to pacifier usage (p=0.0017) and postpartum breastfeeding instruction (p=0.0001). Requirement of a physician order for formula was a statistically significant (p=0.02) predictor of Step 1 implementation but did not reach significance (p=0.14) overall. Acceptance of free formula was significantly associated (p=0.03) with overall Ten Steps implementation. CONCLUSION: Rates of self-reported implementation of the Ten Steps are relatively high in Massachusetts. Step 1 implementation is significantly associated with formula availability, and overall implementation with acceptance of free formula. Continued assessment is needed to confirm these results in larger samples and to examine the relationship of implementation of individual steps, breastfeeding rates, and health outcomes.",M2
16445363,"Screening for depression among pregnant and postpartum women.The purpose of this study was to examine the screening of depression among pregnant and postpartum participants in a community-based program. This cross-sectional study used archival data from 98 women participating in a community-based visiting <e>nurse</e> program in a midwestern U.S. city. Depression screening was accomplished using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS); both instruments ask respondents to answer questions regarding their mood during the past week. The CES-D identified more pregnant and postpartum women as depressed than did the EPDS. A standard regression analysis using previous pregnancies, history of depression, married versus nonmarried, presence of support, and breast-feeding as predictor variables did not produce statistically significant findings for predicting depression among the pregnant and postpartum women in this study. This finding underscores the value of brief depression screening instruments for nurses working with pregnant and postpartum women.",M2
16422722,"Economics of home vs. hospital breastfeeding support for newborns.AIM: This paper presents the findings of research comparing the incremental costs associated with the provision of home-based vs. hospital-based support for breastfeeding by <e>nurse</e> lactation consultants for term and near-term neonates during the first week of life. BACKGROUND: A consequence of both consumer demands and increasing health resource constraints is that alternative care delivery models for safe, efficacious and cost-effective breastfeeding programmes have steadily evolved. To date, the economic impact of the setting (home or hospital) where lactation support is delivered has received little research attention. METHODS: Mother-infant dyads were stratified by gestational age as term (&gt;37 weeks gestational age; n = 101) or near term (35-37 weeks gestational age; n = 37) and randomized to standard hospital care and postpartum follow-up (standard care), or to standard hospital care plus home support from certified nurse lactation consultants (experimental). Data collection occurred at study entry, hospital discharge and at a seventh day postpartum follow-up session. Costs to the family (out-of-pocket and time costs) and to the healthcare system (during hospitalization and after hospital discharge) were measured. Total societal costs were defined as the sum of both family and healthcare system costs. RESULTS: Compared with standard hospital-based care, home support by nurse lactation consultants showed no statistically significant differences in either time costs to the family or total societal costs. Term infants who received home support had statistically significantly greater postdischarge system costs (P &lt; 0.0001), with a trend towards lower out-of-pocket expenses to their families (P = 0.12). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in overall combined family and healthcare system costs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the cost of home lactation support programmes were comparable with the costs of hospital-based standard care. Breastfeeding support at home by lactation consultants should be considered as an option as it was no more costly than support from lactation consultants in the hospital setting. The findings for near-term infants need to be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size.",M2
16390521,"Mothers' experiences of feeding situations - an interview study.AIM: The aim of the study was to describe parents' experiences concerning feeding situations and their contact with the <e>nurse</e> at the Child Health Service (CHS). BACKGROUND: Some of the most important tasks for the nurse at the CHS are to monitor growth, detect feeding difficulties and give advice concerning food intake and feeding practices. METHOD: Eighteen mothers differing in age, education, ethnicity and number of children and recruited from different CHS were interviewed. The narratives were transcribed verbatim and analysed by content analysis at manifest and latent levels. RESULT: All mothers' described that food and feeding were essential parts of their lives requiring a great deal of time and involvement. Two major categories of mothers' attitudes in feeding situations were identified - a flexible attitude and a controlling attitude. Mothers with a flexible attitude were sensitive to the child's signals and responded to them in order to obtain good communication. Mothers who expressed a need for control established rules and routines regarding the feeding situations. Mothers with a controlling attitude expressed receiving inadequate support from the nurse at the CHS. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATION: This study shows that some mothers experience inadequate support from the nurse at the CHS. Knowledge about mothers' experiences of feeding situations and their different attitudes towards the child during feeding might improve the CHS nurses' knowledge and help them understand and more adequately support mothers who experience feeding difficulties.",M2
16373667,"Early breastfeeding cessation in rural Senegal: causes, modes, and consequences.OBJECTIVES: We studied reasons for cessation of breastfeeding before the age of 15 months, replacement feeding modes, and child mortality in West Africa. METHODS: Data were gathered for 12208 children born between 1987 and 1997 in a rural area of Senegal. Interviews were conducted with caregivers of early-weaned children, and child mortality risks were assessed. RESULTS: Fewer than 1% of children had been weaned early. The main reasons for early weaning were maternal death and new pregnancy (in 41% and 27% of cases, respectively). Twenty percent of children had been relactated by a wet <e>nurse</e>, and 16% had received formula. Many early-weaned children died before the age of 2 years (26%), particularly those weaned early as a result of the mother's death (hazard ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74, 15.0). Girls had a lower hazard ratio than boys (0.16; 95% CI=0.05, 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that early cessation of breastfeeding was rare but that associated mortality was high, especially when the mother had died.",M2
16324616,"[Gastric lavage in healthy term newborns: a randomized controlled trial]INTRODUCTION: Gastric lavage is still used in Mexico and other countries without evidence to support this practice. We performed a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that elimination of amniotic fluid from the stomach of the newborn reduces nausea and vomiting and improves tolerance on the first feedings of breast or formula milk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted in a rural general hospital in the north of Mexico. Eligible healthy term newborns were randomly allocated to receive gastric lavage (n = 63) or observation (n = 61). The primary outcome measures were the presence of nausea and/or emesis in the first 24 hours of life and the breastfeeding failure rate, evaluated by a <e>nurse</e> blinded to the group assignment. RESULTS: Of the 63 patients in the gastric lavage group, 13 had at least one episode of nausea or vomiting compared with 15 out of 61 patients in the control group (relative risk: 0.84; 95 % CI: 0.43 to 1.61). Breastfeeding failure occurred in seven mother-child pairs in the gastric lavage group compared with five in the control group (P = 0.8; relative risk: 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.86 to 1.08). Other variables such as sex or cesarian section rate were unrelated to outcome. There were no complications that could be attributed to the procedure. All the newborn infants were discharged without problems. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric aspiration or lavage in the healthy full-term newborn is a common procedure that should be abandoned as it confers no advantages.",M2

15890725,"Attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding and other infant feeding options--a study from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.The HIV/AIDS-pandemic causes many problems for the most affected societies and their health care systems. One of these is the 'parent to child transmission' (PTCT) through breastmilk and its prevention (PPTCT). As economic and hygienic conditions do not always assure safe replacement feeding in developing countries, a WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-expert panel proposed methods to reduce the risk of PTCT but to use breastmilk for infant feeding. The study presented here aimed at identifying the expected acceptance of such a concept by addressing the attitudes of women in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Interviews were performed with 150 mothers and 60 pregnant women. The vast majority regarded breastfeeding as the appropriate method of infant feeding, although the idea of exclusive breastfeeding was not well accepted. Water, especially, was felt to be a necessary supplement. In case of a suggested HIV-infection of the mother, 74 per cent of the women voted for weaning after 3 months. Eighty-three per cent accepted the exclusive use of breastmilk substitutes from birth. Seventy-six per cent were ready to boil their milk for pasteurization. Only 37 per cent considered a wet-<e>nurse</e> to breastfeed their child. As mixed breastfeeding implies a highest risk of PTCT of HIV, the most favoured option-exclusive breastfeeding and early weaning-requires some effort to convince women that breastmilk is a sufficient source of nutrients, fluid and energy for their child and that this feeding should preferably be practised up to 6 months of age. For affluent women, breastmilk substitutes can also be considered as a means of PPTCT in overall resource-poor countries. For the majority of women, there is no real alternative to breastfeeding and to the use of breastmilk for which appropriate technologies of PPTCT are to be developed with respect to national, local and household specifications.",M2

15610365,"Effect of omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in plasma on symptoms of asthma at 18 months of age.The objective of this study was to assess the relation between observed levels of omega-3 fatty acids in plasma and symptoms of asthma and atopy in children at 18 months of age. A total of 616 women at risk of having a child who would develop asthma because of a family history were recruited from the antenatal clinics of six hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Families were randomized to either active omega-3 supplemented or control group. The active group received a daily tuna fish oil supplement and omega-3-rich margarines and cooking oils and the control group received a placebo supplement with polyunsaturated margarines and cooking oils. When the children were 18 months of age an assessment of symptoms was carried out by a research <e>nurse</e> blinded to treatment group allocation. Atopy was measured by skin prick tests, blood was collected to determine serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), and plasma fatty acid concentrations. A total of 376 children (61.0% of total recruited) completed an assessment at 18 months and had blood taken to determine plasma fatty acid concentrations. Omega-3 fatty acid levels were expressed in quintiles of exposure 'as treated' without reference to treatment group allocation. Wheeze ever, doctor visits for wheeze, bronchodilator use and nocturnal coughing were significantly reduced in children in the higher exposure quintiles. Serum IgE was reduced in the highest quintile but not significantly so. There was no difference in diagnosed asthma or atopy between the exposure quintiles. Although wheeze at this age may not be a good indicator of asthma in later childhood, it is encouraging that some symptoms have been reduced in children with high omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in plasma.",M2
15561657,"Mothers' decisions to change from formula to mothers' milk for very-low-birth-weight infants.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine maternal decisions about providing milk for a very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infant, when the initial maternal intent was to formula-feed. DESIGN: Using prospective, purposive sampling, semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 of 23 eligible mothers over a 9-month period. Audio-recorded data were transcribed verbatim, coded, categorized, and subjected to dimensional analysis. SETTING: The study took place in a 52-bed, tertiary urban neonatal intensive-care unit. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Mean maternal age was 26.5 years (range = 18-38), and mean infant birth weight and gestational age were 705.4 g (range = 504-1,310), and 25.8 weeks (range = 23-33), respectively. Of the 21 mothers, 76% were African American or Latina; 62% were low income. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated mothers' initial reasons for selecting formula and changing the decision to provide their milk, whether they were made to feel guilty or coerced, the processes of establishing and maintaining lactation, and breastfeeding outcomes at 1-month postbirth. RESULTS: Mothers initially chose formula because they had no breastfeeding role models and were fearful of pain and lifestyle modifications. They changed this decision after the <e>nurse</e> or physician talked with them about the health benefits for their infant. Of the 21 women, all denied feeling pressured, coerced, or guilty about the decision change, and all identified rewards to themselves and their infants. All mothers provided milk for greater than or equal to 30 days, 19 went on to feed at breast, and 2 became certified breastfeeding peer counselors for the Rush Mothers' Milk Club. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the role of nurses and physicians in providing evidence-based information about mothers' milk and indicate that sharing this knowledge does not make mothers of VLBW infants feel pressured, coerced, or guilty.",M2
15525868,"Determining the main risk factors and high-risk groups of breast cancer using a predictive model for breast cancer risk assessment in South Korea.This study was aimed at developing a predictive model for assessing the breast cancer risk of Korean women under the assumption of differences in the risk factors between Westerners and Koreans. The cohort comprised 384 breast cancer patients and 2 control groups: one comprising 166 hospitalized patients and the other comprising 104 <e>nurses</e> and teachers. Two initial models were produced by comparing cases and the 2 control groups, and the final equations were established by selecting highly significant variables of the initial models to test the accuracy of the models in terms of disease probability and predictability. Both the initial models and the final disease-probability models were confirmed to exhibit high degrees of accuracy and predictability. Major risk factors determined by comparing the patients with hospitalized controls were a family history, menstrual regularity, total menstrual duration, age at first full-term pregnancy, and duration of breastfeeding. Major risk factors determined by comparing patients with nurse/teacher controls were age, education level, menstrual regularity, drinking status, and smoking status. The predictive model developed here shows that risk factors for breast cancer differ between Korean and Western subjects in the aspect of breastfeeding behavior. However, identifying the relationship between genetic susceptibility and breast cancer will require further studies with larger samples. In a model with nurse/teacher controls, drinking and higher education were found to be protective variables, whereas smoking was a risk factor. Hence the predictive model in this group could not be generalized to the Korean population; instead, breast cancer incidence needs to be compared among nurses and teachers in a nurse-and-teacher cohort.",M2

15186472,"Workplace breastfeeding support for hospital employees.BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding initiation rates have been steadily rising in Hong Kong, but most employed women wean prior to returning to work. While health care providers promote breastfeeding, women receive little support from employers. A few health care facilities offer some workplace breastfeeding support, but little is known about the specific types and amount of support that are offered. AIMS: This paper reports a study whose aim was to describe workplace supports available to breastfeeding women employed by hospitals that provide maternity services in Hong Kong, and to determine if differences in workplace supports exist based on the hospitals' numbers of employees or funding source. METHODS: In late 2001, a cross-sectional survey was completed by <e>nurse</e> managers or lactation consultants most knowledgeable about supports to breastfeeding employees in 19 hospitals. FINDINGS: The number of workplace breastfeeding supports or Breastfeeding Support Score (M = 7.47; sd = 3.37) varied considerably. Mean Breastfeeding Support Score for government-funded hospitals was significantly higher (t = 2.31; P = 0.03) than for private hospitals. Of the 14 hospitals that had a designated space for using a breast pump, only five (26.3%) had a private room with a door that locked. Only two hospitals (11.1%) allowed employees to take breaks as needed to use a pump; employees in 10 (55.6%) had to use their meal and regular break times. Hospitals having a hospital-wide committee that addressed workplace breastfeeding issues had a more supportive environment for breastfeeding employees. Although all surveyed hospitals returned the questionnaire, the sample size was small. It was difficult to ensure accuracy and to differentiate subtle variations in the services provided using a self-report survey. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitating continued breastfeeding after employees' return to work requires that employers understand the needs of breastfeeding employees. Policy at the level of the employer and government is an essential component of creating a supportive environment.",M2

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk mother-newborn pairs in a large, multispecialty group practice in which the mother was breastfeeding at 4 weeks. Mothers completed telephone interviews at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum, and their data were linked with their obstetric and pediatric clinicians' responses to a cross-sectional mailed survey conducted during the same time period. Obstetric and pediatric clinicians included medical doctors, <e>nurse</e> practitioners, and nurse midwives. Overall response rates were 63% for mothers and 82% for clinicians (54 obstetric and 67 pediatric clinicians). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the characteristics of clinicians and mothers that predicted exclusive breastfeeding at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 288 mothers who were breastfeeding at 4 weeks and had a complete 12-week interview, 152 (53%) were exclusively breastfeeding their infants at 12 weeks. Mothers who discontinued exclusive breastfeeding were more likely to have experienced problems with their infant latching on or sucking (odds ratio [OR]: 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-9.7) or report that a health care provider recommended formula supplementation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-5.0). Clinicians reported limited time during preventive visits to address breastfeeding problems as a very important barrier to promoting breastfeeding. Obstetric providers were least confident in resolving problems with mothers not producing enough breast milk. Pediatric providers were least confident in resolving problems with breast pain or tenderness or cracked or painful nipples. In the final multivariate model, mothers whose pediatric providers recommended formula supplementation if an infant was not gaining enough weight (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.04, 9.7) or who considered their advice to mothers on breastfeeding duration to be not very important (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-3.9) were more likely to have discontinued exclusive breastfeeding by 12 weeks postpartum. Black mothers were significantly more likely to discontinue exclusive breastfeeding by 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians' practices regarding formula supplementation of healthy infants and their opinions about the importance of their breastfeeding advice are associated with the likelihood that mothers will continue exclusive breastfeeding. Policies to enhance clinicians' abilities to address breastfeeding problems within the constraints of busy practices could improve their ability to support exclusive breastfeeding.",M2
14722500,"Breastfeeding knowledge and practice of pediatric <e>nurse</e> practitioners.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this secondary analysis is to examine and report on pediatric nurse practitioners' (PNPs') attitudes, experience, and knowledge about breastfeeding and to compare the results with those from a sample of pediatricians and other nurse practitioners and nurse-midwives. METHOD: A breastfeeding study questionnaire was sent to all PNPs (N = 95) in a northwestern state. The response rate was 81%. RESULTS: Respondents were nearly unanimous in their belief that  breast is best  and that it was their role to recommend breastfeeding to expectant mothers. In general, 74% of respondents believed they were effective or very effective in meeting the needs of breastfeeding patients. Although they were very supportive of breastfeeding, they were less knowledgeable about specific management strategies. Personal experience (nearly three fourths had themselves breastfed) was named by many as the most valuable source of information. Although PNPs appeared to have a more supportive attitude and better information than pediatric physicians, they reported themselves to be less effective in providing breastfeeding assistance than did their pediatric physician colleagues. DISCUSSION: PNPs generally agreed about the importance of promoting breastfeeding and their effectiveness in doing so. However, many PNPs did not gain experience in breastfeeding support and management in their educational programs and incorrectly answered questions on basic management strategies.",M2
14702445,"Length-of-stay policies and ascertainment of postdischarge problems in newborns.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an early postpartum discharge program and a subsequent legislative mandate for 48 hours of hospital coverage on incidence of newborn jaundice and feeding problems. We tested the hypothesis that heightened postdischarge ascertainment (rather than short stays) is responsible for apparent increases in these outcomes. METHODS: Interrupted time series analysis was conducted on retrospective data from the automated medical records of a large Massachusetts health maintenance organization (HMO). A population of 20,366 mother-infant pairs with normal vaginal deliveries between October 1990 and March 1998 was identified. The interventions included a new HMO protocol in 1994 of 1 hospital overnight after delivery, plus a <e>nurse</e> home visit, then the Massachusetts' 1996 minimum coverage law. Postpartum length of stay, clinical evaluation on day 3 or 4 of life, health center visits up to day 21, health center diagnoses of jaundice or feeding problems, bilirubin testing and test severity, rehospitalizations, and emergency department visits were measured. RESULTS: Postpartum stays &lt;2 nights rose from 28% of newborns before implementation of the program to 70% immediately after implementation. Later, this rate fell from 66% before the mandate to 21% just after the law went into effect. Day 3 or 4 evaluation rose from 24.5% to 64% after the program, then dropped somewhat to 53% after the mandate. Controlling for longer-term trends in health center visits, implementation of the early discharge program was associated with approximately 1 extra visit for every 4 newborns within the first 21 days of life. The state mandate did not affect health center visit rates. Jaundice diagnoses were flat at 8% of newborns during the baseline, then rose to a constant 11% throughout the program and postmandate periods. Bilirubin testing of newborns also rose by 3.4 percentage points at the time of program implementation, and the proportion of tested newborns with results calling for at least consideration of phototherapy rose by 6 percentage points. Phototherapy use rose from a flat 1.8% to 2.4% of newborns after program implementation. Feeding problem diagnoses more than doubled at the time of program implementation and remained elevated after the mandate. Rehospitalizations overall and specifically for jaundice were constant over time, whereas more rare emergency department visits for jaundice dropped from 0.3% of newborns to 0 on program implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Sudden increases in jaundice-related measures and identification of infant feeding problems were not associated with changes in length of stay in this setting. Instead, these increases seem to be the result of more frequent evaluation of newborns during the critical day 3 to 4 period and may also have been elevated by a new climate of concern about neonatal vulnerability.  Ascertainment bias  may have confounded findings in previous reports that raised concerns about the safety of early discharge.",M2
14645327,"The effectiveness of various postpartum depression treatments and the impact of antidepressant drugs on nursing infants.BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is seen in approximately 13% of women who have recently given birth; unfortunately, it often remains untreated. Important causes for undertreatment of this disorder are providers' and patients' lack of information about the effectiveness of various treatments, and their concerns about the impact of treatment on nursing infants. This article presents research-based evidence on the benefits of various treatments for postpartum depression and their potential risks to nursing infants. METHODS: The medical literature on postpartum depression treatment was reviewed by searching MEDLINE and Current Contents using such key terms as  postpartum depression,   treatment,   therapy,   psychotherapy,  and  breastfeeding.  Results and CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that postpartum depression improves with antidepressant drug therapy, estrogen, individual psychotherapy, <e>nurse</e> home visits, and possibly group therapy. Of the more frequently studied antidepressant drugs in breastfeeding women, paroxetine, sertraline, and nortriptyline have not been found to have adverse effects on infants. Fluoxetine, however, should be avoided in breastfeeding women. By administering effective treatment to women with postpartum depression, we can positively impact the lives of mothers, their infants, and other family members.",M2

14610445,"Medications and lactation: what PNPs need to know.The current rise in breastfeeding rates coincides with a continuously expanding prescription medication market. Now more than ever, pediatric <e>nurse</e> practitioners (PNP) are responsible for ordering and consulting on maternal medications during lactation. PNPs are obligated to determine the safety of medications by critically reviewing recommendations that are based on recent clinical research. However, sources vary widely in the relevance of their information. Ideally, comprehensive research-based recommendations about medications and lactation should be based on the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the maternal system, the oral bioavailability of the medication to the infant, and the infant evaluation. Review of the data enables PNPs to effectively evaluate drugs and their actual risks to a breastfeeding infant, thereby supporting integration of sound evidence-based care into clinical practice.",M2
14577078,"Early enteral feeding after closure of colostomy in pediatric patients.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the benefits and adverse effects of protocolized early postoperative enteral feeding in pediatric patients undergoing a closure of colostomy. METHODS: Pediatric patients, completely treated for anorectal malformation, who underwent a closure of colostomy during September 2000 and May 2002 received early postoperative feeding according to the authors' protocol (EF group). Retrospective data of consecutive patients operated on from March 1998 to August 2000 who received traditional feeding practice were used as a control (TF group). The protocol began with a small volume of formula or breast feeding within the first postoperative day. Volume allowance was advanced every 4 hours up to the daily maintenance volume. Full feeding was defined as when the patient was able to tolerate at least 80% of daily maintenance volume. TF group received nothing by mouth until documentation of bowel function. The groups were compared with regard to postoperative stay, postoperative hour of full feeding, first bowel movement, and adverse effects. Statistical analyses were performed with chi2 test, Student's t test, and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 34 and 30 patients in EF and TF groups, respectively. Median age of the patients was 13 months, and median weight was 8.39 kg. Except for the associated anomalies, which were found more in the EF group, there were no differences in the demographic characteristics of the 2 groups. On average, feeding was initiated at 19.7 (16 to 24) hours in the EF group and 51.7 (18 to 92) hours in the TF group (P &lt;.01). Median full feeding hours were 45.5 and 70.5 hours in the EF and TF group, respectively (P &lt;.01). First bowel movement in the EF group was recorded at the average of 4.14 postoperative <e>nurse</e> shifts, compared with 5.96 shifts in the TF group (P &lt;.01). Postoperative stay was significantly reduced from the average of 6.1 days to 4.5 days (P &lt;.01). The overall hospital expenses were not significantly different between the 2 groups. (203.95 dollars US in TF group and 198.50 dollars US in EF group; P =.75) There was 1 vomiting case in the EF group that was temporary and resolved spontaneously. Septic complications were noted in 8 patients in the EF group and 6 patients in the TF group (P =.27). The majority were uncomplicated urinary tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: Early feeding after a closure of colostomy in pediatric patients stimulated early bowel movement and reduced hospital stay with no increased adverse effects.",M2
13677441,"Food taboos among nursing mothers of Mexico.This cross-sectional study was carried out in Guadalajara, Mexico, during 1998-1999 to identify food taboos among nursing mothers who participated in a breast-feeding support programme. The study included 493 nursing mothers who were interviewed 10-45 days after delivery. A chi-square test was used for finding an association among food taboos, mother's characteristics, and demographic variables. 50.3% of the mothers avoided at least one food in their diet after childbirth due to beliefs that it was harmful during breast-feeding. Forty-seven percent avoided three or more foods. Fruits and vegetables (62%) and legumes (20%) were the most-avoided foods. These food taboos were associated with living more than 10 years in Guadalajara city (odds ratio [OR] 1.95 [1.25-3.09], p = 0.002), breast-feeding experience (OR 1.91 [1.18-3.12], p = 0.005), no-prenatal information about breast-feeding (OR 1.59 [1.08-2.34], (p = 0.01), and other people's suggestion to complement breast-feeding (OR 1.61 [1.09-2.38], p = 0.01).

12931781,"Evaluation of an educational intervention on breastfeeding for NICU <e>nurses</e>.The effect of breastfeeding education on breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes of nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was evaluated. NICU nurses (intervention) and pediatric nurses (untreated control) working at a northeastern US children's hospital participated in the pretest/posttest design study. Both groups answered the same breastfeeding questionnaire on 2 occasions. NICU nurses completed the questionnaire the second time after attending the education session. Outcome measures evaluated by questionnaire items were (1) breastfeeding knowledge, (2) pro-breastfeeding attitudes, (3) baby-focused care attitudes, and (4) nurse-focused care attitudes. Comparison groups were similar at pretest on demographic variables and remained so despite attrition between pretesting and posttesting. A significant increase (P &lt; .001) occurred in NICU nurses' breastfeeding knowledge after the education session. Findings suggest that an educational intervention has potential for improving NICU nurses' knowledge and certain attitudes about breastfeeding but may not alter other attitudes of interest in the desired direction.",M2
12839294,"Foetal development and breastfeeding in early texts of the Islamic tradition.BACKGROUND: Knowledge of some early Islamic teachings regarding foetal development and breastfeeding may be of interest to health workers in paediatric practice. The Koran describes the creation of human beings in verses 22:5, 23:12 and 39:6. Some descriptions are reminiscent of phrases in Genesis and Ecclesiastes of the Old Testament. Symbiosis between mother and child is implicit in Koranic verse 46:15, which defines this period as lasting for 30 mo. Accumulated knowledge from earlier periods on the beneficial effects of breastfeeding is reflected in verse 2:233, as a recommendation that infants be breastfed for 2 y. In early Islam it was a father's obligation to ensure that his child received human milk, if the biological mother was indisposed to provide it. Securing human milk was of vital importance for the survival of the child. The historical solution was to employ a wet <e>nurse</e>. Paying a good salary to wet nurses and giving them a status similar to that of a biological mother was a precaution for securing that babies received sufficient milk. During the period of Islamic expansion, the medieval physician Ibn Sina of Buckara (AD 980-1037) contributed to the significance of breastfeeding by describing breast milk as  white blood . CONCLUSION: The significance of breastfeeding was recognized in early texts of the Islamic tradition. These have inspired positive attitudes to breastfeeding in Muslim communities. Adherence may differ among contemporary groups, but it may be important to keep original teachings in mind when planning breastfeeding programmes in Muslim communities.",M2

12749097,"[Representations of breastfeeding in the patient/<e>nurse</e> midwife relation]At the crossroads of medical, cultural and psychological fields, breastfeeding can often provoke intense reactions. In the course of my profession as a midwife, I have observed difficulties in the encounters between patients and midwives. In the context of social representations, I wished to explore and compare the representations of breastfeeding of both patients and midwives, which will test the hypothesis that the incongruity in patient/midwife relationships derives from a difference in their respective representations of breastfeeding. In order to demonstrate this, I conducted partially structured interviews with five hospitalized patients three days post natal, and five midwives from the Geneva maternity ward. The qualitative thematic analysis of the discussions has shown large differences in comprehension between the patients and the midwives, notably in the subject of experience, the influence of contextual factors, emotions, and normative ideas. We can concur that, from the beginning, this hypothesis has in large part been validated. Propositions were formulated, and are the road to improvement. Even after childbirth, breastfeeding, apart from nourishing a child, not only serves as a catalyst for emotions, but also for tensions, conflicts, as well as cultural paradoxes, both domestic and cognitive.",M2
12716398,"Does public health <e>nurse</e> home visitation make a difference in the health outcomes of pregnant clients and their offspring?Public health nurses (PHNs) at Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department have used the Care Pathway tool to track client progress. Conceptually similar to critical pathways used in hospital settings, the Care Pathway is used by the PHN to document milestones of progress by trimester of pregnancy. Data for this research was gathered from chart review of 55 prenatal clients. Study results demonstrate that subjects who had from five to nine home visits by a PHN during pregnancy showed a higher average hemoglobin for the mothers and a higher average birthweight for the babies than those visited four or fewer times. None of the low birthweight babies was born to mothers in the  more visits  category. Furthermore, more breastfeeding was recorded for those who had received more PHN visits. This documentation enabled us to describe better the referent population and to begin to estimate the effect of PHN home visitation on the health outcomes of clients. In essence, we addressed the questions: (1)  Does PHN home visitation make a difference in health outcomes of clients and their families?  and (2)  If so, how can effects be measured? ",M2
12709163,"Prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in neonates.Reports of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and normal newborn nurseries in Japan were investigated, and various methods of preventing transmission were evaluated. In the late 1980s, MRSA which had spread in adult wards also invaded NICU. Very low birthweight or premature infants had become the targets of MRSA infection and this has now become a serious problem. Recent reports have revealed that 87% of major NICU in Japan have suffered from MRSA infections. However, we have found that preventive measures can greatly reduce the risk of a newborn being infected by a carrier, while also controlling the disease caused by MRSA infection. Recently, MRSA infections in normal newborn nurseries have also become a serious problem in pediatric departments. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus which can colonize in the newborn baby just after birth, is passed on to the newborn by carrier medical staff. It was found to be of great importance that infant's mothers hold and <e>nurse</e> their babies immediately after birth, and start breast-feeding while still in the delivery room. Furthermore, the most appropriate and ideal newborn nursery is one where mother and child are roomed together and there is little intervention by the hospital. In neonatal care, it is of utmost importance to treat carriers of MRSA bacteria, and to inhibit the spread of the bacterium in babies by taking standard precautionary measures.",M2

12675164,"A randomized trial of two public health <e>nurse</e> follow-up programs after early obstetrical discharge: an examination of breastfeeding rates, maternal confidence and utilization and costs of health services.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the outcomes of routine home visiting by public health nurses (PHN) after early obstetrical discharge differ from those of a screening telephone call designed to identify mothers who need further intervention. METHODS: Primiparas delivering a singleton infant and eligible for postpartum follow-up were randomized to a home visit or screening telephone call. Data were collected by telephone from 733 participants located at two tertiary care centres in Ontario. Outcomes included maternal confidence at two weeks, health problems of the infants between discharge and four weeks postpartum, breastfeeding rates at six months and costs of the two models. RESULTS: Differences between the samples at the two sites necessitated stratified analyses. No differences were detected between the groups in maternal confidence (p = 0.96), health problems of infants (p = 0.87), or rates of breastfeeding at six months (p = 0.22). However, at both sites the cost of routine home visits was found to be higher than that of screening by telephone. CONCLUSION: Although universal access to postpartum support is important, the results suggest that a routine home visit is not always necessary to identify the women who need it. These results can be generalized only to low-risk women and infants.",M2

PARTICIPANTS: the Notebook lists the names and other details of 749 women. FINDINGS: the Notebook indicates how the wet nurse was recruited, the implications for her baby, how she negotiated her role and the decision-making around her recruitment. KEY CONCLUSIONS: the ambiguity of this medical pioneer's decision-making is demonstrated. Simpson's scientific credentials may have featured much rhetoric. While in the forefront of many obstetric and medical developments, Simpson was regressive in his support for wet nursing. The social input into the selection of the wet nurse has not been identified previously. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: the woman's ability to negotiate her terms of employment emerges. The social determinants of baby feeding decisions, identified in this document, have assumed greater significance since the time that this Notebook was written.",M2
12612230,"Effects on breastfeeding of changes in maternity length-of-stay policy in a large health maintenance organization.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects on breastfeeding rates of a private-sector early discharge program and a subsequent government mandate guaranteeing 48 hours of hospital coverage. METHODS: Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted on retrospective data from the automated medical records of a large health maintenance organization in eastern Massachusetts. A population of 20 366 mother-infant pairs with normal vaginal deliveries between October 1990 and March 1998 was identified. This study period spanned the 2 interventions of interest: 1) the introduction of a new health maintenance organization protocol of 1 postpartum overnight hospitalization followed by a <e>nurse</e> home visit for normal vaginal deliveries, then 2) Massachusetts state minimum coverage legislation. Breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding continuation among initiators (exclusive or with supplements) into the third month of life were determined through a text search of the first 90 days of infants' automated medical records. RESULTS: Both policies had dramatic impacts on length of stay (LOS); postpartum LOS &lt;2 nights rose from 29% of pairs to 65% when the early discharge program was implemented, then fell to 15% after the state mandate. Breastfeeding initiation, however, rose gradually from 71% in the fourth quarter of 1990 to 82% in the first quarter of 1998, with no changes after the interventions. Continuation of breastfeeding among those who initiated remained constant at 73%. Younger maternal age, primiparity, low socioeconomic status, and nonwhite race all were found to be risk factors for lower rates of breastfeeding (either initiation or continuation), but there was no evidence of a decline in breastfeeding associated with shorter LOS among these vulnerable groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early postpartum discharge with outpatient breastfeeding support and a home visitor program has no adverse effects on initiation or continuation of breastfeeding.",M2

12096568,"Breastfeeding practices of working women.Breastfeeding is the fundamental aspect of child rearing that a woman copes with. It creates a wonderful bond between mothers and their babies. The importance of breast feeding to child health is highlighted by the yearly World Breastfeeding week (Forste, Weiss &amp; Lippincott 2001:291). Breastfeeding promotions in the Northern province like anywhere else in the country appear effective and visible enough to encourage women at all levels to breastfeed. Ironically, many women give up breastfeeding when they return to work because the thoughts of expressing their milk at work and the fiddling around with pumps and storage at work seem overwhelming (McAlpine 1998:80). Based on the assumption that breastfeeding requires commitment and determination, the researcher thought it was necessary to enquire about the experiences of working women on breastfeeding. Focus group interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format. Twenty-six women participated in three focus group discussions. The study was conducted in the suburban areas of the Northern Province, Soutpansberg region. Data was transcribed from a taped session and analysed using an open code method. Four major categories were identified: Knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding, lack of support at work, lack of support at home and a need for facilities and resources that promote breastfeeding at the workplace. It was perceived that women are so stressed at the end of the day that they have little or no time to <e>nurse</e> the baby. They appear however knowledgeable about the benefits, advantages and disadvantages of breastfeeding their babies. A concern was also raised that the time that they therefore spend with their babies is limited and affect their relationship with their babies. Women felt that they need support from their employers as well as colleagues at work to be able to balance their responsibilities.",M2
12090830,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children: prenatal and early infancy risk factors among native canadians.BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly being observed among children and youth, including the Native population of Canada. Only one study has investigated prenatal and early infancy risk factors for the disease. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted; 46 patients younger than 18 years were recruited from the only clinical center for the treatment of diabetes serving the province of Manitoba, and 92 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from a pediatric ambulatory clinic serving a large Native population in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Information on exposure to prenatal and early infancy risk factors was obtained through questionnaires administered by a Native <e>nurse</e>-interviewer. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression modeling identified preexisting diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.86-72.5), gestational diabetes (OR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.38-14.1), and breastfeeding longer than 12 months (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.99) as significant independent predictors of diabetic status. Other factors, such as low (&lt;2500 g) and high (&gt;4000 g) birth weight and maternal obesity, were also associated with diabetes in our population, but the elevated risks were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes among Native Canadian children and should be promoted as a potential intervention to control the disease.",M2
12042545,"Randomized trial of postpartum care after hospital discharge.OBJECTIVE: Harmful effects of short postpartum hospital stays include dehydration and malnutrition of breastfed infants. These may be prevented by adequate breastfeeding frequency; however, rigorous research to determine the relative effectiveness of various follow-up strategies in supporting breastfeeding frequency is absent. This study addressed the question,  Is there a difference in breastfeeding frequency or infant weight gain for singleton infants discharged within 36 hours' postpartum who received either community <e>nurse</e> (home visit) or hospital nurse (clinic) follow-up?  METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a university teaching hospital (3700 births/y) and affiliated community health centers. A consecutive sample of 586 healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited from January 1997 to September 1998 before discharge; 513 (87.5%) contributed data on 1 or more outcomes. Forty-eight-hour postpartum telephone contact and day 3 nurse contact in the home (experimental) or at the hospital (control) were provided. The main outcomes measured were breastfeeding frequency and infant weight gain assessed at 2 weeks' postpartum by maternal diary and weight at home by research assistants, masked to group allocation. RESULTS: No clinically important or statistically significant group differences were found in daily breastfeeding frequency (mean difference experimental minus control = 0.1 feeds [95% confidence interval: -0.1-0.3]) or daily rate of infant weight gain (-1.1 g [-2.5-0.3]) based on intention-to-treat analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up by nurses after short postpartum hospital stays, in either the home or a hospital-based clinic, of healthy infants discharged at &lt;36 hours seems associated with satisfactory infant breastfeeding outcomes.",M2

INTERVENTION: A structured questionnaire based on 10 steps to successful breastfeeding was administered by one of the authors and a Lactad nurse between July and October 1995. RESULTS: Fifty-two (20.8%) were aware of the need for initiating breastfeeding within 30 min of birth and 92 (36.8%) were aware of breastfeeding support groups. However, there were significant differences in the level of awareness among the doctors compared to the other categories of health staff (P&lt;0.05). Also, 48 (19.2%) of the health workers believed that babies less than 6 months of age should not be given water (statistical difference (P&lt;0.05) between doctors' attitude and that of the other health workers). Thirteen (5.22%) health workers could demonstrate correct positioning and attachment. CONCLUSION: There was general lack of awareness of some major recommended practices in the hospitals that will promote and sustain breastfeeding. There is therefore the need for policy changes and BFHI training for the staff of these health facilities to respond to the concern and growing need for proper infant/young child feeding.",M2
12000411,"Breastfeeding duration, costs, and benefits of a support program for low-income breastfeeding women.BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding can ameliorate some of the complex health issues faced by low-income families. Women who breastfeed and their infants have lower health care costs compared with those who formula feed. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding is recognized as a national priority, particularly for low-income women. This community-based randomized clinical trial involving low-income mothers compared usual care with an intervention comprising hospital and home visits, and telephone support by a community health <e>nurse</e>/peer counselor team for 6 months after delivery. METHODS: Forty-one women were recruited after delivery of a full-term singleton infant and randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. RESULTS: Women receiving the community health intervention breastfed longer than the women receiving usual care. The infants in the intervention group had fewer sick visits and reported use of fewer medications than infants in the usual care group. The intervention cost ($301/mother) was partially offset by cost savings on formula and health care. CONCLUSIONS: Community health nurse and peer counselor support can increase breastfeeding duration in low-income women, and has the potential to reduce total costs including the cost of support.",M2
11844423,"[Maternal assessment of pre-natal measures to promote natural breast-feeding]OBJECTIVES: To value the satisfaction between mothers about the different professionals and the prenatal promotion on breast-feeding (BF) in our basic health zone. To value the role of a paediatric prenatal contact in the health centre. DESIGN: An descriptive and retrospective, cross-sectional study based on an anonymous closed questionnaire filled by two groups without random selection defined on the variable yes/no BF. SETTING: Paediatric room in the Health Centre of Lugones, Health Area of Oviedo. PARTICIPANTS: Every mother of childs aged between 6 and 18 months attending to the Healthy Child Program since June to November of 2000. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: 60 questionnaires were delivered, 51 to the group BF and 9 to the group no BF (85% BF including mixed and independent of the duration). 52 questionnaires were collected, 44 BF and 8 no BF. We observe a great satisfaction in both groups on the area midwife, who is considered decisive. Obstetrician, hospital and primary <e>nurse</e>, hospital paediatrician and general practitioner may improve their rule in BF promotion. Both groups are interested in the prenatal visit with the health centre paediatrician. Women on no BF group thought that this interview could have changed their decision. CONCLUSIONS: Area midwife is considered the most value professional by the mothers. Hospital and primary professionals may improve his rule in BF promotion in our basic health zone. Only 50% women in no BF group took their decision before the birth. They think that the prenatal paediatric visit could have changed their decision.",M2
11803105,"Breast feeding after reduction mammaplasty performed during adolescence.Reduction mammaplasty (RM) can be performed during adolescence if the functional capacity of the breast is preserved. Future breast feeding must be carefully considered in the therapeutic decision making process. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Breast feeding after reduction mammaplasty performed during adolescence was assessed to determine surgical factors influencing outcome and patient reception of information concerning breast feeding. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 109 women who had undergone reduction mammaplasty between 1981 and 1997 when they were 15-17 years old to ascertain their reasons for having surgery, their satisfaction, and their attitude towards breast feeding. RESULTS: Sixty-five questionnaires (60%) could be analyzed. Mean delay since surgery was 8.1 years. Seventeen women (26%) had delivered 25 infants (mean 1.5). Mean delay after surgery to first delivery was 7.68 years. Five women (29%) nursed their first infant for a mean 11.3 days. None of the women interrupted breast feeding for a reason related to a nipple anomaly or difficult sucking. Twelve women (71%) did not <e>nurse</e> their first infant, because of the prior breast surgery for six of them. Among the 48 nulliparous women, 24 (50%) stated they would nurse their future infant. Although information on breast feeding was systematically delivered, 41 women (63%) stated they had not been informed. There was no statistical relationship between breast feeding and degree of satisfaction, patient-assessed scar quality, or nipple disorders. CONCLUSION: Adolescents who undergo reduction mammaplasty can nurse their future infants with a complication rate similar to that in the general population. Special attention must be given to delivery of information on breast feeding.",M2
11692548,"Breast-feeding and smoking habits among Israeli women.BACKGROUND: Many women stop smoking before or during pregnancy, or while breast-feeding (nursing). OBJECTIVES: To assess the relation between breast-feeding and smoking habits. METHODS: A survey was conducted among 920 women attending family health clinics (group 1) and a maternity department (group 2) on their breast-feeding and smoking habits. RESULTS: A total of 156 women (16.95%) smoked during pregnancy. A significant correlation was found between breast-feeding and not smoking after delivery (P = 0.009 in group 1, P = 0.03 in group 2). A higher tendency to <e>nurse</e> was found among women with an uneventful pregnancy, who vaginally delivered a singleton at term weighing 2,500-4000 g, and who received guidance on breast-feeding. CONCLUSION: Professional guidance in favor of breast-feeding is crucial to increase the rate of nursing. Encouraging breast-feeding will probably decrease the rate of cigarette smoking.",M2
11550408,"Breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes of health professionals and students.Thirty-one physicians, 108 <e>nurses</e>, 105 medical students, and 126 student nurses practicing in the same medical center received a questionnaire to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes about breastfeeding. The mean knowledge score of the 139 staff member was 49.4 +/- 10.8 (The highest possible score was 73); that of the medical students was 31.2 +/- 8.9, and that of the nurse students was 39.5 +/- 7.6. Thirteen percent of the medical students vs. 68.6% of the student nurses reported that they had received breastfeeding education in school. All of the respondents had a positive attitude toward breastfeeding. Occupation and in-service education for breastfeeding could increase the knowledge score. Having been breastfed during infancy could increase both the knowledge score and positive attitude score. We suggest that breastfeeding be integrated into the curricula of both medical and nursing schools. Health professionals should receive in-service education. The mechanism of lactation, management of breast problems and infant problems, contraindications for breastfeeding, the properties of human milk and the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant should all be included.",M2
11533342,"A randomized comparison of home visits and hospital-based group follow-up visits after early postpartum discharge.OBJECTIVE: Short postpartum stays are common. Current guidelines provide scant guidance on how routine follow-up of newly discharged mother-infant pairs should be performed. We aimed to compare 2 short-term (within 72 hours of discharge) follow-up strategies for low-risk mother-infant pairs with postpartum length of stay (LOS) of &lt;48 hours: home visits by a <e>nurse</e> and hospital-based follow-up anchored in group visits. METHODS: We used a randomized clinical trial design with intention-to-treat analysis in an integrated managed care setting that serves a largely middle class population. Mother-infant pairs that met LOS and risk criteria were randomized to the control arm (hospital-based follow-up) or to the intervention arm (home nurse visit). Clinical utilization and costs were studied using computerized databases and chart review. Breastfeeding continuation, maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal satisfaction were assessed by means of telephone interviews at 2 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: During a 17-month period in 1998 to 1999, we enrolled and randomized 1014 mother-infant pairs (506 to the control group and 508 to the intervention group). There were no significant differences between the study groups with respect to maternal age, race, education, household income, parity, previous breastfeeding experience, early initiation of prenatal care, or postpartum LOS. There were no differences with respect to neonatal LOS or Apgar scores. In the control group, 264 mother-infant pairs had an individual visit only, 157 had a group visit only, 64 had both a group and an individual visit, 4 had a home health and a hospital-based follow-up, 13 had no follow-up within 72 hours, and 4 were lost to follow-up. With respect to outcomes within 2 weeks after discharge, there were no significant differences in newborn or maternal hospitalizations or urgent care visits, breastfeeding discontinuation, maternal depressive symptoms, or a combined clinical outcome measure indicating whether a mother-infant pair had any of the above outcomes. However, mothers in the home visit group were more likely than those in the control group to rate multiple aspects of their care as excellent or very good. These included the preventive advice delivered (76% vs 59%) and the skills and abilities of the provider (84% vs 73%). Mothers in the home visit group also gave higher ratings on overall satisfaction with the newborn's posthospital care (71% vs 59%), as well as with their own posthospital care (63% vs 55%). The estimated cost of a postpartum home visit to the mother and the newborn was $265. In contrast, the cost of the hospital-based group visit was $22 per mother-infant pair; the cost of an individual 15-minute visit with a registered nurse was $52; the cost of a 15-minute individual pediatrician visit was $92; and the cost of a 10-minute visit with an obstetrician was $92. CONCLUSIONS: For low-risk mothers and newborns in an integrated managed care organization, home visits compared with hospital-based follow-up and group visits were more costly but achieved comparable clinical outcomes and were associated with higher maternal satisfaction. Neither strategy is associated with significantly greater success at increasing continuation of breastfeeding. This study had limited power to identify group differences in rehospitalization and may not be generalizable to higher-risk populations without comparable access to integrated hospital and outpatient care.",M2
11508101,"The breastfeeding support team for low-income, predominantly-minority women: a pilot intervention study.This quasiexperimental pilot study explored whether a focused breastfeeding intervention had potential to improve outcomes in low-income breastfeeding women. Twenty breastfeeding women (10 in intervention and 10 in usual care) were matched on type of delivery, previous breastfeeding experience, and race. Women were low-income, young, 65% high school graduates, and 40% minority. For this intervention, the BST, a breastfeeding support team (community health <e>nurse</e> and peer counselor) provided hospital and home visits and telephone support. Outcomes were measured weekly for the first month, and monthly through month five. At all time periods, more women who received the intervention were breastfeeding. Further, they had less nipple discomfort in the first month; significantly less fatigue in month four and at three and five months reported less fatigue, depression, and anxiety.",M2
11338146,"Overcoming barriers to breastfeeding: suggested breastfeeding promotion programs for communities in eastern Nova Scotia.The 1994 rate of initiation of breastfeeding in eastern Nova Scotia was 41%. The purpose of this study is to assess both perceived barriers to breastfeeding as well as the need for programs to promote breastfeeding in this region. Seventy randomly selected subjects (67 F, 3 M) responded to a questionnaire about regional breastfeeding practices. Results showed that perceived barriers to breastfeeding included lack of knowledge about breastfeeding management (35.8%) and lack of support (29.9%). Barriers to exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months included going back to work (76.5%) and lack of support (39.2%). To promote exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, participants recommended access to: prenatal classes (98.5%), <e>nurse</e> follow-up following hospital discharge (95.3%), and availability of lactation consultants (88.3%). When proposed promotion programs were implemented, breastfeeding initiation increased to 60.5% and duration rates increased to 4 months (90.2%). Regional barriers to breastfeeding can be partly alleviated through educational and support programs.",M2
11261049,"Feeding outcomes and influences within the neonatal unit.This study examined the feeding intention of mothers (n = 100), and the factors and beliefs, and changes in those factors or beliefs that influenced their choices, in the challenging environment of the neonatal unit. Mothers' experience and the frequency of <e>nurse</e>-assisted feeding activities were examined in mothers intending and not intending to breast-feed on discharge. Eighty-one per cent of mothers were either partially or fully breast-feeding or intending to do so on discharge. The most important factors identified as influencing this feeding choice included personal choice, with other influences being special benefits, more natural and feeling closer to the baby. Experiences such as infants receiving their first sucking feed from either the breast or bottle (inclusive of breast milk) and mothers expressing breast milk more frequently, were found to be significantly different and increased in frequency, in mothers intending to breast-feed. Differences in the mean weighted total daily nurse-assisted feeding score confirmed that these activities varied with gestational age (&lt; or = 32 weeks [2.57], 32 to less than 35 weeks [3.86], and &gt; or = 35 weeks [4.91]; F = 7.04, d.f. 55, P = 0.002), although there was insufficient power to determine differences between breast-feeding and non-breast-feeding mothers. The use of the Feeding Activities Calendar may have contributed to increased activity and high levels of breast-feeding in this preterm group.",M2

11466098,"Pacifier use, early weaning, and cry/fuss behavior: a randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT: The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund strongly discourage use of pacifiers because of their perceived interference with breastfeeding. Observational studies have reported a strong association between pacifier use and early weaning, but such studies are unable to determine whether the association is causal. OBJECTIVES: To test whether regular pacifier use is causally related to weaning by 3 months postpartum and to examine differences in results according to randomized intervention allocation vs observational use or nonuse of pacifiers. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from January 1998 to August 1999. SETTING: Postpartum unit of a university teaching hospital in Montreal, Quebec. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 281 healthy, breastfeeding women and their healthy, term singleton infants. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 counseling interventions provided by a research <e>nurse</e> trained in location counseling. The experimental intervention (n = 140) differed from the control (n = 141) by recommending avoidance of pacifier use and suggesting alternative ways to comfort a crying or fussing infant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early weaning, defined as weaning within the first 3 months, compared between groups; 24-hour infant behavior logs detailing frequency and duration of crying, fussing, and pacifier use at 4, 6, and 9 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 258 mother-infant pairs (91.8%) completed follow-up. The experimental intervention increased total avoidance of pacifier use (38.6% vs 16.0% in the control group), reduced daily use (40.8% vs 55.7%), and decreased the mean number of pacifier insertions per day (0.8 vs 2.4 at 4 weeks [P&lt;.001]; 0.8 vs 3.0 at 6 weeks [P&lt;.001]; and 1.3 vs 3.0 at 9 weeks [P =.004]). In the analysis based on randomized intervention allocation, the experimental intervention had no discernible effect on weaning at 3 months (18.9% vs 18.3% in the experimental vs control group; relative risk [RR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.7), and no effect was observed on cry/fuss behavior (in the experimental vs control groups, respectively, total daily duration, 143 vs 151 minutes at 4 weeks [P =.49]; 128 vs 131 minutes at 6 weeks [P =.81]; and 110 vs 104 minutes at 9 weeks [P =.58]). When randomized allocation was ignored, however, we observed a strong observational association between exposure to daily pacifier use and weaning by 3 months (25.0% vs 12.9% of the exposed vs unexposed groups; RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong observational association between pacifier use and early weaning. No such association was observed, however, when our data were analyzed by randomized allocation, strongly suggesting that pacifier use is a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or reduced motivation to breastfeed, rather than a true cause of early weaning.",M2
11424831,"[Early protected discharge of the mother and the neonate: case-control study]Aim of this study is to compare traditional post-partum hospital stay to hospitalization associated with early protected discharge: a case-control study has been performed to evaluate outcome as mother's appreciation of the experience as well as breastfeeding. The study included 50 healthy-term newborns and their mothers, discharged within 24 and 48 hours of life, and 44 controls, who had traditional  rooming-in  stay, delivered at the Department of Neonatology--University of Turin. The protocol included a midwife daily home visits and a neonatologist and <e>nurse</e> visit within 4th to 5th day of life, to evaluate mother's and baby's health status and to perform metabolic screenings. An ambulatorial follow-up visit at 1 month of life and 2 telephone interviews, at 3rd and 6th month, were also planned. During the first week of life 45 (90%) early discharged newborns had complete nursing (breastfeeding + water or other fluids), 4 (8%) had complementary nursing (breastfeeding + formula) and 1 (2%) received formula. Among controls, 46 (92%) babies received complete nursing, 2 had complementary nursing and 2 had artificial nursing. At 6 months of life breastfeeding was complete for 2% of cases and 6% of controls; in 44% of cases and 56% of controls nursing was complementary. Readmissions to our Birth Center were 2 among early discharged newborns, 1 in the control group. About project's appreciation, 96% of early discharged and 98% of control group mothers declared their availability to repeat the experience. Caring and supporting were judged adequate in 94% of both group. By adequate supporting of mother and newborn, short and traditional hospitalization are both pleasant and don't seem to present significant differences in type and length of nursing.",M2
