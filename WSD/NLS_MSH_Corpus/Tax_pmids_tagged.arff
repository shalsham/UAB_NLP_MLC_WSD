19827270,"Alleviating effect of active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) for anticancer drug-induced side effects in non-tumor-bearing mice.Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is an extract of a basidiomycete mushroom that is used as a supplement by some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; it is thought to enhance the therapeutic effects and reduce the side effects of select anticarcinogenic agents. AHCC has been reported to strengthen the anticancer effects of cisplatin (CDDP) and ameliorate its side effects in female BALB/cA mice inoculated with Colon-26 tumor cells. In this study, the role of AHCC in alleviating the side effects induced by several other anticancer drugs was explored in non-tumor-bearing mice receiving monotherapy with paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), or multi-drug chemotherapy with TAX plus CDDP, 5-fluorouracil (5FU) plus irinotecan, CDDP plus 5FU, or doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. Outcomes from the drug treatment groups with and without AHCC supplementation were compared to controls that received vehicle alone. The multi-drug treatments significantly reduced bone marrow cell viability in all groups and leukocyte count in all groups except for TAX+CDDP; these myelosuppresive effects were generally alleviated by AHCC. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity caused by the treatments that included TAX and CDDP were also significantly improved by AHCC. The death rate was 20 to 30 percent in all treatment groups except TAX+CDDP, and supplementation with AHCC greatly reduced or eliminated mortality. These results support the concept that AHCC can be beneficial for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",M1
19703346,"Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2-mediated uptake of paclitaxel and 2'-ethylcarbonate-linked paclitaxel in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes.OBJECTIVES: The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump plays an important role in paclitaxel detoxification. However, hepatic uptake of paclitaxel mediated by a solute-linked carrier transporter family is still poorly understood in animals and humans. Freshly isolated hepatocyte suspensions are a well established in-vitro model for studying drug transport and xenobiotic metabolism. Therefore, the hepatic uptake of paclitaxel and its P-gp-insensitive prodrug, 2'-ethylcarbonate-linked paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>-2'-Et), has been characterized using freshly isolated and pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)-treated hepatocytes in rats. METHODS: Paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et were incubated with rat hepatocyte suspensions in the presence or absence of inhibitors. KEY FINDINGS: Paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et showed concentration-dependent uptake in rat hepatocytes. The intrinsic transport capacity was two-fold higher for paclitaxel uptake than for TAX-2'-Et uptake. Rifampicin (a potent inhibitor of organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) 2), but not indometacin (a representative inhibitor of organic anion transporter (Oat) 2 and Oatp1) treatment, significantly inhibited the uptake of paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et. We characterized the rifampicin-sensitive uptake of paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et using rat hepatocytes treated with PCN, which dramatically enhances hepatic Oatp2 protein levels. PCN-treated hepatocytes displayed a 1.6-fold greater uptake of paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et than the vehicle-treated hepatocytes. The uptake of the two compounds was significantly reduced by rifampicin but not by indometacin treatment. These findings demonstrated that the rat Oatp2, but not Oatp1 or Oat2, was a candidate transporter for the hepatic uptake of paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have provided an important step towards identifying a key transporter in hepatic detoxification of paclitaxel and TAX-2'-Et in small animals.",M1
19604626,"Enhanced cytotoxicity with a novel system combining the paclitaxel-2'-ethylcarbonate prodrug and an HSV amplicon with an attenuated replication-competent virus, HF10 as a helper virus.We previously demonstrated that HF10, which is a natural, non-engineered HSV-1, has potent oncolytic activity in the treatment of solid malignant tumors in vitro and in vivo [H. Takakuwa, F. Goshima, N. Nozawa, T. Yoshikawa, H. Kimata, A.

Virol. 148 (2003) 813-825; S. Kohno, C. Lou, F. Goshima, Y. Nishiyama, T. Sata, Y.

Kamakura, et al., Non-engineered, naturally oncolytic herpes simplex virus HSV1 HF10: applications for cancer gene therapy, Curr. Gene. Ther. 8 (2008) 208-221]. Previous reports have also shown that a combination of HF10 and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) was more efficacious than either regimen alone for some types of malignant tumors [S. Shimoyama, F. Goshima, O. Teshigahara, H. Kasuya, Y. Kodera, A. Nakao, et al., Enhanced efficacy of herpes simplex virus mutant HF10 combined with paclitaxel in peritoneal cancer dissemination models, Hepatogastroenterology 54 (2007) 1038-1042]. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) using a novel system that combines the paclitaxel-2'-ethylcarbonate prodrug (TAX-2'-Et) and an HSV amplicon expressing rabbit-carboxylesterase (CES) with HF10 as a helper virus. This GDEPT system aims to produce high level of CES at the tumor site, resulting in efficient local conversion of the TAX-2'-Et prodrug into the active drug TAX [A. Nawa, T. Tanino, C. Lou, M. Iwaki, H. Kajiyama, K. Shibata, et al., Gene directed enzyme prodrug therapy for ovarian cancer: could GDEPT become a promising treatment against ovarian cancer?, Anti-Cancer Agents Med Chem 8 (2008) 232-239]. We demonstrated that the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, as a trace maker, was more efficiently introduced by the HSV amplicon compared to the expression vector, pHGCX, and that the HSV amplicon system expressed an active CES enzyme that could convert TAX-2'-Et to TAX in Cos7 cells. Furthermore, although the cytotoxicity of this amplicon system was not enhanced in virus-sensitive tumor cells, it was significantly enhanced in low virus-sensitive tumor cells in the presence of the prodrug in a concentration-dependent manner, compared to the control virus alone (p&lt;0.05). These results indicate that the addition of a prodrug converting enzyme may be a feasible approach to further enhance the efficacy of HF10 as a cancer therapeutics in low HF10-sensitive malignancies.",M1
19501040,"Taxol biosynthesis: Identification and characterization of two acetyl CoA:taxoid-O-acetyl transferases that divert pathway flux away from Taxol production.Two cDNAs encoding taxoid-O-acetyl transferases (<e>TAX</e> 9 and TAX 14) were obtained from a previously isolated family of Taxus acyl/aroyl transferase cDNA clones. The recombinant enzymes catalyze the acetylation of taxadien-5alpha,13alpha-diacetoxy-9alpha,10beta-diol to generate taxadien-5alpha,10beta,13alpha-tri-acetoxy-9alpha-ol and taxadien-5alpha,9alpha,13alpha-triacetoxy-10beta-ol, respectively, both of which then serve as substrates for a final acetylation step to yield taxusin, a prominent side-route metabolite of Taxus. Neither enzyme acetylate the 5alpha- or the 13alpha-hydroxyls of taxoid polyols, indicating that prior acylations is required for efficient peracetylation to taxusin. Both enzymes were kinetically characterized, and the regioselectivity of acetylation was shown to vary with pH. Sequence comparison with other taxoid acyl transferases confirmed that primary structure of this enzyme type reveals little about function in taxoid metabolism. Unlike previously identified acetyl transferases involved in Taxol production, these two enzymes appear to act exclusively on partially acetylated taxoid polyols to divert the Taxol pathway to side-route metabolites.",M1
19249859,"Flexible filaments for in vivo imaging and delivery: persistent circulation of filomicelles opens the dosage window for sustained tumor shrinkage.Shape effects of synthetic carriers are largely unexplored in vivo, although recent findings suggest that flexible filaments can persist in the circulation even if microns in length. Here, to better assess biodistribution, a near-infrared fluorophore (NIRF) was incorporated into such block copolymer  filomicelles , and both in vivo and ex vivo imaging show that the majority of these wormlike micelles remain in the circulation for at least a day after intravenous injection. NIRF imaging further suggests that filomicelles convect into a tumor and some fragments can penetrate into the tumor stroma. To assess a functional effect, the hydrophobic drug paclitaxel (<e>tax</e>) was loaded into both filomicelles and sonication-generated spherical micelles of the same copolymer. Intravenous injection of tax-loaded filomicelles nearly doubles the maximum tolerated dose of tax in normal mice compared to tax-loaded spherical micelles. In tumor-bearing mice, the higher dose of tax produces greater and more sustained tumor shrinkage and tumor cell apoptosis. These results thus begin to address mechanisms for how nonspherical carriers deliver both imaging agents and anticancer therapeutics to solid tumors.",M1
19243757,"Mitochondrial behaviors in the vitrified mouse oocyte and its parthenogenetic embryo: effect of Taxol pretreatment and relationship to competence.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Taxol pretreatment on mitochondrial behaviors in vitrified mouse mature oocytes and their parthenogenetic embryos. DESIGN: Experimental animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory and state key laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Sexually mature female Kunming white strain mice. INTERVENTION(S): Taxol before vitrification group (<e>Tax</e>). Oocytes were pretreated with M(2) containing 1 mmol/L Taxol for 2 minutes at 37C and then vitrified-warmed using the OPS vitrification procedure. Both ED solution and EDFS30 solution contained 1 mmol/L Taxol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mitochondrial behaviors examined by fluorescence microscopy technology and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technology. RESULT(S): In the control group, mitochondria were homogeneously distributed, in slow movement in oocytes, and perinuclearly distributed in 42.6% (n = 115) of their parthenogenetic two-cell embryos. Mitochondria from the toxicity group showed similar localization and movement to those of the control group, but not in the vitrification group. The perinuclear mitochondrial localization pattern of two-cell embryos was statistically significantly lower in both the toxicity (27.2%) and vitrification groups (19.8%) than in the control group. After parthenogenetic activation, the blastocyst formation rate of oocytes in the treated groups (28.1 to 48.6%) was statistically significantly lower than that of control (61.2%), but the rate of Taxol group (47.9%) was statistically significantly higher than that in the vitrification group (28.1%). CONCLUSION(S): Taxol pretreatment before vitrification helps to reduce the mitochondrial disturbance induced by vitrification in oocytes and their parthenogenetic early-stage embryo.",M1
19157226,"[Influence of SNCG transfection on the effectiveness of anti-tumor drugs in PC-3 cell lines]OBJECTIVE: To observe the sensitivity of the PC-3 cell lines transfected with the PCI-NEO-SNCG plasmid to Cisplatin (DDP), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Adriamycin (ADM), Vincristine (VCR) and Paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), and to explore the influence of the SNCG expression on the effectiveness of anti-tumor drugs. METHODS: The plasmids PCI-NEO and PCI-NEO-SNCG were transfected into the hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC-3. RT-PCR was adopted to examine the expression of SNCG in the PC-3 cell lines. The MTT method was employed to detect the suppressive effects of different anti-tumor drugs (DDP, ADM, 5-FU, VCR and TAX) on the cell lines transfected with PCI-NEO and PCI-NEO-SNCG. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycles and apoptosis of the transfected cells treated with TAX. RESULTS: The 5 anti-tumor drugs suppressed the growth of the cell lines transfected with the plasmids PCI-NEO and PCI-NEO-SNCG in a time-dependant manner. The comparison between the growth-suppressing effects of different anti-tumor drugs on the PC-3 cell lines showed no significant differences between the group transfected with PCI-NEO and that with PCI-NEO-SNCG in DDP, 5-FU, ADM and VCR (P &gt; 0.05), while the rate of suppression of TAX on the latter cell lines was significantly lower than that on the former (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the PCI-NEO-SNCG plasmid transfected cell lines, after treated with TAX for 48 hours, those transfected with the PCI-NEO plasmid exhibited a significantly larger proportion of cells remaining in the G2-M stage (P &lt; 0.01), a smaller proportion in the G0-G1 and S stages (P &lt; 0.01) and a significantly higher expression of Caspase-3 (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The significant reduction of the growth-suppressing effect of TAX in the SNCG-transfected PC-3 cell lines suggests that the expression of SNCG may restrain the effect of TAX. These findings have provided evidence and guide to the individual chemotherapy of prostate cancer.",M1
19151428,"Vernonia amygdalina: anticancer activity, authentication, and adulteration detection.Evidence suggests that most chemotherapeutic agents are less effective as treatment in patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast carcinomas compared to those with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast carcinomas. Moreover, African American Women (AAW) is disproportionately diagnosed with ER- breast cancer compared to their white counterparts. Novel therapies effective against ER- breast carcinomas are urgently needed to ameliorate the health disparity. Previous reports show that low concentrations (microgram/ml) of water-soluble leaf extracts of a Nigerian edible plant, V. amygdalina (VA), potently retards the proliferative activities of ER+ human breast cancerous cells (MCF-7) in vitro in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, the anti-proliferative activities of VA in either ductal or ER- carcinoma cells have not been characterized. The exposure of BT-549 to increasing concentrations of VA (10, 100, and 1000 microg/mL) inhibited cell growth by approximately 14 % (P&lt;0.05), 22 % (p&lt;0.05), and 50 % (p&lt;0.005) respectively. The cell count studies were corroborated by DNA synthesis studies. Treatments of BT-549 with 10, 100, and 1000 microg/mL VA inhibited DNA synthesis in a concentration dependent fashion by 22 %, 76 % (P&lt;0.05), and 86 % (p&lt;0.01) respectively. BT-549 cells were insensitive to 10 and 100 nM paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) treatments. Isolation of DNA from dried VA leaves yielded approximately 12.2 and 1 kbp genomic DNA that were Eco RI-insensitive but Hind III and Bam HI-sensitive. These pieces of information may be used to enhance the safety of medicinal botanical VA through authentication, and adulteration detection.",M1
18845169,"Quinoline derivative KB3-1 potentiates paclitaxel induced cytotoxicity and cycle arrest via multidrug resistance reversal in MES-SA/DX5 cancer cells.AIMS: The resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major problem for successful cancer treatment. Multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is characterized by over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the cancer cell plasma membrane that extrudes drugs out of the cells. Therefore, novel MDR reversal agents are desirable for combination therapy to reduce MDR and enhance anti-tumor activity. Thus, the present study was aimed to evaluate the potent efficacy of novel quinoline derivative KB3-1 as a potent MDR-reversing agent for combined therapy with <e>TAX</e>. MAIN METHODS: MDR reversing effect and TAX combined therapy were examined by Rhodamine accumulation and efflux assay and Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, TUNEL assay, and cell cycle analysis. KEY FINDINGS: The discovery of quinoline-3-carboxylic acid [4-(2-[benzyl-3[-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-propionyl]-amino]-ethyl)-phenyl]-amide (KB3-1) as a novel MDR-reversal agent. KB3-1 significantly enhanced the accumulation and retention of a P-gp substrate, rhodamine-123 in the P-gp-expressing MES-SA/DX5 uterine sarcoma cells but not in the P-gp-negative MES-SA cells at non-toxic concentrations of 1 microM and 3 microM. Similarly, fluorescence microscopy observation revealed that KB3-1 reduced the effluxed rhodamine-123 expression on the membrane of MES-SA/DX5 cells. Consistent with decreased P-gp pumping activity, confocal microscopic observation revealed that KB3-1 effectively diminished the expression of P-gp in paclitaxel (TAX)-treated MES-SA/DX-5 cells. Furthermore, Western blotting confirmed that KB3-1 reduced P-gp expression and enhanced cytochrome C release and Bax expression in TAX treated MES-SA/DX-5 cells. In addition, KB3-1 enhanced TAX-induced apoptotic bodies in MES-SA/DX5 cells by TdT-mediated-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining assay aswell as potentiated TAX- induced cytotoxicity, G2/M phase arrest and sub-G1 apoptosis in MES-SA/DX5 cells but not in MES-SA cells. Interestingly, KB3-1 at 3 microM had comparable MDR-reversal activity to 10 microM verapamil, a well-known MDR- reversal agent. SIGNIFICANCE: KB3-1 can be a MDR-reversal drug candidate for combination chemotherapy with TAX.",M1
18570892,"The paclitaxel site in tubulin probed by site-directed mutagenesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae beta-tubulin.Previously, we created a paclitaxel-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by mutating five amino acid residues in beta-tubulin in a strain that has a decreased level of the ABC multidrug transporters. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the relative importance of the five residues in determining sensitivity of this strain to paclitaxel. We found that the change at position 19 from K (brain beta-tubulin) to A (yeast beta-tubulin) and at position 227 from H (brain beta-tubulin) to N (yeast beta-tubulin) had no effect on the activity of paclitaxel. On the other hand, the changes V23T, D26G and F270Y, drastically reduced sensitivity of AD1-8-<e>tax</e> to paclitaxel. Molecular modeling and computational studies were used to explain the results.",M1
18496885,"Enzymatic stability of 2'-ethylcarbonate-linked paclitaxel in serum and conversion to paclitaxel by rabbit liver carboxylesterase for use in prodrug/enzyme therapy.In prodrug/enzyme therapy for cancer, information on the sensitivity of hydrolytic enzymes to prodrug is required to reduce adverse effects of the parental drug and to find the activating enzyme. The aim of this study was to characterize the enzymatic stability of 2'-ethylcarbonate-linked paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>-2'-Et) in the sera of several different species including humans. TAX-2'-Et disposition in serum was kinetically analysed using models with hydrolytic and/or degradation processes. To further evaluate the capability of liver carboxylesterases (CESs) in TAX-2'-Et hydrolysis, a CES isolated from rabbit liver (Ra-CES) was utilized as a model enzyme. Rat serum provided rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of TAX-2'-Et with a half-life of 4 min. The degradation of paclitaxel (TAX) (degradation rate constant, 0.16 h(-1)) was accompanied by the formation of an unknown compound. The conversion to TAX was almost completely inhibited by phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP). In human and rabbit sera, the degradation rate constant of TAX-2'-Et was 5.1 x 10(-2) and 0.15 h(-1), respectively, when excepting hydrolysis. The degradation products had the same molecular weight as TAX-2'-Et. The amount of TAX produced accounted for only 8-11% of the decrease in TAX-2'-Et after a 9 h exposure to rabbit or human serum. PMSF, but not BNPP, inhibited more than 90% of the TAX production in a 1.5 h incubation with human or rabbit serum. Ra-CES enzyme converted TAX-2'-Et to TAX with V(max) and K(m) of 74.7+/-13.8 nmol/min/mg protein and 8.8+/-2.8 microM, respectively. These results indicate that TAX-2'-Et is sensitive to serum CESs, but not cholinesterases. However, serum CESs show species-dependent hydrolysis of TAX-2'-Et. Although human serum allows the slow release of TAX, TAX-2'-Et is expected to reduce the side-effects of TAX. The Ra-CES enzyme is capable of hydrolysing TAX-2'-Et, which may be beneficial for the development of a TAX-2'-Et/enzyme therapy strategy for ovarian cancer.",M1
18478476,"[Anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on human gastric cancer cells in vitro and the relationship with Bcl-2 expression]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on human gastric cancer cells, and investigate the relationship with Bcl-2 expression. METHODS: Single cell suspension was prepared from fresh gastric cancer tissue and exposed to taxol (<e>Tax</e>), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CDDP), adriamycin (ADM), mitomycin (MMC) respectively for 48 hours. Metabolic activity and inhibitory rate of cells were detected by MTT assay. Expression of Bcl-2 was examined with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The inhibitory rates of cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs were different and Tax, 5-FU, CDDP had remarkably higher rates than ADM and MMC. The lower differentiated gastric cancer cells were more sensitive than the higher ones. Positive expression rate of Bcl-2 was 80% and the positive cells showed resistance to 5-FU, ADM and MMC. CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitive testing by MTT assay can constitute the prediction for the application of chemotherapeutic drugs individually. Overexpression of Bcl-2 may contribute to multiple drug-resistance of tumors.",M1
18396642,"[Anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on human gastric cancer cells in vitro and the relationship with expression of hTERT mRNA]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, and investgate the relationship with expression of hTERT mRNA in human gastric cancer tissues. METHODS: Fresh samples of gastric cancer obtained from operation room were prepared to single-cell suspension (3 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and were separately exposed to taxol (<e>TAX</e>), cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), adriamycin (ADM), mitomycin (MMC) for 48 hours. Metabolic activity and inhibitory rate of the cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assay. Expression of hTERT mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: The inhibition rate of cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs was different, and that of TAX, CDDP, 5-Fu was significantly higher than that of ADM and MMC. The positive rate of hTERT mRNA expression was 90.0% (54/60) and positive cells showed resistance to 5-Fu and ADM. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of hTERT mRNA may contribute to primary drug-resistance of tumors. Chemosensitivity tests by MTT assay may contribute to prediction of effectness in applying chemotherapeutic drugs and identify drug-resistant cases.",M1
18339422,"Ornithine decarboxylase attenuates leukemic chemotherapy drugs-induced cell apoptosis and arrest in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells.Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, plays an important role in cell cycle, tumor promotion and anti-apoptosis. In our previous studies, overexpression of ODC prevented apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and methotrexate. We further investigated the apoptotic mechanisms of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, including etoposide (VP-16), paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) and cisplatin (CDDP), and the influences of ODC on apoptosis and cell cycle. Our results showed that the investigated drugs induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi m) in HL-60 cells, all of which were reversed by putrescine, glutathione or N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Overexpression of ODC prevented the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis, ROS generation and the disruption of Deltapsi m. After drug administrations, the decline of Bcl-2, cytochrome c release and caspases' activation were inhibited by ODC overexpression. In cell cycle, ODC overexpressed cells seemed to overcome the G1 arrest and G2/M arrest, caused by VP-16 and TAX, respectively, and kept on the cell cycle rolling. Overexpression of ODC increased the expression of Cyclin A, D, E and Cdk4 and the enzyme activity of Cdk1 and Cdk2 after the treatment of VP-16 and TAX, respectively. In conclusions, the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis is through ROS-related, mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent pathways. With higher ODC activity, cells are resistant to the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis and keep on the cell cycle rolling with the significant interference in G1/S arrest caused by VP-16 and G2/M arrest by TAX.",M1
17889266,"Paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with operable esophageal cancer.PURPOSE: To compare a neoadjuvant regimen of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) with paclitaxel-based regimens and RT in the management of operable esophageal (EC)/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and RT for EC/GEJ cancer at Duke University between January 1995 and December 2004 were included. Clinical end points were compared for patients receiving paclitaxel-based regimens (<e>TAX</e>) vs. alternative regimens (non-TAX). Local control (LC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Chi-square analysis was performed to test the effect of TAX on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients received CT-RT followed by esophagectomy (95 M; 14 F). Median RT dose was 45 Gy (range, 36-66 Gy). The TAX and non-TAX groups comprised 47% and 53% of patients, respectively. Most (83%) TAX patients received three drug regimens including platinum and a fluoropyrimidine. In the non-TAX group, 89% of the patients received cisplatin and 5-FU. The remainder received 5-FU or capecitabine alone. Grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in 41% of patients receiving TAX vs. 24% of those receiving non-TAX (p = 0.19). Overall pCR rate was 39% (39% with TAX vs. 40% with non-TAX, p = 0.9). Overall LC, DFS, and OS at 3 years were 80%, 34%, and 37%, respectively. At 3 years, there were no differences in LC (75% vs. 85%, p = 0.33) or OS (37% vs. 37%, p = 0.32) between TAX and non-TAX groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this large experience, paclitaxel-containing regimens did not improve pCR rates or clinical end points compared to non-paclitaxel-containing regimens.",M1
17564817,"Micelles of different morphologies--advantages of worm-like filomicelles of PEO-PCL in paclitaxel delivery.PURPOSE: Worm-like and spherical micelles are both prepared here from the same amphiphilic diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO [5 kDa]-PCL [6.5 kDa]) in order to compare loading and delivery of hydrophobic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worm-like micelles of this degradable copolymer are nanometers in cross-section and spontaneously assemble to stable lengths of microns, resembling filoviruses in some respects and thus suggesting the moniker 'filomicelles'. The highly flexible worm-like micelles can also be sonicated to generate kinetically stable spherical micelles composed of the same copolymer. RESULTS: The fission process exploits the finding that the PCL cores are fluid, rather than glassy or crystalline, and core-loading of the hydrophobic anticancer drug delivery, paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) shows that the worm-like micelles load and solubilize twice as much drug as spherical micelles. In cytotoxicity tests that compare to the clinically prevalent solubilizer, Cremophor EL, both micellar carriers are far less toxic, and both types of TAX-loaded micelles also show fivefold greater anticancer activity on A549 human lung cancer cells. CONCLUSION: PEO-PCL based worm-like filomicelles appear to be promising pharmaceutical nanocarriers with improved solubilization efficiency and comparable stability to spherical micelles, as well as better safety and efficacy in vitro compared to the prevalent Cremophor EL TAX formulation.",M1
17537309,"[Relationship between the expression of P-glycoprotein, glutathione S-transferase-pi and thymidylate synthase proteins and adenosine triphosphate tumor chemosensitivity assay in cervical cancer]OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of the adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) in human cervical cancer chemosensitivity testing and to analyze the relationship between the three drug resistance-associated proteins: P-glycoprotein (P-gp); glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi); thymidylate synthase (TS) and ATP-TCA. METHODS: ATP-TCA was used to detect the sensitivity of 35 specimens of fresh cervical cancer to six cytotoxic drugs as follows: paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), cisplatin (DDP), bleomycin (BLM), gemcitabine (GEM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan (CPT-11). Consecutive sections from 35 cases of cervical cancer were assessed immunohistochemically for expression of P-gp, GST-pi and TS proteins. RESULTS: (1) Thirty-two of 35 assays were completed successfully, with an evaluability rate of ATP-TCA at 91% (32/35). There was a marked heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in cervical cancer. The ex vivo sensitive rate of TAX was 88% (28/32), of 5-FU 72% (23/32), of GEM 62% (20/32), of DDP 19% (6/32), of BLM 16% (5/32), and of CPT-11 12% (4/32). (2) The expression of GST-pi and TS protein in cervical cancer was 66% (21/32) and 44% (14/32), which was associated with the resistance to DDP and 5-FU ex vivo (P=0.011, P=0.022), respectively; but the expression of P-gp protein was not associated with any resistance to TAX, 5-FU, GEM, DDP, BLM or CPT-11 ex vivo (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATP-TCA could be used to individualize chemotherapy by selecting agents for particular patients of cervical cancer. The expression of GST-pi and TS protein might be useful biomarkers to predict the resistance to DDP and 5-FU in patients with cervical cancer.",M1
17245652,"Paclitaxel-2'-Ethylcarbonate prodrug can circumvent P-glycoprotein-mediated cellular efflux to increase drug cytotoxicity.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate whether 2'-ethylcarbonate-linked paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>-2'-Et) circumvents P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated cellular efflux and cytotoxicity enhanced by TAX-2'-Et activation within human culture cells transfected with a rabbit liver carboxylesterase (Ra-CES) cDNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TAX-2'-Et transport was characterized in a human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) and paclitaxel (TAX)-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells (SKOV3/TAX60). Expression of P-gp, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 and Ra-CES was detected by Western blotting. Cytotoxicity against Ra-CES-expressing cells and cellular amount of TAX produced were determined by MTT assay and using HPLC, respectively. RESULTS: Unlike rhodamine123 and TAX, TAX-2'-Et did not exhibit polarized transport in the Caco-2 cells in the absence or presence of verapamil. P-gp levels were expressed much higher in the SKOV3/ TAX60 cells than in the Caco-2 cells. MRP2 protein was not detectable in the SKOV3/TAX60 cells. Uptake by the SKOV3/TAX60 cells was similar in quantity to the amount internalized by P-gp-negative SKOV3 cells. In the SKOV3/TAX60 cells, cellular uptake of TAX-2'-Et was not altered regardless of the absence or presence of verapamil. The cytotoxicity to the untransfected SKOV3 cells induced by TAX-2'-Et was significantly lower than that induced by TAX. In the Ra-CES-expressing SKOV3 line, the EC50 value of TAX (10.6 nM) was approximately four-fold higher than that of TAX-2'-Et (2.5 nM). Transfection of Ra-CES into another TAX-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells (KOC-7c) conferred a high level of TAX-2'-Et cytotoxicity via prodrug activation. The intracellular levels of TAX produced from TAX-2'-Et in the Ra-CES-positive KOC-7c cells significantly increased compared with the levels seen in exposure of the untransfected KOC-7c cells to TAX. CONCLUSIONS: TAX-2'-Et can circumvent P-gp-associated cellular efflux of TAX. TAX-2'-Et is converted into TAX by the Ra-CES, supporting its potential use as a theoretical GDEPT strategy for cancer cells expressing high levels of P-gp. The TAX-2'-Et prodrug efficiently increased the amount of intracellular TAX, which mediates tumor cell death.",M1
17028052,"A proper schedule of weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine combination is highly active and very well tolerated in NSCLC patients.BACKGROUND: In a previous phase I dose-escalation study, we showed a weekly administration of paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) and gemcitabine (GEM) to be active and very well tolerated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, with the lack of interaction between drugs. The dose of GEM 1500 mg/m(2) and TAX 100 mg/m(2) was selected for phase II studies due to its predictable kinetic behaviour and less severe thrombocytopenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four chemo-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC (53 patients: stage IV) received TAX (100mg/m(2) i.v. infusion over 1h) followed by GEM 1500 mg/m(2) over 30 min) on days 1, 8, 15 and 21 of a 28-day cycle. RESULTS: The objective response rate was 46% (95% CI 32-61), median OS of 10.4 ms (95% CI 6.5-4.3), and a 1-year survival rate of 53%. Grades 3 and 4 haematological toxicity consisted of non-febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 13 and 4% of the cycles, respectively. Grade 3 non-haematological toxicities were observed in three patients (asthenia, diarrhoea and neuropathy), and were always reversible. CONCLUSIONS: This weekly schedule of TAX and GEM is highly active in chemo-naïve NSCLC patients and confirms the low toxicity profile already observed in a previous phase I study.",M1
16965680,"[A randomized comparative trial of three combined regimens containing cisplatin for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Vinorelbine (NVB), paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), and gemcitabine (GEM) are first-line chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) currently. There are many domestically retrospective studies to compare efficacies and adverse reactions among these three regimens, all of which has composed of cisplatin (DDP). This randomized study was to investigate the efficacies and toxicities of these three regimens in NSCLC treatment, in order to choose a feasible regimen for NSCLC patients. METHODS: A total of 276 NSCLC patients were randomly assigned to a regimen of NP (NVB plus DDP ), or TP (TAX plus DDP), or GP (GEM plus DDP). Efficacies and toxicities were analyzed and compared after two cycles. RESULTS: The response rates were 42.3% (41/97) in NP arm, 43.0% (40/93) in TP arm, and 43.4% (36/83) in GP arm, and complete remission rates were 1.0% (1/97), 2.2% (1/93) and (0/83) respectively, without significant difference. The median survival time, disease-free survival time and 1-year survival rate were 8.5 months, 4.1 months and 31.9%; 8.8 months, 3.8 months and 33.3%, and 9.2 months, 3.9 months, 31.3%, respectively in NP, TP and GP arms without significant difference. The major adverse reactions were stage 3 to 4 myelo-suppression, nausea/vomiting, fatigue and phlebitis. There were highest incidences of leucopenia (42.2%), neutropenia (36.2%) and lowest incidence of thrombocytopenia (53.0%) in GP arm compared to NP arm (77.8%, 67.7%, 12.1%) or TP arm (71.0%, 57.0%, 13.0%) statistically (P&lt;0.01 for all). The rates of nausea/vomiting in GP arm (16.8%) and TP arm (25.8%) were significantly lower than in NP arm (41.4%)(P&lt;0.05); and the rate of fatigue in GP arm (38.5%) or phlebitis in NP arm was most frequent among the three arms (P=0.000, 0.008 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in short-term efficacy of chemotherapy regimen NP, TP and GP. TP and GP regimens, both of which possesses its own advantage, are more tolerable than NP regimen which has the most side effects.",M1
16595340,"Tubulin polymerization modulates interleukin-2 receptor signal transduction in human T cells.Few data exist on the modulation of cytokine receptor signaling by the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton. Therefore, we studied interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling in phytohemagglutinine (PHA)-pretreated human T cells in the context of alterations in the cytoskeletal system induced by cytochalasin D (CyD), jasplaklinolide (Jas), taxol (<e>Tax</e>), or colchicine (Col). We found that changes in cytoskeletal tubulin polymerization altered the strength of several IL-2-triggered signals. Moreover, Tax-induced tubulin hyperpolymerization augmented the surface expression of the IL-2R ss -chain and enhanced the association of the IL-2R beta -chain with cytoskeletal tubulin. The IL-2R beta-chain, in turn, was constitutively associated with tubulin and, more weakly, actin. To exclude the possibility that these associations are artifacts caused by PHA, we confirmed them in T cells from TCR-transgenic DO 11.10 mice stimulated with their nominal antigen. We conclude that altered polymerization of cytoskeletal components, especially tubulin, is accompanied by modulation of IL-2 signaling at the receptor level.",M1
16361156,"[Therapeutic effect of <e>TAX</e> combined with Herceptin or epirubicin against breast cancer positive for Her-2/neu]OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of biochemotherapy regimen with Herceptin plus taxol (TAX) and the chemotherapy regimen with epirubicin plus TAX against Her-2/neu-positive breast cancer and observe the changes in serum tumor markers in patients receiving biochemotherapy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with advanced breast cancer positive for Her-2/neu as revealed by immunohistochemistry were divided into the study group (n=32) to receive treatment with the regimen of Herceptin plus TAX and control group (n=41) with the regimen of epirubicin(EPI) plus TAX. The therapeutic effects of the regimens were observed and in the study group, the relationship of the therapeutic effect with Her-2/neu positivity and changes in serum tumor markers were examined. RESULTS: The objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate were obviously higher in the study group than in the control group. In the study group, the clinical response rate of patients with positive immunostaining for Her-2/neu of grades 1+, 2+ and 3+ were 0%, 44.4% and 63.6%, respectively, as compared with those in the control group of 8.3%, 36.4%, and 38.9%, respectively, and the treatment resulted in lowered levels of serum tumor markers without significant changes in CA153, tps and CEA (P&lt;0.05) after treatment, but CA125 showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced breast cancer with positive immunostaining for Her-2/neu of grade 3+, the regimen of Herceptin plus TAX can be more effective than the chemotherapeutic regimen of EPI plus TAX. Patients with Her-2/neu (+++) benefit more from the treatment than those with Her-2/neu (++). Serum CEA, CA153 and TPS levels also possess some value in evaluating the therapeutic effects of the regimens.",M1
16322897,"cDNA microarray analysis of isogenic paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistant breast tumor cell lines reveals distinct drug-specific genetic signatures of resistance.cDNA microarray analysis is a highly useful tool for the classification of tumors and for prediction of patient prognosis to specific cancers based on this classification. However, to date, there is little evidence that microarray approaches can be used to reliably predict patient response to specific chemotherapy drugs or regimens. This is likely due to an inability to differentiate between genes affecting patient prognosis and genes that play a role in response to specific drugs. Thus, it would be highly useful to identify genes whose expression correlates with tumor cell sensitivity to specific chemotherapy agents in a drug-specific manner. Using cDNA microarray analysis of wildtype MCF-7 breast tumor cells and isogenic paclitaxel-resistant (MCF-7(<e>TAX</e>)) or doxorubicin-resistant (MCF-7(DOX)) derivative cell lines, we have uncovered drug-specific changes in gene expression that accompany the establishment of paclitaxel or doxorubicin resistance. These changes in gene expression were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting experiments, with a confirmation rate of approximately 91-95%. The genes identified may prove highly useful for prediction of response to paclitaxel or doxorubicin in patients with breast cancer. To our knowledge this is the first report of drug-specific genetic signatures of resistance to paclitaxel or doxorubicin, based on a comparison of gene expression between isogenic wildtype and drug-resistant tumor cell lines. Moreover, this study provides significant insight into the wide variety of mechanisms through which resistance to these agents may be acquired in breast cancer.",M1
15990222,"Induction of p53 and drug resistance following treatment with cisplatin or paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cell lines.Treatment failures result from resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. The effect of cisplatin and paclitaxel treatments on chemosensitivity was studied in ovarian cancer cells developed from a patient with stage IIIC disease. Cells (UL-3A, UL-3B) that recovered from cisplatin (Cis) and paclitaxel (<e>Tax</e>) treatments showed higher levels of p53, mdr-1 and chemoresistance than untreated controls. EC50 values of Cis and Tax for UL-3A clones were 7.2-34.6, average 20.9 microg/ml, while UL-3B clones ranged from 11.8-252.0 microg/ml, with a mean value of 73.2 microg/ml for Cis, and 260.0-4400.0 nM (mean 2555.0 nM) for Tax.

15885271,"The current role of chemotherapy in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.Since the publication of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 99-16 and <e>TAX</e> 327 studies, which demonstrated a survival benefit for docetaxel-based therapy, clinicians for the first time have a therapy to offer men with metastatic prostate cancer that is not merely palliative in its effects. Phase 2 and phase 3 trials are now building on the findings of SWOG 99-16 and TAX 327 by evaluating the potential of combination taxane-based therapies, such as docetaxel plus high-dose calcitriol, docetaxel-estramustine-bevacizumab, and docetaxel-thalidomide. The optimal timing of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is still unknown, as there are no prospective clinical trial data to indicate whether earlier treatment (eg, at the time of prostate-specific antigen failure) is more or less effective than later treatment (eg, in metastatic and/or symptomatic disease).",M1
15663094,"[What to expect from the neoadjuvant therapy of the oesophageal carcinoma?]AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the neoadjuvant therapy of the oesophageal carcinoma firstly from the perspective of the immediate effect on the resection procedure itself and, secondly, from the perspective of the long-term results. METHODOLOGY: Prior to the resection of the oesophagus, the patients were administered the neoadjuvant therapy. The patients were allocated to three groups with the following branches of the cytostatic treatment: CDDP+FU, <e>TAX</e>+FU a CDDP. A smaller group with a less advanced disorder was treated only surgically, with the oesophageal resection. Furthermore, the study aimed at assessing chemoresistance of the tumors according to the MTT test and at correcting the individual branches appropriately. RESULTS: The total of 70 patients were operated from 2001 to V/2004. Out of this number, 15 oesophgeal resections without the neoadjuvant therapy were conducted. None of the patients exited, and fistules were the commonest complications. CONCLUSION: No differences in postoperative complications were reported between the groups with or without the neodjuvant therapy. Therefore, this therapy has no positive effect on the resection results themselves. The MTT test proved to be of low significance in the neodjuvant therapy assessment. Chemoresistance can be assessed only retrospectively and, furthermore, the results are likely to be affected by a relatively high sensitivity to the neodjuvant therapy itself. The pCR rate reaches 20%. Long-term results had not been assessed due to a short follow-up period.",M1
15648245,"A folate receptor-targeted lipid nanoparticle formulation for a lipophilic paclitaxel prodrug.PURPOSE: The anticancer drug paclitaxel has poor aqueous solubility and is difficult to formulate in a lipid-based formulation due to its limited lipid solubility. Paclitaxel-7-carbonyl-cholesterol (<e>Tax</e>-Chol), a prodrug of paclitaxel with increased lipophilicity, was therefore synthesized and evaluated for incorporation into a lipid nanoparticle (LN) formulation, which also contained folate-polyethylene glycolcholesterol (f-PEG-Chol) as a ligand that targets the tumor marker folate receptor (FR). This novel formulation was designed for prolonged systemic circulation and selective targeting of tumor cells with amplified FR expression. METHODS: Tax-Chol was synthesized. FR-targeted LNs, composed of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/triolein/Chol oleate/PEG-Chol/f-PEG-Chol (40:40:18:2.0:0.5, mole/mole), were then prepared by solvent dilution followed by diafiltration. FR-targeted LNs containing Tax-Chol were then evaluated for cytotoxicity in KB, a human oral carcinoma cell line, and M109, a murine lung carcinoma cell line, both of which are FR(+) and in FR(-) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Furthermore, tumor growth inhibition and animal survival in response to treatment with FR-targeted LNs and control formulations were evaluated in BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneously engrafted M109 tumors. RESULTS: The LNs had a mean diameter of 130 nm and Tax-Chol incoporation efficiency of greater than 90% and exhibited excellent colloidal stability. FR-targeted LNs showed greater uptake and cytotoxicity in FR(+) KB and M109 cells than nontargeted LNs. Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing M109 tumors with FR-targeted LNs resulted in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition and animal survival compared to treatment with nontargeted LNs or paclitaxel formulated in Cremophor EL. CONCLUSION: FR-targeted LNs containing Tax-Chol are a promising novel formulation for the treatment of FR(+) tumors and further preclinical studies are warranted.",M1
15627215,"Secondary leukemia after first-line high-dose chemotherapy for patients with advanced germ cell cancer.PURPOSE: We investigated the incidence of secondary leukemia in patients treated with first-line high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) plus autologous stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for advanced testicular cancer. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-three patients who were entered into two consecutive prospective Phase-II studies of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group were analyzed. A total of 221 patients had received HD-VIP containing cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide and 102 patients were treated with <e>Tax</e>-HD-VIP containing cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, and paclitaxel, each cycle supported by autologous PBSCT. RESULTS: Patients had received a median cumulative etoposide dose of 4.9 g/m(2) (range, 2.2-9.4 g/m(2)). The median follow-up duration for all patients was 36 months (range, 0-128) with a median follow up time of 50 months (range, 0-128) for patients surviving at least 1 year after therapy. One patient developed a secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) involving a chromosomal translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) 24 months after the start of chemotherapy resulting in a cumulative incidence of 0.48% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-1.42]. Additionally, two patients with primary mediastinal germ cell cancer developed a myelodysplastic syndrome. No solid tumors had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: HDCT including high-dose etoposide with autologous PBSCT as first-line therapy for advanced testicular cancer was associated with an acceptably low risk of developing secondary leukemia.",M1
15161987,"Taxane-platinum combinations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a review.Platinum-based chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a result of their single-agent activities and synergistic effects, taxane-platinum combinations are often used as first-line therapy for this disease. Four large, multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trials (the <e>TAX</e> 326 trial, the Southwest Oncology Group 9509 trial, the Italian Lung Cancer Project, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1594 trial) have compared taxane-platinum combinations (docetaxel and paclitaxel) with other platinum combinations (vinorelbine and gemcitabine) in chemotherapy-naïve patients with good performance status scores and advanced disease. The end points for these large randomized clinical trials were survival, response rate, adverse events, and quality of life (QOL). Of the taxane-platinum combinations tested, docetaxel-cisplatin was the only platinum combination to yield survival and response rates superior to another platinum combination. In adverse event terms, the taxane-platinum combination of paclitaxel-carboplatin demonstrated less grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and lower rates of febrile neutropenia than other taxane-platinum combinations but higher rates of irreversible grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy than any of the other taxane-platinum combinations. Additional differences emerged when QOL data were evaluated. The docetaxel-platinum combination demonstrated broad QOL benefits for patients receiving this combination, and this benefit was not observed with the other platinum or taxane-platinum combinations. As our use of these taxane-platinum combinations expands, these differences in survival, response rate, adverse events, and QOL will permit us to better balance our treatment goals for all patients with all stages of NSCLC.",M1
15046776,"Inhibition of CFU-E/BFU-E and CFU-GM colony growth by cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and taxol: development of a high-throughput in vitro method.The major side effect of anticancer drugs is damage to the hematopoietic system. These compounds may interfere with cell proliferation and differentiation in different blood lineages causing many diseases such as neutropenia, aplastic anaemia or trombocytopenia. The clonogenic assays are useful in vitro tools for evaluating and predicting acute xenobiotics myelotoxicity. A miniaturisation of these assays, in order to reduce costs and increase the number of compounds that could be tested, is under investigation. The in vitro sensitivity of human burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) to three anticancer drugs: cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and taxol (<e>TAX</e>) was evaluated both in 35 mm plate and 96-well plate systems and the dose-response curves, IC50 values and IC90 values were compared. The correlation between in vitro data and clinical plasma levels confirms that severe hematotoxicity is the primary adverse effect of these drugs with an evident selectivity on erythroid progenitors for cyclophosphamide. IC50 and IC90 values, calculated on the basis of results obtained with the traditional assay, correlate with those obtained in microplate, as well as the dose-response curves, indicating that the 96 well plate assay could be a useful and reliable tool for high-throughput screening in early stages of drug development.",M1

Short-term (30 min) incubation had no effect on contraction or relaxation. Overnight incubation with 25 microM Van 10/4-attenuated contraction while perillyl alcohol abolished contractility completely. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly attenuated by the higher concentration of paclitaxel, FPT III and Van 10/4. Stretch injury significantly enhanced sensitivity to 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) while attenuating relaxation to calcimycin. Drug incubation (15 min) had no effect on these responses. In conclusion, paclitaxel, FPT III and Van 10/4 have no detrimental effects on vascular function after short-term administration to normal or stretch-injured arteries.",M1
14598941,"Potentiation of antiproliferative drug activity by lonidamine in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.The ability of lonidamine (LND), a derivative of indazole-carboxylic acid, to modulate the cytotoxic activity of anticancer drugs was investigated in two human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cell lines. The cytotoxicity of drugs used singly, in association or in sequence was evaluated using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. LND did not appreciably potentiate the effect of antitumor drugs when given before or simultaneously, in either cell line. Conversely, a synergistic interaction was observed in both cell lines when LND was given after conventional drugs. LND produced a moderate decrease in S-phase cell fraction and did not induce apoptosis. Conversely, paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) induced an important block in G2 and an increase in apoptosis. Following a 48-h TAX wash out, a progressive passage of cells from G2 to M phase was observed with a corresponding increase in apoptotic cells. Post-treatment with LND increased the cytotoxicity of some antitumor drugs, especially TAX, in hepatocarcinoma cells, possibly by preventing, as an energolytic drug, cell damage repair or by producing an additional effect on microtubule stabilization.",M1
12837811,"Randomized, multinational, phase III study of docetaxel plus platinum combinations versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: the <e>TAX</e> 326 study group.PURPOSE: To investigate whether docetaxel plus platinum regimens improve survival and affect quality of life (QoL) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with vinorelbine plus cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 1,218) with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (DC); docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the curve of 6 mg/mL * min every 3 weeks (DCb); or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/wk and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 4 weeks (VC). RESULTS: Patients treated with DC had a median survival of 11.3 v 10.1 months for VC-treated patients (P =.044; hazard ratio, 1.183 [97.2% confidence interval, 0.989 to 1.416]). The 2-year survival rate was 21% for DC-treated patients and 14% for VC-treated patients. Overall response rate was 31.6% for DC-treated patients v 24.5% for VC-treated patients (P =.029). Median survival (9.4 v 9.9 months [for VC]; P =.657; hazard ratio, 1.048 [97.2 confidence interval, 0.877 to 1.253]) and response (23.9%) with DCb were similar to those results for VC. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, and febrile neutropenia were similar with all three regimens. Grade 3 to 4 anemia, nausea, and vomiting were more common (P &lt;.01) with VC than with DC or DCb. Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had consistently improved QoL compared with VC-treated patients, who experienced deterioration in QoL. CONCLUSION: DC resulted in a more favorable overall response and survival rate than VC. Both DC and DCb were better tolerated and provided patients with consistently improved QoL compared with VC. These findings demonstrate that a docetaxel plus platinum combination is an effective treatment option with a favorable therapeutic index for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",M1
12810457,"Docetaxel-based chemotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer.Docetaxel-based chemotherapy appears to have considerable promise in advanced gastric cancer. In phase II studies of single agent docetaxel, response rates (RRs) of 17% to 24% have been achieved in previously untreated patients. Importantly, RRs of 20% to 22% are seen in second-line treatment. Work by a Swiss and Italian collaborative group has shown that the combination of docetaxel 85 mg/m(2) with cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks is quite active, achieving an RR of 55% and median survival of 9 months. Hematotoxicity was the main adverse event but was manageable. In other respects the docetaxel/cisplatin doublet (TC) was relatively well tolerated. The same group demonstrated that continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 300 mg/m(2) can be given on 2 weeks out of 3 to patients receiving TC. The addition of 5-FU, by this schedule, to TC (TCF) does not increase hematological toxicity, and does not compromise the tolerability of TC. An overall RR of 55% has been reported with TCF. A randomized phase II comparison of TC or TCF versus an ECF (epirubicin/cisplatin/5-FU) control arm is ongoing and should lead to a randomized phase III trial comparing TC or TCF with ECF. In an already completed international randomized phase II comparison of TC versus TCF (<e>TAX</e>-325), the three-drug combination proved significantly more active (RR 54% versus 32% with TC, among patients treated per protocol). Time to progression was also longer for TCF. Gastrointestinal (but not hematological) toxicity was less with TC. TCF was chosen for ongoing phase III comparison against a control 5-FU/cisplatin arm. It is possible that data from these randomized studies will confirm the value of docetaxel-based chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer and that docetaxel combinations will also be effective in the multidisciplinary efforts to cure earlier stage cancer.",M1
12798695,"First-line chemotherapy with epidoxorubicin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin for the treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients.OBJECTIVE: A combination of carboplatin (CBDCA) and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) is the standard treatment in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) patients. Epidoxorubicin (EDX) is an active treatment in AOC and exhibits nonoverlapping toxicities with CBDCA and TAX; moreover, when added to platinum-based chemotherapy, it improves long-term survival. We have therefore conducted a phase II study to evaluate the tolerability and antitumor activity of an EDX/TAX/CBDCA (ETC) triplet in AOC patients. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed suboptimal stage III-IV ovarian cancer who had not previously received cytotoxic drugs were treated with TAX (175 mg/m(2) in a 3-h iv infusion), CBDCA (AUC 6, Calvert formula), and EDX (75 mg/m(2) iv bolus) all given on day 1 every 28 days for a maximum of six courses on an outpatient basis. EDX dosage was chosen after a pilot phase I study. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were registered, of whom 5 were determined ineligible bacause of age. Forty-two of the 50 are evaluable for response; 27 (64%) achieved a clinical complete response (CR) and 9 (21%) a partial response (PR) for a response rate of 86% (95% CI 71-94%). Thirty-three patients underwent a secondary debulking procedure after a median of 6 courses (range 2-6). Pathological CR and PR were observed in 9 (27.3%) and 21 (63.6%), respectively; among patients with persistent disease a successful cytoreduction (&lt;1 cm) was obtained in 53.8% of patients. At a median follow up of 35.6 months (range 0-55.5) median progression-free survival is 19.5 months and median overall survival is 36 months. The most common adverse effects were G3-4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia which occurred in 59 and 37% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ETC combination given according to the outlined doses and schedule is highly active in AOC patients with poor prognostic factors and deserves further study.",M1
12770901,"Mobility of taxol in microtubule bundles.Mobility of taxol inside microtubules was investigated using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching on flow-aligned bundles. Bundles were made of microtubules with either GMPCPP or GTP at the exchangeable site on the tubulin dimer. Recovery times were sensitive to bundle thickness and packing, indicating that taxol molecules are able to move laterally through the bundle. The density of open binding sites along a microtubule was varied by controlling the concentration of taxol in solution for GMPCPP samples. With &gt;63% sites occupied, recovery times were independent of taxol concentration and, therefore, inversely proportional to the microscopic dissociation rate, k(off). It was found that 10k(off)(GMPCPP) approximately equal k(off)(GTP), consistent with, but not fully accounting for, the difference in equilibrium constants for taxol on GMPCPP and GTP microtubules. With &lt;63% sites occupied, recovery times decreased as approximately [<e>Tax</e>](-1/5) for both types of microtubules.

To develop a marker of drug effect, we assessed bcl-2 downregulation in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: Enrolled in the study were 14 patients with prostate cancer or other advanced malignancies, and 13 were treated with 1 mg/kg CRA on days 1 and 2, 6 MU/m(2) IFN subcutaneously on days 1 and 2, and TAX at increasing doses on day 2 each week for 6 weeks out of an 8-week cycle. The effect of CRA/IFN on bcl-2 expression was assessed in PBMCs by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The combination of CRA/IFN and TAX was well tolerated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first cycle of therapy included one patient with fever and neutropenia, and one patient with grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia. The recommended phase II dose of TAX in this combination was 80 mg/m(2). Of 13 patients assessable by tumor markers or scans, 5 had stable disease and 2 had a biochemical partial response including a patient with a decrease in PSA of &gt;50% while on study. The assessment of patient PBMC bcl-2 was feasible in ten patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which the safety and clinical activity of weekly TAX combined with CRA/IFN has been demonstrated. The assessment of PBMC bcl-2 is feasible in this weekly chemotherapy schedule",M1
12698198,"BRCA1 expression modulates chemosensitivity of BRCA1-defective HCC1937 human breast cancer cells.Germline mutations of the tumour suppressor gene BRCA1 are involved in the predisposition and development of breast cancer and account for 20-45% of all hereditary cases. There is an increasing evidence that these tumours are characterised by a specific phenotype and pattern of gene expression. We have hypothesised that differences in chemosensitivity might parallel molecular heterogeneity of hereditary and sporadic breast tumours. To this end, we have investigated the chemosensitivity of the BRCA1-defective HCC1937 breast cancer cell line, and the BRCA1-competent MCF-7 (hormone-sensitive) and MDA-MB231 (hormone-insensitive) breast cancer cell lines using the MTT assay. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for the individual compounds were derived by interpolate plot analysis of the logarithmic scalar concentration curve after a 48 h exposure. HCC1937 cells were significantly (P&lt;0.005) more sensitive to cisplatin (CDDP) (IC(50) : 30-40 microM) compared with MCF-7 (IC(50) : 60-70 microM) and MDA-MB231 (IC(50) : 90-100 microM) cells. On the other hand, BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells were significantly less sensitive to doxorubicin (Dox) (IC(50) : 45-50 microM) compared with MCF-7 (IC(50) : 1-5 microM) and MDA-MB231 (IC(50) : 5-10 microM) (P&lt;0.02), as well as to paclitaxel (<e>Tax</e>) (IC(50) : &gt;2 microM for HCC1937, 0.1-0.2 microM for MCF-7 and 0.01-0.02 microM for MDA-MB231) (P&lt;0.001). Full-length BRCA1 cDNA transfection of BRCA1-defective HCC1937 cells led to the reconstituted expression of BRCA1 protein in HCC1937/(WT)BRCA1-derived cell clone, but did not reduce tumour cell growth in soft agar. BRCA1 reconstitution reverted the hypersensitivity to CDDP (P&lt;0.02), and restored the sensitivity to Dox (P&lt;0.05) and Tax (P&lt;0.001), compared with parental HCC1937 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest a specific chemosensitivity profile of BRCA1-defective cells in vitro, which is dependent on BRCA1 protein expression, and suggest prospective preclinical and clinical investigation for the development of tailored therapeutical approaches in this setting.",M1
12648586,"Epirubicin and paclitaxel (EPI-<e>TAX</e> regimen) for advanced ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing regimens.BACKGROUND: The place of anthracyclines in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer remains a matter of debate. We have assessed the feasibility and evaluated the tolerance of epirubicin (EPI) combined with paclitaxel (TAX) in heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: Between March 1996 and March 1998, 34 patients with ovarian cancer in relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy received EPI (75 mg/m(2)/day, iv) and TAX (175 mg/m(2)/day, 3-h infusion). Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. This treatment was second-line for 10 patients and third/fourth-line for 24. RESULTS: Of the 34 assessable patients, 15 (44%) (95% confidence interval 27-60%) achieved objective response (3 complete and 12 partial responses). The number of previous lines of chemotherapy or previous anthracycline treatments did not influence response rates. Responders to previous paclitaxel-based regimens had a significantly higher response rate to EPI-TAX combination (57%) than nonresponders (11%) (P = 0.05). Median response duration was 40 weeks (range 12-94). Median survival from inclusion was 10.7 months (range 1-40). Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 31 patients (91%), febrile neutropenia episodes in 17%, and grade 3/4 anemia and thrombopenia in 27 and 24%, respectively. The main nonhematological toxicities included alopecia and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (12%). Cardiac dysfunction was observed in one patient after the fourth treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity of the EPI-TAX regimen was acceptable in this population of heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients. The regimen was effective and it is considered an option for patients previously responding to paclitaxel-based therapy.",M1
12521996,"Potentiation of dexamethasone-, paclitaxel-, and Ad-p53-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in drug-resistant multiple myeloma cells.Overexpression of Bcl-2 in myeloma cells results in resistance to drugs such as dexamethasone (DEX), adenovirus-mediated delivery of p53 (Ad-p53), and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), which work through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2-ASO) have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, as a single agent or, better, in combination with chemotherapy. We hypothesized that down-regulation of Bcl-2 by Bcl-2-ASO will sensitize drug-resistant myeloma cells to undergo apoptosis. In this paper we report a detailed time/dose study of the effect of Bcl-2-ASO on myeloma cells with varying levels of Bcl-2. Treatment of myeloma cells expressing relatively low levels of Bcl-2 with Bcl-2-ASO resulted in a substantial apoptosis concomitant with a substantial depletion of Bcl-2 protein. Maximal apoptosis was observed at 5 to 10 microg/mL Bcl-2-ASO, following 4 days of treatment. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 and apoptosis were time and dose dependent and were sequence specific. In these cell lines, apoptosis was accompanied by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and by release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. In contrast, high Bcl-2-expressing myeloma cells were practically resistant to Bcl-2-ASO. Most important, however, pretreatment of myeloma cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 with Bcl-2-ASO increased the extent of DEX-, TAX-, and Ad-p53-induced apoptosis from 10%-20% to 70%-90%. Increased apoptosis was accompanied by additional decrease in Bcl-2 protein. Similar results for down-regulation of Bcl-2 and apoptosis were obtained with freshly isolated myeloma cells. These data support development of clinical trials with combinations of Bcl-2-ASO and DEX, TAX, or Ad-p53 in the treatment of refractory myeloma patients.",M1
12515634,"[Evaluation of two different regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of two different regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with stage II, III breast cancer as proved by cytology biopsy, were treated with either 5-Fu, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) or epirubicin, paclitaxel (ET) regimens for 2 cycles every 3 - 4 weeks. Clinical responses in the breast and lymph nodes were assessed after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in FEC arm received combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) 500 mg/m(2) by 4-hour continuous infusion on D1 and D8, epirubicin (EPI) 50 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1, and cyclophosphamide (CTX) 500 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1 and D8. Patients assigned to the ET arm received EPI 60 mg/m(2) by intravenous injection on D1, paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) 150 mg/m(2) by 3-hour continuous infusion on D2. All patients were treated by operation 2 weeks later and radiotherapy was added to some. RESULTS: For primary tumor in the breast, the overall response rate (RR) was 50.0% (12/24) in FEC arm and 79.2% (19/24) in ET arm. One patient showed clinical complete response (cCR), 11 partial response (PR), 12 no change (NC) after the FEC therapy, while 1 patient showed CR, 18 PR, 5 NC after ET therapy. There was no pathologic complete response or progressive disease, though a higher proportion of RR was observed in stage II than stage III patients in these two groups. Clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes which had been found in all 48 patients before 2 cycles of treatment, 50.0% (12/24) in the FEC patients and 66.7% (16/24) in the ET patients became in-palpable. The major toxicity, including leukopenia, gastroenteric reactions, were similar in both groups, but alopecia was more severe and arthralgia, myalgia, neurotoxicity and flushing of face were the unique features of the ET regimen. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two different regimens were effective to the primary tumor and axillary metastatic lymph nodes of breast cancer, and the side effects were tolerable. Higher efficacy and more side effects are observed in ET than in FEC regimen.",M1
12480190,"First-line chemotherapy for NSCLC: an overview of relevant trials.In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), monotherapy with gemcitabine improves quality of life when compared to best supportive care alone, while single-agent taxanes and vinorelbine also improve survival. Platinum-based combinations achieve benefits in response rate, time to progression and survival compared to single-agent cisplatin. With the introduction of combinations of newer agents, 2-year survival rates of 10-20% are being seen in co-operative group trials. Until recently, the various doublets that have been subjected to randomized comparison appear to have achieved similar rates of response and survival, though toxicities differ considerably depending on the choice of drugs used. However, study <e>TAX</e> 326, the largest trial yet conducted in advanced NSCLC, has now demonstrated that the combination of docetaxel with cisplatin is superior to that of vinorelbine and cisplatin. Controlled trials of platinum-containing vs. non-platinum combinations have yet to demonstrate any superiority of one over the other. Hopes for further improvement in survival are focused on the combination of cytotoxic agents with novel molecularly-targeted drugs such as the anti-angiogenics and EGFR inhibitors.",M1
12480189,"Second line chemotherapy for NSCLC: establishing a gold standard.When compared with best supportive care alone, the second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel significantly improved the 1-year survival rate (37 vs. 12%) and lengthened time to disease progression (median 12.3 vs. 7.0 weeks) in study <e>TAX</e> 317. Quality of life was superior with docetaxel and the need for tumor-related therapy was reduced. Docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) in this setting is safe, and offers clinically meaningful benefit to patients. These findings are supported by data from study TAX 320 in which a heavily pre-treated population of advanced NSCLC patients was randomized to receive docetaxel 100 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or a comparator arm of either vinorelbine or ifosfamide. Treatment with either dose of docetaxel significantly increased the proportion of patients without disease progression at 26 weeks. By intent to treat analysis, 1-year survival was 32% in patients randomized to docetaxel 75 mg/m(2). This was significantly greater than the 19% 1-year survival rate in the comparator arm. Prior exposure to paclitaxel did not lessen the response rate or survival advantage of docetaxel in this second-line setting. Future development is likely to lie in the combination of docetaxel with novel molecular-targeted agents such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",M1
12477451,"Development of an in vitro chemo-radiation response assay for cervical carcinoma.PURPOSE: To determine if synergistic effects of radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (chemo) on human cervical carcinoma cell lines and fresh tumor explants could be determined using an in vitro assay. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro radiation response was determined for 4 cell lines and 26 fresh tumor explants in an agar-based assay. Cells were exposed to increasing doses of RT with or without cisplatin (CDDP), carmustine (BCNU), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), or paclitaxel (<e>Tax</e>). Cell suspensions were cultured for 5 days, with [(3)H]thymidine added on day 3 and proliferation was measured. Results were reported as the fraction of proliferation compared to control (FC). For each combination of irradiation and drug, synergy was tested using the Chou analysis, where a combination index (CI) &lt;1 indicated synergistic interaction. In simple correlation analysis, an R value of &gt;0.7 indicated cross-resistance. RESULTS: RT dose-dependent proliferation inhibition was observed for 2 of the 4 cell lines, and for all but 1 of the fresh specimens. Significant heterogeneity of tumor response to RT was seen. Four specimens that were 1 standard deviation below the median FC response after exposure to 300 cGy were classified as extremely radiation resistant. Twenty-one tumors were evaluated for synergistic response using the combination of chemo and RT with a median FC of 0.27 (+/-0.27) for 6.0 Gy of RT alone, 0.22 (+/-0.21) for CDDP alone, and 0.05 (+/-0.08) for the combination. A CI of 0.35 and an R value of 0.09 demonstrated synergy between chemo and RT without cross-resistance. Similar synergy without cross-resistance was found for RT in combination with BCNU, BSO, and TAX. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous RT dose-response relationships in the in vitro assay were demonstrated. Explants were more sensitive to RT than cell lines. Unlike cell lines, fresh tumor cells consistently displayed synergy with RT and chemo. The synergy between RT and BSO suggests that glutathione depletion may enhance the effect of RT. The assay was feasible for examining fresh tumors and may be an important tool for studying RT or drug resistance. Clinical trials to evaluate this assay are indicated.",M1
12108897,"Docetaxel for previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer.Two phase III trials were conducted using docetaxel (Taxotere), administered every 3 weeks, as second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In the <e>TAX</e> 317 trial, 204 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (49 received 100 mg/m2 and 55 received 75 mg/m2) or best supportive care (100 patients). Median survival was 7.5 months with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75) vs 4.6 months for best supportive care (P = .010); and 1-year survival was 37% for D75 vs 11% for best supportive care (P = .010). Quality-of-life analysis also showed statistically significant improvement in disease-related symptoms with docetaxel vs best supportive care. In the TAX 320 study, 373 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (D100), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75), or a control arm of either vinorelbine (Navelbine) or ifosfamide (Ifex) (V/I). Partial response rates were 11.9% with D100 and 7.5% with D75 vs 1% with V/I (P values: .001 [D100] and .036 [D75]). Median response duration was over 7 months. One-year survival was 32% with D75 vs 19% in V/I (P = .025). Prior paclitaxel exposure had no bearing on the response rate and survival advantage of second-line treatment with docetaxel. Response rates to docetaxel were equivalent in the cohort of patients who had received prior paclitaxel (10.5%) and the group ofpatients who had not received prior paclitaxel (8.5%). The 1-year survival rates for patients with no prior paclitaxel therapy were 33% (D75) vs 20% (V/I); and the 1-year survival rates for patients who had received prior paclitaxel were 30% (D75) vs 17% (V/I). In conclusion, two large randomized phase III trials of second-line chemotherapy for NSCLC have shown significant differences favoring docetaxelfor response rate, time to progression, survival, and quality of life. Prior paclitaxel did not decrease the likelihood of response to docetaxel, nor did it lessen the survival advantage seen with docetaxeL Docetaxel offers a clinically meaningful benefit in this setting, with manageable toxicity. Based upon the observed response rates, survival, impact on quality of life, and toxicity profile, the optimal dose of docetaxel in this pretreated population is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.",M1
11870178,"Economic analysis of the <e>TAX</e> 317 trial: docetaxel versus best supportive care as second-line therapy of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of second-line docetaxel compared with best supportive care (BSC) in the TAX 317 trial, a randomized clinical trial of second-line chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective CE analysis of the TAX 317 trial was undertaken, evaluating direct medical costs of therapy from the viewpoint of Canada's public health care system. Costs were derived in 1999 Canadian dollars, and resource use was determined through prospective trial data. RESULTS: The incremental survival benefit in the docetaxel arm over BSC was 2 months (P =.047). The CE of docetaxel was $57,749 per year of life gained. For patients treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), the CE was $31,776 per year of life gained. In univariate sensitivity analyses, CE estimates were most sensitive to changes in survival, ranging from $18,374 to $117,434 with 20% variation in survival at the recommended dose. The largest cost center in both arms was hospitalization, followed by the cost of drugs, investigations, radiotherapy, and community care. BSC patients had fewer hospitalizations than patients in the chemotherapy arm and were more often palliated at home. CONCLUSION: Although the decision to treat should not be based on economic considerations alone, our CE estimate of $31,776 per year of life gained (at the currently recommended dose of docetaxel) is within an acceptable range of health care expenditures, and the total costs of therapy are similar to those of second-line palliative chemotherapy for other solid tumors.",M1
11738551,"Oestrogen-mediated suppression of tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells: subversion of Bcl-2 by anti-oestrogens.In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinoma cells, 17beta-oestradiol suppresses a dose-dependent induction of cell death by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF). The ability of oestrogens to promote cell survival in ER-positive breast carcinoma cells is linked to a coordinate increase in Bcl-2 expression, an effect that is blocked with the pure anti-oestrogen ICI 182,780. The role of Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cell survival was confirmed by stable overexpression of Bcl-2 which resulted in suppression of apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) and TNF as compared to vector-control cells. The pure anti-oestrogen ICI 182,780 in combination with TNF, DOX or TAX potentiated apoptosis in vector-transfected cells. Interestingly, pre-treatment with ICI 182,780 markedly enhanced chemotherapeutic drug- or TNF-induced apoptosis in Bcl-2 expressing cells, an effect that was correlated with ICI 182,780 induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Our results suggest that the effects of oestrogens/anti-oestrogens on the regulation of apoptosis may involve coordinate activation of signalling events and Bcl-2 expression.",M1
11723747,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of combined chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel for patients with ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to assess the utility of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of carboplatin (CBDCA) and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) employed for chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of chemotherapy with CBDCA and TAX were analyzed in 13 patients with ovarian cancers. The pharmacodynamic model, based on myelosuppression, was assessed in terms of concentrations of free platinum (free-Pt) and TAX in blood samples. TAX (175 mg/m2) was administered intravenously (i.v.) over 3 h, and CBDCA (target area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5 mg/ml x min) over 1 h. Free-Pt and TAX concentrations in blood samples were measured at several time points after administration. RESULTS: The nadirs of both the leukocyte and neutrophil counts correlated significantly with the TAX AUC (AUCtax) and serum albumin level, and the percentage decrease in platelet count (pd-Plt) correlated significantly with AUCtax, free-Pt AUC (AUCpt), and the serum albumin level. A pharmacodynamic model corresponding to the nadirs of leukocytes and neutrophils and to pd-Plt was thus generated. CONCLUSION: This pharmacodynamic model may allow the ready prediction, from AUCtax, AUCpt, and the serum albumin value, of the degree of myelosuppression with combined CBDCA and TAX chemotherapy.",M1
11710633,"Antitumor efficacy of 26-fluoroepothilone B against human prostate cancer xenografts.BACKGROUND: Epothilone compounds (e.g. epothilones A and B) represent a new structural class of microtubule inhibitors with the remarkable ability to inhibit tumor growth of multidrug-resistant cell lines at low nanomolar or even subnanomolar concentrations. Unfortunately, this therapeutic efficacy has only been achieved to date with a narrow therapeutic window. Hence, other structural analogs of compounds such as epothilone B are currently being synthesized in the hope that they will demonstrate equivalent antitumor efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity. PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative efficacy and toxicity of selectively modified epothilone compounds. METHODS: Compounds were initially screened for relative cytotoxicity against the human prostate cancer cell lines PC3, LNCaP, MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b. Growth inhibitory IC50 values of 0.5 to 4 nM were obtained. From this initial screen, one epothilone compound, 26-fluoroepothilone B, was chosen for further evaluation against the growth of s.c.-implanted MDA PCa 2b- and PC3-derived prostate tumors in athymic nude mice. The compound was administered intravenously at 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg after the tumors had reached 300 mm3. Two control groups were used: paclitaxel (40 mg/kg) and saline. RESULTS: Following treatment with 10 mg 26-fluoroepothilone B/kg, there was a sustained decrease in tumor size for 30 days reaching a maximal reduction of 80% when compared with tumor growth in the saline control group. Sustained suppression (&gt; 20 days) of tumor growth was observed following the second drug injection. Although a maximal body weight loss of 30% occurred after the second injection, all mice completely regained their initial body weight in 20 days. A lower dose (2 mg/kg) produced a 58% maximal reduction in tumor size and a 20% body weight loss. Minimal inhibition of tumor growth, however, was obtained with paclitaxel at a maximally tolerated dose (40 mg/kg). Other epothilones tested were either less effective and/or more toxic than 26-fluoroepothilone B. This new fluorinated epothilone compound supports the growth of paclitaxel-dependent <e>Tax</e>-18 mutant CHO cells and produces microtubule bundles similar to those produced by paclitaxel, indicating that the two drugs share a similar mechanism of action. CONCLUSION: A new fluorinated epothilone compound, 26-fluoroepothilone B, has been described that stabilizes microtubule structures based on its support of growth of a mutant paclitaxel-dependent CHO cell line. Its antitumor activity against human prostate cancer in nude mice is superior to that of paclitaxel at equivalent toxic doses. Further research is required to determine optimal dosing strategies and to fully assess the compound's activity against other malignant diseases.",M1
11697893,"Activation of HTLV-I long terminal repeat by stress-inducing agents and protection of HTLV-I-infected T-cells from apoptosis by the viral <e>tax</e> protein.HTLV-I is etiologically implicated with tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I associated myelopathy, adult T-cell leukemia and certain other diseases. However, after infection the virus enters into a dormant state, whereas the characteristics of the HTLV-I related diseases indicate that their genesis requires activation of the dormant virus by a Tax-independent mechanism. In the present study we demonstrate that a variety of stress-inducing agents (TPA, cisplatin, etoposide, taxol, and 3-methylcholanthrene) are capable of Tax-independent activation of HTLV-I LTR and that this activation is detected mainly in cells that are undergoing through the apoptotic process. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both apoptosis induction and HTLV-I LTR activation are inhibited by Bcl-2 and by PKC, indicating that these two processes are mechanistically cross-linked. In addition, using an HTLV-I producing human T-cell line which permanently express the negatively transdominant tax mutant, Delta58tax, under the Tet-Off control system, we prove that the virally encoded Tax protein protects the host cells from apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that activation of the dormant virus in the carriers' infected T-cells by certain stress-inducing conditions and protecting these cells from the consequent apoptotic death by the viral Tax protein emerging after this activation, might be the basis for switching the virus from latency to a pathogenic phase.",M1
11516860,"Phase II radiation therapy oncology group trial of weekly paclitaxel and conventional external beam radiation therapy for supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.PURPOSE: Fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) +/- carmustine (BCNU) is the standard of care for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but survival results remain poor. Preclinical studies indicate synergy between RT and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) in astrocytoma cell lines. Phase I studies in GBM have demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose for TAX of 225 mg/m(2)/3 h/week x 6, during EBRT, with no exacerbation of typical RT-induced toxicities. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) therefore mounted a Phase II study to determine the feasibility and efficacy of conventional EBRT and concurrent weekly TAX at its MTD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with histologic diagnosis of GBM were enrolled from 8/16/96 through 3/21/97 in a multi-institutional Phase II trial of EBRT and TAX 225 mg/m(2)/3 h (1-3 h before EBRT), administered the first treatment day of each RT week. Total EBRT dose was 60 Gy (200 cGy/fraction), 5 days per week. A smaller treatment field, to include gross disease plus a margin only, was used after 46 Gy. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (98%) were evaluable. Median age was 55 years (range, 28-78). Seventy-four percent were &gt; or = 50 years. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Classes III, IV, V, VI included 10 (17%), 21 (34%), 25 (41%), and 5 (8%) patients, respectively. Gross total resection was performed in only 16%. There was no Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity reactions precluding further use of TAX occurred in 4 patients. There were 2 instances of late neurotoxicity (4% Grade 3 or 4). Ninety-one percent of patients received treatment per protocol. Seventy-seven percent completed prescribed treatment (6 weeks). Of 35 patients with measurable disease, CR/PR was observed in 23%, MR in 17%, and SD in 43%. Seventeen percent demonstrated progression at first follow-up. Median potential follow-up time is 20 months. Median survival is 9.7 months, with median survivals for RPA classes III, IV, V, and VI of 16.3, 10.2, 9.5, 2.5 months, respectively. Ten patients remain alive. CONCLUSION: Concurrent full-dose EBRT and weekly high-dose TAX is feasible in the majority of GBM patients. Acute toxicity is acceptable; myelosuppression and peripheral sensory neuropathy are surprisingly modest, despite considerably higher overall dose intensity, compared to that achievable in other disease sites. Median survival by RPA class without prolonged adjuvant therapy is comparable to RTOG controls treated with standard EBRT and BCNU (1 year of BCNU).",M1

The treatment and toxicity data presented are based on a planned preliminary analysis conducted after 601 patients had been enrolled. The median age of patients randomized was 60 years and 73% were male. The majority of patients had a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, two thirds had stage IV disease and 35% had three or more sites of organ involvement. While the relative dose intensity for docetaxel was 0.97 both when combined with cisplatin and when combined with carboplatin, the corresponding figure for vinorelbine was 0.68, reflecting the frequent need for dose reduction when combined with cisplatin on the schedule used. Hematologic toxicities were tolerable and comparable across the three arms of the trial, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was below 5% in all cases. The incidence of nonhematologic toxicities also was similar, although nausea and vomiting appeared to be less frequent among patients assigned to docetaxel plus carboplatin than among patients receiving comparator regimens.

With PBPC mobilization in patients with breast cancer used as a model for chemotherapy-induced PBPC recruitment, the kinetics of progenitor cells mobilized either with cyclophosphamide (CY) or epirubicin/paclitaxel (EPI-<e>TAX</e>) followed by the administration of G-CSF was compared. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included a total of 86 patients with breast cancer (stage II-IV) receiving either CY (n = 39) or EPI-TAX (n = 47), both followed by G-CSF support. The progenitor cell content in peripheral blood and apheresis components was monitored by flow cytometric enumeration of CD34+ cells. PBPC collection was started when the threshold of &gt;20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per L of peripheral blood was reached. RESULTS: The PBPC collection was begun a median of 9 days after the administration of EPI-TAX followed by G-CSF support, as compared to a median of 13 days after mobilization with CY plus G-CSF. After treatment with CY, the total numbers of PBPCs peaked on Day 1 of apheresis, and they rapidly declined thereafter. In contrast, treatment with EPI-TAX followed by G-CSF administration led to a steady mobilization of CD34+ cells during leukapheresis. The difference in the mobilization patterns with CY and EPI-TAX resulted in a greater yield of CD34+ cells per L of processed blood volume. Compared to EPI-TAX, mobilization with CY required the overall processing of 30 percent less whole-blood volume to reach the target yield of &gt; or = 10 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg of body weight. After a median of three apheresis procedures, however, both CY+G-CSF and EPI-TAX+G-CSF were equally effective in obtaining this target yield. CONCLUSION: These results imply that specific PBPC mobilization as part of a given chemotherapy regimen should be taken into consideration before the planning of a PBPC harvest.",M1
11340900,"Docetaxel in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.Single-agent docetaxel induces a response in 21-42% of patients with recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). When used in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), response rates (RRs) of between 24 and 27% have been reported. In contrast, in combination with cisplatin, docetaxel has achieved a RR of 33% in previously treated patients and 86% in a subgroup of chemotherapy-naive advanced stage patients. The docetaxel/cisplatin combination appears to be highly active. High-dose induction chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced but potentially curable SCCHN is producing promising results: following combination therapy involving docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU and leucovorin (TPFL), RR are high and 75% of patients are alive at 2 years. Intermediate-dose induction chemotherapy involving docetaxel is also promising: the <e>TAX</e> 708 trial found an excellent 93% RR in 41 evaluable patients treated with docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-FU (TPF). The rate of pathological complete response was also high. The toxicities with TPF therapy were similar to those seen with cisplatin/5-FU regimens without docetaxel. A phase III trial of this approach is currently being conducted.",M1
11062745,"Damage of the kinesin heavy chain gene contributes to the antagonism of cisplatin and paclitaxel.Paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) and cisplatin (DDP) rank among the most promising anti-neoplastic agents for the treatment of epithelial cancer. Pre-clinical and clinical data show that the cytotoxicity resulting from the combined use of TAX and DDP is governed by the order (TAX prior DDP) &gt; (DDP prior TAX). Since this also occurs with DNA damaging agents other than DDP, damage of a sensitivity gene may be of importance. Recently, a role of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) was uncovered for the cytotoxicity of many natural drug derivatives by use of genetic suppressor elements (Gudkov et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 3744-3748). We first confirmed the dependency on the order of addition for TAX and DDP in human leukemic K562 cells taking apoptotic fraction and cell growth as endpoints. We then inhibited KHC gene expression by antisense oligodeoxy-nucleotides or KHC protein function by monoclonal antibody SUK4. Both approaches led to a reduced cytotoxicity of TAX indicating that KHC may confer sensitivity to TAX. Using a PCR-stop assay, we found that DDP indeed caused dose related DNA damage in the KHC gene. There was more DNA damage in the KHC gene than in four other genes (AFP, G6PD, MDR1, TCR-delta). Increasing doses of DDP down-regulated KHC mRNA expression more than of G6PD. There may therefore be a role of KHC for the use of TAX and DDP in combination.",M1
10997809,"Phase I and pharmacologic study of weekly gemcitabine and paclitaxel in chemo-naïve patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) are active, non-cross-resistant drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We performed a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of GEM and TAX given weekly in chemo-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Escalating doses of GEM (800-2000 mg/m2) and TAX (60-100 mg/m2) were administered on days 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks to 35 patients with advanced NSCLC. Plasma pharmacokinetics of TAX and GEM was assessed at the three higher dose-levels. RESULTS: Dose-escalation was discontinued in absence of MTD because of increased cumulative toxicity leading to dose modification or treatment delay at levels 6 and 7 (TAX 100 mg/m2 plus GEM 1750 and, respectively, 2000 mg/m2). Hematological toxicity included grade 4 neutropenia in 3% of cycles, grade 3 thrombocytopenia in one cycle and febrile neutropenia in three cycles. Maximal non-hematological toxicity was grade 3 elevation in serum transaminases and grade 2 neuro-sensory toxicity in 8% and 5% of cycles, respectively. At the two higher dose-levels a non-linear pharmacokinetics of GEM was observed with a remarkable variability of Cmax and AUC. No pharmacokinetic interactions were reported. Objectives responses were seen at all dose levels, with an overall response rate of 43% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 25.5%-62.6%) in 30 evaluable patients. CONCLUSIONS: The weekly administration of GEM and TAX is very well tolerated, and has shown promising antitumor activity in NSCLC. In view of the cumulative toxicity and of the pharmacokinetic profile of GEM, doses of 1500 mg/m2 of GEM and 100 mg/m2 of TAX are recommended for phase II studies.",M1
10953309,"Establishment and characterization of a paclitaxel-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cell line.We have established a paclitaxel-resistant mutant cell line called H460/<e>TAX</e> which was derived from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H460. A 64-fold greater resistant was shown in our assay as compared with the parental cells. High specificity of drug resistance was also observed since this mutant was not cross-resistant to several other anticancer drugs. Drug accumulation in H460/TAX was significantly less than that in H460. Many endogenous protein profiles were intact, including the expression level of P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, the 70 kDa heat shock proteins as well as the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in H460/TAX cells, except that the total amount of alpha- and beta- tubulins was higher in H460/TAX than in H460 cells. Higher drug concentration and longer treatment for paclitaxel were required in H460/TAX to exert the phosphorylation of keratin 19 which was then accompanied by reorganization of the intermediate filament and the microtubule networks. Since all of the aforementioned factors involved in paclitaxel-resistance in other systems were not found to be significantly altered in H460/TAX, there must be other paclitaxel-resistance mechanisms(s) which remains to be identified in human lung cancers.",M1
10949988,"High efficacy of paclitaxel and doxorubicin as first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer: a phase I-II study.The aim of this study was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) in combination with doxorubicin (ADM). To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of this combination, TAX was administered in escalating doses of 30 mg/m2, starting from 120 mg/m2, by 1 hour continuous infusion, per group of three patients; ADM was administered at a fixed dose of 50 mg/m2, 24 hours before administering TAX (phase 1). The combination was recycled every 3 weeks. In phase II, TAX was administered at the MTD defined in phase I. Thirty-six women were enrolled. The MTD of TAX was 220 mg/m2. Objective responses were observed in 28/34 (82%) assessable patients. The median progression-free survival was 11.8 months and overall survival 27.8 months. The main clinical toxicity was neutropenia (grade III-IV) of short duration (94%). Two patients developed cardiac toxicity. The combination TAX+ADM is very effective in advanced breast cancer.",M1
10856094,"Randomized phase III trial of docetaxel versus vinorelbine or ifosfamide in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. The <e>TAX</e> 320 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Study Group.PURPOSE: To confirm the promising phase II results of docetaxel monotherapy, this phase III trial was conducted of chemotherapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had previously failed platinum-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 373 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) (D100) or 75 mg/m(2) (D75) versus a control regimen of vinorelbine or ifosfamide (V/I). The three treatment groups were well-balanced for key patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall response rates were 10.8% with D100 and 6.7% with D75, each significantly higher than the 0.8% response with V/I (P =.001 and P =.036, respectively). Patients who received docetaxel had a longer time to progression (P =.046, by log-rank test) and a greater progression-free survival at 26 weeks (P =.005, by chi(2) test). Although overall survival was not significantly different between the three groups, the 1-year survival was significantly greater with D75 than with the control treatment (32% v 19%; P =.025, by chi(2) test). Prior exposure to paclitaxel did not decrease the likelihood of response to docetaxel, nor did it impact survival. There was a trend toward greater efficacy in patients whose disease was platinum-resistant rather than platinum-refractory and in patients with performance status of 0 or 1 versus 2. Toxicity was greatest with D100, but the D75 arm was well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: This first randomized trial in this setting demonstrates that D75 every 3 weeks can offer clinically meaningful benefit to patients with advanced NSCLC whose disease has relapsed or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.",M1
10850886,"Cell death in paclitaxel-dependent chinese hamster ovary cells is initiated by the loss of telomeric DNA repeats.We have reported earlier that cell death in a metastatic murine melanoma cell line induced by paclitaxel and its water-soluble conjugates is mediated through the extensive erosion of telomeric repeats. The purpose of this study was to investigate if loss of telomeric repeats was also involved in cell death of <e>Tax</e>-18 and Tax-2-4, two paclitaxel-requiring mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Tax-18 and Tax-2-4 cells were grown in paclitaxel-free culture medium for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 37 degrees C and then harvested for cytological preparations. Control cultures of both cell lines were grown in paclitaxel-supplemented medium and harvested simultaneously. We found that: 1) the frequency of telomeric associations in metaphase preparations was increased with the duration of paclitaxel-depleted culture; 2) Tax-18 cells showed a higher incidence (33.0%) of endoreduplicated metaphases at 24 h of paclitaxel-depleted culture than did Tax-2-4 cells, in which endoreduplicated metaphases were rare; 3) the frequency of polyploid cells was increased after 48, 72, and 96 h of paclitaxel-depleted culture for Tax-18 relative to that for Tax-2-4 cells; 4) both cell lines showed reductions in telomeric signals at chromosomal termini, but not in the interphase nuclei; and 5) both cell lines had shorter terminal telomeric restriction fragments after culture in paclitaxel-depleted medium. These results support our earlier observations and indicate that reduction of telomeric repeats is involved in G2/M cell arrest (endoreduplication) followed by severe DNA fragmentation, and then cell death of two CHO mutant cell lines that require paclitaxel for cell division.",M1
10769656,"Correlation of chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs and telomere length, telomerase activity and telomerase RNA expression in human ovarian cancer cells.BACKGROUND: We examined the correlations among telomere length (TRF), telomerase activity (TA) and the steady-state level of telomerase RNA expression (hTR) of human ovarian cancer cells with different phenotypes and investigated whether the cells' sensitivities to anticancer agents correlate with TRF, TA or hTR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TRF, TA and hTR of 11 human ovarian cancer cell lines and 2 cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were determined by genomic Southern blotting, a telomeric repeat amplification protocol and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The chemosensitivities of the cell lines to cisplatin (CDDP), paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), etoposide (ETO), CPT-11 (CPT), cyclophosphamide (CYC), ifomide (IFO) and doxorubicin (DOX) were decided as IC50 values by calorimetric assay. RESULTS: All 11 cell lines presented shorter mean TRFs (5.0 kb) than normal control tissue (8.0 kb); 10 cell lines presented a 3.2-fold higher mean TA than the control and all 11 cell lines expressed hTR. Quantitatively, the steady-state levels of hTR correlated with the TRF (p &lt; 0.05). Significant positive correlations between hTR and CDDP sensitivities (at 24 hours of exposure), ETO (72 hours), CPT (48 hours) and CYC/IFO (24-72 hours) were observed. The same was true for TRF and the CDDP sensitivities (at 24 hours). TAX and DOX did not have any impact on these factors. The TRF, TA and hTR values in the two CDDP-resistant cell lines were generally reduced, compared to their parent cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Alkylating agents (CDDP, CYC and IFO) and topoisomerase inhibitors (ETO, CPT) may have the potential to influence the structural alteration of hTRs and telomeres and thus, the down-regulation of the TA in ovarian cancer cells.",M1
10726444,"[Chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian carcinosarcoma]Carcinosarcoma of the ovary is a rare neoplasm representing 1% of this organ malignancies. The disease appears almost exclusively in advanced stage having an unfavourable prognosis. Three patients affected by carcinosarcoma (MMMT) of the ovary admitted to our Operative Unit have been treated. All patients underwent surgery and subsequently chemotherapy. Two patients were affected by heterologous MMMT and were stage IV and IIIc respectively, the other one, affected by homologous MMMT, was stage IIIc. Stage IV patient was submitted to 6 cycles of CARBO + IFX + CDDP, second look and further 6 cycles of <e>TAX</e>. After 23 months she was submitted to colostomy for intestine occlusion. At the 35 months she died for cachexia and intestine occlusion. Stage IIIc heterologous patient was submitted to 6 cycles of CDDP + EPI + IFX + MESNA for 3 days; at 6 months from diagnosis she did not present any sign of disease. Stage IIIc homologous patient, affected by chronic renal insufficiency and submitted to dialysis, underwent 5 cycles of TAX and at 11 months from diagnosis presented partial response. Carcinosarcoma of the ovary, because of its rarity, and of the poor record of cases in the literature, is a much debated topic in particularitis complementary therapy. Opinions of the several authors are in contrast regarding the use of CHT + RT at the same time. Only RT after surgery does not seem to improve the survival of these patients. Personal experience, with the reported outlines, compared with survival, seems to confirm the use of CDDP and of IFX and to give new horizons to TAX, waiting for further findings.",M1
10561278,"Phase I clinical and pharmacologic study of 13-cis-retinoic acid, interferon alfa, and paclitaxel in patients with prostate cancer and other advanced malignancies.PURPOSE: Recent studies demonstrate that retinoids decrease expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, enhance the effect of chemotherapy, and act synergistically with interferon alfa (IFNalpha) to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro. A phase I trial of 13-cis-retinoic acid (CRA), IFNalpha, and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) was conducted to determine the toxicity and recommended phase II dose of this combination. Pharmacodynamic studies were performed to determine whether CRA and IFNalpha could modulate bcl-2 expression in vitro and in patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with prostate cancer or other advanced malignancies were treated with CRA/IFNalpha and escalating doses of TAX. The effect of CRA/IFNalpha on TAX pharmacokinetics was analyzed in both patients and human liver microsomes. The effect of CRA/IFNalpha on bcl-2 expression was assessed in vitro and in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by immunoblotting. RESULTS: CRA 1 mg/kg on days 1 to 4, IFNalpha 6 MU/m(2) subcutaneously on days 1 to 4, and TAX 175 mg/m(2) on day 3 was well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that CRA/IFNalpha caused a 33% decrease in TAX clearance and a 23% decrease in the area under the concentration-time curve values of the TAX metabolite 6-alfa-hydroxytaxol (6-HT). CRA alone reduced conversion of TAX to 6-HT by 41% in human liver microsomes. CRA/IFNalpha decreased bcl-2 expression in vitro and in PBMCs. CONCLUSION: CRA/IFNalpha and TAX is a well-tolerated regimen. CRA/IFNalpha increases TAX area under the concentration-time curve through an inhibitory effect of CRA on the metabolism of TAX to 6-HT. CRA/IFNalpha can modulate bcl-2 expression in vitro and demonstrates similar biologic activity in patients. Further studies will determine the activity of CRA/IFNalpha/TAX and validate the assessment of bcl-2 in PBMCs as a marker of tumor response.",M1
10496651,"Pluronic P85 increases permeability of a broad spectrum of drugs in polarized BBMEC and Caco-2 cell monolayers.PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of P glycoprotein (P-gp) by Pluronic P85 (P85) block copolymer increases apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) transport of rhodamine 123 (R123) in the polarized monolayers of bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. The present work examines the effects of P85 on the transport of fluorescein (Flu), doxorubicin (Dox), etoposide (Et), taxol (<e>Tax</e>), 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), valproic acid (VPA) and loperamide (Lo) using BBMEC and Caco-2 monolayers as in vitro models of the blood brain barrier and intestinal epithelium respectively. METHODS: Drug permeability studies were performed on the confluent BBMEC and Caco-2 cell monolayers mounted in Side-Bi-Side diffusion cells. RESULTS: Exposure of the cells to P85 significantly enhanced AP to BL permeability coefficients of Flu, Tax, Dox and AZT in both cell models. Further, P85 enhanced AP to BL transport of Et, VPA and Lo in Caco-2 monolayers. No changes in the permeability coefficients of the paracellular marker mannitol were observed in the presence of the copolymer. CONCLUSIONS: P85 increases AP to BL permeability in BBMEC and Caco-2 monolayers with respect to a broad panel of structurally diverse compounds, that were previously shown to be affected by P-gp and/ or multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) efflux systems. Broad specificity of the block copolymer effects with respect to drugs and efflux systems appears to be a valuable property in view of developing pharmaceutical formulations to increase drug accumulation in selected organs and overcome both acquired and intrinsic drug resistance that limits the effectiveness of many chemotherapeutic agents.",M1
10426661,"Effect of the cisplatin-procaine complex DPR in combination with several anticancer agents on murine P388 leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo.We evaluated in vitro the antiproliferative activity of DPR (Fig. 1), a new cisplatin-derived compound, in combination with five conventional anticancer drugs: the antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and methotrexate (MTX), the alkylating agent mitomycin C (MMC), the antimicrotubule agent taxol (<e>TAX</e>) and the intercalating agent of the antracycline group doxorubicin (DOX), against murine P388 leukemic cells. MTT assay was used to determine growth inhibition after incubation of cells for 72 hours in the presence of single or combined drugs. The additive, synergistic or antagonistic nature of the combined drug effect was determined using the isobole method. In our cellular model, synergism was the prevailing result observed when DPR was combined with MMC. Conversely, antagonism was observed when DPR was combined with TAX. When DPR was administered together with the other antineoplastic drugs, the final effect was dependent on the concentrations of single agents. The study in vitro of the association between DPR and MMC was extended in vivo in BDF-1 female mice bearing i.p. P388 leukemic cells. Our data in vivo confirmed those obtained in vitro, demonstrating the therapeutic advantage of the association of ineffective doses of DPR (2 and 7 mg/kg) and MMC (3.2 mg/kg) over the administration of MMC alone.",M1
10344150,"[Pharmacological action of paclitaxel]Paclitaxel (taxol, <e>Tax</e>) is a novel plant product isolated from the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). It has a unique mechanism of action, because it induces very stable and dysfunctional microtubules. Paclitaxel has a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity. It has been successfully used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, lung cancer, carcinoma of the head and neck, malignant melanoma and other human neoplasms. Tax has response rates of 20-36% in patients with refractory ovarian cancer. Toxic effects include myelosuppresion, hypersensitivity reactions, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac disturbances, alopecia. However, studies evaluating the drug still are ongoing paclitaxel seems to be one of the most promising antineoplastic agents.",M1
9735415,"Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with resistance to paclitaxel, but not gemcitabine, in multiple myeloma cells.Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease despite an initial response-rate of &gt;60% with conventional or high-dose chemotherapy using glucocorticosteroids (i.e. dexamethasone), or alkylating agents (i.e. melphalan). Although these agents are capable of inducing complete remission (CR) in &gt;50% of MM patients, resistance develops rapidly, in &gt;90% of patients, within 2 years of treatment. Therefore, there is a need for new drugs for the treatment of relapsing and refractory MM patients. Gemcitabine (GEM) is a pyrimidine analog that blocks DNA synthesis, whereas, paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) is a mitotic spindle poison that promotes microtubular aggregation. Since it appears that these two drugs have different cellular targets, we examined the effect of each drug individually for several parameters and for possible synergy. We studied the cytotoxic effect of TAX and GEM on MM cells expressing varying levels of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2, which is overexpressed in the majority of myeloma cell from MM patients. We found that both drugs are cytotoxic by inducing apoptosis, however, the extent of apoptosis with TAX, but not with GEM was dependent on the levels of bcl-2 expression. We further investigated the effect of TAX and GEM on the cell cycle distribution and on the levels of bcl-2. The results indicate that the two drugs have different modes of action with respect to each parameter tested. TAX induced arrest of the cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, regardless of bcl-2 levels, however, apoptosis was induced in mitotic cells expressing relatively low levels of bcl-2. In contrast, GEM caused apoptosis of cells in the S-phase, regardless of level of bcl-2 expression. A major difference between TAX and GEM was in their effects on the levels of bcl-2. Whereas, TAX induced an early downregulation of bcl-2 (only in the cells with relatively low levels of bcl-2), treatment with GEM did not affect bcl-2 levels. The effects of TAX on both the cell cycle and bcl-2 were detected very early (4-8 h) and preceded the onset of apoptosis. GEM and TAX act synergistically, at low doses (IC50 of 0.5 microM for GEM and 0.025 microM for TAX), to effectively kill bcl-2 overexpressing cells that are resistant to higher doses (0.25 microM) of TAX alone. Therefore, we have initiated a phase II clinical trial of TAX and GEM for MM patients refractory to current therapy.",M1
9667244,"Study of cohort-specific consent and patient control in phase I cancer trials.PURPOSE: To address the challenging ethical dilemmas created from the participation of advanced cancer patients in phase I trials, we assessed the feasibility of a clinical trial design that uses an interactive informed consent process in which patient-subjects can choose to become directly involved in decisions of dose escalation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were advanced cancer patients in the Hematology/Oncology Clinics at the University of Chicago who were eligible to participate in a phase I trial in which they underwent a three-step informed consent process that used cohort-specific consent and allowed them the option to choose their own doses of the chemotherapeutic agents under study, vinorelbine (NVB) and paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>), within predetermined limits. NVB and TAX were administered in conventional 21- to 28-day cycles for two cycles while on study. Dose escalation occurred when a patient-subject chose a higher untested dose after they received information on all previously assessable patient-subjects. In addition to the phase I trial itself, a survey that consisted of structured interviews, which sought to evaluate patients' experiences with the interactive subject-choice phase I trial design and consent process, was conducted with participating subjects. The phase I trial itself sought to determine the associated toxicities of the agents under study. The survey results were compared with a similar survey of a matched control population of subjects who participated in other concurrently active conventional phase I trials at our institution. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patient-subjects participated in the phase I trial, with 24 who agreed to and completed the survey interviews. Seventy-six percent of patient-subjects opted to choose their dose of the agents under study, and 28% chose the highest available doses. More than half of the patient-subjects (56%) felt some degree of comfort in being asked to choose their dose of chemotherapy, with 53% stating that being asked to choose their dose made them feel in control, fully informed, or content. However, there were no statistically significant improvements in objective measures of the informed consent process, which included surveyed subjects' stated understanding of either provided information about phase I trials and alternatives to trial participation or of the research purpose of phase I trials. By making choices, the group of patients in the interactive subject choice trial changed the size of the dose cohorts and modified the process of dose escalation in this phase I study. CONCLUSION: Although complex, our innovative phase I trial design is feasible. In addition to the use of cohort-specific consent, the trial design may reduce the magnitude of many of the commonly recognized ethical dilemmas associated with this form of clinical research, which include difficulties with information provision and the understanding of possible risks and benefits of phase I trial participation, through direct subject involvement in research decision making by otherwise potentially vulnerable cancer patients.",M1
9660544,"Combination of cisplatin-procaine complex DPR with anticancer drugs increases cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cell lines.DPR, cis-diamminechloro-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl 4-amino-benzoate, N4]-chlorideplatinum(II) monohydrochloride monohydrate, is a newly developed water-soluble platinum compound which possess minimal cross-resistance to cisplatin and shows relatively less side effects. In an attempt to establish whether the combination of DPR with other conventional anticancer drugs would be of any benefit we assessed in vitro the cytotoxic effects of combinations of DPR with the antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX), the alkylating agents mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin, the antimicrotubule agent taxol (<e>TAX</e>), and the intercalating agent of the anthracycline group doxorubicin (DOX) on murine M5076 ovarian reticulosarcoma and human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. These agents were selected because of their common use in the clinic and because they represent four distinct categories of antineoplastic mechanisms. Cells were incubated for 72 h in the presence of single or combined drugs, and the cytotoxic effect was determined by the MTT assay. The analysis of combination treatment was made by the isobole method. In human A2780 cells, an overall synergy was found for DPR combined with 5-FU, DOX and cisplatin. Synergistic effects were also observed for most combinations with MTX or MMC. A DPR concentration-dependent additivity and antagonism was seen at the highest MTX concentration (1 microM), while additive effects were observed for the combined treatments of DPR and low concentrations of MMC (0.008 and 0.0016 microM). Additive effects were also observed for the association of DPR and TAX over most combinations tested. In murine M5076 cells, synergism was the prevailing result observed when DPR was combined with 5-FU, DOX, MMC or cisplatin. When administered together with MTX we observed additivity over most combinations tested. These findings suggest that DPR, when simultaneously administered with standard anticancer agents, may be advantagious for cytokilling.",M1
9625431,"The effect of combining antitubulin agents on differentiated and undifferentiated human colon cancer cells.The cytotoxicity of sequential combinations of a taxoid [paclitaxel (<e>TAX</e>) or docetaxel (TXT)] with a vinca alkaloid [vinorelbine (NVB)] was compared in differentiated and undifferentiated HT29-D4 cells. Agents were titrated from low doses inducing no modification of microtubule network to high doses corresponding to the clinically relevant concentrations that block mitosis. For undifferentiated cells, the sequential combination NVB/TAX was more efficient than TAX/NVB (22% cell survival versus 37% for 5 nM TAX and NVB). Surprisingly, we successively obtained synergism for low doses of both compounds [NVB (1-5 nM) and TAX (1-15 nM)], then additivity and finally antagonism when one of the compounds was at the concentration inducing mitotic block. The three patterns of results were also obtained with NVB/TXT combinations. For the synergistic combinations at the lowest concentrations, cytotoxicity occurred by apoptosis following mitosis. For differentiated cells, the most cytotoxic combinations were 1 microM TAX or TXT for 3 days followed by 1 microM NVB for 3 days, and 0.75 nM TAX or TXT for 9 days followed by 1 microM NVB for 3 days, the latter producing synergistic effects. Cytotoxicity occurred by apoptosis for the two states of differentiation. Major differences depending on cell phenotype were demonstrated: low sensitivity of differentiated cells to antitubulin agents and the difference in apoptotic pathways since mitosis is not involved in differentiated cells.",M1
9109049,"Human plasma distribution of free paclitaxel and paclitaxel associated with diblock copolymers.Amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly (D,L-lactide)-block-methoxy polyethylene glycol was synthesized, and paclitaxel (Taxol) was incorporated into this copolymer above its critical micelle concentration (cmc), resulting in the formation of polymeric micellar paclitaxel (PMT). Free paclitaxel dissolved in acetonitrile (<e>TAX</e>) and PMT, at 10 micrograms of paclitaxel/mL of human plasma, were incubated for 5, 30, and 60 min at 37 degrees C. Following incubation, the plasma was separated into its high-density (HDL), low-density (LDL), very-low-density (VLDL) lipoprotein and lipoprotein-deficient (LPDP) plasma fractions by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Each of these lipoprotein (LP) and LPDP fractions were analyzed for paclitaxel and plasma lipid levels by well-established HPLC and enzymatic assays. When TAX was incubated in human plasma for 5 min, an equal amount of drug was found in the LP and LPDP fractions. This distribution profile did not change following incubation for 30 and 60 min. Of the amount of TAX that was distributed within the LP fraction, 70-75% of TAX was associated with the HDL fraction for all time points studied. The paclitaxel plasma and LP distribution profile for PMT was similar to the distribution profile of TAX, suggesting that the plasma and LP distribution of paclitaxel is independent of the method of paclitaxel delivery and that LP distribution is not a function of mass lipid levels.",M1
9073315,"Messenger RNA expression of resistance proteins and related factors in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines resistant to doxorubicin, taxol and cisplatin.Doxorubicin- (OAW-dox, SK-OV-dox), taxol- (OAW-<e>tax</e>, SK-OV-tax) and cisplatin- (SK-OV-cis) resistant cells derived from the parental OAW-42 and SK-OV-3 cell lines were established. OAW-42 sublines showed high resistance, the SK-OV-3 sublines only low resistance. OAW-42 sublines showed a cross-resistance profile typical of multidrug resistance (MDR). The sublines of SK-OV-3 showed a cross-resistance profile different from the OAW-42 sublines. The mRNA expression of several resistance proteins and related factors was analyzed. An overexpression of P-glycoprotein 170 (P-170), glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), thymidylate synthase (TS), glutathione peroxidase (GP) and c-jun was found in OAW-dox and OAW-tax cells. Additionally, OAW-tax cells expressed a higher mRNA level of protein kinase Cbeta2. DNA analysis revealed a 2-fold gene amplification of P-170, whereas the genes for GST-pi, TS and GP were not amplified. SK-OV-dox and SK-OV-tax cells showed a decreased level of histone 3 (H3) and TS mRNA. This shows that the sublines of OAW-42 developed resistance by co-expression of several resistance-related proteins and proto-oncogenes whereas the sublines of SK-OV-3 expressed resistance by decreased expression of the proliferation-dependent proteins H3 and TS.",M1
8612315,"Reversal of doxorubicin, etoposide, vinblastine, and taxol resistance in multidrug resistant human sarcoma cells by a polymer of spermine.We have previously described the synthesis of a cytotoxic polymeric conjugate of spermine (Poly-SPM) which is able to inhibit the transport of polyamines (spermine, spermidine, and putrescine) into normal and malignant cells. Recent studies examining the toxicity of Poly-SPM in parental and multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cells have revealed a cross-resistance in the MDR variant Dx5 to the toxic effects of the conjugate in the MDR-positive cells. There were also differences in spermine and putrescine uptake rates between parental and MDR-positive with the MDR-positive cells having a lower Vmax and a higher Km. The ability of this Poly-SPM to reverse MDR was examined in MDR variants (Dx5 cells) of the human sarcoma cell line MES-SA. The cells express high levels of the mdr1 gene product, P-glycoprotein, and are 25-to 60-fold resistant to doxorubicin (DOX), etoposide (VP-16), vinblastine (VBL), and taxol (<e>TAX</e>). Cytotoxicity was measured by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Poly-SPM (50 microM) lowered the drug concentration IC50 values in the Dx5 cells by 37-fold with VBL, 42-fold with DOX, 29-fold with VP-16, and 25-fold with TAX when compared to the control IC50 values without Poly-SPM. This reversal of resistance was concentration dependent, decreasing 17-fold with DOX, 6.1-fold with VBL, 19-fold with VP-16, and 5-fold with TAX when 25 microM Poly-SPM was used. No modulation was observed in the parental cell line MES-SA, which does not express the mdr1 gene. Poly-SPM had no influence on the IC50 of non-MDR chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. The modulation studies correlated with the ability of Poly-SPM to reverse the cellular accumulation defect of [3H]-VBL and [3H]-TAX in the Dx5 but not MES-SA cells. Pretreatment of the Dx5 cell with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO at 2 and 5 microM) for 24 h increased the function of the MDR transporter to further decrease the cellular accumulation of VBL and TAX when compared to untreated cells. DFMO pretreatment is known to upregulate the polyamine transporter(s). These findings show that, in addition to inhibiting polyamine transport, Poly-SPM reverses MDR in Dx5 cells, suggesting a potential relationship between the polyamine influx transporter and the MDR efflux pump. This potential functional link between the polyamine influx transporter(s) and the MDR efflux transporter (P-glycoprotein) offers a novel approach to inhibiting this form of drug resistance.",M1

7954419,"K252a, KT5720, KT5926, and U98017 support paclitaxel (taxol)-dependent cells and synergize with paclitaxel.We have used paclitaxel-dependent <e>Tax</e> 2-4 cells to screen for compounds that have paclitaxel-like functional activity. The indolocarbazole serine/threonine kinase inhibitor K252a and analogues such as KT5926, KT5720, and K252b partially support the growth of the paclitaxel-dependent cells in the absence of paclitaxel. A novel kinase inhibitor of similar structure, U98017, supports the growth of the dependent cells to 48% of that seen with paclitaxel. Used in combination with paclitaxel, these compounds reduce the amount of paclitaxel required for maximum growth of the dependent cells. Isobologram analysis demonstrates that these compounds also act synergistically with paclitaxel to promote toxicity in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. These selected indolocarbazoles may act at sites distinct from that of paclitaxel and may specifically inhibit kinases that contribute to the destabilization of microtubules. Other indolocarbazoles such as staurosporine and rebeccamycin do not support paclitaxel-dependent cell growth. Structurally unrelated serine/threonine kinase inhibitors such as H-9 and H-7 or tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lavendustin do not support the growth of these cells. These results define a screen for functional paclitaxel analogues and suggest that it may be useful to investigate the possible synergy of selected indolocarbazoles and paclitaxel in vivo.",M1
7907234,"Characteristics of the combination paclitaxel plus doxorubicin in breast cancer cell lines analyzed with the ATP-cell viability assay.Preliminary clinical data show promising activity regarding the combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) (<e>TAX</e>) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (ADR) in the treatment of breast cancer. This combination needs both further preclinical and clinical investigations to better understand the drug interaction, and to optimize the dose and schedule of these drugs. This study was done to evaluate the combination effect of TAX and ADR in three human breast cancer cell lines. The ATP-Cell-Viability Assay was used to evaluate the chemosensitivity profiles and to obtain dose response curves. For quantitation of synergism and antagonism the median-effect principle was applied and the corresponding combination index values were calculated. Drug synergism/antagonism was shown to be dose-related; synergism was enhanced at higher fractions affected. From this preclinical data, we have concluded that TAX-ADR is highly effective and partly synergistic in vitro. In spite of severe initial toxicities in early clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer patients, further clinical studies appear to be justified in order to define a tolerable dosage.",M1
2569432,"Extragenic suppression and synthetic lethality among Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants resistant to anti-microtubule drugs.The antimicrotubule agents oryzalin (ORY), colchicine (COL) and taxol (<e>TAX</e>) were used to select three recessive, conditional lethal (ts-) mutants which defined two new essential loci, ory1 and cor1. The two ory1 mutants conferred resistance to ORY, TAX, and COL; the cor1 mutant conferred resistance only to COL. Each of the mutants displayed wild-type sensitivity to a number of unrelated inhibitors. Assembly and disassembly of flagellar microtubules in the ory1 mutants displayed wild-type sensitivity to ORY and COL, suggesting that the ory1 gene product either does not participate in these processes or the ory1 gene product alone is not sufficient to confer resistance. The ory1 locus mapped to linkage group X; cor1 was mapped to the left arm of linkage group XII. A synthetic lethal interaction was observed between ory1 and cor1 mutations, i.e., inferred ory1 cor1 double mutants were inviable at the permissive temperature. The conditional lethal phenotype of ory1-1 was used to select many spontaneous TS+ revertants, which arose at high frequencies. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the revertants demonstrated that (1) the revertants fell into four phenotypic classes, including some which conferred supersensitivity to ORY and others which conferred cold-sensitive lethality, (2) reversion was caused in most or all cases by extragenic suppressors, (3) suppressor mutations displayed complex behavior in heterozygous (sup/+) diploids, (4) many different loci may be capable of suppressing ory1 mutants, and (5) suppressors of ory1-1 efficiently suppressed an independently isolated allele, ory1-2. Taken together the ory1, cor1, and suppressor mutations identify a number of interacting loci involved in essential cellular processes which are specifically susceptible to antimicrotubule agents.",M1
2881620,"Verapamil reversal of vincristine resistance and cross-resistance patterns of vincristine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells.The phenotypic properties of a large number of low-level vincristine (VCR)-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines have been studied. In particular, we examined the correlation between the reversal of VCR resistance by verapamil (VRP) and cross-resistance patterns to other drugs. Cross resistance to other vinca alkaloids developed in parallel with VCR resistance. Doxorubicin resistance was observed in many of the cell lines, occurring even at the lowest levels of VCR resistance. Increased sensitivity to taxol (<e>TAX</e>) was a feature of half of the lines tested and there was no increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil or chlorambucil. Two main groups of mutants have been identified: (a) those that are thought to be membrane mutants which are cross-resistant to TAX and whose VCR resistance is reversible by VRP; and (b) those that appear to be tubulin mutants, which have increased sensitivity to TAX and resistance to VCR in the presence of VRP. It was not possible to distinguish between the different mechanisms of low-level resistance by drug accumulation studies in unsupplemented medium. However, VCR accumulation in the presence of VRP did correlate with the cross-resistance results.",M1
2861892,"A phosphoglycoprotein associated with taxol resistance in J774.2 cells.Taxol is an inhibitor of cell replication that promotes the assembly of microtubules in vitro and in cells. In the murine macrophage-like cell line J774.2, a taxol-resistant subline (J7/<e>TAX</e>-50) has been developed in vitro by growing the cells in increasing drug concentrations. These cells, which are approximately 800-fold resistant to taxol, display some cross-resistance to colchicine, vinblastine, puromycin, doxorubicin, and actinomycin D but remain sensitive to bleomycin. Binding of radiolabeled drug to the resistant cells is reduced by approximately 90%. Resistant cells grown in the absence of drug for 10 days (J7/TAX-0D10), 1 month (J7/TAX-0D30), and 8 months (J7/TAX-0D240) regain a major portion (27, 92, and 99%, respectively) of their sensitivity to the drug. However, binding of the drug to the J7/TAX-0D30 and J7/TAX-0D240 cells is increased to only 20 and 70%, respectively, of that measured with sensitive cells. Analysis of plasma membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining reveals the presence of a prominent protein with an approximate molecular weight of 135,000 in the resistant line that is essentially absent from the parental line and from both of the J7/TAX-0D30 and J7/TAX-0D240 lines. Although this protein can be seen in J7/TAX-0D10, its quantity is diminished. The Mr 135,000 protein is also observed in the resistant cells when they are labeled with [3H]leucine, [35S]methionine, [3H]glucosamine, or [32P]orthophosphate. Plasma membranes from colchicine- or vinblastine-resistant J774.2 cells also contain prominent phosphoglycoproteins, with approximate molecular weights of 145,000 and 150,000, respectively. Partial purification of the Mr 135,000 glycoprotein by agarose-bound ricinus communis agglutinin I-agarose affinity chromatography indicates that it accounts for approximately 4 to 5% of total membrane protein. A Mr 100,000 phosphoglycoprotein, present in the membranes of J774.2 cells is essentially absent in J7/TAX-50 cells after labeling with [3H]glucosamine or [32P]orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the Mr 135,000 and 100,000 phosphoglycoproteins reveals that the phosphorylation sites are serine and threonine residues. There appears to be a good correlation between the presence of the Mr 135,000 phosphoglycoprotein in plasma membranes and resistance to taxol.",M1
6134737,"Taxol-requiring mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells with impaired mitotic spindle assembly.In the accompanying paper (Cabral, F., 1982, J. Cell. Biol., 97:22-29) we described the isolation and properties of taxol-requiring mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells. We now show that at least one of these mutants, <e>Tax</e>-18, has an impaired ability to form a spindle apparatus. Immunofluorescence studies using antibodies to tubulin demonstrate that, when incubated in the absence of taxol, Tax-18 forms only a rudimentary spindle with few and shortened microtubules associated with the spindle poles. Furthermore, midbodies were not observed, consistent with an absence of cytokinesis. Essentially normal spindles and midbodies are seen in the presence of taxol. Electron microscopic examination indicates that centrioles and kinetochores are morphologically normal in the mutant strain. Pole-to-kinetochore microtubules were seen but interpolar microtubules were not. Taxol-deprived mutant cells stained with anti-centrosome serum show an elevated centriole content, indicating that the defect in Tax-18 does not affect centriole replication or prevent progression through the cell cycle. Although Tax-18 cells do not form a complete spindle in the absence of taxol, cytoplasmic microtubule assembly occurs in association with microtubule-organizing centers, and microtubules with apparently normal morphology exist throughout the cytoplasm. Observation of chromosome movement indicates that the defect in these cells occurs after prometaphase. These studies demonstrate that the formation of spindle microtubules requires cellular conditions that are different from those required for cytoplasmic microtubule formation. They further show that a normal spindle may be necessary for cytokinesis but not for progress of the cells through the cell cycle.",M1
6134736,"Isolation of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants requiring the continuous presence of taxol for cell division.Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants resistant to the cytotoxic effects of taxol and requiring the drug for normal growth were isolated in a single step. One of these mutant cell lines, <e>Tax</e>-18, fails to divide in the absence of taxol; instead, the cells become larger, rounder, flatter, and multinucleated. Analysis by flow cytometry indicates that during taxol deprivation there is an accumulation of cells in G2 + M phase but that the cells are able to leak through the block in the absence of cell division and further increase their DNA content beyond the tetraploid amount. This interpretation is confirmed by karyotype analysis and by time-lapse studies that show cells rounded for mitosis two to five times longer than in wild-type cultures or in Tax-18 cultures grown in taxol. The cells finally attempt to undergo cytokinesis, fail, and spread out again, but as larger cells than before. Tax-18 has a normal growth rate and morphology when grown in taxol even at concentrations three to five times below the selecting concentration of the drug. The cells, however, have increased sensitivity to microtubule-disrupting drugs such as colcemid, griseofulvin, and D2O. The mutation for taxol auxotrophy behaves recessively in somatic cell hybridization experiments, and the phenotypic reversion rate is approximately 10(-5) in a nonmutagenized population. Both alpha- and beta-tubulin are present in apparently normal amounts and with normal electrophoretic mobilities on two-dimensional gels. The results suggest that Tax-18 lacks a factor necessary for mitosis and that taxol may be able to substitute for this factor.",M1

Procedural accounts of fair bargaining have been popular solutions to this problem, but I argue that they are insufficient to protect against exploitation. I argue instead that a maximin principle of fair distribution provides a more compelling normative account of fairness in relationships characterised by extreme vulnerability and inequality of bargaining potential between the parties.

This study investigates the distributional effects of climate change taxes on households belonging to different income and lifestyle groups; and it compares the effects of a CO(2) <e>tax</e> with a multiple GHG tax in the UK in terms of cost efficiency and distributional effects. Results show that a multi GHG tax is more efficient than a CO(2) tax due to lower marginal abatement costs, and that both taxes are regressive, with lower income households paying a relatively larger share of their income for the taxes than higher income households. A shift from a CO(2) tax to a GHG tax will reduce and shift the tax burden between consumption categories such as from energy-intensive products to food products. Consumers have different abilities to respond to the tax and change their behavior due to their own socio-economic attributes as well as the physical environment such as the age of the housing stock, location, and the availability of infrastructure. The housing-related carbon emissions are the largest component of the CO(2) tax payments for low income groups and arguments could be made for compensation of income losses and reduction of fuel poverty through further government intervention.",M2

DESIGN AND SETTING: Mathematical modelling of three scenarios of volumetric alcohol taxation for the population of Australia: (i) no change in deadweight loss, (ii) no change in tax revenue, and (iii) all alcoholic beverages taxed at the same rate as spirits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated change in alcohol consumption, tax revenue and health benefit. RESULTS: The estimated cost of changing to a volumetric tax rate is $18 million. A volumetric tax that is deadweight loss-neutral would increase the cost of beer and wine and reduce the cost of spirits, resulting in an estimated annual increase in taxation revenue of $492 million and a 2.77% reduction in annual consumption of pure alcohol. The estimated net health gain would be 21 000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with potential cost offsets of $110 million per annum. A tax revenue-neutral scenario would result in an 0.05% decrease in consumption, and a tax on all alcohol at a spirits rate would reduce consumption by 23.85% and increase revenue by $309 million. All volumetric tax scenarios would provide greater health benefits and cost savings to the health sector than the existing taxation system, based on current understandings of alcohol-related health effects. CONCLUSIONS: An equalized volumetric tax that would reduce beer and wine consumption while increasing the consumption of spirits would need to be approached with caution. Further research is required to examine whether alcohol-related health effects vary by type of alcoholic beverage independent of the amount of alcohol consumed to provide a strong evidence platform for alcohol taxation policies.",M2

20379131,"State cigarette minimum price laws - United States, 2009.Cigarette price increases reduce the demand for cigarettes and thereby reduce smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption, and youth initiation of smoking. Excise <e>tax</e> increases are the most effective government intervention to increase the price of cigarettes, but cigarette manufacturers use trade discounts, coupons, and other promotions to counteract the effects of these tax increases and appeal to price-sensitive smokers. State cigarette minimum price laws, initiated by states in the 1940s and 1950s to protect tobacco retailers from predatory business practices, typically require a minimum percentage markup to be added to the wholesale and/or retail price. If a statute prohibits trade discounts from the minimum price calculation, these laws have the potential to counteract discounting by cigarette manufacturers. To assess the status of cigarette minimum price laws in the United States, CDC surveyed state statutes and identified those states with minimum price laws in effect as of December 31, 2009. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which determined that 25 states had minimum price laws for cigarettes (median wholesale markup: 4.00%; median retail markup: 8.00%), and seven of those states also expressly prohibited the use of trade discounts in the minimum retail price calculation. Minimum price laws can help prevent trade discounting from eroding the positive effects of state excise tax increases and higher cigarette prices on public health.",M2

All states and the District of Columbia (DC) impose an excise <e>tax</e> on cigarettes. Because many states increased their cigarette excise taxes in 2009, CDC conducted a survey of these tax increases. For this report, CDC reviewed data contained in a legislative database to identify cigarette excise tax legislation that was enacted during 2009 by the 50 states and DC. During that period, 15 states (including DC), increased their state excise tax on cigarettes, increasing the national mean from $1.18 per pack in 2008 to $1.34 per pack in 2009. However, none of the 15 states dedicated any of the new excise tax revenue by statute to tobacco control. Additionally, for the first time, two states (Connecticut and Rhode Island) had excise tax rates of at least $3.00 per pack. Additional increases in cigarette excise taxes, and dedication of all resulting revenues to tobacco control and prevention programs at levels recommended by CDC, could result in further reductions in smoking and associated morbidity and mortality.",M2

PURPOSE: This paper uses simulation modeling to examine the effects of three tobacco control policies and cessation treatment policies-alone and in conjunction-on population smoking prevalence. METHODS: Building on previous versions of the SimSmoke model, the effects of a defined set of policies on quit attempts, treatment use, and treatment effectiveness are estimated as potential levers to reduce smoking prevalence. The analysis considers the effects of (1) price increases through cigarette <e>tax</e> increases, (2) smokefree indoor air laws, (3) mass media/educational policies, and (4) evidence-based and promising cessation treatment policies. RESULTS: Evidence-based cessation treatment policies have the strongest effect, boosting the population quit rate by 78.8% in relative terms. Treatment policies are followed by cigarette tax increases (65.9%); smokefree air laws (31.8%); and mass media/educational policies (18.2%). Relative to the status quo in 2020, the model projects that smoking prevalence is reduced by 14.3% through a nationwide tax increase of $2.00, by 7.2% through smokefree laws, by 4.7% through mass media/educational policies, and by 16.5% through cessation treatment policies alone. Implementing all of the above policies at the same time would increase the quit rate by 296%, such that the HP2010 smoking prevalence goal of 12% is reached by 2013. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of a combination of policies led to some surprisingly positive possible futures in lowering smoking prevalence to 12% within just several years.

20176306,"Creating a perfect storm to increase consumer demand for Wisconsin's Tobacco Quitline.BACKGROUND: Telephone quitlines are a clinically proven and cost-effective population-wide tobacco-dependence treatment, and this option is now available in all 50 states. Yet, only 1% of the smoking population accesses these services annually. This report describes a series of policy, programmatic, and communication initiatives recently implemented in Wisconsin that resulted in a dramatic increase in consumer demand for the Wisconsin Tobacco Quitline (WTQL). INTERVENTION: In 2007, the Wisconsin legislature voted to increase the state cigarette excise <e>tax</e> rate by $1.00, from $0.77/pack to $1.77/pack effective January 1, 2008. In preparation for the tax increase, the Wisconsin Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, which manages the WTQL, and the state's quitline service provider, Free &amp; Clear, Inc., collaborated to enhance quitline knowledge, availability, and services with the goal of increasing consumer demand for services. The enhancements included for the first time, a free 2-week supply of over-the-counter nicotine replacement medication for tobacco users who agreed to receive multi-session quitline counseling. A successful statewide earned media campaign intensified the impact of these activities, which were timed to coincide with temporal smoking-cessation behavioral patterns (i.e., New Year's resolutions). RESULTS: As a result, the WTQL fielded a record 27,000 calls during the first 3 months of 2008, reaching nearly 3% of adult Wisconsin smokers.

DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke. DATA SOURCES: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving $32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves $22.4 billion over the same period. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake. LIMITATION: Efforts to reduce population sodium intake could result in other dietary changes that are difficult to predict. CONCLUSION: Strategies to reduce sodium intake on a population level in the United States are likely to substantially reduce stroke and MI incidence, which would save billions of dollars in medical expenses.

20173798,"Government paralysis? Stable tobacco prices mean preventable deaths and disease persist, along with health inequalities in New Zealand.Tobacco affordability, prices and tobacco <e>tax</e> rates have considerable effects on smoking uptake, consumption, and quitting. We examined the trends in New Zealand per capita tobacco consumption and real cigarette prices from 1975-2008. Since 1984, there has been a close inverse relationship between real price and per capita tobacco consumption. Thus price increases drive consumption falls. However, in the periods of 1992-1997 and 2002-2008, both price and consumption were largely stable. The stability since 2002 means other tobacco control interventions have been undercut by increased tobacco affordability (due to increased average real incomes). Furthermore, the lack of tobacco tax increases (to be used to fund better tobacco control) is against majority surveyed New Zealand public opinion, and may be contrary to even smokers' views. The great majority of smokers, who want to quit, could be assisted by more extensive programmes funded by the extra revenue from tobacco tax increases. These could include more prime-time mass media campaigns and greater Quitline capacity. Tobacco tax increases are a highly evidence-based policy that could help reduce harm to the health of New Zealanders and reduce health inequalities.",M2
20171537,"Economic impacts of the Pueblo Smoke-Free Air Act.BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2003, the city of Pueblo CO enacted a smokefree ordinance (Pueblo Smoke-Free Air Act [PSFAA]) that prohibited smoking in public places and workplaces, including taverns and restaurants. Opponents to this ordinance argued that it would have a negative impact on tavern and restaurant sales. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PSFAA had a negative economic impact on tavern and restaurant sales <e>tax</e> revenues. METHODS: With data gathered in 2007, this study implemented an interrupted time-series model in 2008, using 42 months of pre- and post-intervention sales tax revenue data for Pueblo to determine whether implementation of this ordinance had an effect on tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues. Ratios of tavern and restaurant openings to closings were also computed for the pre- and post-intervention periods. RESULTS: Pre-post sales tax revenue data showed slight losses in sales tax revenue for taverns, and gains for restaurants, which more than offset the tavern losses. After adjusting for the consumer price index, the city of Pueblo experienced a 20.3% gain in combined tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues from the pre-ordinance period to the post-ordinance period. The ratio of tavern openings to closings improved from 1:1 pre-period to 3.3:1 post-period and the restaurant ratio remained unchanged at approximately 1.78:1 from pre- to post-period. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that the PSFAA had a negative economic impact on consumer price index-adjusted tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues. From a fiscal policy perspective, this ordinance may have contributed to a net increase in sales tax revenues for the city of Pueblo. The business openings/closings data suggest that the confidence Pueblo's business sector had in the local hospitality industry was not negatively influenced by the PSFAA.",M2
20171533,"Race-differentiated outcomes in multiple special healthcare taxing districts.BACKGROUND: Communities with locally generated special healthcare taxes have demonstrated a generally favorable association with selected population health status outcomes. PURPOSE: This research attempted to determine if that positive association with health outcomes is race differentiated. METHODS: Florida counties with multiple special taxing districts were grouped and compared against counties that had either no special healthcare taxing authority or had such authority but were inactive (did not <e>tax</e>). Outcomes of interest were five combined groups and eight cause-specific mortality indicators and five categories of hospitalizations from the 6-year period 2000-2005 analyzed in 2007. Standard mortality ratios and standard hospitalization ratios were calculated separately for white and black populations in four age bands. RESULTS: Compared to blacks and whites living in communities without special taxing districts, black residents of communities with such districts had larger reductions in mortality for chronic conditions such as cancers, diabetes, stroke, and pneumonia/influenza. The same holds true for hospitalizations for diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and asthma. These differences were not found in mortality due to HIV, homicide, or motor vehicle crashes. Some differences by taxing district were also age and race differentiated. CONCLUSIONS: In communities with health-related taxing authorities, reductions in health disparities between whites and blacks can be demonstrated. These differences are not uniform and vary by the specific type of outcome, race, and age. These findings support the need for studies that prospectively determine whether implementing new taxing strategies may help reduce health disparities.",M2

20117579,"The effectiveness of <e>tax</e> policy interventions for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms.A systematic review of the literature to assess the effectiveness of alcohol tax policy interventions for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms was conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). Seventy-two papers or technical reports, which were published prior to July 2005, met specified quality criteria, and included evaluation outcomes relevant to public health (e.g., binge drinking, alcohol-related crash fatalities), were included in the final review. Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also significantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms. According to Community Guide rules of evidence, these results constitute strong evidence that raising alcohol excise taxes is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The impact of a potential tax increase is expected to be proportional to its magnitude and to be modified by such factors as disposable income and the demand elasticity for alcohol among various population groups.",M2
20117573,"Congestion road <e>tax</e> and physical activity.BACKGROUND: Large-scale policy and environmental changes, such as congestion road taxes, may be a way to promote active transportation. PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the potential effect of a congestion road tax on physical activity. METHODS: Baseline data were collected during October-November 2003, follow-up data in May 2006, and analysis was performed in September 2008. The short self-administered version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess physical activity. Data from those with access to motorized vehicles in the Stockholm region (n=165), where the tax was in place, were compared with those from the Göteborg/Malmö regions (n=138). Within each region before and during the road tax implementation, the data were analyzed for differences in time spent at different intensity levels of physical activity, in addition to sitting, as well as for changes in reported time in overall (weighted) physical activity. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the magnitude of the changes of the intensity levels of physical activity, weighted overall physical activity, or sitting, between Stockholm and Göteborg/Malmö. Among those exposed to the congestion road tax and with access to motorized vehicles, an increase in moderate physical activity (p=0.036); overall physical activity (p=0.015); and a reduction in time spent sitting (p=0.009) was observed. No differences were observed among those unexposed. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study on the influence of a congestion road tax on levels of physical activity, though inconclusive, suggest that policy changes such as a congestion road tax might promote improvements in physical activity levels in individuals with motorized vehicles.",M2
20104796,"Implications of health reform for retiree health benefits.This Issue Brief examines how current health reform legislation being debated in Congress will impact the future of retiree health benefits. In general, the proposals' provisions will have a mixed impact on retiree health benefits: In the short term, the reinsurance provisions would help shore up early retiree coverage and Medicare Part D coverage would become more valuable to retirees. In the longer term, insurance reform combined with new subsidies for individuals enrolling for coverage through insurance exchanges, the maintenance-of-effort provision affecting early retiree benefits, increases to the cost of providing drug benefits to retirees, and enhanced Medicare Part D coverage, would all create significant incentives for employers to drop coverage for early retirees and drug coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees. REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR EARLY RETIREES: Proposed legislation includes a provision to create a temporary reinsurance program for employers providing health benefits to retirees over age 55 and not yet eligible for Medicare. Given the temporary nature of the program, it is intended to provide employers an incentive to maintain benefits until the health insurance exchange is fully operational. At that point, employers will have less incentive to provide health benefits to early retirees, and retirees will have less need for former employers to maintain a program. MEDICARE DRUG BENEFITS: The House-passed bill would initially reduce the coverage gap (the so-called  doughnut hole ) for individuals in the Medicare Part D program by $500 and eliminate it altogether by 2019. The bill currently before the Senate would also reduce the coverage gap by $500, but does not call for eliminating it. Both would also provide a 50 percent discount to brand-name drug coverage in the coverage gap. These provisions increase the value of the Medicare Part D drug program to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries relative to drug benefits provided by employers. <e>TAX</e> TREATMENT OF EMPLOYER SUBSIDIES UNDER MMA: The Medicare Modernization Act provides subsidies to employers that continue to offer prescription drug coverage through a retiree health benefits program. This subsidy is currently not counted as taxable income to the employer receiving it. Both the House and Senate bills would effectively repeal this tax exclusion. This would have two effects: The real cost of providing retiree health benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees would increase, and an employer's FAS 106 liability would increase immediately. The increase in the cost of retiree drug benefits will cause employers to re-evaluate the subsidy, compared with other available options. Moving retirees to Medicare Part D may become even more attractive to employers if the coverage gap is reduced and/or eliminated. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CHANGES: With some exceptions, the House-passed legislation would prohibit employers from changing the benefits offered to retirees and their beneficiaries once a person has retired. This provision could have a number of different effects: More employers may move toward capping their contributions; employers that want to maintain retiree health benefits may react by cutting the health benefits of active workers; employers may eliminate retiree health benefits altogether to avoid being locked into providing a permanent benefit; or they may drop benefits if they think there is no need to provide them.",M2
20101381,"[Assessing the health target  Reduce tobacco consumption ]The consortium gesundheitsziele.de has defined health targets and actions to reduce tobacco consumption of the general population. Five primary fields of action were defined: (1) <e>tax</e> increase, (2) ban of advertisements, (3) protection against second-hand smoking, (SHS) (4) support of smoking cessation, and (5) actions to avoid taking up smoking. The achievements in recent years are described by means of epidemiological studies and other specific data. (1) Tax increases led to a significant rise of cigarette prices. (2) A complete ban of advertisements has not yet been achieved. The tobacco industry shifted expenditures to fields where advertising is still allowed. (3) Many actions to foster protection against SHS could be implemented. Public awareness has been raised, the acceptance of smoking bans has grown, and exposure to SHS has been reduced. (4) Demand and supply of smoking cessation interventions have been enhanced. (5) Actions to avoid taking up smoking seem to be successful as the rate of smokers among young people has decreased, the number of never-smokers has increased, and a more critical attitude of non-smokers towards smoking could be observed. It is recommended that the above actions be continued because the capabilities of the structural, mass media, and behavioral interventions have not been fully exhausted.",M2

20040110,"Support for a <e>tax</e> increase to provide unrestricted access to an Alzheimer's disease medication: a survey of the general public in Canada.BACKGROUND: Public drug insurance plans provide limited reimbursement for Alzheimer's disease (AD) medications in many jurisdictions, including Canada and the United Kingdom. This study was conducted to assess Canadians' level of support for an increase in annual personal income taxes to fund a public program of unrestricted access to AD medications. METHODS: A telephone survey was administered to a national sample of 500 adult Canadians. The survey contained four scenarios describing a hypothetical, new AD medication. Descriptions varied across scenarios: the medication was alternatively described as being capable of treating the symptoms of cognitive decline or of halting the progression of cognitive decline, with either no probability of adverse effects or a 30% probability of primarily gastrointestinal adverse effects. After each scenario, participants were asked whether they would support a tax increase to provide unrestricted access to the drug. Participants who responded affirmatively were asked whether they would pay an additional $75, $150, or $225 per annum in taxes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the determinants of support for a tax increase. RESULTS: Eighty percent of participants supported a tax increase for at least one scenario. Support was highest (67%) for the most favourable scenario (halt progression - no adverse effects) and lowest (49%) for the least favourable scenario (symptom treatment - 30% chance of adverse effects). The odds of supporting a tax increase under at least one scenario were approximately 55% less for participants who attached higher ratings to their health state under the assumption that they had moderate AD and almost five times greater if participants thought family members or friends would somewhat or strongly approve of their decision to support a tax increase. A majority of participants would pay an additional $150 per annum in taxes, regardless of scenario. Less than 50% would pay $225. CONCLUSIONS: Four out of five persons in a sample of adult Canadians reported they would support a tax increase to fund unrestricted access to a hypothetical, new AD medication. These results signal a willingness to pay for at least some relaxation of reimbursement restrictions on AD medications.",M2
20018990,"Performance-based regulation: enterprise responsibility for reducing death, injury, and disease caused by consumer products.This article offers a bold new idea for confronting the staggering level of death, injury, and disease caused by five consumer products: cigarettes, alcohol, guns, junk food, and motor vehicles. Business leaders try to frame these negative outcomes as  collateral damage  that is someone else's problem. That framing not only is morally objectionable but also overlooks the possibility that, with proper prodding, industry could substantially lessen these public health disasters. I seek to reframe the public perception of who is responsible and propose to deploy a promising approach called  performance-based regulation  to combat the problem. Performance-based regulation would impose on manufacturers a legal obligation to reduce the negative social costs of their products. Rather than involving them in litigation or forcing them to operate differently (as  command-and-control  regimes do), performance-based regulation allows the firms to determine how best to decrease bad public health consequences. Like other public health strategies, performance-based regulation focuses on those who are far more likely than individual consumers to achieve real gains.

20018986,"Maximizing federal Medicaid dollars: nursing home provider <e>tax</e> adoption, 2000-2004.Since Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments, state officials have sought to offset state expenditures by maximizing federal contributions. One such strategy is to adopt a provider tax, which enables states to collect revenues from providers; those revenues are then used to pay for services rendered to Medicaid recipients, thereby leveraging federal matching dollars without concomitant increases in state expenditures. The number of states adopting a nursing home tax increased from thirteen to thirty-one between 2000 and 2004. This study seeks to identify the factors that spurred the rapid increase in nursing home provider taxes following implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Results indicate that states with more powerful nursing home lobbies, lower proportions of private pay nursing home residents, worse fiscal health, weaker fiscal capacity, broader Medicaid eligibility, and nursing home supply restrictions were more likely to adopt. This implies that state officials react rationally to prevailing fiscal and programmatic circumstances when formulating policy under Medicaid and that providers seek relief, in part, from the adverse fiscal consequences of federal policy changes by promoting policy change at the state level.",M2
20018943,"Characteristics of smoker support for increasing a dedicated tobacco <e>tax</e>: national survey data from New Zealand.AIM: To examine smoker support for tobacco tax and for increased dedicated tobacco taxes, along with associations forany such support. METHODS: The New Zealand (NZ) arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey utilizes the NZ Health Survey (a national sample). From this sample, we surveyed adult smokers (N = 1,376). RESULTS: Most smokers considered that the current level of tobacco tax is  too high  (68%), but a majority (59%) would support an increase in tobacco tax if the extra revenue was used to promote healthy lifestyles and support quitting. There was majority support for a dedicated tobacco tax increase among all sociodemographic groups of smokers (including M?ori, Pacific, and Asian smokers). In the fully adjusted multivariate model, significant associations with support for a dedicated tax increase included higher deprivation level (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.15) and suffering one form of financial stress (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.18-2.78). Other significant associations with support included concern about the smoking impacts on health and quality of life (AOR = 1.41), expressing support for tobacco control regulation (AOR = 1.83), and strength of intention to quit (AOR = 1.30). DISCUSSION: A majority of smokers from all sociodemographic groups supported an increase in tobacco tax if it was dedicated to quitting support and health promotion. The higher support among smokers with stronger intentions to quit is consistent with other evidence that smokers value tobacco control regulation such as high taxes to help them achieve their long-term quitting goals.",M2

METHODS: Estimated price elasticities of the demand for cigarettes, prevalence data and epidemiology are used to estimate the impact of a tobacco tax increase on cigarette consumption, government tax revenue, lives saved, employment and revenue loss in the cigarette industry and tobacco farming. RESULTS: The recent Chinese tax adjustment, if passed along to the retail price, would reduce the number of smokers by 630,000 saving 210,000 lives, at a price elasticity of -0.15. A tax increase of 1 RMB (or US$0.13) per pack of cigarettes would increase the Chinese government's tax revenue by 129 billion RMB (US 17.2 billion), decrease consumption by 3.0 billion packs of cigarettes, reduce the number of smokers by 3.42 million and save 1.14 million lives.

Despite having the second lowest cigarette tax rate in the nation, Missouri was unsuccessful in passing its 2006 ballot initiative to raise the tax. An important way to encourage health-related policy change such as increasing tobacco taxes is through media coverage of tobacco issues. We examined how tobacco issues were presented in Missouri's print media leading up to the 2006 election. METHODS: This study analysed 1263 articles with tobacco content published in 187 Missouri newspapers in the year before the election. Articles were coded for general and tobacco-related characteristics including article type (news story, editorial, letter to the editor), tobacco control position (pro, neutral, anti) and article theme (economic, health, political). RESULTS: Most articles were news stories (73.6%) and pro-tobacco control (63.8%). The proportion of anti-tobacco control articles increased significantly (chi(2)=104.9, p&lt;0.001) the month before the election, driven by an increase in economically themed articles. Economic articles were published more often in counties with less voter support for the tax (F=5.68, p&lt;0.01). Finally, tobacco control position varied significantly across article types (chi(2)=148.3, p&lt;0.01), with letters to the editor being anti-tobacco control most often. CONCLUSION: The media have a critical role in promoting public health goals and presenting health issues which influences formation of health policies.

One thousand three hundred and ninety-four respondents agreed to participate in the survey out of 2,600 randomly sampled adults over 20 years old from all over Japan. The results of multiple regression analysis confirmed that value similarity is the strongest predictor of public trust in the government.

METHODS: Published government statistics and estimated price elasticities of the demand for cigarettes are used to estimate the impact of the new tax rate adjustment on cigarette consumption and population health. RESULTS: The new adjustment increased the tax rate by 11.7% points at the producer price level. Converting this 11.7% point increase to the retail price level would mean an increase of 3.4% points in the retail price tax rate. Thus, China's new cigarette tax rate at the retail level would be 43.4% instead of the previous 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The primary motivation for the recent Chinese government tobacco tax adjustment is to raise additional government revenue. Because the additional ad valorem tax has not yet been transferred to smokers, there is no public health benefit. It is hoped that the Chinese government will pass along these taxes to the retail price level, which would result in between 640,000 and two million smokers quitting smoking and between 210,000 and 700,000 quitters avoiding smoking-related premature death.",M2
19850550,"A simulation model to predict the fiscal and public health impact of a change in cigarette excise taxes.OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a model that predicts changes in cigarette consumption and excise revenue in response to excise <e>tax</e> changes, and (2) to demonstrate that, if the industry has market power, increases in specific taxes have better tobacco control consequences than increases in ad valorem taxes. DESIGN: All model parameters are user-determined. The model calculates likely changes in cigarette consumption, smoking prevalence and excise tax revenues due to an excise tax change. The model is applicable to countries that levy excise tax as specific or ad valorem taxes. RESULTS: For a representative low-income or middle-income country a 20% excise tax increase decreases cigarette consumption and industry revenue by 5% and increases excise tax revenues by 14%, if there is no change in the net-of-tax price. If the excise tax is levied as a specific tax, the industry has an incentive to raise the net-of-tax price, enhancing the consumption-reducing impact of the tax increase. If the excise tax is levied as an ad valorem tax, the industry has no such incentive. The industry has an incentive to reduce the net-of-tax price in response to an ad valorem excise tax increase, undermining the public health and fiscal benefits of the tax increase. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a simple web-based tool that allows policy makers and tobacco control advocates to estimate the likely consumption, fiscal and mortality impacts of a change in the cigarette excise tax. If a country wishes to reduce cigarette consumption by increasing the excise tax, a specific tax structure is better than an ad valorem tax structure.",M2

Goal of our study was the estimation of government earnings from tobacco consumption of minors in Austria. METHODS: Tobacco <e>tax</e> paid by adolescents aged 11 to 17 years was estimated from smoking prevalences and taxation of cigarettes. RESULTS: In 2006 state revenues from cigarette consumption of minors in Austria amounted to 60.5 million Euro. DISCUSSION: Up to now the fight against business interest of the tobacco industry in Austria has been mainly left to volunteers. Therefore we suggest the funding a professional agency, independent from state budget and interest groups, by a tobacco prevention fund which is financed by the revenues from cigarettes smoked by youth. The mission of this fund should be to lower smoking incidence and smoking prevalence among minors. The WHO framework convention on tobacco control, ratified by Austria in 2005, should be considered in the next amendments of the tobacco law. The efforts of the European Union to reduce tobacco consumption should be supported also by Austria. For this purpose the tobacco prevention fund - similar to the regulation in Switzerland - would give the financial background.",M2

METHODS: Using financial and administrative data on 163 municipalities, the authors estimated logit models of local governments' participation in the anti-smoking programme as a function of the proportion of local tax revenue that came from the TCT and a set of control variables, namely local socioeconomic characteristics and the size of the staff in the local public health centre (PHC). FINDINGS: Local governments that derived a greater percentage of their local tax revenue from the TCT, particularly those that ranked in the upper fourth in terms of this percentage, were less likely to participate in the anti-smoking programme. Insufficient staff in the PHC was also found to be associated with lower participation in the anti-smoking programme. CONCLUSION: Local governments' dependence on revenue from the TCT may be a deterrent to tobacco control in the Republic of Korea.",M2

METHODS: Cross-sectional and panel data from Denmark from 2003 to 2006 were analyzed. Samples were collected by telephone interviews using random digit dialing. RESULTS: Panel data for Denmark revealed that alcohol consumption remained relatively stable. Similar results were found in the Danish cross-sectional data. It appears that 'substitution' rather than increased importation occurred. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to support earlier research stating that decreased prices and increased availability is related to higher alcohol consumption. This could be partly because (1) Denmark has reached a 'saturation' level of consumption over the past 30 years and (2) the survey mode of data collection did not capture specific subpopulations who might have increased their consumption. It may be necessary to examine other indicators of alcohol use or alcohol-related harm in order to fully assess the consequences of such changes in alcohol availability.",M2

Evidence from the self-employed.This paper estimates the effect of recent federal and state level increases in the deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed individuals, which reduced the after-<e>tax</e> price of health insurance, on both the take-up of coverage and the amount of insurance purchased. Using a panel of tax returns filed by self-employed taxpayers from 1999 to 2004, we estimate a take-up elasticity of -0.316 overall, with significantly higher elasticities for single taxpayers. On the intensive margin, we find an elasticity of -0.733 overall.",M2
19699437,"Associations between state-level soda taxes and adolescent body mass index.PURPOSE: Soft drink consumption has been linked with higher energy intake, obesity, and poorer health. Fiscal pricing policies such as soda taxes may lower soda consumption and, in turn, reduce weight among U.S. adolescents. METHODS: This study used multivariate linear regression analyses to examine the associations between state-level grocery store and vending machine soda taxes and adolescent body mass index (BMI). We used repeated cross-sections of individual-level data on adolescents drawn from the Monitoring the Future surveys combined with state-level <e>tax</e> data and local area contextual measures for the years 1997 through 2006. RESULTS: The results showed no statistically significant associations between state-level soda taxes and adolescent BMI. Only a weak economic and statistically significant effect was found between vending machine soda tax rates and BMI among teens at risk for overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Current state-level tax rates are not found to be significantly associated with adolescent weight outcomes. It is likely that taxes would need to be raised substantially to detect significant associations between taxes and adolescent weight.",M2

19662827,"The impact of cigarette taxes and advertising on the demand for cigarettes in Ukraine.BACKGROUND: Cigarette consumption in Ukraine is increasing while the cigarettes are becoming more affordable due to low taxes and raising income. The impact of cigarette prices and taxes on cigarette consumption is unclear due to the limited research evidence using the local data. This study estimates the sensitivity of Ukraine population to cigarette prices and the affordability of cigarettes using the macro level data in order to predict the effectiveness of cigarette <e>tax</e> policy. METHODS: Monthly time-series data available from 1997 to 2006 in Ukraine were used to estimate the generalized least square model with an AR(1) process to investigate the impact of cigarette price/tax, household income, the affordability of cigarettes and the volume of tobacco advertising on Ukraine domestic cigarette sales while controlling for other factors. RESULTS: Our analyses demonstrate a strong positive association between cigarette sales and household income as well as a strong positive association between cigarette sales and tobacco advertising activity. The population is found to have relatively low sensitivity to cigarette prices and cigarette taxes, but the impact of cigarettes' affordability is statistically significant, even though also of low magnitude. CONCLUSION: We speculate that the lower sensitivity to cigarette prices among Ukraine population is caused by wide price variation allowing smokers to avoid a price increase by brand substitution as well as by low costs of cigarettes, high social acceptance of smoking and limited effort to control tobacco use in Ukraine. Narrowing the cigarette price choices and increasing cigarette prices above the level of inflation and income growth by adopting the appropriate tax policy would likely increase the effectiveness of this tool for controlling the smoking rate in Ukraine as well as yield additional budget revenue gains. In addition, imposing advertising restriction may further help reducing the smoking prevalence.",M2

19591750,"Union women, the tobacco industry, and excise taxes: a lesson in unintended consequences.Between 1987 and 1997, the tobacco industry used the issue of cigarette excise <e>tax</e> increases to create a political partnership with the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), a group representing female trade unionists in the U.S. This paper documents how the industry created this relationship and the lessons tobacco-control advocates can learn from the industry's example, in order to mitigate possible unintended consequences of advocating excise tax increases. In 1998, under the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, the tobacco industry began making documents produced in litigation available publicly. Currently, approximately 50 million pages are available online, including substantial documentation of the industry-CLUW relationship. For this study, a comprehensive search of these documents was conducted. The tobacco industry encouraged CLUW's opposition to excise tax increases by emphasizing the economic regressivity of these taxes, discussing excise taxes generically to deflect attention from cigarettes, and encouraging opposition to earmarking cigarette taxes to pay for specific programs. In addition, CLUW received at least $221,500 in financial support between 1987 and 1997 and in-kind support for its conferences, membership materials, and other services. Excise tax increases, if pursued without considering the impacts they may have on low-SES populations, may have unintended consequences. In this case, such proposals may have helped to create a relationship between CLUW and the tobacco industry. Because excise taxes are endorsed in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, tobacco-control advocates must understand how to build relationships with low-SES populations and mitigate potential alliances with the tobacco industry.",M2

This paper describes the tobacco excise structure in Indonesia from 2007 to 2009. The design of the tobacco excise system contributes to neutralizing the effect of a <e>tax</e> increase on consumption. Wide gaps in tax rates allow for the availability of low-priced products, and consumers can substitute to cheaper products in response to price increases. There has been no systematic increase in the tax rates, which promotes affordable of tobacco products. Firms can reduce their prices at point of sale and absorb the tax increase instead of passing it onto consumers. Tiered tax rates by production scale allow firms to evade paying the highest tax brackets legally, thereby increasing profit margins while reducing prices at point of sale. Increases in tobacco excise rates in Indonesia may not have a large health impact under the current system of tax administration.",M2

19580218,"The 2009 Health Confidence Survey: public opinion on health reform varies; strong support for insurance market reform and public plan option, mixed response to <e>tax</e> cap.PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HEALTH REFORM: Findings from the 2009 Health Confidence Survey--the 12th annual HCS--indicate that Americans have already formed strong opinions regarding various aspects of health reform, even before details have been released regarding various key factors. These issues include health insurance market reform, the availability of a public plan option, mandates on employers and individuals, subsidized coverage for the low-income population, changes to the tax treatment of job-based health benefits, and regulatory oversight of health care. These opinions may change as details surface, especially as they concern financing options. In the absence of such details, the 2009 HCS finds generally strong support for the concepts of health reform options that are currently on the table. U.S. HEALTH SYSTEM GETS POOR MARKS, BUT SO DOES A MAJOR OVERHAUL: A majority rate the nation's health care system as fair (30 percent) or poor (29 percent). Only a small minority rate it excellent (6 percent) or very good (10 percent). While 14 percent of Americans think the health care system needs a major overhaul, 51 percent agree with the statement  there are some good things about our health care system, but major changes are needed.  NATIONAL HEALTH PLAN ELEMENTS RATED HIGHLY: Between 68 percent and 88 percent of Americans either strongly or somewhat support health reform ideas such as national health plans, a public plan option, guaranteed issue, expansion of Medicare and Medicaid, and employer and individual mandates. MIXED REACTION TO HEALTH BENEFITS TAX CAP: Reaction to capping the current tax exclusion of employment-based health benefits is mixed. Nearly one-half of Americans (47 percent) would switch to a lower-cost plan if the tax exclusion were capped, 38 percent would stay on their current plan and pay the additional taxes, and 9 percent don't know. CONTINUED FAITH IN EMPLOYMENT-BASED BENEFITS, BUT DOUBTS ON AFFORDABILITY: Individuals with employment-based health benefits are confident that employers will continue to offer such benefits. They are much less confident that they would be able to afford coverage on their own, even if employers gave them the money they currently spend on health benefits. However, were employers to stop offering coverage, respondents report that they are likely to purchase it on their own. RISING HEALTH COSTS HURTING FAMILY FINANCES: Those experiencing health cost increases tend to say these increases have negatively affected their household finances. In particular, they indicate that increased health care costs have resulted in a decrease in contributions to a retirement plan (32 percent) and other savings (53 percent) and in difficulty paying for basic necessities (29 percent) and other bills (37 percent). COSTS ALSO AFFECTING HEALTH CARE USE: Many consumers report they are changing the way they use the health care system in response to rising health care costs. Roughly 80 percent of those with higher out-of-pocket expenses say these increased costs have led them to try to take better care of themselves and choose generic drugs more often. One-quarter also say they did not fill or skipped does of their prescribed medications in response to increased costs.",M2
19560605,"Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies and programmes to reduce the harm caused by alcohol.This paper reviews the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies and programmes to reduce the harm caused by alcohol, in the areas of education and information, the health sector, community action, driving while under the influence of alcohol (drink-driving), availability, marketing, pricing, harm reduction, and illegally and informally produced alcohol. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that policies regulating the environment in which alcohol is marketed (particularly its price and availability) are effective in reducing alcohol-related harm. Enforced legislative measures to reduce drink-driving and individually directed interventions to already at-risk drinkers are also effective. However, school-based education does not reduce alcohol-related harm, although public information and education-type programmes have a role in providing information and in increasing attention and acceptance of alcohol on political and public agendas. Making alcohol more expensive and less available, and banning alcohol advertising, are highly cost-effective strategies to reduce harm. In settings with high amounts of unrecorded production and consumption, increasing the proportion of alcohol that is taxed could be a more effective pricing policy than a simple increase in <e>tax</e>.",M2

19483200,"Modelling income group differences in the health and economic impacts of targeted food taxes and subsidies.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects, by income group, of targeted food taxes and subsidies on nutrition, health and expenditure in the UK. METHODS: A model based on consumption data and demand elasticity was constructed to predict the effects of four food taxation-subsidy regimens. Resulting changes in demand, expenditure, nutrition, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality were estimated. Data Expenditure data were taken from the Expenditure and Food Survey; estimates of price elasticities of demand for food were taken from a report based on the National Food Survey 1988-2000. Estimates of effect on CVD and cancer mortality of changing fat, salt, fruit and vegetable intake were taken from previous meta-analyses. RESULTS: (i) Taxing principal sources of dietary saturated fat is unlikely to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer mortality. (ii) Taxing 'less healthy' foods (defined by the WXYfm nutrient profiling model) could increase CVD and cancer deaths by 35-1300 yearly. (iii) Taxing 'less healthy' foods and subsidising fruits and vegetables by 17.5% could avert up to 2900 CVD and cancer deaths yearly. (iv) Taxing 'less healthy' foods and using all <e>tax</e> revenue to subsidize fruits and vegetables could avert up to 6400 CVD and cancer deaths yearly. Few obesity-related CVD deaths are averted by any of the regimens. All four regimens would be economically regressive and positive health effects will not necessarily be greater in lower-income groups where the need for dietary improvement is higher. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted food tax combined with the appropriate subsidy on fruits and vegetables could reduce deaths from CVD and cancer.",M2
19478719,"Federal and state cigarette excise taxes - United States, 1995-2009.On April 1, 2009, the largest federal cigarette excise <e>tax</e> increase in history went into effect, bringing the combined federal and average state excise tax for cigarettes to $2.21 per pack and achieving the Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) objective (27-21a) to increase the combined federal and average state cigarette excise tax to at least $2 per pack. This report summarizes changes in the federal excise tax, as well as state excise taxes for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) from December 31, 1995 to April 1, 2009. The findings indicate that the federal excise tax increased from 24 cents per pack in 1995 to $1.01 per pack in 2009, and the average state excise tax increased from 32.7 cents per pack to $1.20 per pack during the same period. These increases represent a 321% increase in the federal excise tax and a 267% increase in the average state excise tax since 1995. Price increases should be combined with other evidence-based policy and clinical interventions to meet HP2010 objectives to decrease smoking prevalence and reduce the burden from smoking-attributable death and disease.",M2

Recent advances have broadened the indications to include younger, working-age patients. Despite these benefits, there are often long waits for this procedure in Canada. Furthermore, there exists little documentation of the ability of patients waiting for THA to maintain employment or perform their occupational duties. METHODS: I prospectively identified patients younger than 65 years from a primary hip-replacement surgery waiting list. The study coordinator contacted patients by phone and asked them to participate; if they agreed, we mailed them a validated questionnaire. To compare working with nonworking patients, I used univariate analysis and logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 84 of the 100 patients who agreed to participate returned the questionnaire. While awaiting THA, 20% of patients who considered themselves to be in the workforce were off work owing to their hip conditions. Work cessation resulted in a median drop in income of $15,000 CDN and forgone <e>tax</e> revenues of $3800. Poor hip function was related to both lowered productivity and work cessation before surgery. Patients with an Oxford 12 hip score of 50 or worse appeared to have about a 50% chance of stopping work before THA, whereas those with a score of 40 or better appeared to have only a 10% chance of stopping work. CONCLUSION: About 20% of patients in the workforce who are awaiting THA are off work owing to their hip conditions while on the waiting list. Poor hip function is associated with work cessation and decreased productivity.",M2

Much debate surrounds the utility of alcohol taxation as a measure to reduce alcohol-related harm. However, the harms resulting from alcohol misuse in Australia are at unacceptable levels and action to reduce them is overdue. There is good evidence from Australia and internationally that taxation and price measures are among the most effective and cost-effective in reducing alcohol consumption and related harms. Recent alcohol sales data give an early indication that the alcopops tax is being effective in reducing consumption. Current alcohol tax policy is unwieldy and not well directed towards improving public health. A proportion of tax revenues dedicated to alcohol programs would assist public acceptance of the measures. A broad review of alcohol taxation policy is needed as part of a comprehensive approach to alcohol problems in Australia.",M2

DESIGN: A review of published research and routinely available data. SETTING: Finland. MEASUREMENTS: Prices of alcoholic beverages, recorded and unrecorded alcohol consumption, data on criminality and other police statistics, alcohol-related deaths and hospitalizations, service use. FINDINGS: Alcohol consumption increased 10% in 2004, clearly more than in the early 2000s. With few exceptions, alcohol-related harms increased. Alcohol-induced liver disease deaths increased the most, by 46% in 2004-06 compared to 2001-03, which indicates a strong effect on pre-2004 heavy drinkers. Consumption and harms increased most among middle-aged and older segments of the population, and harms in the worst-off parts of the population in particular. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol taxation and alcohol prices affect consumption and related harms, and heavy drinkers are responsive to price. In Finland in 2004, the worst-off parts of the population paid the highest price in terms of health for cuts in alcohol prices. The removal of travellers' import quotas, which was an inherent part of creating the single European market, had serious public health consequences in Finland.",M2
19329203,"The impact of <e>tax</e> reforms designed to encourage healthier grain consumption.In this paper, we simulate the effects of tax reforms aimed at encouraging healthier grain consumption. We use a rich data set on household grain consumption in 2003 from the market research institute GfK Sweden, combined with information on the nutritional content of the consumption. We estimate behavioral parameters, which are used to simulate the impact on the average household of tax reforms entailing either a subsidy on commodities particularly rich in fiber or a subsidy of the fiber density in grain products. Our results suggest that to direct the fiber intake towards nutritional recommendations, reforms with a substantial impact on consumer prices are required. Regardless of the type of subsidy implemented, the increase in the intake of fiber is accompanied by unwanted increases in nutrients that are often overconsumed: fat, salt and sugar. Funding the subsidies by taxing these nutrients, or less healthy commodities, helps to counteract such developments.",M2

This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (<e>tax</e> or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. METHODS: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. FINDINGS: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low-socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The limited existing evidence suggests that small taxes or subsidies are not likely to produce significant changes in BMI or obesity prevalence but that nontrivial pricing interventions may have some measurable effects on Americans' weight outcomes, particularly for children and adolescents, low-SES populations, and those most at risk for overweight. Additional research is needed to be able to draw strong policy conclusions regarding the effectiveness of fiscal-pricing interventions aimed at reducing obesity.",M2

Business leaders from the industries that make these products currently try to frame these negative outcomes as 'collateral damage' that is someone else's problem. That framing is not only morally objectionable, but also overlooks the possibility that, with proper prodding, industry could substantially mitigate these public health disasters. A promising regulatory tool called 'performance-based regulation' is a new approach to combating the problem. Simply put, performance-based regulation would impose a legal obligation on manufacturers to reduce their negative social costs. Rather than suing the firms for damages, or telling them how they should run their businesses differently (as typical 'command and control' regimes do), performance-based regulation allows the firms to determine how best to decrease today's negative public health consequences. Like other public health strategies, performance-based regulation shifts the focus away from individual consumers on to those who are far more likely to achieve real public health gains. Analogous to a <e>tax</e> on causing harm that exceeds a threshold level, performance-based regulation seeks to harness private initiative in pursuit of the public good.",M2

We estimated prevalence and identified correlates of purchasing contraband cigarettes on reserves; we also quantified the share of contraband purchased on reserves relative to reported total cigarette consumption and the associated financial impact on taxation revenue. DESIGN: Data from the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a regionally stratified representative population telephone survey that over-samples smokers. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1382 adult current smokers. MEASUREMENTS: Reported status of purchasing cigarettes on reserves and the quantity of cigarettes bought on reserves. The prevalence of purchasing cigarettes on reserves was assessed with descriptive statistics. A two-part model was used to analyse correlates of having recently purchased contraband. FINDINGS: A total of 25.8% reported recent purchasing and 11.5% reported usual purchasing. Heavy smoking, having no plans to quit and lower education were correlated with recent purchasing. Heavy smoking and not having plans to quit were also correlated with buying more packs of cigarettes on reserves. Contraband purchases on reserves accounted for 14.0% of the reported total cigarette consumption and resulted in an estimated <e>tax</e> loss of $122.2 million. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial purchasing of contraband cigarettes on reserves in Ontario, resulting in significant losses in tax revenues. The availability of these cheap cigarettes undermines the effectiveness of tobacco taxation to reduce smoking. Wherever indicated, governments should strengthen their contraband prevention and control measures, as recommended by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to ensure that tobacco taxation achieves its intended health benefits and that tax revenues are protected.",M2
