20523064,"Basophil activation marker CD203c is useful in the diagnosis of hen's egg and cow's <e>milk</e> allergies in children.BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of food allergy (FA) is usually based on oral food challenge tests (OFC). However, OFCs occasionally induce severe adverse reactions. CD203c expression on basophils is emerging as a potential diagnostic index. We evaluated whether CD203c expression on basophils would be a useful marker of OFC-associated symptoms in hen's egg and cow's milk allergies in children. METHODS: Seventy-one patients who had been diagnosed with FA based on OFCs or a convincing history of FA symptoms in the Department of Pediatrics, Sagamihara National Hospital, were recruited. CD203c expression was assessed after stimulation with antigens (egg white, ovomucoid, milk or casein) using allergenicity kits. The CD203c stimulation index (SI = the allergen-induced CD203c expression level divided by the baseline expression level) and the threshold of CD203c expression (the minimum concentration of antigen to induce CD203c SI &gt;or=2) were analyzed in association with tolerance acquisition. RESULTS: For the CD203c SI, the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were 0.72 for egg white, 0.82 for ovomucoid, 0.84 for milk and 0.67 for casein. The positive predictive value for the threshold of CD203c expression was 94.7% for egg white, 100% for ovomucoid, 85.7% for milk and 75.0% for casein. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of food antigen-induced CD203c expression on basophils is useful to determine if children will outgrow FA as well as in decision making regarding whether or not to perform OFCs.",M1
20527578,"Salt fluoridation: a meta-analysis of its efficacy for caries prevention.The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the caries preventive effect of Salt fluoridation (SF) in the permanent dentition in children. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO COMPARE: (1) the caries preventive effects of SF versus no exposure in different age cohorts (6-8; 9-12; and 13-15 years old); (2) SF versus other community based interventions (<e>milk</e> or water fluoridation [WF]). METHODS: 9 English and 2 non-English databases were searched for papers that reported on the caries preventive effect of groups (with controls) that were exposed to SF in the form of mean DMFT scores with standard deviations. Differences in exposed and nonexposed groups were computed on the basis of weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For 6-8 year olds, the pooled reduction in DMFT scores was -0.98 [95% CI: -1.68 to -0.29]; for 9-12 year olds, it was -2.13 [95% CI: -2.55 to -1.70] and for the 13-15 year old groups, -4.22 [95% CI: -6.84 to -1.55]. All the analyses favoured the SF groups (p &lt;0.001). For SF versus WF, there was no difference (-0.11 reduction [95% CI: -0.29 to +0.07]). CONCLUSION: Within limitations, the pooled estimates of the WMDs for the different age cohorts favoured SF versus no exposure.",M1
20497785,"Psychosocial factors influencing calcium intake and bone quality in middle school girls.Calcium intake has been associated with promoting bone health in children and adolescents, thus preventing osteoporosis later in life. Behavior change such as increased calcium intake, as well as physiological factors such as bone quality, may be facilitated by psychosocial and environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to identify pathways by which psychosocial factors influence calcium intake and bone quality in middle school girls. The study design was cross-sectional. Baseline data from the Incorporating More Physical Activity and Calcium in Teens (IMPACT) study, collected in 2001-2003, were used. IMPACT was a 1.5-year nutrition and physical activity intervention study, designed to improve bone density in 717 middle school girls in Texas. Main outcome measures were calcium intake determined using mean milligrams of calcium consumed per day and number of glasses of <e>milk</e> consumed per day, and bone quality determined using a calcaneal stiffness index. Confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were performed to identify the direct and indirect pathways used by various psychosocial factors such as knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and milk availability at home, to influence calcium intake and bone quality. Results showed that knowledge of osteoporosis and calcium-rich foods had an indirect effect on calcium intake, with outcome expectations as the mediating variable (beta=.035 and beta=.03, respectively; P&lt;0.05). Calcium self-efficacy had a significant indirect effect on calcium intake, with outcome expectations as the mediator (beta=.085, P&lt;0.05). None of the variables significantly influenced bone quality. Thus, several direct and indirect pathways used to influence calcium intake among adolescent girls were identified. These findings are critical for the development of effective interventions to promote calcium intake in this population.",M1
20496828,"[New infection rate of bovine mammary glands after application of an internal teat seal at dry off]The internal teat sealant OrbeSeal (Pfizer Animal Health) should prevent new IMI throughout the dry period. The aim of our field studies was to determine the efficacy of infusion with an internal teat seal at dry off in reducing new intramammary infections during the dry period in relation to an untreated control. In experiment 1 128 cows were enrolled from 24 dairy herds in Lower Saxony. Prior to final milking, all quarters were sampled for bacteriological culture and SCC analysis in three weekly intervals. After final milking, all 4 quarters of test group animals were infused with a commercially available internal teat seal. Following calving quarter <e>milk</e> samples were collected between 1 to 3 DIM and again between 8 to 10 and 15 to 17 DIM for culture and SCC analysis. The rate of new IMI during the dry period was 7.4% of quarters in the OrbeSeal-group and 12.7% in the control group, resp. In experiment 2 the new infection rate of udder quarters treated with OrbeSeal was evaluated in a split udder design with 93 cows healthy on all four udder quarters from six dairy farms in North Germany. In this study the front right and rear left udder quarters were treated, while both other quarters served as control. Applied methods occurred like in experiment 1. Here a new infection rate of 2.8% (OrbeSeal group) and in the control group a new infection rate of 11.5% was reached (P &lt; 0.05).",M1
20484449,"Biomarkers of <e>milk</e> fat and the risk of myocardial infarction in men and women: a prospective, matched case-control study.BACKGROUND: High intakes of saturated fat have been associated with cardiovascular disease, and milk fat is rich in saturated fat. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the serum milk fat biomarkers pentadecanoic acid (15:0), heptadecanoic acid (17:0), and their sum (15:0+17:0) and a first myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: The study design was a prospective case-control study nested within a large population-based cohort in Sweden. Included in the study were 444 cases (307 men) and 556 controls (308 men) matched on sex, age, date of examination, and geographic region. Clinical, anthropometric, biomarker fatty acid, physical activity, and dietary data were collected. The odds of a first MI were investigated by using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In women, proportions of milk fat biomarkers in plasma phospholipids were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in controls than in cases and were, in general, negatively, albeit weakly, correlated with risk factors for metabolic syndrome. The crude standardized odds ratios of becoming an MI case were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.94) in women and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.1) in men. After multivariable adjustment for confounders, the inverse association remained in both sexes and was significant in women. In agreement with biomarker data, quartiles of reported intake of cheese (men and women) and fermented milk products (men) were inversely related to a first MI (P for trend &lt; 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Milk fat biomarkers were associated with a lower risk of developing a first MI, especially in women. This was partly confirmed in analysis of fermented milk and cheese intake. Components of metabolic syndrome were observed as potential intermediates for the risk relations.",M1
20480913,"Determination of trans vitamin K1 in infant and medical nutritional products using AOAC Method 999.15 with modified preparation and extraction procedures and C30 bonded phase chromatography: single-laboratory validation.Modifications were made to AOAC Official Method 999.15 to extend its applicability to specialty infant formulas containing hydrolyzed proteins and free amino acids, and to medical and adult nutritional products. Minor changes to the sample preparation procedure and chromatographic separation improved vitamin K1 recoveries and reduced chromatographic interferences in these types of matrixes. Currently AOAC Method 999.15 is applicable only to the determination of total vitamin K1 (phylloquione) in infant formula and <e>milk</e> (fluid, ready-to-feed, and powdered) containing &gt; 1 microg vitamin K1/100 g solids. AOAC Method 999.15 recoveries of vitamin K1 were improved by altering sample sizes, extraction solvents and amounts, and the reagent addition order and amount of water or aqueous solutions added. The chromatographic separation of vitamin K1 in medical nutritional products containing canola and marine oils was improved, and trans vitamin K1 was separated from the biologically inactive cis isomer in all products with a C30 3 microm column and a 100% methanol mobile phase. With these modifications to the extraction procedure and chromatographic separation, AOAC Method 999.15 demonstrated acceptable precision and accuracy for the quantitation of trans vitamin K1 in specialty infant formulas containing hydrolyzed proteins and free amino acids, and medical and adult nutritional products. A single-laboratory validation of these minor modifications was completed. Fourteen different product matrixes were analyzed during validation. The intermediate precision averaged 4.15% RSD (range 2.52-5.81% RSD), and recovery data averaged 100.1% (range 92.2-109%).",M1
20480910,"Determination of immunoglobulin G in bovine colostrum and <e>milk</e> powders, and in dietary supplements of bovine origin by protein G affinity liquid chromatography: collaborative study.An AOAC collaborative study was conducted to evaluate an affinity LC procedure for measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG) in selected dairy powders. The powders were extracted with 0.15 M sodium chloride solution and the pH was adjusted to 4.6 to precipitate caseins, which would otherwise lead to an overestimation of IgG. The analyte was then bound to a commercially available Protein G affinity cartridge and selectively eluted with a glycine buffer at pH 2.5. Detection was at 280 nm and quantification was made against a calibration curve prepared from bovine serum IgG. The samples analyzed included the likely matrixes for which this assay will find commercial use, namely, high- and low-protein-content colostrum powders, tablets containing colostrum powder, and some IgG-containing dairy powders; milk protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, and skim milk powder. Eleven laboratories provided data for the study and assayed blind duplicates of six materials. The repeatability RSD values ranged from 2.1 to 4.2% and the reproducibility RSD values ranged from 6.4 to 18.5%. The Protein G method with casein removal has adequate reproducibility for measuring IgG in colostrum-derived powders that are traded on the basis of IgG content as a colostral marker.",M1
20480905,"Detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B in <e>milk</e> and milk products using immunodiagnostic lateral flow devices.Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is an extracellular pyrotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a known etiologic agent of food poisoning in humans. Lateral flow immunochromatographic devices (LFDs) designed for the environmental detection of SEB were adapted for use in this study to detect SEB in milk containing 2% fat, chocolate-flavored milk, and milk-derived products such as yogurt, infant formula, and ice cream. The advantage of using LFDs in these particular food products was its ease and speed of use with no additional extraction methods needed. No false positives were observed with any of the products used in this study. Dilution of the samples overcame the Hook effect and permitted capillary flow into the membrane. Thus, semisolid products such as ice cream and some yogurts, and products containing thickeners needed to be diluted using a phosphate-buffered saline-based buffer, pH 7.2. SEB was easily detected at concentrations of 5 microg/mL and 500 ng/mL when the LFDs were used. SEB was also reliably detected at concentrations below 5 and 0.25 ng/mL, which may induce serious disease.",M1
20480893,"Second-derivative spectrometric determination of urea in <e>milk</e> using the diacetyl monoxime reagent.The application of derivative spectrometry to resolve overlapping spectra and improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the colorimetric determination of urea in milk using diacetyl monoxime is presented. With first-derivative (1D) spectrometry, the lambda(max) of the colored complex was established to be 525 nm. The absorption band at lambda(max) = 525 nm in normal absorption (0D) spectrometry was resolved into three clearly distinct spectral bands with minima at 497, 530, and 566 nm with second-derivative (2D) spectrometry. With the second-derivative (2D530) technique, the depth of the trough of the strongest signal at 530 nm was used to determine urea in milk samples. Linear calibration curves for urea were obtained over a concentration range of 0.2-1.4 mg/L, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.999. The LOD and LOQ of the method were 0.01 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Recoveries of 99-100% of spiked urea in milk with RSD values below 2.0% were obtained. The second-derivative method is simple, affordable, sensitive, and selective for the determination of urea in milk.",M1
20480889,"Validation procedures for quantitative food allergen ELISA methods: community guidance and best practices.This document provides supplemental guidance on specifications for the development and implementation of studies to validate the performance characteristics of quantitative ELISA methods for the determination of food allergens. It is intended as a companion document to other existing publications on method validation. The guidance is divided into two sections: information to be provided by the method developer on various characteristics of the method, and implementation of a multilaboratory validation study. Certain criteria included in the guidance are allergen-specific. Two food allergens, egg and <e>milk</e>, are used to demonstrate the criteria guidance. These recommendations will be the basis of the harmonized validation protocol for any food allergen ELISA method, whether proprietary or nonproprietary, that will be submitted to AOAC and/or regulatory authorities or other bodies for status recognition. Regulatory authorities may have their own particular requirements for data packages in addition to the guidance in this document.

20480883,"Development and validation of a multiresidue method for the determination of neonicotinoid and macrocyclic lactone pesticide residues in <e>milk</e>, fruits, and vegetables by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/MS/MS.A multiresidue method was developed and validated for the determination of 13 neonicotinoid pesticides and metabolites, and nine macrocyclic lactone pesticides and veterinary drugs using SPE and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/MS/MS. The method was validated in milk, orange, spinach, apple, plum, watermelon, green bean, zucchini, broccoli, strawberry, grape, and tomato by analyzing replicates of residue-free control samples fortified with a mixture of 22 target analytes at three concentration levels. The recoveries of the analytes from the fortified matrixes were mostly within 70-120%, except for some of the neonicotinoid metabolites. The LOD values varied by analyte and matrix and ranged between 0.001-2 ng/g. The developed method was successful in combining two widely different classes of compounds into a single analysis.",M1
20472872,"Seroprevalence and spatial distribution of Fasciola hepatica-infected dairy herds in England and Wales.The seroprevalence of Fasciola hepatica infection in a population of commercial dairy herds in England and Wales was estimated using an ELISA that detected antibodies to F hepatica in bulk tank <e>milk</e>. A total of 3130 milk samples, obtained as convenience samples from two commercial milk-testing laboratories, were tested during the winter of 2006/07. Herds considered to be seropositive were categorised as low positive, medium positive or high positive. A geospatial map was drawn to show the distribution of infected herds and the seroprevalence of exposure at regional level, using the Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics boundaries, and at a finer spatial level defined by postcode area. Overall, 76 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 74 to 77 per cent) of herds carried antibodies to F hepatica; the seroprevalence in England was 72 per cent (95 per cent CI 70 to 74 per cent) and in Wales it was 84 per cent (95 per cent CI 82 to 86 per cent). The highest prevalences of exposure were found in north-west England, where more than 47 per cent of herds were in the high positive exposure category.",M1
20472571,"Maternal and perinatal characteristics and the risk of cow's <e>milk</e> allergy in infants up to 2 years of age: a case-control study nested in the Finnish population.This study examined whether maternal background and perinatal factors were associated with the risk of cow's milk allergy (CMA) in infants up to 2 years of age in a nested case-control study. All children born in 1996-2004 in Finland and diagnosed with CMA by 2006 were identified (n = 16,237). For each case, one matched control was selected. Information on maternal and perinatal factors was derived from the Medical Birth Register. The associations were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. Cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 1.27) and high maternal age (&gt; or =35 years; adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.36) were associated with increased risk, whereas low maternal socioeconomic status (adjusted OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.71), smoking (adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.79), high number of previous deliveries (&gt; or =5; adjusted OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.86), and multiple pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.82) were associated with decreased risk of CMA. In conclusion, maternal background and perinatal factors may play a role in the development of CMA, but further research is needed to clarify these associations and the underpinning biologic mechanisms.",M1
20462154,"Mastitis in dairy buffalo and cattle in Egypt due to Clostridium perfringens: prevalence, incidence, risk factors and costs.Although Clostridium perfringens is recognised as an important cause of clostridial enteric diseases, there is only limited knowledge about the association of particular C. perfringens toxinotypes (types A to E) with mastitis in domestic animals. In this study, mastitis was detected in 213/623 (34.12%) and 8/83 (9.64%) of the quarter <e>milk</e> samples collected from cases of clinical mastitis in cows and buffalo, respectively. The micro-organism was isolated in an incidence of 16/357 (4.48%) of milk samples from cows and 1/25 (4.0%) of samples from buffalo. Infection in one quarter was the most typical situation found (83% in cows and 87% in buffalo). Clostridium perfringens infection was also correlated to the season, with the highest proportion of isolates being found during spring (10.71%) and winter (7.07%). Using the classical toxin neutralisation typing method, 17 strains, isolated from cow and buffalo milk, were identified as C. perfringens type A, and selected for molecular analysis. Polymerase chain reaction detected the oecpa gene while the P/cpb and e/etx genes went undetected. The authors believe that C. perfringens has the potential to produce disease on its own or to predispose the udder to disease caused by major mastitis and environmental pathogens.",M1
20460680,"Effects of <e>milk</e> powder and its components on texture, yield, and color of a lean poultry meat model system.The effects of whole milk powder, 2 skim milk powders, caseinate, and 2 modified whey proteins (2% protein level in the final product) were evaluated in lean chicken meat batters and compared with controls with and without added lactose. All dairy proteins significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced cook losses when compared against the controls, with the 2 skim milk powders and modified whey-I showing the best results. Hardness and fracturability were also higher for all test batters compared with controls. Skim milk-II showed the highest fracturability value (21.9 vs. 7.1 N for the control) and was also found to be the most cost-effective ingredient for improving moisture binding and texture; skim milk-I and modified whey-I followed behind. Springiness and fracture distance were higher for all of the dairy proteins, except caseinate, indicating a positive contribution to the lean meat system's elasticity. In terms of color, adding the skim milk powders, modified whey-II, and whole milk powder resulted in lighter cooked meat batters as evidenced by the higher L* values and higher spectra curves.",M1

20444956,"Iron-fortified <e>milk</e> and noodle consumption is associated with lower risk of anemia among children aged 6-59 mo in Indonesia.BACKGROUND: Anemia is common among children in developing countries and is associated with decreased cognitive and physical development. Iron-fortified foods may decrease child anemia. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the association between iron-fortified milk and iron-fortified noodle consumption and anemia in children aged 6-59 mo. DESIGN: Consumption of fortified milk and fortified noodles and child anemia were assessed in 81,885 families from rural and 26,653 families from urban slum areas in Indonesia. RESULTS: The proportions of children who received fortified milk and noodles were 30.1% and 22.6%, respectively, in rural families and 40.1% and 48.9%, respectively, in urban families. The prevalence of anemia among children from rural families was 55.9% and from urban families was 60.8%. Children from rural and urban families were less likely to be anemic if they received fortified milk [odds ratio (OR): 0.76; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.80 (P &lt; 0.0001) and OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.86 (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively] but not fortified noodles [OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.09 (P = 0.56) and OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.02 (P = 0.16), respectively] in multiple logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounders. In rural families, the odds of anemia were lower when the child who consumed fortified milk also consumed fortified noodles or when the child who consumed fortified noodles also consumed fortified milk. CONCLUSIONS: In Indonesia, consumption of fortified milk and noodles was associated with decreased odds of child anemia. Iron-fortified milk and noodles may be a strategy that could be applied more widely as an intervention to decrease child anemia.",M1
20443436,"It's all formula to me: women's understandings of toddler <e>milk</e> ads.This study utilised semi-structured interviews to investigate how women expecting a first baby perceived print advertisements for 'toddler milks' in order to determine whether they function as indirect advertising for infant and follow-on formula. Examination of the marketing literature, analysis of the advertisers' websites and the advertisements themselves provided sources of triangulation. Fifteen women expecting a first baby were recruited from antenatal classes conducted by staff of the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service. These respondents clearly understood toddler milk advertisements to be promoting a range of products that included infant and follow-on formula and accepted their claims quite uncritically These claims contradicted public health messages about breastfeeding and the evidence of health risks associated with formula feeding. Toddler milk advertisements appear to function as indirect advertising for infant and follow-on formula. The Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula: Manufacturers' and Importers' Agreement is failing to protect the Australian community from the advertising of breastmilk substitutes as required by World Health Assembly Resolution 33.47, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. Further research is recommended to determine whether the responses of this group of primiparous women from a single area in NSW are representative of the wider population of Australian mothers.",M1
20438510,"A comparative analysis of acceptance by Japanese females and price of goat <e>milk</e> from different sources.A sensory survey was carried out using 4 different types of whole goat milk among middle-class females to investigate consumer acceptability of goat milk and whether there is an opportunity to expand the sale of goat milk products in Japan. Four different types of whole milk powder (domestic concentrate-fed, domestic pasture-fed, USA commercially canned, and New Zealand commercially canned) were used. Fresh cow milk was served as a control. Thirty-one housewives evaluated the 5 liquid milk samples for smell, taste and overall characteristics on a scale of 1 (low) to 3 (high). Chi-square analyses were carried out to detect significant differences between the milk types in each category. The goat milk from the USA was the most preferred goat milk with respect to smell and overall evaluation. Domestic pasture-fed milk received the lowest grade in the evaluation for its 'grassy and goaty' smell. This result shows us that pasture intake affects the taste and smell of powdered milk which gives the lowest evaluation by the participants. If Japanese goat milk producers want to be successful in the domestic goat milk market and compete against goat milk products from other countries, they should improve production methods and flavor of their products.",M1
20434431,"Isolation of bovine <e>milk</e>-derived microvesicles carrying mRNAs and microRNAs.By a series of centrifugation and ultracentrifugation, we could isolate microvesicles with approximately 100 nm in diameter from bovine milk. We also found that approximately 1700 and 1000 ng of total RNA, in which small RNAs were major components, was contained inside the microvesicles isolated from 6 ml of colostrum and mature milk, respectively, despite high RNase activity in the milk. Polyadenylated gene transcripts for major milk proteins and translation elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) were present in the microvesicles, and integrity of some transcripts was confirmed by real-time PCR targeting 5'- and 3'-ends of mRNA and by in vitro translation analysis. Moreover, a considerable amount of mammary gland and immune-related microRNAs were present in the milk-derived microvesicles. Acidification of milk to mimic gastrointestinal tract did not mostly affected RNA yield and quality. The milk related gene transcripts were detected in cultured cells when incubated with milk-derived microvesicles, suggesting cellular uptake of the microvesicle contents including RNA. Our findings suggest that bovine breast milk contains RNAs capable for being transferred to living cells and involved in the development of calf's gastrointestinal and immune systems.",M1
20430131,"First- and second-trimester WIC participation is associated with lower rates of breastfeeding and early introduction of cow's <e>milk</e> during infancy.BACKGROUND: Existing literature suggests prenatal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may reduce breastfeeding among low-income mothers. However, little is known about whether the timing of WIC entrance during pregnancy influences infant feeding decisions. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the association between the timing of prenatal participation in WIC and various infant feeding practices, including breastfeeding initiation, breastfeeding for at least 4 months, exclusive breastfeeding, formula feeding, and early introduction of cow's milk and solid food. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey matching of birth certificate data to mothers' interviews 9 months after the child's birth. Mothers provided information on participation in the WIC program, infant feeding practices, and sociodemographic characteristics. SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of 4,450 births in 2001 from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Birth Cohort. ANALYSES: Multivariate logistic regression techniques (using STATA 9.0 SE, Stata Company, College Station, TX) estimated the relationship between the timing of prenatal WIC participation and infant feeding practices. RESULTS: Entry into the WIC program during the first or second trimester of pregnancy is associated with reduced likelihood of initiation of breastfeeding and early cow's milk introduction; and entry during the first trimester is associated with reduced duration of breastfeeding. WIC participation at any trimester is positively related to formula feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal WIC participation is associated with a greater likelihood of providing babies infant formula rather than breastmilk after birth. Findings also indicate that there are critical prenatal periods for educating women about the health risks of early cow's milk introduction. Given the health implications of feeding infants cow's milk too early, WIC may be successful in educating women on the health risks of introducing complementary foods early, even if direct counseling on cow's milk is not provided.",M1
20426226,"Vitamin D status of Canadians as measured in the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem, but little is known about the vitamin D status of Canadians. DATA AND METHODS: The data are from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey, which collected blood samples. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means) were used to estimate 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations among a sample of 5,306 individuals aged 6 to 79 years, representing 28.2 million Canadians from all regions, by age group, sex, racial background, month of blood collection, and frequency of <e>milk</e> consumption. The prevalence of deficiency and the percentages of the population meeting different cut-off concentrations were assessed. RESULTS: The mean concentration of 25(OH)D for the Canadian population aged 6 to 79 years was 67.7 nmol/L. The mean was lowest among men aged 20 to 39 years (60.7 nmol/L) and highest among boys aged 6 to 11 (76.8 nmol/L). Deficiency (less than 27.5 nmol/L) was detected in 4% of the population. However, 10% of Canadians had concentrations considered inadequate for bone health (less than 37.5 nmol/L) according to 1997 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Standards (currently under review). Concentrations measured in November-March were below those measured in April-October. White racial background and frequent milk consumption were significantly associated with higher concentrations. INTERPRETATION: As measured by plasma 25(OH)D, 4% of Canadians aged 6 to 79 years were vitamin D-deficient, according to 1997 IOM standards (currently under review). Based on these standards, 10% of the population had inadequate concentrations for bone health.",M1

Polymorphic information content, effective number of alleles and heterozygosity of these microsatellite loci were determined. Relationships of the three microsatellite loci with enzyme activities and daily milk yields in Holstein cows were analyzed by least squares linear model. The results showed significant correlations of the three microsatellite loci with their corresponding enzyme activities and daily milk yield in summer and fall (Plt;0.05). The least square means of GSH-Px activities and daily milk yields for BMS2258 (182 bp/164 bp), SOD activities for SOD1 (148 bp/148 bp), and daily milk yields for SOD1 (148 bp/146 bp), Na+/K+-ATPase activities and daily milk yields for BM723 (161 bp/111 bp) were relatively higher. These genotypes were the most favorable genotypes for enzyme activity and daily milk yields in summer and fall, which could be references for marker assisted selection in heat resistance traits in dairy cattle.",M1
20417392,"Enumeration of coagulase and thermonuclease-positive Staphylococcus spp. in raw <e>milk</e> and fresh soft cheese: an evaluation of Baird-Parker agar, Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen agar and the Petrifilm Staph Express count system.Staphylococcus spp. are microorganisms that are naturally present in milk and dairy products and are often associated with food-borne diseases outbreaks due to the ability of some strains to produce thermostable enterotoxins. This ability is usually associated with coagulase and thermonuclease production, characteristics that are considered in the microbiological analyses for the control of such microorganisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the culture media and the methodologies used for the enumeration of coagulase and thermonuclease-positive Staphylococcus spp. in raw milk and fresh soft cheese. Samples of artificially contaminated milk (with coagulase-positive Staphylococcus reference strains) and samples of naturally contaminated raw milk and cheese were submitted for enumeration in Baird-Parker agar (BP), Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen agar (RPFA) and in the Petrifilm Staph Express count system (STX). No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were observed between the mean counts obtained in all of the evaluated culture media. RPFA and STX had good correlation indices between the total and typical colony counts as well as with coagulase and the thermonuclease-positive colony counts. Thus, there is a better association between coagulase and thermonuclease production to typical colony morphology developed on these culture media, leading to more accurate and reliable results than with BP, which demonstrated lower correlation indices between these counts.",M1
20415192,"[Alimentary factors predisposing to colorectal cancer risk: a prospective epidemiologic study]BACKGROUND: Some foods are incriminated in the genesis of colorectal cancers (CRC), on the other hand, other foods are considered as protectors. AIM: This study aimed to determine the alimentary factors influencing the risk of CRC. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiologic prospective study. We performed firstly a descriptive analysis of the CRC group (32 patients) and we compared this group to a control group of 61 patients subdivided into two subgroups [Non tumoral digestive disease (31 patients) and a subgroup of trauma patients (30 patients)]. Factors, retained by the univariate analysis were introduced into a logistic regression model which identified the independent factors influencing the risk of CRC. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified 12 factors influencing the risk of CRC with p &lt; or = 0.05: age, sex, geographical origin, anemia, addiction to smoking, sport activity, walk, processed meat, <e>milk</e>, fruits, oil and frying. The multivariate analysis identified three factors: age 40/60 years (OR: 5.15), processed meat consumption; frequent/rare (OR: 5.1), milk consumption rare/frequent (OR: 7.07). CONCLUSION: For young people, a frequent consumption of processed meat increases the risk of CRC. However the frequent consumption of milk protects against CRC. We recommend to young people consumption of milk and avoiding frequent consumption of processed meat.",M1
20383242,"Comparison of diagnostic approaches, and a cost-benefit analysis of different diagnostic approaches and treatments of anoestrous dairy cows.AIM: To compare diagnostic techniques, and to assess the economic effects of diagnosing and treating dairy cows not detected in oestrus before the planned start of mating (PSM). METHODS: Cows from 12 herds were defined as anoestrus at Day -9 (where Day 0=PSM) based on presence of tail paint that had been applied at Day -35. The presence of a corpus luteum (CL) was diagnosed by palpation or ultrasonography on Day -9, or by determining the concentration of progesterone (P4) in <e>milk</e> at Days -16 and -9. Cows with concentrations of P4 in milk &gt;1 ng/ml at one or both times were defined as CL+. Cows were randomly assigned to be treated with (a) nothing (Control; n=558); (b) gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on Day -9, prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) on Day -2, and GnRH on Day 0, with set-time artificial insemination (AI) 16-20 h after the second GnRH treatment (Ovsynch; n=553); or (c) as for (b) but with placement of an intravaginal P4-releasing device on Day -9, and removal on Day -2 (Ovsynch+P4; n=551). Cows detected in oestrus between Day -2 and the second GnRH treatment did not receive the second GnRH treatment. Pregnancy diagnosis took place on three occasions, and the date of conception estimated, from which the PSM-to-conception interval was calculated. Agreement between the three diagnostic techniques for CL status was evaluated using Kappa analyses, and sensitivities and specificities were calculated using a Bayesian Monte Carlo approach that does not assume a gold standard. Partial budgets and decision trees were constructed to assess the cost effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: The level of agreement was higher between ultrasonography and concentration of P4 in milk (0.64) than for palpation and ultrasonography or concentration of P4 in milk (0.50 and 0.49, respectively). The Ovsynch+P4 treatment had a higher net benefit than Ovsynch relative to no treatment (NZ$80.40 and NZ$47.50/cow treated, respectively) in the absence of diagnosis of CL status. Following diagnosis, the Ovsynch+P4 treatment remained the most cost-effective option for both CL+ and CL- cows. It was concluded that the Ovsynch+P4 treatment without any diagnostic procedure was the most cost-effective option. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment of anoestrous cows was more cost-effective than no treatment, with Ovsynch+P4 more cost-effective than Ovsynch in cows with or without a CL. Differentiation of anoestrous cows into CL+ and CL- groups for treatment was not cost-effective.",M1
20381889,"The association between bulk tank <e>milk</e> analysis for raw milk quality and on-farm management practices.Our objective was to determine the risk factors associated with bacteriological quality of bulk tank milk. Bulk tank milk samples were collected from all Prince Edward Island dairy herds (n=235) from March 2005 to March 2007. Biweekly total bacterial, preliminary incubation, laboratory pasteurization, and coliform counts were conducted using a Petrifilm culture system. Data for on-farm risk factors were collected via a mail-out survey which consisted of 4 main sections: (1) general farm demographics and management, (2) cow cleanliness and hygiene, (3) milking procedures and mastitis control, and (4) equipment maintenance and cleaning. Of 235 producers, 153 completed the mail-out survey giving a response rate of 65%. Both total aerobic and preliminary incubation counts were positively associated with the amount of soiling on the teats prior to udder preparation, manual cleaning of the bulk tank, and the use of a specific type of detergent. Additionally, various methods of premilking udder preparation were important, with pre-dip followed by drying being superior to other methods in reducing the bacterial counts. The laboratory pasteurization count was positively associated with the presence of a plate cooler and inadequate frequency of acid wash, whereas having a water purification system was negatively associated with laboratory pasteurization count. Finally, coliform count was negatively associated with clipping udder hair and automated washing of the bulk tank, whereas increasing herd size and inadequate frequency of acid wash were risk factors. Season was a significant predictor for all bacterial counts with the lowest counts tending to occur in winter.",M1
20380775,"Effect of CSN1S1 genotype and its interaction with diet energy level on <e>milk</e> production and quality in Girgentana goats fed ad libitum.A study was carried out to evaluate how the energy level of the diet can affect milk production and quality in Girgentana lactating goats in relation to polymorphism at the alphas1-casein (CSN1S1) genotype locus. Twenty-seven goats, homogeneous for milk production (1.5+/-0.3 kg/d), days of lactation (90+/-10 d) and body weight (35.8+/-5.5 kg) were selected on the basis of their CSN1S1 genotype, as follows: nine goats homozygous for strong (AA) alleles, nine goats homozygous for weak alleles (FF) and nine goats heterozygous (AF). The goats were used in a 3x3 factorial arrangement of treatments, with three genotypes (AA, FF, AF) and three diets at different energy levels (100%, 65% and 30% of hay inclusion). The experiment consisted of three simultaneous 3x3 Latin squares for the three genotypes, with one square for each level of hay inclusion in the diet. All the animals were housed in individual pens. Each experimental period lasted 23 d and consisted of 15 d for adaptation and 8 d for data and sample collection, during which the goats received the scheduled diet ad libitum. The animals were fed three different diets designed to have the same crude protein content (about 15%) but different energy levels: a pelleted alfalfa hay (H100) and two feeds including 65% (H65) and 30% (H30) of alfalfa hay (respectively 1099, 1386 and 1590 kcal NE for lactation/kg DM). All the diets were ground and pelleted (6 mm diameter). AA goats were more productive than AF and FF goats (respectively: 1419 v. 1145 and 1014 g/d; P=0.002). Indeed the interaction energy levelxgenotype was significant (P=0.018): in fact AA goats showed their milk increase only when fed with concentrates. Differences in protein and in casein levels between the three genotypes were in line with results expected from the different allele contribution to alphas1-casein synthesis. Milk urea levels were significantly lower in AA goats compared with AF and FF genotypes (respectively 32.7 v. 40.4 and 40.4 mg/dl; P=0.049) and significantly lower when goats were fed with 65H and 30H diets than with 100H diet (respectively 37.4 and 34.3 v. 41.7 mg/dl; P&lt;0.001). Indeed, a significant interaction genotypexdiet (P=0.043) occurred for milk urea, which was significantly lower in AA goats but only when fed with concentrates (65H and 30H). Blood concentrations of energy indicators (glucose, non-esterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyric acid) were not influenced by genotype. The results confirm that strong alleles are associated with a greater efficiency of feed utilization and seem to show that a high energy level of the diet can further improve this efficiency.",M1
20380773,"Growth hormone alters lipid composition and increases the abundance of casein and lactalbumin mRNA in the MAC-T cell line.The MAC-T cell line has been used extensively to investigate bovine mammary epithelial cell function. A lactogenic phenotype is generally induced in this cell line by a combination of dexamethasone, insulin and prolactin and has typically been assessed by <e>milk</e> protein production. Few studies have focused on identifying other factors that may affect milk protein synthesis in the MAC-T cell line, and none have considered the lipid class distribution of MAC-T cells as a component of the lactogenic phenotype. Growth hormone (GH) has been shown to increase milk protein synthesis both in vivo and in mammary cell models, and has been shown to alter the lipogenic profile of mammary explant models. We tested the hypothesis that MAC-T cells would respond directly to GH and that the response would include alterations to the lipid class distribution as well as to milk protein gene expression, leading to a more appropriate model for mammary cell function than treatment with dexamethasone, insulin and prolactin alone. Differentiated cells expressed GH receptor mRNA, and addition of GH to the differentiation medium significantly induced production of alpha-s1 casein and alpha-lactalbumin mRNA. GH also significantly affected the proportion of triacylglycerol and sphingomyelin. These results indicate that GH is an important factor in inducing a lactogenic phenotype in the MAC-T cell line, and support the possibility of a direct effect of GH on milk synthesis in vivo.",M1
20380772,"Genetic variation at the goat hormone-sensitive lipase ( LIPE) gene and its association with <e>milk</e> yield and composition.Hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of energy balance by releasing free fatty acids from adipose triacylglycerol stores. These fatty acids can be subsequently transferred to other body compartments to be oxidized or employed in other biochemical reactions. This enzymic function is particularly important in lactating animals because the synthesis of milk components involves the mobilization of lipid depots to satisfy the large energy demands of the mammary gland. In the current study, we partially sequenced the goat LIPE gene in several individuals. In doing so, we identified two synonymous polymorphisms at exons 2 (c.327C&gt;A&gt;T, triallelic polymorphism) and 3 (c.558C&gt;T). Moreover, we found a mis-sense polymorphism at exon 6 (c.1162G&gt;T) that involves an alanine to serine substitution at position 388. Analysis with Polyphen and Panther softwares revealed that this amino acid replacement is expected to be neutral. Performance of an association analysis with a variety of milk traits revealed that goat LIPE genotype has highly suggestive effects on milk yield (P=0.0032) as well as on C18:3 n-6g (P=0.0051), trans-10 cis-12 CLA (P=0.007) and C12:0 (P=0.0084) milk contents. These associations are concordant with the preference of LIPE to selectively mobilize medium-chain and unsaturated fatty acids.",M1
20379889,"Characterization of casein gene complex and genetic diversity analysis in Indian goats.<e>Milk</e> protein polymorphism plays an important role in genetic diversity analysis, phylogenetic studies, establishing geographical diversity, conservation decision, and improving breeding goals. Milk protein polymorphism in Indian goat breeds has not been well studied; therefore, an investigation was carried out to analyze the genetic structure of the casein gene and milk protein diversity at six milk protein loci in nine Indian goat breeds/genetic groups from varied agro-climatic zones. Milk protein genotyping was carried out in 1098 individual milk samples by SDS-PAGE at alphaS1-CN (CSN1S1), beta-CN (CSN2), alphaS2-CN (CSN1S2), kappa-CN (CSN3), beta-LG, and alpha-LA loci. Indian goats exhibited alphaS1-casein A allele in higher frequency in the majority of breeds except Ganjam and local goats. The alphaS1-casein A allele frequencies varied from 0.45 to 0.77. A total of 16 casein haplotypes were observed in seven breeds and breed specific haplotypes were observed with respect to geographic region. The average number of alleles was lowest in Ganjam (1.66 +/- 0.81) and highest in Sirohi goats (2.50 +/- 1.05). Expected heterozygosity at six different loci demonstrated genetic diversity and breed fragmentation. Neighbor-Joining tree was built basing on Nei's distance. There was about 16.95% variability due to differences between breeds, indicating a strong subdivision. Principal component analysis was carried out to highlight the relationship among breeds. The variability among goat breeds was contributed by alphaS2-CN, beta-LG and alphaS1-CN. The Indian goats exhibited alphaS1-CN (CSN1S1) A allele in higher frequency in all the breeds indicating the higher casein yield in their milk.",M1
20379374,"The role of the lactadherin in promoting intestinal DCs development in vivo and vitro.Lactadherin, as one of the immune components in the breast <e>milk</e>, might play a role in the intestinal immune system of newborn. Therefore, we investigated the effect of lactadherin-feeding in early time on the development of intestinal immune system compared with naturally rearing and artificially rearing (non-lactadherin). In the present study, we observed that the Peyer's Patches (PP) from the pups of artificially reared group with lactadherin added were characterized by an excess of OX62(+)CD4(+)SIRP(+) DC cells and a higher expression of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)T cells. Additionally, this study also demonstrated that IL-10 production was dramatically increased when lactadherin was present in culture medium compared with lactadherin-absent culture. These results suggested that lactadherin could adjust intestinal DCs activity, induce CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)T cell differentiation, and enhance IL-10 production.",M1
20377965,"Rapid detection and identification of bacterial pathogens by using an ATP bioluminescence immunoassay.Rapid identification of viable bacterial contaminants in food products is important because of their potential to cause disease. This study examined a method for microbial detection by using a combined ATP bioluminescence immunoassay. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were selected as target organisms because of their implication in foodborne illness. Various matrices containing the target cells were examined, including ground beef homogenate, apple juice, <e>milk</e>, and phosphate-buffered saline. Specific antibodies were immobilized on the surface of 96-well plates, and then the sample matrices containing target cells in the wells were incubated. Sample matrix (no cells) was used to establish background. The plates were washed, and the wells were incubated with BacTiter-Glo reagent in Mueller-Hinton II broth. Bioluminescent output was measured with the GloMax 96 luminometer. Signal-to-noise ratios were calculated, resulting in a limit of detection of 10(4) CFU/ml for both E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium. The limit of detection for both species was not affected by the presence of nontarget cells. The various sample matrices did not affect signal-to-noise ratios when E. coli O157:H7 was the target. A weak matrix effect was observed when Salmonella Typhimurium was the target. A strong linear correlation was observed between the number of cells and luminescent output over 4 orders of magnitude for both species. This method provides a means of simultaneously detecting and identifying viable pathogens in complex matrices, and could have wider application in food microbiology.",M1
20377958,"Development of a novel immuno-PCR assay for detection of ricin in ground beef, liquid chicken egg, and <e>milk</e>.Reliable, sensitive, and high-throughput methods are essential for food defense, to detect foodborne contaminants and to facilitate remediation and recovery from potential toxin-related incidents. Ricin is a protein toxin that has been used for intentional contamination of foods in the past. In this study, we developed procedures for quantification of ricin in foods using immuno-PCR (IPCR). The direct adsorption of ricin onto the wells of a microtitration plate was compared with indirect immobilization via a capture antibody (sandwich IPCR). The latter procedure provided much greater sensitivity. We also compared a protocol with the immunoassay and PCR conducted in a single plate to a two-step procedure in which the PCR was conducted in a second plate, following release and transfer of the DNA marker. The two-step procedure proved 1,000-fold more sensitive for ricin detection, so this format was used to detect ricin in spiked samples of ground beef, chicken egg, and milk, and the results were compared with those obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IPCR had a limit of detection of 10 pg/ml in chicken egg and milk samples and 100 pg/ml in ground beef extracts. Comparable ELISA results were in the 1 to 10 ng/ml range. Thus, IPCR affords sensitivity that is 10-fold greater in the ground beef matrix, 100-fold greater in the milk, and 1,000-fold greater in the egg matrix than the sensitivity obtained by ELISA. Further optimization of the sandwich IPCR was performed by comparing various antibody combinations. Among the four formats investigated, the pAb-pAb combination yielded the lowest limit of detection (10 fg/ml).",M1
20374842,"Effect of the addition of calcium soap to ewes' diet on fatty acid composition of ewe <e>milk</e> and subcutaneous fat of suckling lambs reared on ewe milk.The aim of this work was to study the effect of the inclusion of calcium soap (CS) in ewes' diet on the fatty acid profile of suckling lambs. Sixty suckling lambs of three breeds (Castellana, Churra and Assaf) were divided into two equal groups. One group was fed with a diet composed of beetroot pulp, alfalfa, barley, corn, soy, cotton and 4% of CS, and the other with a control diet without CS. The fatty acid profiles of the ewe's milk samples collected on the day before slaughter and of the lamb subcutaneous fat collected from the back of the carcasses were analysed. The addition of calcium soap to the ewe's diet did not change the milk fatty acid profile but significantly increased SFA and decreased both the PUFA and MUFA levels of suckling lamb fat. PCA analysis revealed a good separation of the lamb samples according to the diet of the mothers, showing that diet is more important than breed in explaining sample variability.",M1

20358108,"Lab-On-a-Chip for carbon nanotubes based immunoassay detection of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB).We describe a new eight channel Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) for a Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based immunoassay with optical detection of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) for food safety applications. In this work, we combined four biosensing elements: (1) CNT technology for primary antibody immobilization, (2) Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) for light signal generation, (3) a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) for detection and (4) polymer lamination technology for developing a point of care immunological assay for SEB detection. Our concept for developing versatile LOCs, which can be used for many different applications, is to use a modular design with interchangeable recognition elements (e.g. various antibodies) to determine the specificity. Polymer lamination technology was used for the fabrication of a six layer, syringe operated LOC capable of analyzing eight samples simultaneously. An anti-SEB antibody-nanotube mixture was immobilized onto a polycarbonate strip, to serve as an interchangeable ligand surface that was then bonded onto the LOC. SEB samples are loaded into the device and detected by an ELISA assay using Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-SEB IgG as a secondary antibody and ECL, with detection by a previously described portable cooled CCD detector. Eight samples of SEB in buffer or soy <e>milk</e> were assayed simultaneously with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng mL(-1). CNT immobilization of the antibody increased the sensitivity of detection six fold. Use of a simple interchangeable immunological surface allows this LOC to be adapted to any immunoassay by simply replacing the ligand surface. A syringe was used to move fluids for this assay so no power is needed to operate the device. Our versatile portable point-of-care CCD detector combined with the LOC immunoassay method described here can be used to reduce the exposure of users to toxins and other biohazards when working outside the lab, as well as to simplify and increase sensitivity for many other types of immunological diagnostics and detection assays.",M1
20356599,"Major lipid classes separation of buttermilk, and cows, goats and ewes <e>milk</e> by high performance liquid chromatography with an evaporative light scattering detector focused on the phospholipid fraction.An improved HPLC-ELSD method has been developed for the analysis of the lipid classes of buttermilk and milk from different species, focused in the phospholipids fraction without a prior fractionation step and in a single run. The total lipid profile analysis showed the major and minor lipid compounds as cholesterol esters, triacylglycerides, cholesterol, diacylglycerides, free fatty acids, monoacylglycerides, and also the polar compounds as glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine. The identification and quantification of the different compounds, using calibration curves made with individual standards and the low coefficients of variation obtained in the inter- and intra-assays showed the suitability of the developed method. In this study, we optimized and validated a quantitative HPLC-ELSD method at a concentration level suitable for routine analysis of the major lipid classes in milk and dairy products.",M1
20350743,"The relative influence of diet and serum concentrations of organochlorine compounds on K-ras mutations in exocrine pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: In exocrine pancreatic cancer (EPC) mechanistic relationships may exist among some organochlorine compounds (OCs) and mutations in the K-ras oncogene, as well as among the latter and dietary factors. OBJECTIVE: To analyze (1) the relationship between food intake and serum concentrations of OCs in EPC patients and (2) the relative influence of food and OCs on the frequency of K-ras mutations in EPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Incident cases of EPC were prospectively identified, and interviewed face-to-face during hospital admission (N=135 patients with data on OCs and diet, and N=97 with additional information on K-ras status). OCs were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. RESULTS: Consumption of <e>milk</e> and other dairy products was positively associated with concentrations of p,p'-DDT, PCB 138 and PCB 153 (log-transformed betas=0.652, 0.588 and 0.317, respectively; all p&lt;0.05). When adjusted by OCs, dairy products were no longer associated with K-ras. By contrast, after adjusting by consumption of dairy products, patients with the highest concentrations of p,p'-DDT and some PCBs remained more likely to have a K-ras-mutated EPC than patients with lower concentrations (OR for upper tertile of PCB 138=5.5, 95% CI: 1.3-23.4). CONCLUSIONS: Dairy products were a source of OCs. The association between dairy products and K-ras mutations was not independent of OCs. By contrast, the association between OCs and K-ras was not confounded by dairy products. OCs may be more likely to contribute to the occurrence of K-ras mutations than nutrients contained in dairy products.",M1
20338455,"Short communication: genetic trends of <e>milk</e> yield under heat stress for US Holsteins.Data included 90,242,799 test-day milk records from 5,402,484 Holstein cows in the first 3 parities and 9,326,754 animals in the pedigree. Additionally, daily temperature-humidity indexes from 202 weather stations were available. Analyses were done by a random regression model in which each parity was treated as a separate trait and that accounted for heat stress. The fixed effects included herd test-day, age at calving, milking frequency, and days in milk classes. Random effects included additive genetic, permanent environment, and herd-year effects, all fit as random regressions. Five covariates in the random regressions included linear splines with 4 knots at 5, 50, 200, and 305 DIM and a function of a temperature-humidity index (THI). Mixed model equations were solved by using an iteration on data approach with a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. Genetic trends for daily milk yield in absence of heat stress (intercept) were 0.140 kg/yr, 0.172 kg/yr, and 0.168 kg/yr for the first, second, and third parity, respectively. Genetic trends for decline of milk yield at temperature of 5 degrees C THI over the threshold of sensitivity to heat stress were -0.002 kg/yr, -0.035 kg/yr, and -0.038 kg/yr, for first, second, and third parity, respectively. Genetic profiles were created by contrasting the 100 most and 100 least heat-tolerant bulls for the official proofs. The most heat-tolerant bulls transmitted lower production and dairy form but higher fertility, productive life, and type, especially udder and locomotion traits. In later parities, the type advantages were smaller. Test-day records capture only a fraction of information due to heat stress, and the real trends for heat stress may be stronger. Studies on heat stress for production should include records on later parities.",M1
20338454,"Short communication: genetic variability in the predicted microRNA target sites of caprine casein genes.The main goal of the current work was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that might create or disrupt microRNA (miRNA) target sites in the caprine casein genes. The 3' untranslated regions of the goat alpha(S1)-, alpha(S2)-, beta-, and kappa-casein genes (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3, respectively) were resequenced in 25 individuals of the Murciano-Granadina, Cashmere, Canarian, Saanen, and Sahelian breeds. Five SNP were identified through this strategy: c.175C&gt;T at CSN1S1; c.109T&gt;C, c.139G&gt;C, and c.160T&gt;C at CSN1S2; and c.216C&gt;T at CSN2. Analysis with the Patrocles Finder tool predicted that all of these SNP are located within regions complementary to the seed of diverse miRNA sequences. These in silico results suggest that polymorphism at miRNA target sites might have some effect on casein expression. We explored this issue by genotyping the c.175C&gt;T SNP (CSN1S1) in 85 Murciano-Granadina goats with records for <e>milk</e> CSN1S1 concentrations. This substitution destroys a putative target site for miR-101, a miRNA known to be expressed in the bovine mammary gland. Although TT goats had higher levels (6.25 g/L) of CSN1S1 than their CT (6.05 g/L) and CC (6.04 g/L) counterparts, these differences were not significant. Experimental confirmation of the miRNA target sites predicted in the current work and performance of additional association analyses in other goat populations will be an essential step to find out if polymorphic miRNA target sites constitute an important source of variation in casein expression.",M1
20338453,"Short communication: heritability of <e>milk</e> fatty acid composition and stearoyl-CoA desaturase indices in dairy cows.Activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the mammary gland is important for determining the relative proportions of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in milk and the concentration of the conjugated linoleic acid isomer rumenic acid (RA; cis-9,trans-11 18:2). Previous studies identified a large degree of between-cow variation in SCD activity, which was consistent across diets and suggests a genetic influence. The objectives of this study were to quantify genetic and phenotypic variations in fatty acid concentrations and SCD indices in milk fat and to estimate their heritabilities in a population of United Kingdom dairy cows. Milk samples were collected from 2,408 daughters of 597 Holstein-Friesian sires on 325 commercial farms for determination of fatty acid profiles. Indices of SCD activity were calculated by expressing each SCD product (cis-9 14:1, cis-9 16:1, cis-9 18:1, and RA) as a proportion of the precursor plus product [e.g., SCDI(14)=cis-9 14:1/(14:0+cis-9 14:1)]. For individual fatty acids, phenotypic variance was considerably greater than additive genetic variance, resulting in small and nonsignificant heritability estimates (+/- standard error) for all except 6:0 (h(2)=0.27+/-0.10), 8:0 (h(2)=0.27+/-0.09), 12:0 (h(2)=0.13+/-0.07), cis-9 14:1 (h(2)=0.28+/-0.10), and cis-9 18:1 (h(2)=0.12+/-0.07). Heritability estimates of desaturase indices were significant for SCDI(14) (h(2)=0.38+/-0.11), SCDI(18) (h(2)=0.19+/-0.09), and SCDI(RA) (h(2)=0.21+/-0.09), but not for SCDI(16) (h(2)=0.05+/-0.06). This study provides evidence that additive effects are responsible for a significant proportion of the phenotypic variation in SCD activity in dairy cows. It is concluded that because heritability of desaturase indices is moderate and significant in many cases, these indices could be investigated further for use in future breeding programs to increase concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids and RA while decreasing concentrations of saturated fatty acids in milk fat.",M1

Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification followed by digestion with HaeIII and RsaI for PRL and beta-LG, respectively, and by PCR amplification for CSN3. Monthly milking records and pedigree information were used to evaluate the effect of each polymorphism on milk yield. Results indicated that PRL genotype had a significant effect on milk yield. Ewes carrying one A allele produced 110.6g more milk per day than ewes with no A alleles. There was no statistical difference between ewes with only one A allele and ewes with 2 A alleles. No association among polymorphisms at the beta-LG and CSN3 loci and milk yield was found. The results presented in this study indicate that the PRL gene is a potential marker that could be used in selection programs for improving milk yield in dairy sheep.",M1
20338451,"Genetic parameters of <e>milk</e> ELISA scores for Johne's disease.The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of antibody response to Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis using routinely collected Minnesota Dairy Herd Improvement milk ELISA tests. After all edits, 25,809 tests from 21,514 Holstein cows in 282 Johne's positive herds were available for analysis. The Johne's test results were analyzed both as a binary trait (positive or negative) and as a linear trait as the transformed ELISA optical density [ln(OD)]. Significant fixed effects in the model were age at test date, days in milk, and laboratory negative control; random effects were herd test date, animal effect, and permanent environment effect. Transformed ELISA optical density increased with age at test day and days in milk. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.065 to 0.095. Percentage of variation explained by maternal effects ranged from 1.3 to 2.29%. Repeatabilities ranged from 0.380 to 0.433. Statistically significant correlations between the sire solutions for ln(OD) for 154 bulls with at least 30 daughters in the analysis and their USDA predicted transmitting abilities were as follows: fat yield, -0.199; protein yield, -0.179; productive life, -0.292; and Net Merit, -0.339. These correlations suggest that selection for productive life or Net Merit also will improve resistance to Johne's disease.",M1
20338450,"Genetic variability of <e>milk</e> components based on mid-infrared spectral data.The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters of the mid-infrared (MIR) milk spectrum represented by 1,060 data points per sample. The dimensionality of traits was reduced by principal components analysis. Therefore, 46 principal components describing 99.03% of the phenotypic variability were used to create 46 new traits. Variance components were estimated using canonical transformation. Heritability ranged from 0 to 0.35. Twenty-five out of 46 studied traits showed a permanent environment variance greater than genetic variance. Eight traits showed heritability greater than 0.10. Variances of original spectral traits were obtained by back transformation. Heritabilities for each spectral data points ranged from 0.003 to 0.42. In particular, 3 MIR regions showing moderate to high heritability estimates were of potential genetic interest. Heritabilities for specific wave numbers, linked with common milk traits (e.g., lipids, lactose), were similar to those estimated for these traits. This research confirms the genetic variability of the MIR milk spectrum and, therefore, the genetic variation of milk components. The objective of this study was to better understand the genetics of milk composition and, maybe in the future, to select animals to improve milk quality.",M1
20338448,"Evaluation of five lactation curve models fitted for fat:protein ratio of <e>milk</e> and daily energy balance.Selection for milk yield increases the metabolic load of dairy cows. The fat:protein ratio of milk (FPR) could serve as a measure of the energy balance status and might be used as a selection criterion to improve metabolic stability. The fit of different fixed and random regression models describing FPR and daily energy balance was tested to establish appropriate models for further genetic analyses. In addition, the relationship between both traits was evaluated for the best fitting model. Data were collected on a dairy research farm running a bull dam performance test. Energy balance was calculated using information on milk yield, feed intake per day, and live weight. Weekly FPR measurements were available. Three data sets were created containing records of 577 primiparous cows with observations from lactation d 11 to 180 as well as records of 613 primiparous cows and 96 multiparous cows with observations from lactation d 11 to 305. Five well-established parametric functions of days in milk (Ali and Schaeffer, Guo and Swalve, Wilmink, Legendre polynomials of third and fourth degree) were chosen for modeling the lactation curves. Evaluation of goodness of fit was based on the corrected Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, correlation between the real observation and the estimated value, and on inspection of the residuals plotted against days in milk. The best model was chosen for estimation of correlations between both traits at different lactation stages. Random regression models were superior compared with the fixed regression models. In general, the Ali and Schaeffer function appeared most suitable for modeling both the fixed and the random regression part of the mixed model. The FPR is greatest in the initial lactation period when energy deficit is most pronounced. Energy balance stabilizes at the same point as the decrease in FPR stops. The inverted patterns indicate a causal relationship between the 2 traits. A common pattern was also observed for repeatabilities of both traits, with repeatabilities being largest at the beginning of lactation. Additionally, correlations between cow effects were closest at the beginning of lactation (r(c)=-0.43). The results support the hypothesis that FPR can serve as a suitable indicator for energy status, at least during the most metabolically stressful stage of lactation.",M1
20338445,"Short communication: responses to increasing amounts of free alpha-linolenic acid infused into the duodenum of lactating dairy cows.Increasing the alpha-linolenic acid (LNA; 18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15) content of <e>milk</e> fat might help promote consumers' health. The objective of this study was to determine the potential to alter the content of LNA in milk by duodenal infusion of a free fatty acid mixture rich in LNA. Four multiparous lactating Chinese Holstein cows fitted with duodenal cannulas were administered 2 treatments in a crossover design: an LNA-rich fatty acid infusion at varying concentrations (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 g/d) versus a basal infusate control. Dry matter intake was not affected by LNA infusions. Milk production tended to decrease and was quadratically affected as LNA infusion increased, but 4% fat-corrected milk yield was not changed. Milk fat content tended to increase linearly with LNA infusion. Milk protein content was not changed by LNA infusion, whereas milk lactose content and yield were decreased quadratically as LNA infusion increased. Increasing the amount of LNA infused into the duodenum linearly increased concentrations of 18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 (0.61 to 25.4 g/100g of total fatty acids) and 18:2 cis-9,cis-12 in milk fat. Increasing LNA decreased the percentages of 4:0, 14:0, and 16:0 fatty acids linearly. Increasing LNA also linearly decreased the percentages of 18:1 cis-9 and 18:2 cis-9,trans-11 in milk fat. Milk fat content of 20:5 cis-5,cis-8,cis-11,cis-14,cis-17 was quadratically affected, whereas concentrations of 18:0, 18:1 trans-9, 18:1 trans-11, and 18:2 trans-10,cis-12 were not affected. Increasing the supply of 18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 to the small intestine linearly increased 18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 in milk fat and markedly altered milk fat composition.",M1
20338443,"<e>Milk</e> fatty acid profile and dairy sheep performance in response to diet supplementation with sunflower oil plus incremental levels of marine algae.In an attempt to develop strategies for enhancing the nutritional value of sheep milk fat, dairy ewe diet was supplemented with 3 incremental levels of marine algae (MA), in combination with sunflower oil, to evaluate the effects of these marine lipids on milk fatty acid (FA) profile and animal performance. Fifty Assaf ewes in mid lactation were distributed in 10 lots of 5 animals each and allocated to 5 treatments (2 lots per treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 25 g of sunflower oil/kg of DM plus 0 (SO), 8 (SOMA(1)), 16 (SOMA(2)), or 24 (SOMA(3)) g of MA (56.7% ether extract)/kg of DM. Milk production and composition, including FA profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment. Neither intake nor milk yield were significantly affected by lipid addition, but all MA supplements decreased milk fat content from d 14 onward, reaching a 30% reduction after 28 d on SOMA(3). This milk fat depression might be related not only to the joint action of some putative fat synthesis inhibitors, such as trans-9,cis-11 C18:2 and probably trans-10 C18:1, but also to the limited ability of the mammary gland to maintain a desirable milk fat fluidity, that would have been caused by the noticeable increase in trans-C18:1 together with the lowered availability of stearic acid for oleic acid synthesis through Delta(9)-desaturase. Furthermore, all lipid supplements, and mainly MA, reduced the secretion of de novo FA (C6:0-C14:0) without increasing the yield of preformed FA (&gt;C16). Supplementation with sunflower oil plus MA resulted in larger increases in cis-9,trans-11 C18:2 than those observed with sunflower oil alone, achieving a mean content as high as 3.22% of total FA and representing a more than 7-fold increase compared with the control. Vaccenic acid (trans-11 C18:1) was also significantly enhanced (on average +794% in SOMA treatments), as was C22:6 n-3 (DHA) content, although the transfer efficiency of the latter, from the diets to the milk, was very low (5%). However, the highest levels of MA inclusion (SOMA(2) and SOMA(3)) reduced the milk n-6:n-3 ratio, but MA supplements caused an important increase in trans-10 C18:1, which would rule out the possibility that this milk has a healthier fat profile before determining the specific role of each individual FA and ensuring that this trans-FA is at least innocuous in relation to cardiovascular disease risk.",M1
20338442,"Net flux of nutrients across splanchnic tissues of lactating dairy cows as influenced by dietary supplements of biotin and vitamin B12.Biotin and vitamin B(12) are coenzymes in reactions that are essential to propionate metabolism in dairy cows. The objective of the present studies was to determine whether an increased dietary supply of these vitamins would change the net flux of nutrients through the rumen, the portal-drained viscera (PDV), the total splanchnic tissues (TSP), and the liver. Four lactating cows equipped with ultrasonic flow probes around the right ruminal artery and the portal vein and catheters in the right ruminal vein, the portal vein, one hepatic vein, and one mesenteric artery were fed 12 times per day a mixed ration at 95% of ad libitum dry matter intake. Daily supplements of 500 mg of vitamin B(12)+20mg of biotin or no vitamin supplement (study 1) or 500 mg of vitamin B(12) alone or with 20mg of biotin (study 2) were fed according to a crossover design with two 4-wk periods in each study. On the last day of each period, blood flow was recorded and blood samples were collected every 30 min for 4h. In study 1, biotin and vitamin B(12) given together increased <e>milk</e> production and milk protein yields compared with the control diet. The supplement increased appearance of the 2 vitamins across the PDV and TSP. It also reduced the net portal appearance of ammonia and total volatile fatty acids across the PDV. In study 2, compared with the 2 vitamins together, vitamin B(12) alone increased glucose flux across PDV and TSP as well as its arterial concentration and PDV flux of ammonia. With the diet used in the present experiment, the major effects of the vitamin supplements seem to be mediated through changes in ruminal fermentation and gastrointestinal tract metabolism rather than by effects on hepatic metabolism.",M1
20338441,"Successful control of Johne's disease in nine dairy herds: results of a six-year field trial.The objective was to evaluate if a standardized Johne's disease control program significantly reduced the prevalence of cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis in dairy herds with a moderate to high initial infection prevalence of &gt;or=10% ELISA-positive adult cattle. Nine Wisconsin dairy herds of diverse sizes and management styles completed the 6-yr study. The control program involved changes to heifer rearing practices in combination with a routine testing program. For heifers, the program specifically required 1) segregated maternity pens for ELISA-positive and ELISA-negative cattle; 2) removal of calves from the maternity pen in &lt;2h; 3) use of colostrum only from individual ELISA-negative cows (no colostrum pooling); 4) hygienic collection of colostrum; 5) feeding of pasteurized <e>milk</e> as milk replacer or on-farm pasteurized milk until weaning; and 6) minimizing contact with manure from the adult cattle until weaning. The testing program was designed to detect the most infectious cattle by using a commercial ELISA once on every adult during each lactation. Producers were required to cull cows with strong-positive ELISA results before the next calving and to label cows with low- to medium-level ELISA results and manage them to limit infection transmission. Outcomes were measured by comparing the apparent prevalence based on ELISA or fecal culture in the whole herd and in first-lactation cohorts at 2 time points: before implementation of the control program and at the end of the trial. The combined results from the 9 herds showed a significant reduction in ELISA-positive cows, from 11.6% at the start of the trial to 5.6% at conclusion of the trial. The apparent prevalence decline among first-lactation cows was greater and was evident by ELISA (10.4 vs. 3.0%) and by fecal culture (17.0 vs. 9.5%). Although variations among farms were observed, the collective results demonstrated that bovine paratuberculosis can be controlled in dairy herds through effective heifer husbandry practices in combination with diagnostic testing to identify, for culling or management, cows most likely infectious.",M1
20338440,"The effects of ruminally degraded protein on rumen fermentation and ammonia losses from manure in dairy cows.This experiment investigated the effect of dietary crude protein (CP) and ruminally degraded protein (RDP) levels on rumen fermentation, digestibility, ammonia emission from manure, and performance of lactating dairy cows. The experiment was a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 6 cows. Three diets varying in CP concentration were tested (CP, % of dry matter): 15.4 (high CP, control), 13.4 (medium CP), and 12.9% (low CP). These diets provided metabolizable protein balances of 323, -44, and 40 g/d and RDP balances of 162, -326, and -636 g/d (high, medium, and low, respectively). Both the medium and low CP diets decreased ruminal pH compared with high CP, most likely because of the higher nonfiber carbohydrate concentration in the former diets. Ruminal ammonia pool size (rumen ammonia N was labeled with (15)N) and the concentration of total free amino acids were greater for the high CP diet than for the RDP-deficient diets. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibilities were not affected by treatment. Both the medium and low CP diets resulted in lower absolute and relative excretion of urinary N compared with the high CP diet, as a proportion of N intake. Excretion of fecal N and <e>milk</e> yield and composition were not affected by diet. Milk N efficiency (milk N / N intake) and the cumulative secretion of ammonia-(15)N in milk protein were greater for the RDP-deficient diets, and milk urea N concentration was greater for the high CP diet. Both medium and low CP diets decreased the irreversible loss of ruminal ammonia N compared with the high CP diet. The rate and cumulative ammonia emissions from manure were lower for the medium and low CP diets compared with the high CP diet. Overall, this study demonstrated that dairy diets with reduced CP and RDP concentrations will produce manure with lower ammonia-emitting potential without affecting cow performance, if metabolizable protein requirements are met.",M1
20338438,"Changes in <e>milk</e> fatty acid profile and animal performance in response to fish oil supplementation, alone or in combination with sunflower oil, in dairy ewes.Ruminant diet supplementation with sunflower oil (SO) and fish oil (FO) has been reported as a good strategy for enhancing some milk fat compounds such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in dairy cows, but no information is available regarding dairy sheep. In this work, ewe diet was supplemented with FO, alone or in combination with SO, with the aim of improving milk nutritional value and evaluating its effect on animal performance. Sixty-four Assaf ewes in mid lactation, fed a high-concentrate diet, were distributed in 8 lots of 8 animals each and assigned to 4 treatments (2 lots/treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 20 g of SO/kg (SO), 10 g of FO/kg (FO), or 20 g of SO plus 10 g of FO/kg (SOFO). Milk production and composition, including a complete fatty acid profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatments. Supplementation with FO tended to reduce dry matter intake compared with the control treatment (-15%), and its use in combination with SO (SOFO) resulted in a significant decrease in milk yield as well (-13%). All lipid supplements reduced milk protein content, and FO also reduced milk fat content by up to 21% alone (FO) and 27% in combination with SO (SOFO). Although the mechanisms involved in FO-induced milk fat depression are not yet well established, the observed increase in some milk trans-FA that are putative inhibitors of milk fat synthesis, such as trans-9,cis-11 CLA, and the 63% decrease in C18:0 (consistent with the theory of reduced milk fat fluidity) may be involved. When compared with the control, lipid supplementation remarkably improved the milk content of rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11 CLA; up to 4-fold increases with SO and SOFO diets), whereas FO-containing diets also increased milk n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly docosahexaenoic acid (with mean contents of 0.29 and 0.38% of total fatty acids for SOFO and FO, respectively), and reduced the n-6:n-3 FA ratio to approximately half the control value. All lipid supplements resulted in high levels of some trans-FA, mainly trans-11 C18:1 (vaccenic acid) but also trans-10 C18:1.",M1
20338437,"Associations of elevated nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations with early lactation reproductive performance and <e>milk</e> production in transition dairy cattle in the northeastern United States.The objectives were to evaluate the effects of elevated pre- and postpartum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations during the transition period on reproductive performance and milk production in dairy cattle. In a prospective cohort study of 91 freestall, total mixed ration-fed herds in the northeastern United States, blood samples were collected from approximately 15 prepartum and 15 different postpartum transition animals in each herd. All samples were stratified based on pre- or postpartum status at the time of sample collection, and 2,259 and 2,290 animals were used to evaluate reproductive and milk production performance, respectively. Reproductive performance was assessed by time to conception within 70 d post-voluntary waiting period (VWP) and milk production was assessed using mature-equivalent 305-d (ME305) milk yield estimated at 120 d in milk. While controlling for body condition score (BCS), calving season, median ME305 milk production, and parity, NEFA and BHBA concentrations were evaluated with time to event analysis to investigate reproductive performance. These same predictor variables were used to determine the effects of elevated NEFA and BHBA concentrations on ME305 milk yield with herd as a random effect. Heifers and cows were grouped in the final analyses if the results between groups were similar. In all animals sampled prepartum, the risk of pregnancy within 70 d post-VWP was reduced by 19% when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.27 mEq/L. In all animals sampled postpartum, those with NEFA concentrations &gt;or=0.72 mEq/L had a 16% decrease in risk of pregnancy and those with BHBA concentrations &gt;or=10mg/dL had a 13% decrease in risk. In cows and heifers, ME305 milk yield was decreased by 683 kg when prepartum NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.33 mEq/L. In heifers sampled postpartum, ME305 milk yield was increased by 488 kg when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.57 mEq/L and increased by 403 kg when BHBA concentrations were &gt;or=9 mg/dL. In cows sampled postpartum, ME305 milk yield was decreased by 647 kg when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.72 mEq/L and decreased by 393 kg when BHBA concentrations were &gt;or=10mg/dL. With the exception of milk production in heifers, this study indicates that increased concentrations of serum NEFA and BHBA had a detrimental effect on reproductive performance and milk production.",M1
20338436,"Factors influencing variation of bulk <e>milk</e> antibiotic residue occurrence, somatic cell count, and total bacterial count in dairy sheep flocks.To study the variations of bulk tank milk variables in dairy ewe flocks and to identify the main target practices and flock groups to improve milk quality and safety, a total of 71,228 records of antibiotic residue (AR) and milk yield and 68,781 records of somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were obtained over 5 yr from the same 209 dairy ewe flocks of the Assaf breed belonging to the Consortium for Ovine Promotion of Castilla-León (Spain). Based on a logistic regression model, year, month, semester, SCC, TBC, dry therapy, and milk yield significantly contributed to AR variation. High SCC was associated with increased AR violations. When antibiotic dry therapy was implemented, AR occurrence was higher than when this practice was not used. A polynomial monthly distribution throughout the year was observed for AR occurrence; the highest values were in autumn, coinciding with low milk yields per flock. Yearly occurrences drastically diminished from 2004 (1.36%) to 2008 (0.30%), probably as a result of effective educational programs. The mixed-model ANOVA of factors influencing variation in SCC and TBC indicated that year, month, AR, dry therapy group, milking type, and year interactions were significant variation factors for SCC and TBC; mathematical model accounted for 74.1 and 35.4% of total variance for each variable, respectively. Differences in management and hygiene practice caused significant SCC and TBC variations among flocks and within flocks throughout the 5-yr study. Over time, continuously dry treated flocks showed lower logSCC (5.80) and logTBC (4.92) than untreated (6.10 and 5.18, respectively) or discontinuously dry treated (6.01 and 5.05, respectively) flocks. Continuously dry treated flocks had lower AR occurrences than did discontinuously dry treated flocks. As a whole, AR occurrence and SCC and TBC bulk tank milk variables can be used for monitoring mammary health and milk hygiene and safety in dairy sheep throughout time.",M1
20338435,"Associations of soft flooring materials in free stalls with <e>milk</e> yield, clinical mastitis, teat lesions, and removal of dairy cows.The objective was to test if there was an association between free-stall base softness and milk yield, incidence of clinical mastitis (CM), teat lesions, and removal of cows. In a questionnaire sent to 1,923 dairy farms presumed to be using free-stall housing, farmers were asked for information regarding housing and stall base; for example, the year of installation and the product name or brand of their mats or mattresses. This information was merged with data for milk yield, CM, teat lesions, and removal of cows extracted from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System for the years after installation of mats or mattresses. After exclusion of invalid contributions, the data set consisted of 29,326 lactations for milk yield distributed over 363 free-stalled herds in Norway. The farms were stratified into 5 categories according to the softness of the stall surface measured as millimeter impact of a sphere with a diameter of 120 mm at 2-kN load: 1=concrete, softness of 0mm; 2=rubber, softness of 1 to 8mm; 3=soft mats, softness of 9 to 16 mm; 4=multilayer mats, softness of 17 to 24 mm; and 5=mattresses, softness over 24 mm. Lactation curves were estimated as modified Wood's lactation curves using test-day data and mixed models with repeated measurements, adjusting for days in milk, parity, and softness of free-stall flooring. Herds on concrete free-stall bases yielded 6,727+/-146 kg of milk from 5 to 305 days in milk. In comparison, herds showed a decrease of 0.3% on rubber, an increase of 2.4% on soft mats, an increase of 4.5% on multilayer mats, and an increase of 3.9% on mattresses. Compared with concrete, the hazard ratio (HR) of CM was less on rubber, multilayer mats, and mattresses [HR=0.89 (0.79-0.99), 0.85 (0.73-0.996), and 0.80 (0.73-0.88), respectively]. Compared with concrete, the HR of teat lesions was less on rubber, soft mats, multilayer mats, and mattresses [HR=0.41 (0.26-0.65), 0.33 (0.24-0.44), 0.12 (0.04-0.38), and 0.47 (0.33-0.67), respectively]. The HR of removal of cows was less on mattresses compared with concrete, rubber, soft mats, and multilayer mats, with HR=0.90 (0.84-0.97), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), 0.86 (0.80-0.93), and 0.85 (0.76-0.95), respectively. A soft free-stall base contributed significantly to increased milk yield and fewer incidences of CM, teat lesions, and removal of cows.",M1
20338434,"The use of a cephalonium containing dry cow therapy and an internal teat sealant, both alone and in combination.The dry period is a critical time in the lactation cycle, being the optimum time to cure existing intramammary infection (IMI) as well as encompassing the periods of highest susceptibility to new infection. Currently, IMI in the dry period is controlled with antibiotic dry cow therapy. The aim of this randomized control trial was to investigate different dry cow therapy regimens by stratifying cows by likely infection status at drying off in herds with low somatic cell count (SCC; bulk <e>milk</e> SCC &lt;250,000 cells/mL) in southwest England. All quarters in 890 cows were recruited. The recruited cows were categorized as either infected or uninfected on the basis of SCC and clinical mastitis history. Ipsilateral quarters within each cow were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 4 different treatment regimens according to their infection category. Quarters in high-SCC infected cows were allocated to receive antibiotic dry cow therapy either alone or in combination with an internal teat sealant; quarters in low-SCC uninfected cows were allocated to receive teat sealant either alone or in combination with antibiotic dry cow therapy. All quarters were sampled for bacteriology at drying off and again within 10 d post-calving. Quarters were subsequently monitored for clinical mastitis for the first 100 d of lactation. The mass of residual sealant was assessed immediately post-calving to allow assessment of the association of sealant retention with treatment efficacy. Models were constructed to assess the efficacy of the different regimens in preventing IMI. Apparent cure rates of existing IMI with major pathogens were consistently &gt;90% in quarters receiving antibiotic. Combination treatment of high-SCC infected cows resulted in an increased likelihood of being pathogen free post-calving (odds ratio=1.40; 95% credibility interval=1.03-1.90). The benefits of combination treatment of low-SCC uninfected cows were less clear. With respect to clinical mastitis, combination treatment of high-SCC infected cows resulted in a decreased likelihood of developing clinical mastitis in the first 100 d of the subsequent lactation (odds ratio=0.68; 95% credibility interval=0.48-0.98). The retention of the internal sealant was adversely affected by its use in combination with antibiotic dry cow therapy.",M1
20338431,"Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry-based <e>milk</e> metabolomics in dairy cows during early and late lactation.Milk production in dairy cows has dramatically increased over the past few decades. The selection for higher milk yield affects the partitioning of available nutrients, with more energy being allocated to milk synthesis and less to physiological processes essential to fertility and fitness. In this study, the abundance of numerous milk metabolites in early and late lactation was systematically investigated, with an emphasis on metabolites related to energy metabolism. The aim of the study was the identification and correlation of milk constituents to the metabolic status of the cows. To investigate the influence of lactation stage on physiological and metabolic variables, 2 breeds of different productivity were selected for investigation by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We could reliably quantify 44 different milk metabolites. The results show that biomarkers such as acetone and beta-hydroxybutyrate are clearly correlated to the metabolic status of the individual cows during early lactation. Based on these data, the selection of cows that cope well with the metabolic stress of early lactation should become an option.",M1
20338430,"An improved method to culture Staphylococcus aureus from bovine <e>milk</e>.Staphylococcus aureus is an important udder pathogen often associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. Identification of Staph. aureus-positive udder quarters and cows is an important part of control programs to reduce spread of Staph. aureus within and between dairy herds. Therefore, accurate and easy-to-perform culturing methods of Staph. aureus in milk are needed. In the present study, 8 methods for isolation of Staph. aureus in bovine milk samples were investigated. The methods involved different culturing volumes, enrichment, incubation, and freezing processes as well as sedimentation and use of the Mastistrip cassette (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden). Three different sets of milk samples were collected, and 6, 5, and 4 methods were used in each subset of samples. Our results indicate an increased probability of detecting Staph. aureus in milk samples when a simple incubation step (37 degrees C for 18 h) without additives was included before culturing. Using this incubation method, the number of Staph. aureus-positive udder quarters and cows increased by 50 and 29%, respectively, compared with using the standard method of direct culturing of 10 microL of milk. The improved method may be especially useful for detection of low concentrations of Staph. aureus in milk; for example, when screening herds for Staph. aureus.",M1
20338429,"Associations between bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus infections and animal performance in Swedish dairy herds.To assess the economic impact of bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections, accurate estimates of their associated effects on animal performance are needed. This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test-day <e>milk</e> yield and somatic cell count, risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows, and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd. Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections, based on 1) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV- and BRSV-specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows; 2) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV- and BRSV-related clinical outbreaks; and 3) the combination of both pieces of information. A total of 36,184 test days, 2,716 cows with a first service, and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses. Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models, after adjustment for covariates known to influence the performance under study. A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds, as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (of 0.57 and 0.91 kg/d, respectively), compared with cows in presumably infection-free herds. There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count (of 12,000 cells/mL) for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak. The risk of failure after first service, as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer, was numerically higher in BRSV-infected herds, although this was not statistically significant. In contrast, BCV infection herd status, as defined in the present study, was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds compared with those in infection-free herds.",M1
20338427,"Effect of bovine somatotropin (500 mg) administered at ten-day intervals on ovulatory responses, expression of estrus, and fertility in dairy cows.The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of administering 500 mg of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) every 10 d on ovulatory responses, estrous behavior, and fertility of lactating Holstein cows. Lactating dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: a control with no administration of bST (73 primiparous and 120 multiparous cows) or 6 consecutive administrations of 500 mg of bST (83 primiparous and 123 multiparous cows) given subcutaneously at 10-d intervals starting 61+/-3 d postpartum (study d 0), concurrent with the initiation of the timed artificial insemination (AI). Blood samples were collected thrice weekly from 61+/-3 to 124+/-3 d in <e>milk</e> (DIM), and plasma samples were analyzed for concentrations of estradiol, glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and progesterone. The estrous cycle of cows was presynchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) at 37+/-3 and 51+/-3 DIM, and the Ovsynch timed AI protocol was initiated at 61+/-3 DIM. Ovaries were scanned to determine ovulatory responses during the Ovsynch protocol. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 33 and 66 d after AI. Body condition was scored on study d 0, 10, 42, and 76. Sixty-four cows were fitted with a pressure mounting sensor with radiotelemetric transmitters to monitor estrous behavior. Treatment of lactating dairy cows with 500 mg of bST at 10-d intervals increased yields of milk and milk components in the first 2 mo after treatment. Body condition of bST-treated cows remained unaltered, whereas control cows gained BCS. Treatment with bST increased concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 chronically, but concentrations of insulin and glucose increased only transiently in the first 7 d after the first injection of bST. Concentrations of progesterone during and after the Ovsynch protocol remained unaltered after treatment with bST; likewise, ovulatory responses during the Ovsynch protocol were mostly unaltered by treatment. Concentration of estradiol tended to be greater for bST cows than for control cows immediately before induction of ovulation in the Ovsynch protocol. Similarly, the mean and the peak concentrations of estradiol were greater for bST cows than for control cows when monitored during spontaneous estrus. Nevertheless, duration of estrus and the median number of standing events were less for bST cows than for control cows. Pregnancies per AI after the first and second postpartum inseminations were not affected by bST treatment. Treatment of lactating dairy cows with 500 mg of bST every 10 d improved lactation performance, but it did not affect pregnancies per AI and it reduced expression of estrus.",M1
20338425,"Mammary remodeling in primiparous and multiparous dairy goats during lactation.<e>Milk</e> production is generally lower but lactation persistency higher in primiparous (PP) than in multiparous (MP) goats. This may be related to differences in development and maintenance of mammary gland function, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The present study aimed to elucidate whether differences in lactational performance between PP and MP mammary glands are related to the time course of development and maintenance, not only of the mammary epithelial cell (MEC) population, but also of the mammary vasculature that sustains synthetic activity. Mammary biopsies were obtained from both mammary glands of 3 PP and 6 MP (&gt;or=2 parity) dairy goats at parturition (d 1), d 10, 60, and 180 of lactation. Gene transcription relating to MEC turnover and vascular function was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, mammary morphology was characterized (quantitative histology), and cell turnover was determined (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and Ki-67). Primiparous glands showed higher expression for the genes involved in angiogenesis; namely, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and angiopoietin 1 and 2 and their receptor, a few days after parturition (d 10). Primiparous glands also had higher rates of MEC proliferation in early lactation. It therefore appears that initiation of lactation is associated with development and growth of the mammary gland into early lactation, which continues for a longer period in PP compared with MP glands. In addition, MEC survival was found to be higher in PP glands throughout lactation, and MEC in PP glands underwent more extensive differentiation. This could explain the reported flatter lactation curve and higher lactation persistency in PP glands. Although some of the genes included in this study were differentially expressed in PP and MP glands during the course of lactation, it was not possible to identify any specific genomic factor(s) that could account for the differences between PP and MP glands with respect to mammary development and MEC survival during lactation. It remains to be established why parity number affects MEC and vascular development and survival during lactation, and, in particular, which regulatory mechanisms are involved.",M1
20338424,"Barium selenate supplementation and its effect on intramammary infection in pasture-based dairy cows.A significant proportion of cattle receive inadequate dietary Se because of its low content in soils and pastures of various regions of the world. Several economically important diseases in dairy cows, such as mastitis, have been associated with Se deficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single injection of a long-acting form of Se at drying off on the risk and incidence rate of new intramammary infections and on <e>milk</e> somatic cell count in the subsequent lactation in pasture-based dairy cows. Forty-nine Chilean Holstein-Friesian cows were fed a diet containing &lt;0.05 mg of Se/kg of ration dry matter. During the dry period, cows were allocated to 1 of 2 groups, a supplemented (n=24) group treated with a single subcutaneous injection of barium selenate 2 mo before calving and a control group (n=25) that remained unsupplemented. Duplicate foremilk samples were aseptically collected within 6 d after calving and every 2 wk until drying-off for bacteriological culture. Milk samples were also collected monthly for somatic cell count evaluation. Blood samples were collected before treatment and at 30, 90, 180, and 270 d after treatment for analysis of blood glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was higher in supplemented cows 30 d after the injection until the end of the study. The risk and incidence rate of new intramammary infections was not affected by supplementation. A progressive increase in somatic cell count was observed throughout lactation, but there was no effect of supplementation. In conclusion, a one-time injection of barium selenate 2 mo before calving in these pasture-based dairy cows did not affect udder health in the subsequent lactation, indicating that Se basal intake was adequate for preventing subclinical mastitis in pasture-based cows in southern Chile.",M1
20338423,"Management practices associated with conception rate and service rate of lactating Holstein cows in large, commercial dairy herds.Data from lactating Holstein cows in herds that participate in a commercial progeny testing program were analyzed to explain management factors associated with herd-average conception and service rates on large commercial dairies. On-farm herd management software was used as the source of data related to production, reproduction, culling, and <e>milk</e> quality for 108 herds. Also, a survey regarding management, facilities, nutrition, and labor was completed on 86 farms. A total of 41 explanatory variables related to management factors and conditions that could affect conception and service rate were considered in this study. Models explaining conception and service rates were developed using a machine learning algorithm for constructing model trees. The most important explanatory variables associated with conception rate were the percentage of repeated inseminations between 4 and 17 d post-artificial insemination, stocking density in the breeding pen, length of the voluntary waiting period, days at pregnancy examination, and somatic cell score. The most important explanatory variables associated with service rate were the number of lactating cows per breeding technician, use of a resynchronization program, utilization of soakers in the holding area during the summer, and bunk space per cow in the breeding pen. The aforementioned models explained 35% and 40% of the observed variation in conception rate and service rate, respectively, and underline the association of herd-level management factors not strictly related to reproduction with herd reproductive performance.",M1
20338421,"Importance of casein micelle size and <e>milk</e> composition for milk gelation.The economic output of the dairy industry is to a great extent dependent on the processing of milk into other milk-based products such as cheese. The yield and quality of cheese are dependent on both the composition and technological properties of milk. The objective of this study was to evaluate the importance and effects of casein (CN) micelle size and milk composition on milk gelation characteristics in order to evaluate the possibilities for enhancing gelation properties through breeding. Milk was collected on 4 sampling occasions at the farm level in winter and summer from dairy cows with high genetic merit, classified as elite dairy cows, of the Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein breeds. Comparisons were made with milk from a Swedish Red herd, a Swedish Holstein herd, and a Swedish dairy processor. Properties of CN micelles, such as their native and rennet-induced CN micelle size and their zeta-potential, were analyzed by photon correlation spectroscopy, and rennet-induced gelation characteristics, including gel strength, gelation time, and frequency sweeps, were determined. Milk parameters of the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate profiles as well as minerals were used to obtain correlations with native CN micelle size and gelation characteristics. Milk pH and protein, CN, and lactose contents were found to affect milk gelation. Smaller native CN micelles were shown to form stronger gels when poorly coagulating milk was excluded from the correlation analysis. In addition, milk pH correlated positively, whereas Mg and K correlated negatively with native CN micellar size. The milk from the elite dairy cows was shown to have good gelation characteristics. Furthermore, genetic progress in relation to CN micelle size was found for these cows as a correlated response to selection for the Swedish breeding objective if optimizing for milk gelation characteristics. The results indicate that selection for smaller native CN micelles and lower milk pH through breeding would enhance gelation properties and may thus improve the initial step in the processing of cheese.",M1
20338420,"Linear relationship between increasing amounts of extruded linseed in dairy cow diet and <e>milk</e> fatty acid composition and butter properties.The aim of this experiment was to compare the effects of increasing amounts of extruded linseed in dairy cow diet on milk fat yield, milk fatty acid (FA) composition, milk fat globule size, and butter properties. Thirty-six Prim'Holstein cows at 104 d in milk were sorted into 3 groups by milk production and milk fat globule size. Three diets were assigned: a total mixed ration (control) consisting of corn silage (70%) and concentrate (30%), or a supplemented ration based on the control ration but where part of the concentrate energy was replaced on a dry matter basis by 2.1% (LIN1) or 4.3% (LIN2) extruded linseed. The increased amounts of extruded linseed linearly decreased milk fat content and milk fat globule size and linearly increased the percentage of milk unsaturated FA, specifically alpha-linolenic acid and trans FA. Extruded linseed had no significant effect on butter color or on the sensory properties of butters, with only butter texture in the mouth improved. The LIN2 treatment induced a net improvement of milk nutritional properties but also created problems with transforming the cream into butter. The butters obtained were highly spreadable and melt-in-the-mouth, with no pronounced deficiency in taste. The LIN1 treatment appeared to offer a good tradeoff of improved milk FA profile and little effect on butter-making while still offering butters with improved functional properties.",M1
20338418,"Effect of the inclusion of artichoke silage in the ration of lactating ewes on the properties of <e>milk</e> and cheese characteristics during ripening.The effect of including artichoke silage in the rations of dairy ewes on milk characteristics and biochemical changes of ripened cheeses was evaluated. Four groups of lactating ewes were fed rations containing 0, 10, 20, or 30% artichoke silage on a dry matter basis. Bulk milk samples were collected 3 times during the feeding period, and semi-hard cheeses were manufactured and sampled during ripening. Milk composition and cheese yield were not affected by diet. Inclusion of 20 and 30% artichoke silage reduced the firmness of the curds at a level only detected by the Gelograph (Gelograph-NT, Gel-Instrumente, Thalwil, Switzerland) probe. Inclusion of artichoke silage in ewes' diet decreased fat and total free fatty acids content of these cheeses and increased total free amino acids content. Despite the effect of diet on cheese ripening characteristics, the overall sensory scores for cheeses corresponding to artichoke silage diets were statistically higher than those for the control cheeses.",M1
20338417,"Composition, coagulation properties, and cheesemaking potential of <e>milk</e> from cows undergoing extended lactations in a pasture-based dairying system.Extending the lactation length of dairy cows beyond the traditional 10 mo toward lactations of up to 22 mo has attracted interest in the pasture-based seasonal dairying systems of Australia and New Zealand as a way of alleviating the need for cows to conceive during peak lactation, such as is required to maintain seasonally concentrated calving systems. Lactation lengths longer than 10 mo instead provide cows with more time to cycle and conceive after parturition and may therefore be more suitable systems for high-producing Holstein-Friesian cows. Before recommending such systems there is a need to evaluate the effects of long lactations on the suitability of milk for manufacture of high-quality dairy products. In the current experiment, the composition of milk from cows entering the second half of a 22-mo lactation was examined in detail and compared with that from cows undergoing a traditional 10-mo lactation. On 2 occasions, coagulation properties were measured using low amplitude strain oscillation rheometry, and Cheddar cheese was made in 250-L pilot-scale vats. Results showed that milk from extended lactations had higher concentrations of fat and protein than cows undergoing 10-mo lactations under similar management conditions and at the same time of year. The ratio of casein to true protein was not affected by lactation length and neither were the proportions of individual caseins. The increase in milk solids during extended lactations translated into a more rapid rate of coagulation and ultimately a firmer curd on one of the two occasions. Milk from extended lactations yielded more cheese per 100 kg of milk, and there were few differences in the composition or organoleptic properties of the cheese. These data are the first to show that pasture-based dairy industries could embrace the use of extended lactations without compromising the core business of producing high-quality dairy products.",M1
20338414,"Effect of different colored filters on photooxidation in pasteurized <e>milk</e>.The effect of different colored filters and atmospheres on photooxidation and quality in milk was studied. Pasteurized bovine milk (3.9% fat) was packed in 2 different atmospheres (air and N(2)) and exposed to light for 20 h at 4 degrees C under 8 transparent filters with different light transmission properties. The following transparent, noncolored, and colored filters based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used: noncolored (PET), noncolored with 2 different UV-block regions, yellow, green, amber, orange, and red. Control samples were stored in darkness and in a carton. Sensory evaluation showed off flavors significantly increased in milk stored under all filters compared with the control samples. Variation in atmosphere resulted in significant differences in formation of rancid flavor in milk stored under different filters. Milk samples stored in N(2) underwent the most sensory deterioration under orange and red filters, whereas milk samples stored in air were most deteriorated under noncolored filters. According to the oxidation compounds measured by gas chromatography, milk samples stored under noncolored and orange filters were highly oxidized, whereas red, green, and amber filters offered better protection against photooxidation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the degradation of photosensitizers (riboflavin, protoporphyrin, and chlorophyllic compounds) in the milk samples. Degradation of protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds in N(2) correlated well with sensory properties related to photooxidation (R(2)=0.75-0.95). The study indicates that protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds were effective photosensitizers in milk. To avoid photooxidation in milk, it is therefore important to protect it against light from the UV spectrum as well as light from the entire visible region.",M1
20338412,"Siderophore production and utilization by <e>milk</e> spoilage Pseudomonas species.Many bacteria respond to potentially growth-limiting availability of iron by producing low-molecular-weight iron chelators (siderophores). The aim of this work was to examine the siderophores synthesized and utilized by Pseudomonas spp. implicated in milk spoilage. Twenty isolates of Pseudomonas spp. previously shown to have significant milk spoilage potential were tested for the ability to produce siderophores. Of these, 14 produced pyoverdin and 2 of these also produced pyochelin; 1 produced only pyochelin; 1 produced only salicylate; 2 produced non-pyoverdin, hydroxamate-containing siderophore; and 2 produced chrome azurol sulfonate reactive material that was neither pyoverdin nor pyochelin. There was considerable diversity among the pyoverdins produced. All isolates were shown to utilize iron complexed with exogenous pyoverdin, but usage of particular exogenous pyoverdins differed among isolates. Interference with the iron-uptake systems of the Pseudomonas spp. may be a means by which food spoilage can be slowed, and the pyoverdin system would appear to be a potential target. However, given the diversity of pyoverdins produced and utilized, and the presence of other siderophores, successful interference with bacterial iron acquisition in this context may be challenging.",M1
20338411,"Effect of somatic cell count in goat <e>milk</e> on yield, sensory quality, and fatty acid profile of semisoft cheese.This study investigated the effect of somatic cell count (SCC) in goat milk on yield, free fatty acid (FFA) profile, and sensory quality of semisoft cheese. Sixty Alpine goats without evidence of clinical mastitis were assigned to 3 groups with milk SCC level of &lt;500,000 (low), 500,000 to 1,000,000 (medium), and 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 (high) cells/mL. Thirty kilograms of goat milk with mean SCC levels of 410,000 (low), 770,000 (medium), and 1,250,000 (high) cells/mL was obtained for the manufacture of semisoft cheese for 2 consecutive weeks in 3 lactation stages. The composition of milk was analyzed and cheese yield was recorded on d 1. Cheese samples on d 1, 60, and 120 were analyzed for total sensory scores, flavor, and body and texture by a panel of 3 expert judges and were also analyzed for FFA. Results indicated that milk composition did not change when milk SCC varied from 214,000 to 1,450,000 cells/mL. Milk with higher SCC had a lower standard plate count, whereas coliform count and psychrotrophic bacteria count were not affected. However, milk components (fat, protein, lactose, casein, and total solids) among the 3 groups were similar. As a result, no significant differences in the yield of semisoft goat cheeses were detected. However, total sensory scores and body and texture scores for cheeses made from the high SCC milk were lower than those for cheeses made from the low and medium SCC milks. The difference in milk SCC levels also resulted in diverse changes in cheese texture (hardness, springiness, and so on) and FFA profiles. Individual and total FFA increased significantly during ripening, regardless the SCC levels. It is concluded that SCC in goat milk did not affect the yield of semisoft cheese but did result in inferior sensory quality of aged cheeses.",M1
20338410,"How three adventitious lactic acid bacteria affect proteolysis and organic acid production in model Portuguese cheeses manufactured from several <e>milk</e> sources and two alternative coagulants.Model cheeses were manufactured according to a full factorial experimental design to help shed light on the individual and combined roles played by 3 native lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus plantarum) upon proteolysis and organic acid evolution in cheese. The model cheeses were manufactured according to a generally representative Portuguese artisanal protocol, but the (ubiquitous) adventitious microflora in the cheesemaking milk were removed via sterilization before manufacture; therefore, the specific effects of only those lactic acid bacteria selected were monitored. In addition, 2 types of coagulant (animal and plant) and 3 types of cheesemaking milk (cow, sheep, and goat) were assessed to determine their influence on the final characteristics of the model cheeses. The nature of the coagulant appeared to be essential during the first stage of proteolysis as expected, whereas the contribution of those bacteria to the pools of total free AA and organic acids was crucial afterward. This was especially so in terms of the differences observed in the metabolisms of lactic acid (in the case of Lactococcus spp.) as well as acetic and citric acids (in the case of Lactobacillus spp.).",M1
20338282,"Prospective association between <e>milk</e> intake and adiposity in preschool-aged children.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the quantity and type of milk (whole, reduced fat, or 1%/nonfat) consumed at age 2 years is associated with adiposity at age 3 years. DESIGN: We assessed milk and dairy intake at age 2 years with food frequency questionnaires completed by mothers. Our primary outcomes were body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m(2)), z score and overweight at age 3 years, defined as BMI for age and sex &gt;or=85th percentile. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Eight-hundred and fifty-two preschool-aged children in the prospective US cohort Project Viva. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for maternal BMI and education, paternal BMI, and child age, sex, race/ethnicity, intake of energy, nondairy beverages, television viewing, and BMI z score at age 2 years were used. RESULTS: At age 2 years, mean milk intake was 2.6 (standard deviation 1.2) servings per day. Higher intake of whole milk at age 2, but not reduced-fat milk, was associated with a slightly lower BMI z score (-0.09 unit per daily serving [95% confidence interval: -0.16 to -0.01]) at age 3 years; when restricted to children with a normal BMI (5th to &lt;85th percentile) at age 2 years, the association was null (-0.05 unit per daily serving [95% confidence interval: -0.13 to 0.02]). Intake of milk at age 2 years, whether full- or reduced-fat, was not associated with risk of incident overweight at age 3 years. Neither total milk nor total dairy intake at age 2 years was associated with BMI z score or incident overweight at age 3 years. CONCLUSION: Neither consuming more dairy products, nor switching from whole milk to reduced-fat milk at age 2 years, appears likely to prevent overweight in early childhood.",M1
20338280,"Girls' early sweetened carbonated beverage intake predicts different patterns of beverage and nutrient intake across childhood and adolescence.BACKGROUND: Information is limited on persistence of early beverage patterns throughout childhood and adolescence and their influence on long-term dietary intake. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in beverage intake during childhood and assess beverage and nutrient intake from ages 5 to 15 years among girls who were consuming or not consuming sweetened carbonated beverages (soda) at age 5 years. DESIGN/SUBJECTS: Participants were part of a longitudinal study of non-Hispanic white girls and their parents (n=170) assessed biennially from age 5 to 15 years starting fall 1996. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: At each assessment, intakes of beverages (<e>milk</e>, fruit juice, fruit drinks, soda, and tea/coffee), energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients were assessed using three 24-hour recalls. Analyses of longitudinal changes and the interaction between beverage type and age were conducted using a mixed modeling approach. Girls were categorized as either soda consumers or nonconsumers at age 5 years. A mixed modeling approach was used to assess longitudinal differences and patterns of change in beverage and nutrient intake between soda consumption groups. RESULTS: Early differences in soda intake were predictive of later soda and milk intake and of differences in selected nutrients. Relative to girls who were not consuming soda beverages at age 5 years, soda consumers at age 5 years had higher subsequent soda intake, lower milk intake, higher intake of added sugars, lower protein, fiber, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium from ages 5 to 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Soda consumption at age 5 years predicted patterns of nutrient intake that persisted during childhood and into adolescence. Diets of soda consumers were higher in added sugars and lower in protein, fiber, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium. Findings provide a more complex picture regarding the emergence of early beverage patterns and their predictive effects on nutrient intake across childhood and adolescence.",M1
20337399,"Quantification of anthocyanins and flavonols in <e>milk</e>-based food products by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The present article describes the development and validation of an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the comprehensive quantification of anthocyanin and flavonol constituents of milk-based food products. Protein precipitation by acidified methanol and ultrafiltration was utilized as sample preparation to preserve overall polyphenol composition but to eliminate milk proteins in order to comply with UPLC. Reversed-phase chromatography was optimized to achieve separation of 27 analytes in 10 min in order to reduce suppression effects, achieve a wide dynamic range, and most importantly, to resolve isomeric compounds. Positive-ion electrospray mass spectrometric detection and fragmentation of analytes was optimized, final transitions were selected for maximized selectivity, reliable quantification, and reduction of false positives. The quantitative performance of the method was validated, the main features include (1) range of lower limits of detection 0.3-30 ng/mL for glycosylated analytes, 10-300 ng/mL for aglycones, (2) lower limits of quantification 1-100 ng/mL for glycosylated analytes, 30-1,000 ng/mL for aglycones, (3) averaged intraday precision 9%, (4) calibrated range 2-180,000 ng/mL for glycosylated analytes, 60-600,000 ng/mL for aglycones, and (5) averaged accuracy 101%.

HPLC was performed using a silica octadecylsilane column, butylhydroxytoluene-acetonitrile-water (0.05 + 800 + 200, v/v/v) mobile phase, and detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 415 nm, respectively. HPLC/MS was used to confirm whether a chromatographic peak was ethoxyquin. The LOQ of the foods was 0.01 microg/g, except for pig fat and cow's <e>milk</e>, and the RSD (n=6) at 0.1 microg/mL of the standard solution was 1.12%. The accuracy of the calculated data of the standard solution was within the range of 94.0 to 101.2%. Recoveries of ethoxyquin from the food products of cattle, pigs, chickens, and salmon were more than 71.0% with an RSD of &lt; 9.3%, except for chicken liver at different concentration levels, including the lower LOQ, the maximum residue limit (MRL), and in some tissues, twice the MRL. Residue levels of ethoxyquin in 33 commercially available food products of animal origin that were purchased on the west side of the Tokyo metropolitan area were surveyed.

Thermally assisted desorption and ionization of the analyte was achieved with the plasma probe. The small size, low power consumption and capability for direct sampling without pretreatment makes plasma ionization an appropriate ionization method for use with a handheld mass spectrometer. The standard discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface used to connect atmospheric pressure ion sources to mass spectrometers (Gao et al., Anal. Chem., 2008, 80, 4026-4032) was modified by using supplementary pumping to increase the ion transfer efficiency. Whole milk, fish, milk powder and other complex matrices spiked with melamine were placed on glass slides close to the vacuum inlet and analyzed without sample pretreatment. Quantitation in complex matrices was achieved using MS/MS of protonated melamine m/z 127 to yield the characteristic fragment ion of m/z 85. Analysis rates of two samples per minute, levels of melamine as low as 250 ng/mL in whole milk (below the regulatory level in the US of 1 ppm (1 microg/mL) or the European level of 2.5 ppm (microg/mL)), a linear dynamic range of 0.5-50 microg/mL and a relative standard deviation of ca. 7.6-16.2% were achieved. The importance of melamine to public health and the prior lack of a rapid, sensitive and yet highly specific field analysis method add to the relevance of this study.",M1
20301016,"Clostridium botulinum in cattle and dairy products.The use of plastic-wrapped and nonacidified silage as cattle feed has led to an increasing number of botulism outbreaks due to Clostridium botulinum Groups I-III in dairy cattle. The involvement of Groups I and II organisms in cattle botulism has raised concern of human botulism risk associated with the consumption of dairy products. Multiplication of C. botulinum in silage and in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle with botulism has been reported, thus contamination of the farm environment and raw <e>milk</e>, and further transmission through the dairy chain, are possible. The standard milk pasteurization treatment does not eliminate spores, and the intrinsic factors of many dairy products allow botulinal growth and toxin production. Although rare, several large botulism outbreaks due to both commercial and home-prepared dairy products have been reported. Factors explaining these outbreaks include most importantly temperature abuse, but also unsafe formulation, inadequate fermentation, insufficient thermal processing, post-process contamination, and lack of adequate quality control for adjunct ingredients were involved. The small number of outbreaks is probably explained by a low incidence of spores in milk, the presence of competitive bacteria in pasteurized milk and other dairy products, and growth-inhibitory combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in cultured and processed dairy products.",M1
20300740,"Validated HPAEC-PAD method for prebiotics determination in synbiotic fermented <e>milks</e> during shelf life.Interest concerning functional food has been growing in recent years, and much attention has been focused on the choice of prebiotic fibers and probiotic microorganisms added to food products with the aim of improving health, producing synbiotic products. In the work reported here, an innovative analytical method performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed electrochemical detection has been optimized and validated for application to the study of prebiotic effects in synbiotic fermented milk prepared by addition of probiotics. The proposed method permits the evaluation of fructooligosaccharides and inulooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization of 6-7 and 4-7, respectively. Quantitative determination was performed on oligosaccharides, whose standards are not commercially available, by employing calibration curves built by adding a known amount of the fiber used as an ingredient to the matrix. The work provides results from a parallel study on simultaneous variations of prebiotics and probiotics during the shelf life of fermented milk samples. The main advantage over time-consuming, classic enzymatic methods, whose results are limited only to average fiber content, is the possibility of dosing each carbohydrate by performing a single HPAEC run.

Forty mentally retarded boys (age 7-10 years old) were randomly assigned to four groups (no differences in age, BMD, calcium intake and physical activity): training groups with or without calcium supplementation (Tr+Ca+ and Tr+Ca-) and nontraining groups with or without calcium supplementation (Tr-Ca+ and Tr-Ca-). The intervention involved 45 min of physical training performed 3 sessions a week and/or the addition of dietary calcium-rich food using enriched cow <e>milk</e> with vitamin D containing 230 mg calcium per serving, over 6 months. Paired-samples t-test and ANOVA analysis was used to determine the main and combined effects of training and calcium on BMD. All groups showed greater femoral neck BMD after 6 months. The increase in femoral neck BMD in the Tr+Ca+ group was 10% greater than increase in the Tr+Ca- group (not significant). Apparently, the effect of training was greater than calcium intake because the Tr+Ca- group achieved 4% greater BMD than Tr-Ca+ group (not significant). In this study, both training groups had greater BMD than the control group (Tr-Ca-) (P&lt;0.05). In these participants with inadequate calcium intakes, additional exercise and calcium supplementation resulted in a 6-20% greater increase in BMD than controls at the loaded site (femoral neck). These results help to provide more evidence for public health organizations to deal with both exercise and nutrition issues in children for the achievement of peak BMD.",M1
20298651,"Effect of <e>milk</e> and soy-based infant formulas on in situ demineralization of human primary enamel.PURPOSE: The effect of infant formulas sweetened or not with sucrose on primary enamel demineralization and dental biofilm is not known. This study's purpose was to evaluate the effect of infant formula and sucrose association on demineralization of primary enamel and dental biofilm formed. METHODS: A cross-over, split-mouth, and blind in situ study was conducted during 3 phases, each of 10 days duration, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal appliances containing slabs of human primary enamel. The dental slabs were extraorally subjected 8 times a day to 6 groups of treatment: distilled and deionized water; 10% sucrose solution; and milk-based and soy-based formula with or without 10% sucrose added. After each phase, the acidogenicity, biochemical and microbiological composition of dental biofilm formed was analyzed, and enamel demineralization was assessed by microhardness. RESULTS: Both formulas induced significant enamel mineral loss, which increased when sucrose was added. Both formulas were fermented, resulting in a decrease of biofilm pH, irrespective of sucrose addition. Also, lactobacilli counts were higher in biofilm formed in the presence of both formulas when compared to the water group. CONCLUSIONS: Milk and soy-based formulas present potential to induce demineralization in primary enamel, which increased when sweetened with sucrose.",M1
20237202,"Consequences of interference of <e>milk</e> with chemoattractants for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantifications.Concentrations of the chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, and C5a in milk were reduced by the preparation of milk whey by high-speed centrifugation or with rennet. About half of the chemoattractants (35 to 65%) were associated with the casein micelle sediment, except when whey was prepared by acidification. Consequently, quantification of chemoattractants should be carried out preferentially with skimmed milk samples or, whenever whey is needed, with acidic whey samples. The interference of milk or milk whey with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) used to quantify the chemoattractants was moderate, as long as tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), not ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonate)], was used as the substrate of peroxidase. These considerations will help to assess more precisely a component of the immune response of the mammary gland to infection.",M1

20230278,"Intake of a <e>milk</e>-based wolfberry formulation enhances the immune response of young-adult and aged mice.Aging is associated with alterations of immune responses. Wolfberry, a popular Chinese functional ingredient, is prized for its anti-aging properties; however, little is known about the immunological effect of wolfberry intake. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of dietary intake of a milk-based formulation of wolfberry, named Lacto-Wolfberry, on in vivo and ex vivo parameters of adaptive immunity in young-adult and aged mice. Over 44 days, young-adult (2 months) and aged (21 months) C57BL/6J mice were fed ad libitum with a controlled diet and received drinking water supplemented or not with 0.5% (wt/vol) Lacto-Wolfberry. All mice were immunized on day 15 and challenged on day 22 with a T cell- dependent antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Lacto-Wolfberry supplementation significantly increased in vivo systemic immune markers that are known to decline with aging. Indeed, both antigen-(KLH) specific humoral response and cell-mediated immune responses in young-adult and aged mice were enhanced when compared to their respective controls. No significant effect of Lacto-Wolfberry supplementation was observed on ex vivo spleen cells proliferative response to mitogens and on splenocyte T cell subsets. In conclusion, dietary intake of Lacto-Wolfberry may favorably modulate the poor responsiveness to antigenic challenge observed with aging.",M1
20229005,"Simultaneous quantification of carotenoids, retinol, and tocopherols in forages, bovine plasma, and <e>milk</e>: validation of a novel UPLC method.Simultaneous quantification of various liposoluble micronutrients is not a new area of interest since these compounds participate in the nutritional quality of feeds that is largely explored in human, and also in animal diet. However, the development of related methods is still under concern, especially when the carotenoid composition is complex such as in forages given to ruminants or in lipid-rich matrices like milk. In this paper, an original method for simultaneous extraction and quantification of all carotenoids, vitamins E, and A in milk was proposed. Moreover, a new UPLC method allowing simultaneous determination of carotenoids and vitamins A and E in forage, plasma and milk, and separation of 23 peaks of carotenoids in forages was described. This UPLC method using a HSS T3 column and a gradient solvent system was compared to a previously published reverse-phase HPLC using two C18 columns in series and an isocratic solvent system. The UPLC method gave similar concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins A and E than the HPLC method. Moreover, UPLC allowed a better resolution for xanthophylls, especially lutein and zeaxanthin, for the three isomers of beta-carotene (all-E-, 9Z- and 13Z-) and for vitamins A, an equal or better sensitivity according to gradient, and a better reproducibility of peak areas and retention times, but did not reduce the time required for analysis.",M1
20228365,"Predictors for successful bacteriological culture from <e>milk</e> samples.A total of 757 milk samples were taken from 57 farms throughout Wales as part of a mastitis investigation. Problem cows were selected using the most recent milk recording or, if these data were unavailable, the whole herd was assessed using the California mastitis test (CMT) and scored on a scale of 0 to 3. The affected quarter was identified using CMT. The results of the bacteriology were grouped into negative and positive culture. All contaminated samples were excluded. The CMT recording at the time of sampling, the infection status of the cow (new, first, chronic or repeat) as defined by national milk records and the number of quarters infected at the time of sampling were identified for negative and positive samples. Selecting quarters with a higher CMT score increased the likelihood of positive culture. Culturing from a sample with a CMT score of 3 was over three times more likely to yield a positive culture than a score of 1 (odds ratio [OR] 3.74, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 1.41 to 9.97) and 1.7 times more likely to yield a positive culture than a score of 2 (OR 1.70, 95 per cent CI 1.16 to 2.50). Culturing from a score of 2 was not statistically different from a score of 1 in terms of the likelihood that a positive culture would be identified (OR 2.20, 95 per cent CI 0.83 to 5.93). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of negative samples when comparing chronic, repeat, new and first infections or number of quarters infected.",M1

A procedure for confirming the presence of anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drug (NSAID) residues in bovine milk by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection is herein described. The native fluorescence of nine drugs belonging to different NSAID sub-classes, namely flurbiprofen, carprofen, naproxen, vedaprofen, 5-hydroxy-flunixin, niflumic acid, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid and tolfenamic acid, allowed for detection in bovine milk down to 0.25-20.0 microg/kg. Confirmation of the nine NSAIDs is attained by fluorescence detection at characteristic excitation and emission wavelengths. The procedure described is simple and selective. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranging between 0.25 and 20 microg/kg were measured; satisfactory trueness and within-laboratory reproducibility data were calculated at LOQ spiking levels, apart from 5-hydroxy-flunixin. The procedure developed is used in our laboratory for confirmation of each one of the above mentioned NSAIDs in bovine milk, to support results after HPLC quantitative analysis with UV-vis detection.",M1
20227609,"Influence of pasteurization, brining conditions and production environment on the microbiota of artisan Gouda-type cheeses.To monitor the effect of the indigenous <e>milk</e> microbiota and of technological and environmental parameters on the microbiota established in ripened cheese, the diversity and dynamics of the predominant microbial communities in artisan Gouda-type cheeses produced under different conditions was studied. A total of 22 cheese types differing in milk source, milk treatment, production environment and brining conditions were analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) using total DNA extracts as well as DNA extracted from culturable fractions. Through band position analysis and band sequencing, the majority of DGGE bands could be attributed to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), although a few bands also belonged to staphylococci and gamma-Proteobacteria. Aided by principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), cheeses produced at different locations could clearly be differentiated. The same approach also allowed to distinguish raw and pasteurized milk cheeses, the former showing a more diverse microbiota in terms of a higher species richness and number of DGGE bands. No substantial differences were found between cheeses brined at two different locations. In conclusion, the combined PCR-DGGE approach relying on both total DNA extracts and culturable fractions proved its value for analyzing the effect of technological and environmental parameters on the diversity and dynamics of the microbiota in Gouda-type cheeses.",M1
20227599,"Persistence strategies of Bacillus cereus spores isolated from dairy silo tanks.Survival of Bacillus cereus spores of dairy silo tank origin was investigated under conditions simulating those in operational dairy silos. Twenty-three strains were selected to represent all B. cereus isolates (n = 457) with genotypes (RAPD-PCR) that frequently colonised the silo tanks of at least two of the sampled eight dairies. The spores were studied for survival when immersed in liquids used for cleaning-in-place (1.0% sodium hydroxide at pH 13.1, 75 degrees C; 0.9% nitric acid at pH 0.8, 65 degrees C), for adhesion onto nonliving surfaces at 4 degrees C and for germination and biofilm formation in <e>milk</e>. Four groups with different strategies for survival were identified. First, high survival (log 15 min kill &lt; or =1.5) in the hot-alkaline wash liquid. Second, efficient adherence of the spores to stainless steel from cold water. Third, a cereulide producing group with spores characterised by slow germination in rich medium and well preserved viability when exposed to heating at 90 degrees C. Fourth, spores capable of germinating at 8 degrees C and possessing the cspA gene. There were indications that spores highly resistant to hot 1% sodium hydroxide may be effectively inactivated by hot 0.9% nitric acid.

20227598,"Influence of bacterial dynamics upon the final characteristics of model Portuguese traditional cheeses.The microbiological profile in raw <e>milk</e> cheeses is typically characterized by a multitude of microbial groups, with interactions among them throughout ripening that are not fully understood to date. Incidence of undesired microorganisms in raw cheesemaking milk, as is the case of either spoilage or even pathogenic ones, is a common trait in Portuguese traditional cheeses. Hence, they will likely contribute to the physicochemical changes occurring therein and, consequently, to the characteristics of the final product. In order to gain insight into their role, model cheese systems, manufactured as far as possible according to artisanal practices (except that the initial microbial load and biodiversity were controlled), were experimentally tested. Single contaminants, or a consortium thereof, were inoculated at two levels in sterilized raw ewe's milk, and duly combined with inocula containing one or two lactic acid bacteria normally found in those traditional cheeses. The physicochemical composition, organic acid profile, and evolution of both protein breakdown and rheology were monitored throughout a 60 d-ripening period. Modifications brought about within the cheese matrix as a result of microbial metabolism, especially those arising from the interaction between lactic acid bacteria and unwanted microorganisms, included the enhanced release of peptides and free amino acids, which in turn led to higher viscoelastic moduli. The final model cheeses could be well discriminated, based on the impact of the various inocula considered upon the levels of organic acids. Conversely, proteolysis and viscoelastic properties appeared to be essentially independent of the initial microflora.",M1

HA production was enhanced to approximately 100 mg/l at pH 6.8 and 33-40 degrees C. Agitation speed and aeration rate slightly affected HA production. Soybean peptides including those of high molecular weight (approximately 27 to 130 kDa) further increased HA production to 208 mg/l under the optimal condition (pH 6.8, 35 degrees C, 100 rpm), which was 20-fold greater than non-optimal condition. HA production was no longer related to the specific growth rate. The HA produced under the optimal condition included a large amount of high-molecular-weight fraction of 100 to 2000 kDa, compared with under the basal condition without optimization.",M1
20226158,"Sensitive detection of multiplex toxins using antibody microarray.Using a newly developed fluorescent nanoparticle (NP) that gives rise to a high-intensity and stable fluorescent light, a sensitive antibody (Ab) microarray assay system has been developed for specific detection of bioterrorism agents, as exemplified by ricin, cholera toxin (CT), and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The Ab microarray uses a sandwich format that consists of capture Abs, analytes (toxins), biotinylated detection Abs, and avidin-conjugated NP. In all three cases, polyclonal Abs (pAbs) displayed superiority over monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in capturing toxins on microarray slides even when the pAbs and mAbs had similar affinity as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The detection system was successfully used to detect toxins spiked in <e>milk</e>, apple cider, and blood samples. We were able to detect ricin at 100 pg/ml in buffer and at 1 ng/ml in spiked apple cider or milk, whereas CT and SEB were detected at 10 pg/ml in buffer and 100 pg/ml in spiked apple cider or milk. High specificities were also demonstrated in the detection of mixed toxin samples with similar sensitivities. The matrix effect of blood samples on the detection of mixed toxins seems to be minimal when the toxin concentration is at or above 100 ng/ml. The current study highlights the significant role of pAb and NP in increasing selectivity and sensitivity of toxin detection in a microarray format.",M1
20220207,"Dietary trans fatty acid isomers differ in their effects on mammary lipid metabolism as well as lipogenic gene expression in lactating mice.The biological activities and mechanisms of action of individual transoctadecenoic acids (trans-18:1 FA) have not been completely elucidated. We examined the effects of several individual trans-18:1 FA isomers and trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on fat synthesis, and expression of lipogenic genes in mammary and liver tissue in lactating mice. From d 6 to 10 postpartum, 30 lactating C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a control (CTR) diet containing 20 g/kg oleic acid or diets in which the oleic acid was either completely replaced by partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (PHVO), trans-7 18:1 (T7), trans-9 18:1 (T9), or trans-11 18:1 (T11) or partially replaced with 6.66 g/kg trans-10, cis-12 CLA. <e>Milk</e> fat percentage was decreased by CLA (44%), T7 (27%), and PHVO (23%), compared with CTR. In the mammary gland, CLA decreased the expression of genes related to de novo FA synthesis, desaturation, triacylglycerol formation, and transcriptional regulation. PHVO and T7 diets decreased the expression of 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase and thyroid hormone responsive SPOT14 homolog (THRSP) mRNA. In contrast, dietary trans FA (tFA) did not affect hepatic lipogenic gene expression. However, mice fed CLA, T7, and PHVO diets had increased liver weights due to hepatic steatosis. Trans-7 18:1 was extensively desaturated to trans-7, cis-9 CLA in mammary and liver tissues. Dietary trans-7 18:1 could lead to milk fat depression in lactating mice, possibly through its desaturation product trans-7, cis-9 CLA. Also, the differences between the effects of trans-10, cis-12 CLA and other tFA could be attributed to its effects on carbohydrate response element binding protein and PPARgamma, in addition to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c and THRSP.",M1

METHODS: Upon approval by an independent ethics committee and the National Regulatory Agency of Argentina, we compared the time-concentration profiles of somatropin in 24 healthy volunteers, in a randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover design after inhibition of endogenous GH secretion with lanreotide, a long-acting somastostatin analogue. After the subcutaneous administration of 1.33 mg of each formulation, serum somatropin was analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoassay and IGF-I by immunoradiometric assay. Safety was assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with Win Nonlin 5.2 using a non-compartmental model and bioequivalence was assessed. RESULTS: The test/reference ratios of AUC, AUC(last) and C(max) were 106.4 (90% CI = 100.2-112.9), 105.3 (90% CI = 99.1-111.8) and 105.49 (90% CI = 92.6-120.1), respectively. No serious adverse events were reported and no GH antibodies were detected. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a single dose of Biohormon, the first product with somatropin obtained from milk of transgenic mammals, is bioequivalent to the reference product HHT according to standard criteria.",M1

RRR-, RRS-, RSR-, RSS- and the four 2S-alpha-tocopherols) from all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate supplementation in milk replacer for rearing and veal calves respectively, in practical farming conditions. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, six rearing calves were fed milk replacer supplemented with 80 mg/kg all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate for a period of 9 weeks. The calves were supplied calf starter concentrate from 1 to 12 weeks. In experiment 2, six veal calves were fed milk replacer supplemented with 80 mg/kg all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate for a period of 24 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the start and every 4 weeks until 12 weeks for rearing calves in experiment 1, and until slaughter (24 weeks) for veal calves in experiment 2. Liver, adipose, muscle, and brain samples were taken at slaughter of the six veal calves in experiment 2. The distribution of different alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers in feed, plasma, and tissues was analyzed. In both experiments, it was observed that RRR-alpha-tocopherol was the dominant stereoisomer in plasma and tissues. The average percentage of the RRR-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer was 64 %, and 39 % of the total alpha-tocopherol in plasma for rearing and veal calves, respectively. The higher RRR-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer proportion as percentage of the total alpha-tocopherol in rearing calves was related to higher dietary natural vitamin E intake. Other 2R-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers had lower utilization efficiency than RRR-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer. 2S-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers were basically not utilized by calves.",M1

Methods: This enzyme was purified from bovine <e>milk</e> by Amberlite CG 50 resin, CM Sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography. Results: Rz (A412/A280) value for the purified LPO was found to be 0.8. Lactoperoxidase was purified 20.45-fold with a yield of 28.8 %. Purity of enzyme was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method and a single band was observed. All tested vitamins caused inhibition of the enzyme activity and displayed a competitive type of inhibition mechanism. IC(50) values of these three vitamins were 2.03 microM, 0.025 mM, and 0.0925 mM, and the K(i) constants were 0.508+/-0.257 microM, 0.0107+/-0.0044 mM, and 0.0218+/-0.0019 mM respectively. Conclusion: The vitamins discussed here displayed inhibition-type competition with LPO enzyme at varying concentrations. Our study showed that L-ascorbic acid exhibited a much higher inhibitory effect at lower concentrations, so it was evidently a more potent inhibitor than other vitamins tested.",M1

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the predominant bacterial group in the milk belonged to the Lactobacillus species during the experimental period, whereas the genus Staphylococcus gained in numbers during the outside grazing period in addition to Lactobacillus. To investigate the quantitative dynamics of staphylococci, real-time PCR was performed using staphylococcal-specific primers. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the population of staphylococci increased during the outside grazing period.

METHODS: During 2003, all frozen donor milk samples were thawed and aseptically placed in pools prior to pasteurization. All individual and pooled samples were cultured and incubated for 48 hours. Specific microbiologic identification of group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus sp. was performed. Gram-negative rods (GNRs) were subtyped but not specifically identified. Positive cultures were expressed in quantitative colony counts. RESULTS: Samples from 303 pools and 810 individual mother's donor milk were cultured. Forty-four pools (15%) represented  preterm donor milk  from milk donated by mothers who delivered prior to 36 weeks of gestation. Before pasteurization, 185 pools (62%) grew at least one lactose-fermenting GNR, and 58 pools (19%) grew a second lactose-fermenting GNR. Forty-four percent grew a non-lactose-fermenting GNR, and 20% grew an oxidase-positive GNR. The majority (87%) were colonized with Staphylococcus. Other Gram-positive organisms identified included Enterococcus (16%), alpha-Streptococcus (8%), and S. aureus (4%). Only one milk sample was positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The majority of pooled milk samples grew two or more organisms. Milk from 22% of mothers did not grow detectable bacteria on routine cultures. The bacteriologic colonization profiles of milk from mothers delivering prematurely were similar to those of mothers delivering at term. After routine Holder pasteurization of donor milk, 93% of milk samples showed no growth on routine bacterial cultures. CONCLUSIONs: A wide variety of bacteria contaminate human milk from donor mothers. Most milk samples grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Gram-negative organisms. Although normal skin flora was cultured typically from milk samples, there were also many prepasteurization milk samples contaminated with pathogenic organisms. Holder pasteurization was, however, an effective means by which to remove any detectable bacteria from samples of donor human milk.",M2
20496615,"Implementing and revitalizing the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was launched in the 1990s by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF as a global effort with hospitals, health services, and parents to ensure babies are breastfed for the best start in life.

METHODS: Mothers (n = 20) measured their 24-hour milk production from each breast by test-weighing their babies at home. Mothers came to the research laboratory for a day visit and expressed milk from either both or one breast (left or right) for 10-15 minutes, every hour for 2-7 hours. Mothers were not instructed to restrict breastfeeding prior to the first (0-hour) expression. RESULTS: It was found that the milk volume at 1 hour (59.7 +/- 36.5 and 46.5 +/- 25.6 mL/hour for the right and left breast, respectively) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than the milk volume from subsequent hourly intervals. The average hourly volumes obtained from the 2nd to 7th hour (18.0 +/- 3.1 and 14.0 +/- 4.8 mL/hour for the right and left breast, respectively) were not significantly different from the average hourly rates calculated for the 24-hour milk production (18.4 +/- 6.3 and 15.5 +/- 5.1 mL/hour for the right and left breast, respectively). Furthermore, local inhibition was not observed during hourly expressions of up to 7 hours. CONCLUSION: The average hourly volumes of milk from the 2nd to 7th hour expressions could provide an estimate of the rate of milk secretion. Further study is required to fully validate these findings.",M2
20402060,"Maternal and environmental determinants of breast-<e>milk</e> mercury concentrations.We aimed to evaluate the maternal factors [including dietary habits, dental care, smoking, anemia, levels of breast-milk zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe), and levels of serum selenium (Se), Zn and copper (Cu)] that influence breast-milk mercury (Hg) concentrations and to investigate whether there is any relation between Hg concentrations and infant growth and development during the exclusive breastfeeding period and in the second year of life. Forty-four healthy mother-infant pairs in the 10-20-day postpartum period were enrolled in the study. Maternal history and blood samples for hemoglobin, Fe, Fe binding capacity, ferritin, Se, Zn, and Cu and breast-milk samples for Fe, Zn and Hg were taken. Infant growth and development during the exclusive breastfeeding period and in the second year of life were followed. The mean concentration of breast-milk Hg was 3.42 +/- 1.66 microg/L. Serum Se levels were negatively correlated with milk Hg levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that active/passive smoking and offal intake during pregnancy and presence of maternal anemia had an impact on increased milk Hg concentrations. Preventive strategies for mercury exposure should include management of iron deficiency anemia, cessation of smoking exposure and proper nutrition during the pregnancy period.",M2

Epidemiologically, animals are considered reservoirs and humans incidental hosts. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated Q fever in rural Senegal. Human samples (e.g., sera, saliva, breast <e>milk</e>, feces) were screened in the generally healthy population of two villages of the Sine-Saloum region. Ticks were collected in four regions. Seroprevalence was studied by immunofluorescence, and all other samples were tested by two qPCR systems for detection of C. burnetii. Positive samples were genotyped (multispacer typing) by amplification and sequencing of three spacers. Strains were isolated by cell culture. We found that the seroprevalence may be as high as 24.5% (59 of 238 studied) in Dielmo village. We identified spontaneous excretion of C. burnetii by humans through faeces and milk. Hard and soft ticks (8 species) were infected in 0-37.6%. We identified three genotypes of C. burnetii. The previously identified genotype 6 was the most common in ticks in all studied regions and the only one found in human samples. Three strains of genotype 6 of C. burnetii were also recovered from soft tick Ornithodoros sonrai. Two other genotypes found in ticks, 35 and 36, were identified for the first time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Q fever should be considered a significant public health threat in Senegal. Humans, similar to other mammals, may continuously excrete C. burnetii.",M2
20383376,"Organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers in marine and fresh water biota and in human <e>milk</e>.The levels and relative proportions of 11 organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers (OPs), some of which are reportedly toxic to aquatic organisms, were investigated in human breast milk and samples of fish and mussels from Swedish lakes and coastal areas in order to assess spatial differences in environmental exposure and spatial and temporal differences in human exposure. Some of the biota samples were collected at locations with known potential sources of OPs, but most were collected in background locations. Tris-2-chloroisopropyl phosphate (TCPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) dominated in the biota with levels ranging from 170 to 770 ng g(-1) for TCPP in perch and between 21 and 180 ng g(-1) for TPP. In milk samples, TCPP (median 45 ng g(-1)) and tributyl phosphate (median 12 ng g(-1)) were the most frequently occurring OPs. Among samples of fish from background locations, the concentrations and profiles of most OPs were quite similar, indicating that their sources were diffuse. However, in fish from sample locations near known sources, there were marked differences in OP concentrations and profiles. Fish from a stream receiving surface water from Arlanda airport displayed high levels of OPs (10 200 ng g(-1)) that are commonly used in aircraft hydraulic fluids. Fish collected at points 1 or 2 km downstream of sewage treatment plants showed significantly higher levels of tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), one of the most typically abundant OP in effluents from such plants. In the milk samples obtained from women in different towns no distinct differences were detected in OP concentrations or profiles. However, the levels of TBEP tended to be higher in milk collected 10 years ago than in milk collected more recently. However, human exposure to OPs through eating fish or to breastfeeding babies seems to be of minor importance in relation to other potential sources, such as indoor dust inhalation and ingestion.",M2

The content of SOPC is much lower than those in the developing countries where this pesticide continues to be applied. The breast milk levels of OCP, TEQ (polychlorinated dibento-para-dioxines and polychlorinated dibenzofurans) in all towns and individual indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in Irkutsk significantly decreased as compared with those in the 1980s. However, in Kachug and Baikalsk, the concentrations of PCB practically unchanged and the level of some congeners increased. The absence of changes in the content of PCB in Kachug and Baikalsk may be associated with no decrease in environmental pollution in the Irkutsk Region. Altered breast concentrations of SOCPs caused a reduction in their intake in babies.",M2
20367522,"Medical abortion in lactating women--low levels of mifepristone in breast <e>milk</e>.OBJECTIVE: Medical abortion using mifepristone followed by misoprostol is increasingly used for termination of an unwanted pregnancy. Consequently, an increasing number of women undergo medical abortion while still breastfeeding from a previous pregnancy. But there are no data on mifepristone use during lactation. We studied the levels of mifepristone in breast milk collected from women undergoing medical abortion. DESIGN AND SAMPLES: Samples of milk were collected from 12 women during the first 7 days after intake of either 200 mg (n = 2) or 600 mg (n = 10) of mifepristone. In addition, serum samples were collected on day 3 (n = 4). Main outcome measures. The levels of mifepristone, quantified using radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The milk concentrations of mifepristone were highest in the first samples collected during the first 12 hours following drug intake, and ranged from undetectable (&lt; 0.013 micromol/l) to 0.913 micromol/l. Thereafter, declining concentrations of mifepristone were detected up to 7 days. The lowest levels of mifepristone in milk were measured following ingestion of the 200 mg dose. The milk:serum ratio of mifepristone ranged from &lt; 0.013:1 to 0.042:1 on day 3 (n = 4). The calculated relative infant dose (RID) was 1.5% at its highest. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of mifepristone in milk are low, especially when using the 200 mg dose. Breastfeeding can be safely continued in an uninterrupted manner during medical abortion of this kind.",M2
20363457,"Improving the use of human <e>milk</e> during and after the NICU stay.The feeding of human milk (milk from the infant's own mother; excluding donor milk) during the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) stay reduces the risk of costly and handicapping morbidities in premature infants. The mechanisms by which human milk provides this protection are varied and synergistic, and appear to change over the course of the NICU stay. The fact that these mechanisms include specific human milk components that are not present in the milk of other mammals means that human milk from the infant's mother cannot be replaced by commercial infant or donor human milk, and the feeding of human milk should be a NICU priority. Recent evidence suggests that the impact of human milk on improving infant health outcomes and reducing the risk of prematurity-specific morbidities is linked to specific critical exposure periods in the post-birth period during which the exclusive use of human milk and the avoidance of commercial formula may be most important. Similarly, there are other periods when high doses, but not necessarily exclusive use of human milk, may be important. This article reviews the concept of  dose and exposure period  for human milk feeding in the NICU to precisely measure and benchmark the amount and timing of human milk use in the NICU. The critical exposure periods when exclusive or high doses of human milk appear to have the greatest impact on specific morbidities are reviewed. Finally, the current best practices for the use of human milk during and after the NICU stay for premature infants are summarized.",M2

Their analysis, therefore, requires the combination of a sensitive and high-resolution separation technique with a mass identification tool. This study introduces for the first time the hyphenation of CE with an electrospray mass spectrometer, capable to perform multiple MS analysis (ESI-MS(n)) for the separation and characterization of HMOs in breast milk and feces of breast-fed babies. LIF was used for on- and off-line detections. From the overall 47 peaks detected in off-line CE-LIF electropherograms, 21 peaks could be unambiguously and 11 peaks could be tentatively assigned. The detailed structural characterization of a novel lacto-N-neo-tetraose isomer and a novel lacto-N-fucopentaose isomer was established in baby feces and pointed to gastrointestinal hydrolysis of higher-Mw HMOs. CE-LIF-ESI-MS(n) presents, therefore, a useful tool which contributes to an advanced understanding on the fate of individual HMOs during their gastrointestinal passage.",M2

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prebiotic, probiotic added to a standard formula on gastrointestinal motility respect to placebo-formula. Cutaneous electrogastrography (EGG) and ultrasound gastric emptying (GE) were performed in 49 preterm newborns. 17 newborns were exclusively breast-fed; 32 were randomly assigned to receive prebiotic-added formula (0.8 g/dl of a mixture from scGOS and lcFOS, ratio 9:1) (10), a probiotic-added formula (L. reuteri at dose of 1x10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per day) (10), a formula with placebo (12) for 30 days.

20335541,"FADS1 FADS2 gene variants modify the association between fish intake and the docosahexaenoic acid proportions in human <e>milk</e>.BACKGROUND: The genes encoding Delta(5)- and Delta(6)-desaturases (FADS1 FADS2 gene cluster) were reported to be associated with n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) fatty acid proportions in human plasma, tissues, and milk. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can be supplied especially by dietary fish or fish oil and synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid through a pathway involving these desaturases. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether FADS gene variants modify the effect of maternal fish and fish-oil intake on plasma and milk DHA proportions. DESIGN: FADS1 rs174561, FADS2 rs174575, and intergenic rs3834458 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 309 women from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study in The Netherlands. Plasma was collected at 36 wk of pregnancy, and milk was collected at 1 mo postpartum. Fish and fish-oil intake was assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire at 34 wk of pregnancy and updated for the week of milk collection. Gene-diet interactions were tested by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: DHA proportions were lower in women homozygous for the minor allele than in women who were homozygous for the major allele (DHA proportions in plasma phospholipids: P &lt; 0.01; DHA proportions in milk: P &lt; 0.05). Fish intake ranged from 0 to 2.5 portions of fatty fish/wk, and 12 women took fish-oil supplements during pregnancy. DHA proportions in plasma phospholipids increased with increasing fish and fish-oil intake, irrespective of the genotype. DHA proportions in milk increased only with fish and fish-oil intake in the major-allele carriers. CONCLUSION: Lower proportions of DHA in milk from women who were homozygous for the minor allele could not be compensated for by increasing fish and fish-oil intake, possibly because of limited incorporation into milk.",M2

Chinese technical sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-PCP) has been used to control the spread of snail-borne schistosomiasis since the 1960s. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), impurities contained in the Na-PCP, enter the soil and may accumulate in the food chain. In order to evaluate their potentially harmful effects on local residents, 50 breast milk samples and 20 blood samples were collected in 2004 from residents in the Dongting Lake area, one of China's known schistosomiasis areas. Levels of 17 PCDD/F congeners were measured in all samples, and DNA damage was simultaneously assessed in blood samples. The PCDD/F congener distribution patterns in human tissue samples from the Dongting Lake area were similar to those in Na-PCP, and the octachlorodibenzodioxin (OCDD) congener was predominant in all samples. We also had a primary investigation that the breast milk WHO-TEQ associated with some factors such as: age, dietary habit, body mass index (BMI) and the total menses times. In blood samples, the samples with higher OCDD level had higher DDS (DNA damage score) values than those samples with low OCDD level, which indicated that the higher DNA damage value in general population might be caused directly or indirectly by PCDD/Fs. The results also indicated that the WHO-TEQ values in blood were associated with age (r=0.6, p=0.007).",M2
20236698,"Increased risk of eczema but reduced risk of early wheezy disorder from exclusive breast-feeding in high-risk infants.BACKGROUND: Breast-feeding is recommended for the prevention of eczema, asthma, and allergy, particularly in high-risk families, but recent studies have raised concern that this may not protect children and may even increase the risk. However, disease risk, disease manifestation, lifestyle, and the choice to breast-feed are interrelated, and therefore, analyzing true causal effects presents a number of methodologic challenges. OBJECTIVE: First, to assess the effect from duration of exclusive breast-feeding on the development of eczema and wheezy disorders during the first 2 years of life in a high-risk clinical birth cohort. Second, to assess any influence from the fatty acid composition of mother's <e>milk</e> on the risk from breast-feeding. METHODS: We studied disease development during the first two years of life of the 411 infants from the Copenhagen Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) birth cohort, born to mothers with a history of asthma. We analyzed the effect from duration of breast-feeding before disease onset on the disease risk, avoiding the effect from disease-related modification of exposure (inverse causation). Polyunsaturated fatty acids were measured in breast milk. RESULTS: Breast-feeding significantly increased the risk of eczema adjusted for demographics, filaggrin variants, parents' eczema, and pets at home (N = 306; relative risk, 2.09; 95% CI 1.15-3.80; P = .016) but reduced the risk of wheezy episodes (relative risk, 0.67; 95% CI 0.48-0.96; P = .021) and of severe wheezy exacerbation (relative risk, 0.16; 95% CI 0.03-1.01; P = .051). There was no association between the fatty acid composition of mother's milk and the risk of eczema or wheeze. Conclusion: The risk of eczema was increased in infants with increasing duration of breast-feeding. In contrast, the risk of wheezy disorder and severe wheezy exacerbations was reduced. There were no significant effects from the fatty acid composition of the breast milk on risk of eczema or wheezy disorders.",M2

The source of HTLV-I-infected cells in breast milk has been thought to be T cells, however, the majority of cells in breast milk are CD14(+) macrophages but not CD3(+) T lymphocytes, and no data are available regarding HTLV-I transmission through breast milk macrophages (BrMMpsi). To explore the potential of BrMMpsi as a possible source of infection in mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HTLV-I, an immortalized cell line (HTLV-BrMMpsi) has been established from BrMMpsi by infection with HTLV-I. HTLV-BrMMpsi retained macrophage characteristics and did not express a complete dendritic cell (DC) phenotype; nevertheless, HTLV-BrMMpsi efficiently promoted T cell proliferation in primary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) like DC. Moreover, HTLV-I infection could be transmitted from HTLV-BrMMpsi to activated T cells in the peripheral blood. These findings suggested that BrMMpsi might be an appropriate HTLV-I reservoir involved in MTCT transmission via breastfeeding.",M2

It contains many nutrients, anti-infectious and biologically active substance. Human milk also contains many angiogenic polypeptides. We have determined four of these: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), insulin-like growth factor- I (IGF-I) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of VEGF, b-FGF, IGF-I and PDGF in human milk collected from mothers with preterm and term neonates. Human milk samples were collected from 29 mothers of preterm (&lt;37 weeks) and from 29 mothers of term (38&gt;weeks) infants at days 3, 7 and 28 postpartum. Milk samples were analyzed for VEGF, b-FGF and PDGF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IGF-I was measured by radioimmunoassay method. Human milk levels of VEGF, IGF-I and b-FGF were significantly higher (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, within-preterm group concentrations of VEGF, IGF-I and PDGF significantly differed during postpartum days 3-7-28 (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.001, respectively), but did not do so for b-FGF concentrations. In term groups, concentrations of IGF-I and VEGF significantly differed (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.001, respectively), but did not do so for concentrations of b-FGF and PDGF. This is the first report of simultaneous measurements of four major angiogenic factors in human milk collected from mothers with preterm and term.

20184992,"Enteral nutrition in children with short-bowel syndrome: current evidence and recommendations for the clinician.The optimal enteral feeding regimen in children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) is debated by clinicians. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of published data on feeding strategies in children with SBS. A structured literature search (years 1966 through 2007) was done to identify human studies in children directly addressing nutrition (or specified nutrients) in relation to SBS. Eight relevant studies retrieved were graded by seven experts according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. This grading system is based on the study design and methodological quality of individual studies. Recommendations were made based on the outcome according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network if appropriate and on expert opinion otherwise. The most important recommendations are: Enteral nutrition should be initiated as soon as possible after bowel resection to promote intestinal adaptation. Enteral nutrition should be administered in a continuous fashion. Breast <e>milk</e> or standard polymeric formula (depending on the child's age) is recommended as preferred type of nutrition. Bottle-feeding (small volumes) should be started as soon as possible in neonates to stimulate the suck and swallow reflexes. Solid food can be introduced at the age of 4 to 6 months (corrected for gestational age if necessary) to stimulate oral motor activity and to avoid feeding aversion behavior. The team of experts concluded that high-quality research on the preferred types of enteral and oral nutrition in children with SBS is scarce. Multicenter prospective studies on the effects of feeding strategies on bowel adaptation, fecal production, linear growth, and clinical outcome are required to find the optimal feeding regimen in children with SBS.",M2
20184400,"Optimization of human <e>milk</e> fortification for preterm infants: new concepts and recommendations.Preterm infants fed fortified human milk (HM) in standard (STD) fashion grow slower than preterm formula fed infants. Recently, low protein intake has been proven to be the primary limiting factor responsible for this growth failure. The main reason of protein undernutrition despite fortification is that STD fortification is based on the customary assumptions about the composition of HM. However, the protein concentration of preterm HM is variable and decreases with the duration of lactation. Also, the protein concentration of banked donor milk, which is most often provided by mothers of term infants, is likely to be lower. Hence, most of the HM fed to preterm infants during the fortification period is likely to have an inadequately low protein concentration. This hypothesis has been confirmed very recently by comparing the assumed and actual protein intakes in preterm infants fed fortified HM. Novel fortification models have been devised to deal with the problem of ongoing protein undernutrition. Individualized fortification is the recommended method to optimize HM fortification. There are two models of individualization:  adjustable fortification  and  targeted fortification . Both ways are feasible and effective in improving protein intakes and growth. Adjustable fortification has the advantage of being practical and avoids excessive protein intakes.",M2
20172207,"Maintenance of breast <e>milk</e> Immunoglobulin A after high-pressure processing.Human milk is considered the optimal nutritional source for infants. Banked human milk is processed using low-temperature, long-time pasteurization, which assures microbial safety but involves heat denaturation of some desirable milk components such as IgA. High-pressure processing technology, the subject of the current research, has shown minimal destruction of food macromolecules. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of pressure treatments on IgA content. Moreover, bacterial load was evaluated after pressure treatments. The effects of high-pressure processing on milk IgA content were compared with those of low-temperature, long-time pasteurization. Mature human milk samples were heat treated at 62.5 degrees C for 30min or pressure processed at 400, 500, or 600MPa for 5min at 12 degrees C. An indirect ELISA was used to measure IgA in human milk whey obtained after centrifugation at 800xg for 10min at 4 degrees C. All 3 high-pressure treatments were as effective as low-temperature, long-time pasteurization in reducing the bacterial population of the human milk samples studied. After human milk pressure processing at 400MPa, 100% of IgA content was preserved in milk whey, whereas only 72% was retained in pasteurized milk whey. The higher pressure conditions of 500 and 600MPa produced IgA retention of 87.9 and 69.3%, respectively. These results indicate that high-pressure processing at 400MPa for 5min at 12 degrees C maintains the immunological protective capacity associated with IgA antibodies. This preliminary study suggests that high-pressure processing may be a promising alternative to pasteurization in human milk banking.",M2

20105666,"The mucosal immune system and its integration with the mammary glands.Mucosal immunity reduces the need for elimination of penetrating exogenous antigens by proinflammatory systemic immunity. The adult gut mucosa contains some 80% of the body's activated B cells-differentiated to plasmablasts and plasma cells (PCs). Most mucosal PCs produce dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA), which, along with pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM), can be exported by secretory epithelia expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. Immune exclusion of antigens is performed mainly by secretory IgA in cooperation with innate defenses, but, in newborns and in IgA deficiency, secretory IgM is important. In the gut, induction and regulation of mucosal immunity occurs primarily in gut-associated lymphoid tissue-particularly the Peyer's patches-and also in mesenteric lymph nodes. Terminal differentiation to PCs is accomplished in the lamina propria to which the activated memory/effector T and B cells home. Lactating mammary glands are part of the secretory immune system, and IgA antibodies in breast <e>milk</e> reflect antigenic stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue such as the tonsils. Breast-milk antibodies are thus highly targeted against infectious agents and other exogenous antigens in the mother's environment, which are those likely to be encountered by the infant.

20105665,"Characteristics and potential functions of human <e>milk</e> adiponectin.Adiponectin is a protein hormone produced by adipose tissue, whose circulating levels are inversely related to adiposity and inflammation. Adiponectin circulates as oligomers, from the low-molecular-weight trimer to the high-molecular-weight octodecamer (18 mer). Each oligomer has distinct biological activities, which include enhancement of insulin sensitivity and metabolic control and suppression of inflammation. Adiponectin occurs in human milk at higher concentrations than leptin. The adiponectin in human milk is almost entirely of the high-molecular-weight form, the form with the highest activity in controlling many types of metabolic processes. Human adiponectin fed to infant mice is transported across the intestinal mucosa into the serum. An inverse relationship between adiponectin levels in milk and adiposity (weight-for-height) of the breast-fed infant was observed and could be due to modulation of infant metabolism by milk adiponectin and may be related to the observed protection against obesity by breast-feeding. Human milk may be a medium whereby the hormonal milieu (in response to internal factors and the environment) of the mother can be used to communicate with the breast-fed infant to modify infant metabolic processes. Transmission of information from mother to infant through milk may allow adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.",M2
20105664,"Cytokines in human <e>milk</e>.Epidemiologic studies conducted in the past 30 years to investigate the protective functions of human milk strongly support the notion that breastfeeding prevents infantile infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. However, more recent clinical and experimental observations also suggest that human milk not only provides passive protection, but also can directly modulate the immunological development of the recipient infant. The study of this remarkable defense system in human milk has been difficult because of its biochemical complexity, the small concentration of certain bioactive components, the compartmentalization of some of these agents, the dynamic quantitative and qualitative changes of milk during lactation, and the lack of specific reagents to quantify these agents. However, a host of bioactive substances, including hormones, growth factors, and immunological factors such as cytokines, have been identified in human milk. Cytokines are pluripotent polypeptides that act in autocrine/paracrine fashions by binding to specific cellular receptors. They operate in networks and orchestrate the development and functions of immune system. Several different cytokines and chemokines have been discovered in human milk in the past years, and the list is growing very rapidly. This article will review the current knowledge about the increasingly complex network of chemoattractants, activators, and anti-inflammatory cytokines present in human milk and their potential role in compensating for the developmental delay of the neonate immune system.",M2

In the early postnatal period, breast milk is the major source of EGF for the developing intestinal mucosa. HB-EGF is also detected in breast milk, but in concentrations 2 to 3 times lower than EGF. With normal physiological conditions, the intestinal epithelium undergoes a continuing process of cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. EGF plays an important role in these processes. In pathophysiologic situations, EGF contributes to epithelial protection from injury and post-injury mucosal repair. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease affecting infants born prematurely. The pathogenesis of NEC is not known, and there is no effective treatment for this disease. In an experimental NEC model, oral administration of a physiological dose of EGF significantly reduces the incidence and severity of NEC. HB-EGF provides similar protection against NEC, but only when pharmacological doses are used. Further studies are necessary before EGF can be introduced as an efficient therapeutic approach of intestinal injury.",M2
20105662,"Breast <e>milk</e> as the gold standard for protective nutrients.In this introductory overview, I explore the observation that breast milk is the gold standard for protective nutrients fed to newborn infants and present clinical evidence of its strong protective effect against age-related infectious gastroenteritis. The composition of breast milk changes according to the newborn infant's needs for passive protection. In addition, substances in breast milk can actively stimulate development of the newborn's host defenses to provide continued mucosal protection after breastfeeding is terminated. Later I present several specific examples of the development of intestinal host defenses due to breastfeeding. An important function of early breastfeeding is its anti-inflammatory effect on the immature, excessive inflammatory response in newborns. Several components of breast milk can reduce the inflammatory response to stimuli in the newborn intestine. These include transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, interleukin (IL)-10, erythropoietin, and lactoferrin. These components of breast milk can act individually or in concert to contain the neonatal immature anti-inflammatory response.",M2
20105661,"Bioactive proteins in human <e>milk</e>: mechanisms of action.Human milk contains a multitude of bioactive proteins, with very diverse functions. Some of these proteins are involved in the synthesis and expression of milk, but the majority appears to have evolved to provide physiological activities in the breast-fed infant. These activities are exerted by a wide variety of mechanisms and have largely been unraveled by in vitro studies. To be active in the gastrointestinal tract, these proteins must be able to resist proteolytic degradation, at least for some time. We have evaluated the human milk proteins lactoferrin, haptocorrin, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, and transforming growth factor -beta in an in vitro digestion model, mimicking the conditions of the infant gastrointestinal milieu. These bioactive proteins are resistant against proteolysis and can remain intact or as larger fragments through passage of the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestibility assays can be helpful to assess which human milk proteins can resist proteolysis and to what extent.",M2
20105660,"<e>Milk</e>-derived transforming growth factor-beta and the infant immune response.Breast milk cytokines have the potential to regulate the immune response to food antigens in infants. Cytokines are present in all mammalian milks and are capable of inhibiting excess inflammation and modulating epithelial proliferation. There are a range of candidate cytokines in milk such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the major cytokine present, and interleukin-10, which play a role in immune regulation in the developing infant. This article will be a review of the current literature with regard to TGF-beta in infant immune development. Our data on supplementation of formula with rTGF-beta2 will be discussed in view of the current literature. Oral antigen exposure also plays an important role in priming the developing immune response. The influence of early introduction of oral beta-lactoglobulin in allergy prone rat pups will also be discussed.",M2

20148367,"Trans fatty acids in human <e>milk</e> are an indicator of different maternal dietary sources containing trans fatty acids.The trans fatty acid (TFA) patterns in the fats of ruminant meat and dairy products differ from those found in other (processed) fats. We have evaluated different TFA isomers in human breast milk as an indicator of dietary intake of ruminant and dairy fats of different origins. Breast milk samples were collected 1 month postpartum from 310 mothers participating in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (The Netherlands). The study participants had different lifestyles and consumed different amounts of dairy products. Fatty acid methyl esters were determined by GC-FID and the data were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA), ANOVA/Post Hoc test and linear regression analysis. The two major principal components were (1) 18:1 trans-isomers and (2) markers of dairy fat including 15:0, 17:0, 11(trans)18:1 and 9(cis),11(trans)18:2 (CLA). Despite similar total TFA values, the 9(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio and the 10(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio were significantly lower in milk from mothers with high dairy fat intake (40-76 g/day: 0.91 +/- 0.48, P &lt; 0.05) compared to low dairy fat intake (0-10 g/day: 1.59 +/- 0.48), and lower with strict organic meat and dairy use (&gt;90% organic: 0.92 +/- 0.46, P &lt; 0.05) compared to conventional origin of meat and dairy (1.40 +/- 0.61). Similar results were obtained for the 10(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio. We conclude that both ratios are indicators of different intake of TFA from ruminant and dairy origin relative to other (including industrial) sources.",M2
20139617,"Determination of sialyl and neutral oligosaccharide levels in transition and mature <e>milks</e> of Samoan women, using anthranilic derivatization followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.An improved analytical method using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography following anthranilic acid derivatization for the measurement of each oligosaccharide level in transition (5 to 10 d lactation) and mature (21 to 155 d lactation) milks of sixteen Samoan women is described. The method was applied for the measurement of sialyl as well as neutral oligosaccharide levels. We found that disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT), sialylacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc), and 6'-sialyllactose (6'-SL) were the most abundant of the sialyl oligosaccharides. In the neutral oligosaccharide fraction, lacto-N-fucopentaose II and III combined (LNFP II+III) were the most dominant, followed by lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL). 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-fucopentaose I (LNFP I) were absent in some and found at low levels in most of the Samoan women. Our study indicates that the milk oligosaccharide composition in Samoan women is similar to that of Japanese women with respect to sialyl but not to neutral oligosaccharides. The differences in neutral oligosaccharides might have a genetic origin.",M2

In this study, phylogenic analysis of envelope sequences of milk SIV variants revealed groups of nearly identical viruses, indicating local virus production. However, comparison of the patterns and rates of CTL escape of blood and milk virus demonstrated only subtle differences between the compartments. These findings suggest that a substantial fraction of milk viruses are produced by locally-infected cells, but are shaped by cellular immune pressures similar to that in the blood.",M2

20121424,"Associations between breast <e>milk</e> viral load, mastitis, exclusive breast-feeding, and postnatal transmission of HIV.BACKGROUND:. Exclusive breast-feeding is protective against postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), compared with mixed breast-feeding. Accordingly, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is the World Health Organization's recommendation to HIV-infected mothers for whom exclusive replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable, safe, or sustainable. The mechanism of exclusive breast-feeding protection is unknown but is hypothesized to be mediated through reduced mastitis. METHODS: We compared breast milk and plasma specimens of exclusive breast-feeding and mixed breast-feeding HIV- positive mothers archived from the ZVITAMBO trial in which mixed breast-feeding was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of postnatal transmission at 18 months. Plasma HIV load, breast milk HIV load and sodium/potassium ratio were measured as a proxy for subclinical mastitis. RESULTS: Mixed breast-feeding was not associated with mastitis or breast milk HIV load. Mastitis was associated with breast milk HIV load, and this effect increased with increasing maternal plasma HIV load; mastitis was associated with postnatal transmission only when maternal plasma HIV load was high (&gt;3.7 log(10) copies/mL). Initiation of breast-feeding within an hour of delivery was associated with exclusive breast-feeding (adjusted odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breast-feeding is associated with reduced postnatal transmission of HIV from mother to child, but this protection is not mediated by reduced mastitis or breast milk HIV load. The deleterious effect of mastitis increases as the mother's plasma HIV load increases.",M2

Levels of PBDEs, but not PCBs and HBCDs, were significantly higher in Trang Minh and Bui Dau than in the reference site. The recyclers from Bui Dau had the highest levels of PBDEs (20-250 ng g(-1) lipid wt.), higher than in the reference group by two orders of magnitude and more abundant than PCBs (28-59 ng g(-1) lipid wt.), and were also the only group with significant exposure to HBCDs (1.4-7.6 ng g(-1) lipid wt.). A specific accumulation, unrelated to diet, of low-chlorinated PCBs and high-brominated PBDEs was observed in e-waste recyclers, suggesting extensive exposure to these compounds during e-waste recycling activities, possibly through inhalation and ingestion of dust. The estimated infant intake dose of PBDEs from breast milk of some mothers occupationally involved in e-waste recycling were close to or higher than the reference doses issued by the U.S. EPA.",M2
20113201,"The initial maternal cost of providing 100 mL of human <e>milk</e> for very low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.OBJECTIVES: Human milk (HM) feeding is associated with lower incidence and severity of costly prematurity-specific morbidities compared to formula feeding in very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt;1,500 g) infants. However, the costs of providing HM are not routinely reimbursed by payers and can be a significant barrier for mothers. This study determined the initial maternal cost of providing 100 mL of HM for VLBW infants during the early neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. METHODS: This secondary analysis examined data from 111 mothers who provided HM for their VLBW infants during the early NICU stay. These data were collected during a multisite, randomized clinical trial where milk output and time spent pumping were recorded for every pumping session (n = 13,273). The cost analysis examined the cost of the breast pump rental, pump kit, and maternal opportunity cost (an estimate of the cost of maternal time). RESULTS: Mean daily milk output and time spent pumping were 558.2 mL (SD = 320.7; range = 0-2,024) and 98.7 minutes (SD = 38.6; range = 0-295), respectively. The mean cost of providing 100 mL of HM varied from $2.60 to $6.18 when maternal opportunity cost was included and from $0.95 to $1.55 when it was excluded. The cost per 100 mL of HM declined with every additional day of pumping and was most sensitive to the costs of the breast pump rental and pump kit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that HM is reasonably inexpensive to provide and that the maternal cost of providing milk is mitigated by increasing milk output over the early NICU stay.",M2

In total, 199 women were randomly allocated to 3 groups and supplemented in the postpartum period with a single retinyl palmitate dose of 200 000 IU (S1), a double dose of 200 000 IU 24 hours apart (S2), or no supplementation (C). Retinol content of colostrum and mature milk at 4 weeks was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For colostrum, no significant difference was found between the groups (P = .965). The retinol content in mature milk differed between group C and groups S1 and S2 (P &lt; .05). The double dose of vitamin A did not significantly increase the retinol content of milk at 4 weeks postpartum in comparison to a single dose; however, future research is needed to determine the optimal timing of the second dose of vitamin A.",M2

Mesylate esters have been found in pharmaceuticals as contaminants formed during the manufacturing process and may potentially pose an exposure hazard to humans. We have developed and validated a method for detection of trace amounts (ng/ml levels) of EMS in human plasma and breast milk. The samples were extracted by matrix solid-phase dispersion with ethyl acetate using Hydromatrix and the ASE 200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor. The extracts were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a HILIC column. The detection was performed with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantum Ultra, Thermo Electron Corporation) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in negative-ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring. The use of a surrogate internal standard in combination with HPLC-MS/MS provided a high degree of accuracy and precision. The extraction efficiency was greater than 70%. Repeated analyses of plasma and breast milk samples spiked with high (100 ng/ml), medium (50 ng/ml) and low (5 ng/ml) concentrations of the analytes gave relative standard deviations of less than 12%. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.5-0.9 ng/ml for both matrices.",M2
20098341,"Correlation of 2-methoxyestradiol levels in cord blood and complications of prematurity.2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a potent antiangiogenic molecule that inhibits the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and, consequently, of VEGF and other HIF-1alpha target genes.

20079522,"Partitioning of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in serum and <e>milk</e> from the same mothers.We and others have previously described partitioning of chemicals, including polychlorinated-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and biphenyls in different types of human tissues and fluids, including blood and milk. Additionally, we previously reported the blood to milk partitioning of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a group of 11 women. Partitioning is of importance in understanding the toxicokinetics of these compounds and also in clinical medicine in improving estimates of levels in different matrices including blood and milk. In this study we extend these findings, describing the levels of PBDEs detected in the serum and milk of 29 women from Texas. The median sum of the levels of the four most detected congeners (BDE 47, 99, 100, and 153) in serum was 27.8 ng g(-1) lipid (range 6.7-501.6 ng g(-1) lipid). In milk, the median sum of the levels of the same congeners was 39.7 ng g(-1) lipid (range 12.9-580.3 ng g(-1) lipid). The levels detected in breast milk in this study are similar to those we reported in 2003, where a median total PBDE level of 34 ng g(-1) lipid was reported. When congener specific blood to milk partitioning ratios were calculated for BDEs 47, 99, 100, and 153, the relatively small tetrabrominated congener, BDE 47, was found in higher concentrations in milk compared to blood, while the higher molecular weight hexabrominated congener, BDE 153, was found in approximately equal quantities in blood and milk, on a lipid normalized basis. The reason for the differential partitioning of PBDE congeners in milk and blood could be due to variation in toxicokinetics, specifically distribution based on molecular size or molecular weight.",M2
20079491,"Lead levels in <e>milk</e> and blood from donors to the Breast Milk Bank in Southern Brazil.Brazilian scientific literature on the adverse effects of lead on the general population is still very limited. Lead, a potentially toxic substance, has become a public health problem due to its effects, mainly those affecting the central nervous system and on the synthesis of heme. The aim of this study is to evaluate the level of lead exposure of donors to the Breast Milk Bank in the city of Londrina, Parana, by estimating the levels of that metal in milk and blood samples. This is a cross-sectional study conducted during the period between January and July 2007. All mothers enrolled as donors in the Breast Milk Bank were included in this study. A total of 92 volunteers presenting the following inclusion criteria were evaluated in the project: volunteers who were healthy, without any chronic disease, full-term pregnancy, breastfeeding between the 15th and 210 th day after giving birth, and living in the city of the study. Lead in milk and blood was quantified using the inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) technique. All mothers signed a consent form approved by the Research Ethics Committee from Londrina State University. The median lead concentration in milk samples was 3.0 microg/L, varying from 1.0 to 8.0 microg/L. The median of lead in blood was of 2.7 microg/dl, varying from 1.0 to 5.5 microg/dl. In Spearman correlation analysis, significant but modest correlations could be observed between the concentration of lead in blood and in milk (r(s)=0.207, p=0.048), hemoglobin and ALAD activity (r(s)=-0.264, p=0.011), level of lead in blood and mother's age (r(s)=0.227, p=0.029). However, for hematocrit and hemoglobin, the correlation was higher (r(s)=0.837, p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant associations were found between concentrations of lead in milk and blood and demographic variables studied, obtained through interviews and validated questionnaire.

20071328,"Osteopontin is cleaved at multiple sites close to its integrin-binding motifs in <e>milk</e> and is a novel substrate for plasmin and cathepsin D.Osteopontin (OPN) is a highly modified integrin-binding protein present in most tissues and body fluids where it has been implicated in numerous biological processes. A significant regulation of OPN function is mediated through phosphorylation and proteolytic processing. Proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and matrix metalloproteinases close to the integrin-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence modulates the function of OPN and its integrin binding properties. In this study, seven N-terminal OPN fragments originating from proteolytic cleavage have been characterized from human milk. Identification of the cleavage sites revealed that all fragments contained the Arg-Gly-Asp(145) sequence and were generated by cleavage of the Leu(151)-Arg(152), Arg(152)-Ser(153), Ser(153)-Lys(154), Lys(154)-Ser(155), Ser(155)-Lys(156), Lys(156)-Lys(157), or Phe(158)-Arg(159) peptide bonds. Six cleavages cannot be ascribed to thrombin or matrix metalloproteinase activity, whereas the cleavage at Arg(152)-Ser(153) matches thrombin specificity for OPN. The principal protease in milk, plasmin, hydrolyzed the same peptide bond as thrombin, but its main cleavage site was identified to be Lys(154)-Ser(155). Another endogenous milk protease, cathepsin D, cleaved the Leu(151)-Arg(152) bond. OPN fragments corresponding to plasmin activity were also identified in urine showing that plasmin cleavage of OPN is not restricted to milk. Plasmin, but not cathepsin D, cleavage of OPN increased cell adhesion mediated by the alpha(V)beta(3)- or alpha(5)beta(1)-integrins. Similar cellular adhesion was mediated by plasmin and thrombin-cleaved OPN showing that plasmin can be a potent regulator of OPN activity. These data show that OPN is highly susceptible to cleavage near its integrin-binding motifs, and the protein is a novel substrate for plasmin and cathepsin D.",M2
20056574,"Individual characteristics associated with PBDE levels in U.S. human <e>milk</e> samples.BACKGROUND: Reported polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) concentrations in human samples in the United States have been higher than in Europe and Asia. Little is known about factors that contribute to individual variability in body burden. OBJECTIVE: In this large study we measured PBDE concentrations in human milk from the United States during 2004-2006. We assessed characteristics associated with concentrations in milk and change in milk concentration between 3 and 12 months postpartum. METHODS: We analyzed 303 milk samples obtained 3 months postpartum for PBDEs. A second sample was analyzed for 83 women still lactating 12 months postpartum. PBDE concentrations in milk and variability by individual characteristics such as age, parity, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) were evaluated using generalized linear models. RESULTS: PBDE congeners BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, and 153 were detected in &gt; 70% of samples. BDE-47 concentrations were the highest, ranging from below the limit of detection to 1,430 ng/g lipid, with a median of 28 ng/g lipid. Concentrations of most individual PBDE congeners and the sum of BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, and 153 (SigmaPBDE) were lower among mothers &gt; 34 years of age compared with those 25-29 years of age and higher among mothers with high compared with normal BMI, after adjustment for other covariates. Parity was not associated with PBDE concentration. The change in SigmaPBDE concentration in milk between 3 and 12 months postpartum was highly variable (median increase, 14%; interquartile range, -26% to 50%). CONCLUSIONS: PBDEs were detected in nearly all human milk samples, varying by maternal weight and age and over the course of breast-feeding.",M2

Four focus groups were conducted to explore: (1) beliefs about infant feeding, hunger and ideal weight; (2) feeding practices; (3) nutrition education approaches; and (4) provider/mother interactions. Thirty-seven Somali mother participants identified the following themes within these topics: (1) strategies for assessing hunger, satiety and when to feed; shared beliefs that plump babies are healthy, leading to worry about infant weight; (2) context of breast <e>milk</e> adequacy, difficulties breastfeeding and environmental and cultural barriers to breastfeeding, leading to nearly universal early supplementation with formula; (3) preferred education approaches include provider visits with interpreters, Somali language educational materials and advice from older, experienced family members; and (4) desired health provider skills include: listening, explaining, empathy, addressing specific concerns, repeating important information, offering preventive advice and sufficient visit time. This study presents knowledge about Somali beliefs and practices that can directly guide discussions with these families. Given that these infants appear on a trajectory towards obesity, influencing infant feeding practices in the Somali community is a good upstream approach to preventing obesity.

Prospective cohort study design allows for the identification of exposures that may influence pregnancy outcome and children's health, verification of such exposures by biomarker measurements and notification of any changes in exposure level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study (REPRO_PL) is multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in 8 different regions of Poland. The final cohort is intended to comprise 1300 mother-child pairs to be recruited within 4-year period (2007-2011). The recruitment and all scheduled visits are conducted in maternity units or clinics in the districts included in the study. The women are followed-up 3 times in pregnancy (once in each trimester) and after delivery for the notification of pregnancy outcome. During each visit, detailed questionnaire and biological samples are collected including saliva, urine, hair, maternal blood and cord blood. About 6 weeks postpartum, breast <e>milk</e> from part of the women is collected. The study concentrates on the identification and evaluation of the effects of prenatal environmental exposure on pregnancy outcome and children's health. Specific research hypotheses refer to the role of heavy metals, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the aetiology of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and preterm delivery (PD). The role of oxidative stress putative mechanism and pregnant women nutritional status will be investigated.

Artificially contaminated human milk samples were treated with ultrasound (20 kHz, 150 watts) with and without heating. The retention of four human milk proteins was quantified by biochemical assay and laser scattering particle sizing was used to determine the extent of homogenization. While ultrasonic treatment was effective at inactivating Escherichia coli (D4 degrees C=5.94 min), Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited resistance (D4 degrees C=16.01 min). Thermoultrasonic treatment was considerably more effective (Esch. coli D45 degrees C=1.74 min, D50 degrees C=0.89 min; Staph. epidermidis D45 degrees C=2.08 min, D50 degrees C=0.94 minutes) with a predicted retention (2.8 min treatment, 50 degrees C) of secretory IgA lysozyme, lactoferrin and bile salt stimulated lipase of 91, 80, 77, and 45%, respectively. Homogenization of the milk samples occurred after 5 min and 2 min of ultrasonic and thermoultrasonic treatment, respectively. Thermoultrasonic treatment is an effective method for pasteurizing donor human milk and retaining a greater proportion of bioactive components compared with current practices. However, further studies are required to assess the practicality of applying this technique routinely to donor human milk.",M2

20043434,"Psychological stress and breast diseases during lactation.Termination of breastfeeding in the first six months after childbirth is frequently caused by breastfeeding-related diseases and problems of the breast such as pain, <e>milk</e> stasis or mastitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between psychological stress and the occurrence of breastfeeding associated disorders. In a prospective cohort study of 379 primiparous women without breast anomalies or diseases, psychometric data were collected from participants between the confirmation of the pregnancy and one year post-partum. Primarily, standardised questionnaires (PSQ, WHO QoL and F-SOZU K22) were used for data analysis while additional data was gathered in follow-up interviews. The subgroup analysis showed a significant relationship between stress and breastfeeding-related diseases. Women with pain, cracked nipples, milk stasis or mastitis reported a higher stress level than women without breast problems. Additionally, the majority of women with breast problems and increased psychological stress gave up breastfeeding sooner and, in contrast to the group without problems, indicated significantly more frequently that the milk quantity was insufficient. Breast diseases during lactation are associated with higher levels of psychological stress. Further studies are needed to examine the causes of the higher stress in order to develop strategies to prolong breastfeeding duration.",M2
20041493,"Early lifestage exposure and potential developmental susceptibility to tetrachloroethylene.BACKGROUND: Tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene or  perc , is a highly volatile and lipophilic solvent widely used in dry cleaning, textile processing, and metal-cleaning operations. The limited epidemiological and toxicological data available for exposure to perc during developmental lifestages, as well as the evidence for critical windows of exposure, highlight early life as a period of potential susceptibility. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify all peer-reviewed epidemiological and toxicologial studies examining outcomes from early lifestage exposure to perc, and reviewed by developmental stage for both exposure and outcome. RESULTS: Exposure scenarios to perc unique to early lifestages include transplacental and breast <e>milk</e> intake, along with inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure. Toxicokinetics factors that may influence early lifestage susceptibility to perc, along with existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, are described. Adverse outcomes examined include: reproductive outcomes examined prior to conception including reduced fertility, adverse effects on sperm, or altered reproductive hormones; prenatal outcomes examined after exposure prior to conception or prenatally including fetal death, birth defects, and decreased birth weight; postnatal outcomes examined after exposure prior to conception, prenatally, or during childhood including neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cancer, hepatotoxicity, congential anomalies and mortality; and adult schizophrenia examined after exposure prior to conception. CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence on early lifestage exposure to perc does not provide sufficient evidence of this sensitive period as being more or less important than exposure at a later lifestage, such as during adulthood. However, there are a number of adverse health effects observed uniquely in early lifestages, and increased sensitivity to visual system deficits is suggested in children. Other outcomes observed in adults may not have been adequately assessed in children to directly compare sensitivity.",M2

20034337,"Breastfeeding in HIV-positive women: What can be recommended?Breastfeeding remains a common practice in parts of the world where the burden of HIV is highest and the fewest alternative feeding options exist. The impossible dilemma faced by HIV-positive mothers is whether to breastfeed their infants in keeping with cultural norms but in doing so risk transmitting the virus through breast <e>milk</e>, or to pursue formula feeding, which comes with its own set of risks, including a higher rate of infant mortality from diarrheal illnesses, while reducing transmission of HIV. Treatment of mothers and/or their infants with antiretroviral drugs is a strategy that has been employed for several decades to reduce HIV transmission through pregnancy and delivery, but the effect of these agents when taken during breastfeeding is a newer field of study. In this article we evaluate the latest clinical research, from trials that encourage exclusive breastfeeding to trials of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for either the mother or infant, in an attempt to prevent transmission of HIV through breast milk. Additionally, we discuss research that is in progress, with results anticipated in the next few years that will further shape clinical guidelines and practice. Exclusive breastfeeding is much safer than mixed feeding (the supplementation of breastfeeding with other foods), and should be encouraged even in settings where ART for either the mother or infant is not readily available. The research published regarding maternal treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period has all been non-randomized with relatively little statistical power, but suggests maternal HAART can drastically reduce the risk of transmission of HIV. Infant prophylaxis has been intensively studied in several trials and has been shown to be as effective as maternal treatment with antiretrovirals, reducing the transmission rate after 6 weeks to as low as 1.2%. Research that is in progress will provide us with more answers about the relative contribution of maternal treatment and infant prophylaxis in preventing transmission, and the results of such research may be expected as early as this year through 2013. There is hope that perinatal HIV transmission may be greatly reduced in breastfeeding populations worldwide through a combination of behavioral interventions that encourage exclusive breastfeeding and pharmacologic interventions with antiretrovirals for mothers and/or their infants.",M2
20032311,"Iron concentrations in breast <e>milk</e> and selected maternal factors of human milk bank donors.The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between iron concentration in mature breast milk and characteristics of 136 donors of a Brazilian milk bank. Iron, vitamin A, zinc, and copper concentrations were assessed in human milk and maternal blood. Data were collected on maternal anthropometrics, obstetric, socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle factors. Iron, zinc, and copper in milk and zinc and copper in blood were detected by spectrophotometry. Vitamin A in milk and blood was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Hemoglobin was measured by electronic counting and serum iron and ferritin by colorimetry and chemoluminescence, respectively. Transferrin and ceruloplasmin were determined by nephelometry. According to multivariate linear regression analysis, iron in milk was positively associated with vitamin A in milk and with smoking but negatively associated with timing of breast milk donation (P &lt; .001). These results indicate that iron concentration in milk of Brazilian donors may be influenced by nutritional factors and smoking.",M2
20029556,"[Environmental toxins in breast <e>milk</e>]BACKGROUND: Breast milk is very important to ensure infants a well-composed and safe diet during the first year of life. However, the quality of breast milk seems to be affected by an increasing amount of environmental toxins (particularly so-called Persistent, Bioaccumulative Toxins [PBTs]). Many concerns have been raised about the negative effects this may have on infant health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is a review of literature (mainly review articles) identified through a non-systematic search in PubMed. RESULTS: The concentration of PBTs in breast milk is mainly caused by man's position as the terminal link in the nutritional chain. Many breast-fed infants have a daily intake of such toxins that exceed limits defined for the population in general. Animal studies demonstrate effects on endocrine function and neurotoxicity in the offspring, and a number of human studies seem to point in the same direction. However the  original  optimal composition of breast milk still seems to protect against long-term effects of such toxicity. INTERPRETATION: There is international consensus about the need to monitor breast milk for the presence of PBTs. Such surveillance will be a good indicator of the population's general exposure to these toxins and may also contribute to identifying groups as risk who should not breast-feed their children for a long time.",M2
20019916,"Do human <e>milk</e> concentrations of persistent organic chemicals really decline during lactation? Chemical concentrations during lactation and milk/serum partitioning.BACKGROUND: Conventional wisdom regarding exposures to persistent organic chemicals via breast-feeding assumes that concentrations decline over the course of lactation and that the mother's body burden reflects her cumulative lifetime exposure. Two important implications stemming from these lines of thought are, first, that assessments of early childhood exposures should incorporate decreasing breast milk concentrations over lactation; and, second, that there is little a breast-feeding mother can do to reduce her infant's exposures via breast-feeding because of the cumulative nature of these chemicals. OBJECTIVES: We examined rates of elimination and milk/serum partition coefficients for several groups of persistent organic chemicals. METHODS: We collected simultaneous milk and blood samples of 10 women at two times postpartum and additional milk samples without matching blood samples. RESULTS: Contrary to earlier research, we found that lipid-adjusted concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans, and organochlorine pesticides in serum and milk do not consistently decrease during lactation and can increase for some women. Published research has also suggested an approximate 1:1 milk/serum relationship (lipid adjusted) on a population basis for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; however, our results suggest a more complex relationship for persistent, lipophilic chemicals with the milk/serum relationship dependent on chemical class. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in concentration of lipophilic chemicals on a lipid-adjusted basis during lactation should no longer be assumed. Thus, the concept of pumping and discarding early milk as means of reducing infant exposure is not supported. The hypothesis that persistent lipophilic chemicals, on a lipid-adjusted basis, have consistent concentrations across matrices is likely too simplistic.",M2
20019894,"Malaria control insecticide residues in breast <e>milk</e>: the need to consider infant health risks.BACKGROUND: In many parts of the world, deliberate indoor residual spraying (IRS) of dwellings with insecticides to control malaria transmission remains the only viable option, thereby unintentionally but inevitably also causing exposure to inhabitants. Because mothers are exposed to insecticides via various routes, accumulated residues are transferred to infants via breast milk, in some cases exceeding recommended intake levels. Except for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), safety of residues of other insecticides in breast milk has not been considered during World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) evaluations. However, very little is known of the health risks posed by these chemicals to infants who, in developing countries, breast-feed for up to 2 years. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the need for WHOPES to include breast milk as a potentially significant route of exposure and risk to infants when evaluating the risks during evaluation of IRS insecticides. DISCUSSION: We present evidence showing that neurologic and endocrine effects are associated with pyrethroids and DDT at levels equal or below known levels in breast milk. CONCLUSIONS: Because millions of people in malaria control areas experience conditions of multiple sources and routes of exposure to any number of insecticides, even though lives are saved through malaria prevention, identification of potential infant health risks associated with insecticide residues in breast milk must be incorporated in WHOPES evaluations and in the development of appropriate risk assessment tools.",M2
20011591,"Insufficient <e>milk</e> supply and breast cancer risk: a systematic review.BACKGROUND: An association between insufficient milk supply, the inability of a mother's breast milk to provide sufficiently for her infant, and breast cancer has been suggested by observations in animal models. To determine if an association has been reported in epidemiological studies of human breast cancer, a systematic review of the literature has been conducted. We also sought to identify the methodological limitations of existing studies to guide the design of any future prospective studies in this field. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and CAB abstracts were searched. We selected any study that (1) assessed breast cancer in association with breastfeeding history and (2) examined the relationship between insufficient milk supply with breast cancer. Seven relevant studies were identified that met both criteria. There was statistically significant heterogeneity among the results which likely reflects clinically significant differences in definitions of insufficient milk supply and reference groups that were used. Among premenopausal women who had experienced insufficient milk supply, odds ratios (ORs) for breast cancer risk ranged from 0.9 to 16.3. Among postmenopausal women, ORs ranged from 0.6 to 6.7. Based on the range of odds ratios obtained in the studies reported in this review, it remains unclear if there is a true association between insufficient milk supply and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although some studies have shown a strong positive association, there is no consistent evidence for an effect of insufficient milk supply on breast cancer risk. Exposure definitions are in need of improvement in order to focus on primary insufficient milk supply. Reference groups consisting of women who have successfully breastfed may also introduce positive bias (inflation of the odds ratio) into study results because of the protective effect of prolonged breastfeeding in the control group.",M2

20008425,"Effect of domperidone on the composition of preterm human breast <e>milk</e>.OBJECTIVE: Domperidone is increasingly prescribed to improve breast milk volume despite a lack of evidence regarding its effects on breast milk composition. We examined the effect of domperidone on the nutrient composition of breast milk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six mothers who had delivered infants at &lt;31 weeks' gestation, who experienced lactation failure, were randomly assigned to receive domperidone or placebo for 14 days. Protein, energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels in breast milk were measured on days 0, 4, 7, and 14, serum prolactin levels were measured on days 0, 4, and 14, and total milk volume was recorded daily. Mean within-subject changes in nutrients and milk volumes were examined. RESULTS: Maternal and infant characteristics, serum prolactin level, and breast milk volume and composition were not significantly different between domperidone and placebo groups on day 0. By day 14, breast milk volumes increased by 267% in the domperidone-treated group and by 18.5% in the placebo group (P = .005). Serum prolactin increased by 97% in the domperidone group and by 17% in the placebo group (P = .07). Mean breast milk protein declined by 9.6% in the domperidone group and increased by 3.6% in the placebo group (P = .16). Changes in energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, and phosphate content were also not significantly different between groups. Significant increases were observed in breast milk carbohydrate (2.7% vs -2.7%; P = .05) and calcium (61.8% vs -4.4%; P = .001) in the domperidone versus placebo groups. No significant adverse events were observed among mothers or infants. CONCLUSION: Domperidone increases the volume of breast milk of preterm mothers experiencing lactation failure, without substantially altering the nutrient composition.",M2

To define the dynamics of the CD4(+) T lymphocyte subpopulations in breast milk during acute HIV or SIV infection, lymphocyte populations were monitored in blood and milk of 4 Mamu-A*01(+) rhesus monkeys after SIVmac251 inoculation. Strikingly, although the CD4(+) T lymphocytes in blood were depleted during the peak of viremia, the milk CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts remained unchanged, despite active virus replication in the breast milk compartment. Moreover, CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes were preserved in breast milk during acute infection. CD4(+) T lymphocytes in breast milk and other mucosal compartments of uninfected monkeys were similar in their memory phenotype, activation status, and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 expression. Interestingly, the number and proportion of effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes in milk were increased during acute SIV infection, suggesting effective control of virus-mediated CD4(+) T lymphocyte destruction in the breast milk compartment.",M2
20001515,"Temporal reduction of HIV type 1 viral load in breast <e>milk</e> by single-dose nevirapine during prevention of MTCT.Short-course zidovudine (ZDV) with or without a single dose of nevirapine (sdNVP) is widely used to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). However, more data on viral load in breast milk following pMTCT regimens are needed. In a randomized PMTCT study in Botswana, in which half of the women received sdNVP in labor, stored samples from mothers assigned to breastfeed were analyzed for HIV-1 RNA in breast milk supernatant. A total of 527 samples from 282 women, collected at delivery, 2 weeks, 2 months, and 5 months postpartum were available for testing. Cell-free breast milk HIV-1 RNA was detectable (&gt;40 copies/ml) in 44.8% (236/527) of samples analyzed. Women randomized to sdNVP + ZDV were more likely to have undetectable breast milk viral loads at 2 weeks postpartum compared with those who received ZDV alone (67.8% vs. 38.5%, p = 0.002). By 2 months postpartum the difference between study arms disappeared, and 43.8% of women who received sdNVP + ZDV had undetectable HIV-1 RNA compared to 53.8% of the ZDV alone group (p = 0.19) and 60.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively, at month 5 (p = 0.61.) The addition of sdNVP to antenatal short-course AZT resulted in significantly reduced breast milk viral loads at 2 weeks postpartum suggesting a reduced risk of MTCT during the early postpartum period. However, viral loads in both study arms were comparable at 2 and 5 months postpartum, suggesting that the receipt of sdNVP in labor may defer rather than blunt the postpartum viral load rebound seen in breast milk after the discontinuation of ZDV.",M2

20000068,"Barriers to exclusive breastfeeding among infants aged 0-6 months in Eldoret municipality, Kenya.OBJECTIVE: Breast <e>milk</e> is the best source of nutrients for young infants. It promotes optimal growth and development. WHO recommends Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) for the first 6 months of life as the best way of feeding an infant. EBF Prevalence in Kenya is low, there is need to find out barriers to EBF, hence the study. The objective of the study was to establish barriers to EBF to 6 months among infants aged 0-6 months. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional involving 384 mother-infant pair visiting Huruma and West, maternal and child health (MCH) clinics. This study was done in the urban setting of Eldoret. Simple random sampling technique was used to get the desired sample size of 384. A questionnaire was used to collect data. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS) version 12.0. RESULTS: Maternal age was categorized into mothers with; &lt;24 years (n=207, 53.9%), 25-29 years (n=116, 30.2%), 30-35 years (n=35, 9.1%) and &gt;35 years (n=24, 6.3%). Over half (n=198, 51.5%) of infants were female and 48.5%( n= 186) were male. The median and mean age of infants in the study was 2.3 and 2 months respectively. Reported barriers to exclusive breastfeeding included; breast milk unsatisfying to the infant (n=157, 64.4%), insufficient breast milk production (n=35, 14.3%), to improve nutritional status of the infant (n=18, 7.4%), for the infant learns to feed on other foods (n=19, 7.7%) and in order for mothers to resume work (n=15, 6.1%). CONCLUSION: Barriers to EBF in the study may be attributed to inadequate breastfeeding knowledge among the mothers. This study is important in devising strategies that will increase EBF in the community.",M2
19962799,"Breastfeeding facilitates acceptance of a novel dietary flavour compound.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Infants may learn to accept flavours via exposure to flavour in mother's <e>milk</e>. This study examines whether acceptance of a flavour compound develops over 10 exposures through mother's milk (part 1), and how such acceptance evolves after 10 exposures, on alternate days, to the same flavour in solid food (part 2). METHODS: Three groups of 5-8 month-old infants participated. Breast-fed infants were randomised into two groups: a non-exposed group (n=20) and a group exposed to caraway flavour (d-carvone) via mother's milk (n=20). Mothers in the second group consumed a caraway-flavoured food. The third group was composed of formula-fed infants whose mothers consumed the caraway-flavoured food (n=8). Infants' acceptance of caraway-flavour was tested after both exposure periods by evaluating, on separate days, intake parameters and mother's judgement of liking of plain and caraway-flavoured purées. RESULTS: Part 1 showed that exposed and non-exposed breast-fed infants had higher initial acceptance of the caraway-flavoured purée than formula-fed infants. Part 2 results showed no evolution in acceptance of caraway-flavoured purée among breast-fed infants. In contrast formula-fed infants' acceptance of caraway-flavoured purée increased, corresponding to flavour-specific acceptance learning. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that breastfeeding facilitates acceptance of novel flavours. This effect is not necessarily due to exposure to specific flavour compounds.",M2
19959230,"Assessment of estrogenic activity and total lipids in maternal biological samples (serum and breast <e>milk</e>).The present study investigated estrogenic activity and total lipid levels in maternal serum and breast milk. The study was performed with 50 mothers from Fang district of northern Thailand. Maternal serum was collected 5 times, including the second trimester, pre-delivery period, delivery period, and lactating period at day 30 and day 60. Breast milk was collected 7 times, including day 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60 of lactation. There were the same patterns of variation between estrogenicity and total lipid levels both in serum and breast milk. The correlation between serum estrogenicity and serum total lipids was found with a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.403 to 0.661. However, no correlation was found between milk estrogenicity and milk total lipids. The results therefore suggest that lipid contents might be the major factors affecting the variation of estrogenicity levels, and xenoestrogens, which the mother subjects exposed, were lipophilic pollutants. The remarkable findings were that the mean levels of estrogenicity in breast milk were approximately 8-13.5 times higher than those in maternal serum compared at the same period. However, no correlation was found between estrogenicity levels in serum and breast milk, leading to decreased accuracy in predicted infant exposure by maternal serum.",M2
19954849,"POP levels in breast <e>milk</e> and maternal serum and thyroid hormone levels in mother-child pairs from Uppsala, Sweden.In experimental studies, it has frequently been observed that the homeostasis of thyroid hormones (THs) is affected by exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as dioxins and PCBs. In man, similar effects have been indicated in several epidemiological studies. In order to investigate the possible effect on THs at low background exposures found among the Swedish population the following study was performed. Primiparous women (n=395) in the Uppsala region were recruited between 1996 and 1999. Of these, 325 mothers agreed to donate a serum sample in late pregnancy and breast milk was obtained from 211 women 3 weeks after delivery. Babies were sampled for blood at 3 weeks (n=150) and 3 months (n=115) after birth. In connection to the sampling, questions on personal characteristics were asked. Levels of low (tri- to penta-) chlorinated PCB, di-ortho PCB, p,p'-DDE, (mono-ortho) PCB TEQ and PCDD/DF TEQ were monitored in breast milk and in mother's blood (not PCDD/DF). The results showed that the measured TH levels (thyroid-stimulating hormone - TSH, total tri-iodothyronine - TT3, free thyroxine - FT4) in mothers and children were within the reference range. Some significant associations were seen between POP exposures and TH levels in mother or child after simple regression analysis. Following adjustment for important confounding factors, the significant associations mostly disappeared. However, significantly decreasing TT3 levels with increasing prenatal low-chlorinated PCB exposure were still seen in 3 week old children, and on TT3 in mothers exposed to PCDD/DF. In conclusion, the study clearly shows the importance of adjustment for important confounding factors in the analysis of possible associations between POP exposure and hormonal effects. The remaining associations are weak in both children and mothers and the clinical consequences of these alterations are uncertain. When comparing studies that investigate associations between TH levels and POP levels during the perinatal stage, no obvious between-study concordance was seen regarding the critical dose for hormonal effects to occur.",M2

Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants, together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring. The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast <e>milk</e> of residents living in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecosystems and human health.",M2

Among a number of extraction and clean-up methods tested, pressurized liquid extraction followed by gel permeation chromatography and florisil clean-up proved to be simple, robust and optimized so that all target analytes (parent compounds and metabolites) were collected in a single fraction. Extracts were analyzed by GC-HRMS to identify PBDEs. Following, the same extracts were derivatized and re-analyzed by GC-HRMS to determine 11 target and 35 non-target OH- and MeO-PBDEs. Monitoring of the M(+) for MeO-PBDEs and the [M-CH(2)CO](+) ions for derivatized OH-PBDEs at 10,000 resolution permitted unequivocal identification of the PBDE metabolites in the environmental matrices examined. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, detection limits and long-term stability. The analytical precision obtained with this method was between 0.3 and 17%, and the limits of quantification were lower than 3.28 pg/g dry weight, 20.5 and 41.4 pg/g lipid weight in sediment, milk and fish, respectively.

19935821,"PUFA and LC-PUFA intake during the first year of life: can dietary practice achieve a guideline diet?BACKGROUND: An appropriate supply of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) during early childhood may enhance cognitive development. Little attention is paid to the fatty acid (FA) supply during the complementary feeding period. We examined the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and LC-PUFAs pattern in dietary practice of two study groups and evaluated the results against the present Dietary Guidelines in Germany. METHODS: The food consumption and FA pattern of dietary practice in subjects from two prospective studies (n=102 and n=184, respectively) at the age of 3, 6 and 9 months was assessed by weighed diet records, and changes during the first year of life were compared with the food-based dietary guidelines for the first year of life. RESULTS: Dietary practice in the complementary feeding period was clearly dominated by commercial food products. The FA composition in dietary practice was different from the Guideline Diet and the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs was less favorable. Consumption of breast <e>milk</e> or formula was still of major importance for the intake of LC-PUFAs in the complementary feeding period. CONCLUSION: LC-PUFAs are predominantly provided by breast milk and formula during the first year of life and consequently decrease when milk consumption decreases. For compensation, commercial complementary food might come closer to the Guideline Diet by lowering the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio through appropriate vegetable oil along with an increase in total fat content up to the legal limit.",M2
19929699,"Design and characterization of a human <e>milk</e> product for the preterm infant.BACKGROUND: It is necessary to fortify human milk to promote optimal growth of the very preterm infant. However, the addition of non-human milk components to human milk is not ideal because of the risk of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis. Human milk products (HMP) are an alternative to commercially available fortifiers, but their preparation is likely to result in modifications to the qualities of human milk. METHODS: Ten batches of HMP were prepared with the aim of meeting a desired protein:energy ratio of 3.0 g of protein/100 kcal. Ultrafiltration was used to produce a skim milk concentrate, to which cream was then added to produce the final HMP. Characterization of HMP and human milk fortified with commercial human milk fortifiers (Nutriprem [Cow &amp; Gate, Limerick, Ireland] and S-26 SMA human milk fortifier [Wyeth Nutrition, Baulkham Hills, NSW, Australia]) included quantifying macronutrient content, osmolality, microbial content, and particle distribution. RESULTS: Average protein:energy ratio of the final batch was 2.93 +/- 0.10 g of protein/100 kcal, equating to an inaccuracy of 2.5% relative to the desired ratio of 3.0 g of protein/100 kcal. Significantly greater fat (P &lt; 0.01), lower lactose (P &lt; 0.001), and lower osmolality (P &lt; 0.001) were characteristic of the HMP compared to human milk fortified with either commercial fortifier. Microbial growth occurred during preparation of HMP but did not exceed 10(5) colony-forming units/mL, and pasteurization of human milk prevented contamination in 80% of batches. CONCLUSIONS: HMP can be designed to accurately target the protein and energy requirements of the preterm infant, but modifications of the macronutrient, biochemical, structural, and microbial characteristics of human milk may affect the quality of the final product.",M2
19916998,"Albendazole and its metabolites in the breast <e>milk</e> of lactating women following a single oral dose of albendazole.AIMS: Albendazole (ABZ) is used in several anthelminthic drug programs. ABZ side-effects are generally mild, but ABZ-induced pancytopenia may be serious. In filariasis programmes, it may be necessary to administer ABZ to breastfeeding women. Few data are available on safety of ABZ for breastfed infants. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of ABZ and its metabolites in human milk is insufficiently investigated. The aim was to study pharmacokinetics of ABZ and its metabolites [ABZ sulphoxide (ABSX) and ABZ sulphone] in the breast milk lactating women after one single oral dose of ABZ. METHODS: Thirty-three lactating women (age 18-40 years) participated in the study. They received a single oral 400-mg dose of ABZ. Five milk samples were taken at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h. One serum sample was taken after 6 h. Samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: ABZ was detectable in milk samples 6 h after the oral dose. The mean concentration of serum ABZ was 63.7 +/- 11.9 ng ml(-1). The pharmacokinetic parameters for ABSX were calculated as follows: 351.9 +/- 32.4 ng ml(-1), 6.9 +/- 0.5 h, 12.4 +/- 2.2 h and 5190.3 +/- 482.8 ng*h ml(-1) for C(max), T(max), t((1/2)) and AUC(0-36), respectively. The milk-to-serum ratios (range) for ABZ and ABSX were 0.9 (0.2-6.5) and 0.6 (0.1-1.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After an oral dose of 400 mg, ABZ and ABSX attain low concentrations in breast milk that are unlikely to be considered harmful for the breastfed infant.",M2
19916905,"Peculiarities of abzymes from sera and <e>milk</e> of healthy donors and patients with autoimmune and viral diseases.The detection of catalytic activity of antibodies is the earliest indicator of development of autoimmune diseases (AID). In early stages of AID, the repertoire of abzymes with various properties is relatively small, but it is greatly increased during their development. Catalytic diversity of the abzymes includes DNase, RNase, ATPase, and oxidoreductase activities; there are antibodies phosphorylating proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides. This review summarizes new data on abzyme heterogeneity and possible reasons for this phenomenon. A possible role of abzymes and their exceptional multiplicity in the pathogenesis of different AID is discussed.",M2
19912159,"Predictors of inflammatory breast diseases during lactation--results of a cohort study.PROBLEM: Inflammatory breast diseases during lactation are major reasons for early weaning. METHOD OF STUDY: A prospective cohort study was performed to examine the association between stress and inflammatory breast diseases. Psychometric data, cytokine levels in breast <e>milk</e> and blood samples were analysed postpartum (T1). Psychometric data and course of breast feeding were evaluated twelve weeks later (T2). Patients were divided into case- and control-groups (according to the presence of breast diseases). RESULTS: Mothers of the case group (n = 23) were significantly older and showed significantly increased stress levels between T1 and T2 compared with the control group (n = 43). Leucocytes in the postpartum blood count were significantly decreased in the case group. There were no significant differences between groups in the concentrations of Th-1- and Th-2-cytokines in breast milk postpartum. CONCLUSION: Higher maternal age, postpartum increase in stress perception and low number of leucocytes are associated with a higher incidence of inflammatory breast diseases. Further studies must examine the causality of this effect.",M2
19910519,"Toward a clarification of the concept of mastitis as used in empirical studies of breast inflammation during lactation.The objective of this study is to clarify use of the term mastitis in empirical studies of lactational mastitis. Eighteen articles published between 1998 and 2008 were critically analyzed, and a concept clarification of the term mastitis was carried out. Four articles suggested that mastitis was an infection, 4 made no mention of the etiology of symptoms, and 10 articles described mastitis as an inflammation or an infection. Eight studies made no use of distinctions between <e>milk</e> stasis, noninfectious mastitis, and infectious mastitis. Bacterial cultivation was used in 5 articles, and 1 article measured leukocytes and C-reactive protein. Several different causes were cited. Antibiotics were suggested as appropriate treatment in 4 articles. Use of the concept of mastitis in empirical studies remains inconsistent and may do so until the etiology of symptoms is understood. Understanding is also needed as to why some women who present with symptoms suggesting septic reaction recover without antibiotic therapy.",M2
19907411,"A case of transient zinc deficiency in a breast-fed preterm infant successfully treated with oral zinc supplementation: review of zinc metabolism and related diseases.A 15-week-old baby girl, born at the 29 week of gestation, presented with a four-week history of demarcated, erythematous, erosive and exudative patches on the perianal, perioral and acral areas. A clinical diagnosis of zinc deficiency was considered. Serum zinc level was decreased (0.5 mg/L; normal 0.70-1.50 mg/L), the mother's serum and <e>milk</e> had normal zinc values. The baby was started an empiric trial of oral zinc supplementation (3 mg zinc gluconate/kg body weight/ day) with complete healing of lesions after two weeks. Treatment was gradually withdrawn at six months of age with no relapse. Transient zinc deficiency due to increased zinc requirements in breast-fed mainly preterm infants is a condition similar to acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive disorder of enteric zinc absorption affecting almost exclusively not breast-fed infants. Early recognition of the disorder and introduction of zinc supplementation rapidly reverses transient zinc deficiency, that probably will become more and more frequent, because of the rising rate of premature infants with breast-feeding only.",M2

The characterization of these biomolecules, however, is still considered challenging, owing to their overall complexity and diversity. Addressed here are the technical difficulties with an emphasis on the application of mass spectrometry to rapidly profile and quantify human milk oligosaccharides. Fundamental concepts and improvements in instrumentation and an overview of the biological functions and structures of these compounds are also discussed.

19897300,"Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in breast <e>milk</e> correlated to maternal age, education level, and occupational exposure.The aim of the present study is to determine whether levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in breast milk in the general population are associated with demographic parameters, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and occupational exposure. Forty-six participants are randomly selected from healthy women recruited between April 2007 and April 2008 from local hospitals in southern Taiwan. Thirty PBDE isomers in breast milk are analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a high resolution mass spectrometer. The mean+/-standard deviation of Sigma PBDEs in breast milk is 3.59+/-1.07 ng/g lipid. Our current value of Sigma PBDEs in breast milk is 0.7-fold lower compared to the past value in our previous study between 2000 and 2001. Higher levels of Sigma PBDEs might be significantly associated with older maternal age and maternal age of the present study is between 22 and 42 years old. Levels of Sigma PBDEs and certain PBDEs in breast milk are not correlated with maternal pre-pregnant BMI (Body mass index), parity, and lipid contents of breast milk. The Sigma PBDEs level in breast milk is lower in more educated women after controlling for age and pre-pregnancy BMI in our subjects. The main factors associated with Sigma PBDEs in breast milk are age and education level among the binary variables of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics in this report. The exploratory relationships are found between PBDEs in breast milk and age, education level, or occupational exposure due to small sampling size.",M2
19897227,"Exposure assessment of breast-fed infants in the Czech Republic to indicator PCBs and selected chlorinated pesticides: area-related differences.The aim of our study was to obtain data on the exposure of breast-fed infants to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in different urban areas of the Czech Republic. The PCB and OCP levels were determined in 90 human <e>milk</e> samples collected in seven urban areas in 1999-2000 according to the WHO protocol. The estimated daily intake (EDI) was calculated for each of the analytes and compared with the respective tolerable daily intake (TDI). Significant local differences in the sum of 35 PCB congeners analyzed (total PCBs) as well as in the most prominent indicator congeners 138, 153, and 180 values were observed, with the highest levels being found in breast milk samples from mothers living in the vicinity of a former plant using PCBs in Uherské Hradiste (median and ranges 3410 and 1448-13,754 ng g(-1)lipid weight (lw)). Non-exposed mothers from the same area had about threefold lower levels (median and ranges 1073 and 757-2139 ng/g lw, respectively). The lowest levels of total PCBs were found in Telc (median and ranges 480 and 293-731 ng g(-1)lw, respectively). In all study areas, EDIs for PCBs in breast-fed infants exceeded the TDI of 0.4 microg kg(-1)bwd(-1) recommended in the Czech Republic. EDI for HCB exceeded the recommended TDI of 0.16 microg kg(-1), EDI for DDT was slightly below TDI of 10 microg kg(-1) bw d(-1) and HCHs EDI was negligible. The database of analytical results from this study was used for Bayesian modeling of breast-fed infant exposure to PCBs and OCPs during the recommended 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding.",M2
19889457,"Determinants of brominated flame retardants in breast <e>milk</e> from a large scale Norwegian study.Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are widely present in human populations. In order to investigate human exposure pathways and associations with socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, 393 breast milk samples from mothers living in various regions throughout Norway were analyzed. Up to ten PBDE congeners were measured in all the samples, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and BDE-209 in subsets of 310 and 46, respectively. The median concentrations of the sum of the seven most prominent PBDEs (BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183), BDE-209 and HBCD were 2.1, 0.32 and 0.86ng/g lipids, respectively. These concentrations are comparable to the levels generally observed in human populations in Europe. The frequency distributions were quite skewed with long tails towards higher concentrations. Maternal age, parity, education, having a cohabitant employed as electrician, and ventilation were factors significantly associated with some of the BFRs, although these factors only explained a small amount of the variability (R(2) 0.04-0.16). The mothers' diet was not found to influence the breast milk PBDE and HBCD levels. Our results show that sources other than the diet are important for the variability seen in breast milk BFR concentrations and that exposure from the indoor atmosphere should be emphasized in future studies.",M2

19879984,"Optimized synthesis of 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoylglycerol-rich triacylglycerol via interesterification catalyzed by a lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus.1,3-Dioleoyl-2-palmitoylglycerol (OPO)-rich human <e>milk</e> fat substitute (HMFS) was synthesized from tripalmitin-rich fraction and ethyl oleate by a lipase-catalyzed interesterification. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize its OPO content and acyl migration with reaction factors - substrate mole ratio of PPP-rich fraction to ethyl oleate (1:4, 1:5 and 1:6), reaction temperature (50, 55 and 60 degrees C) and time (3, 7.5 and 12 hours). The predictive models for OPO content and acyl migration were adequate and reproducible. The OPO content increased with substrate ratio, and decreased with reaction time and temperature, whereas acyl migration increased with temperature and time. The optimal conditions for HMFS synthesis while maximizing OPO content (31.43% OPO) and minimizing acyl migration (6.07%) were predicted at the reaction combination of 50 degrees C, three hours and 5.5 substrate ratio. HMFS was resynthesized under the same condition, and no significant difference between the observed and predicted values was found. Further, the major fatty acid of HMFS was palmitic acid (80.6%) at sn-2 position, and oleic acid (64.9%) at sn-1,3 position.",M2

19854932,"Distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-N-biose I, a major building block of human <e>milk</e> oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.This study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-N-biose I (LNB) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. LNB is a building block for the human milk oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. A total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP) gene (lnpA) and examined for growth when LNB was used as the sole carbohydrate source. While all strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. breve, and B. bifidum were able to grow on LNB, none of the strains of B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. angulatum, B. animalis subsp. lactis, and B. thermophilum showed any growth. In addition, some strains of B. pseudocatenulatum, B. animalis subsp. animalis, and B. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize LNB. With the exception for B. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpA coincided with LNB utilization in almost all strains. These results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of LNB. These findings support the hypothesis that GLNBP plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.",M2
19854513,"Persistent organic pollutants in breast <e>milk</e> of mothers residing around an open dumping site in Kolkata, India: specific dioxin-like PCB levels and fish as a potential source.Concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides were measured in human breast milk collected from mothers residing near an open dumping site and a reference site in Kolkata, India during 2004-2005. POPs were detected in all the human milk samples analyzed, suggesting that residents of Kolkata are widely exposed to these contaminants. Concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs in the samples from the dumping site were significantly higher than in the reference site samples, whereas no such difference was found for PCDDs and PCDFs. In addition, significantly higher concentrations of total PCBs were also observed in the samples from the dumping site than the reference site. Interestingly, concentrations of total and dioxin-like PCBs in the breast milk of mothers from the dumping site significantly increased with the number of years of residence near the dumping site. These results indicate that significant pollution sources of PCBs are present in the dumping site of Kolkata and the residents living around are exposed to relatively higher levels of PCBs. When the residue levels of dioxins and related compounds in fish collected from ponds near the Kolkata dumping site and the reference site were measured, it was found that dioxin-like PCB and TEQ levels in fish from the dumping site were notably higher than those from the reference site. This result indicates that fish is a potential source of PCBs for residents living near the Kolkata dumping site.",M2
19881394,"Optimal growth and lower fat mass in preterm infants fed a protein-enriched postdischarge formula.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postdischarge formulas with extra energy and protein improve short-term growth but may also influence long-term body composition in an unwanted manner. Energy- and protein-enriched formulas with an increased protein-to-energy ratio improves gain of lean mass. The objective of the study was to investigate whether feeding a nutrient-enriched formula without extra energy after term, usually 3 to 4 weeks after discharge, would influence growth and body composition in infancy. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial preterm infants were fed fortified human <e>milk</e> or preterm formula until term. At term, 102 infants were randomized to a nutrient-enriched formula without extra energy or standard formula until 6 months corrected age. Twenty-six infants received unfortified human milk after term. At term and 6 months corrected age, anthropometry and a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan were performed. Lean and fat mass (FM) were corrected for height. RESULTS: There were no differences in growth or body size between the feeding groups. Infants fed the enriched formula gained less FM and had lower FM corrected for body size at 6 months corrected age than infants fed standard formula. Infants fed human milk had lower lean mass and higher FM corrected for body size at 6 months corrected age than formula-fed infants. CONCLUSIONS: Feeding nutrient-enriched formula without extra energy after term does not change quantity of growth but does influence type of weight gain and body composition of preterm infants. Infants fed the nutrient-enriched formula had lower FM corrected for body size at 6 months corrected age than infants fed standard formula or human milk.",M2
19881390,"Enteral nutrient supply for preterm infants: commentary from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition.The number of surviving children born prematurely has increased substantially during the last 2 decades. The major goal of enteral nutrient supply to these infants is to achieve growth similar to foetal growth coupled with satisfactory functional development. The accumulation of knowledge since the previous guideline on nutrition of preterm infants from the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in 1987 has made a new guideline necessary. Thus, an ad hoc expert panel was convened by the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in 2007 to make appropriate recommendations. The present guideline, of which the major recommendations are summarised here (for the full report, see http://links.lww.com/A1480), is consistent with, but not identical to, recent guidelines from the Life Sciences Research Office of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences published in 2002 and recommendations from the handbook Nutrition of the Preterm Infant. Scientific Basis and Practical Guidelines, 2nd ed, edited by Tsang et al, and published in 2005. The preferred food for premature infants is fortified human <e>milk</e> from the infant's own mother, or, alternatively, formula designed for premature infants. This guideline aims to provide proposed advisable ranges for nutrient intakes for stable-growing preterm infants up to a weight of approximately 1800 g, because most data are available for these infants. These recommendations are based on a considered review of available scientific reports on the subject, and on expert consensus for which the available scientific data are considered inadequate.",M2
