20498108,"What is driving the HIV epidemic in French Guiana?Thirty years after the first HIV case in French Guiana, the drivers of the epidemic are not clearly known, but the epidemic is usually conceptualized as generalized. Cross-linking results from a study in the general population and a study in the HIV-infected population in Cayenne suggests that in the general population of HIV-positive men, 45% of HIV cases are attributable to having sex with someone they paid. Similarly, for HIV-positive women exchanging sex for presents or money, 10.7% of HIV cases are attributable to transactional sex. A surprising finding was that 16.8% of HIV patients had tried <e>crack</e> cocaine before. On the Maroni river, the female-biased sex ratio suggests the drivers in that remote area may be related to cultural polygyny. These observations have important consequences on communication and prevention strategies.",M1
20230724,"Longitudinal relationship between psychological distress and multiple substance use: results from a three-year multisite natural-history study of rural stimulant users.OBJECTIVE: Substance use is associated with poor mental health, but little is known regarding how use of multiple substances is associated with mental health, particularly longitudinally, in community studies. This article examines this issue in a large (N = 710), natural-history study of rural stimulant (cocaine and/or methamphetamine) users in three states. METHOD: Respondent-driven sampling recruited recent (past-30-day) stimulant users in three counties each in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio. Participants were interviewed every 6 months for 3 years. Mental health was measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, and prior 6 months' substance use was measured for 17 possible substances. Data analysis used generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data with the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory as the dependent variable at each interview and substance use as predictor variables measured by number of substances used in the past 6 months and, separately, the 17 individual substances, adjusting for use of substance-use treatment, demographics, and recruitment site. RESULTS: On average, both Global Severity Index score and use of many substances declined over the course of study. Global Severity Index score was significantly associated with (a) greater number of substances used in the past 6 months (p &lt; .0001) and (b) use of <e>crack</e> cocaine, methamphetamine, and nonprescription use of prescription painkillers and tranquilizers. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple and specific substances appear to incrementally increase psychological distress. Users of cocaine and methamphetamine are present in rural areas; these associations with poor psychological health raise concerns regarding availability of local treatment services for individuals with mental-health problems, as well as substance abuse.",M1
20229694,"Lifetime victimization and psychological distress: cluster profiles of out of treatment drug-involved women.K-means clustering techniques were used to identify four cluster profiles characterized by unique patterns of victimization and psychological distress and further differentiated by distinct patterns of risk and protection across multiple life domains among a sample of 149 <e>crack</e>-using women. Results of this study suggest that important differences exist in patterns of victimization and psychological distress among drug-involved women. Identification of this variation can be used to tailor intervention strategies to the particular needs of different subgroups within the population of crack-using women.",M1
20120283,"[Cocaine and <e>crack</e> addiction: a growing public health problem]Cocaine addiction is an important public health problem worldwide, and use of this drug is growing in France. Cocaine produces its psychoactive and addictive effects primarily by acting on the brain's reward system--a set of interconnected regions that regulate pleasure and motivation. An initial short-term effect due to a build-up of the neurochemical dopamine gives rise to euphoria and to a desire to take the drug again. Cocaine's many longer-term effects include addiction, persistent craving and a high risk of relapse. Dysregulation of brain reward pathways is associated with a drastic escalation of drug-seeking behaviors and intake. Cocaine addiction is rapidly progressive and can have severe medical, psychiatric and psychosocial consequences. There are no proven pharmacotherapies for cocaine addiction. However, cocaine addiction being due to a pharmacologically induced reduction in the neuroplasticity of brain circuits mediating normal reward learning, novel pharmacotherapies directly targeting the biological pathology of addiction should be feasible. Progress in the neurobiology of cocaine dependence has enabled researchers to identify medications that might help patients initiate abstinence and avoid relapse. Several such medications, and a vaccine, have given encouraging results in controlled clinical trials with cocaine-dependent patients. Major behavioral therapies have also proven to be effective on cocaine addiction. Treatment approaches combining medication and behavioral intervention are likely to produce the best results.",M1
20010287,"Sudden death from massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with <e>crack</e> cocaine use: case report and review of the literature.Cocaine is associated with many health complications including gastrointestinal ischemia/infarction, and hemorrhage. The clinical medical literature describes such entities, but no case exists within the forensic literature describing life-threatening intraluminal gastrointestinal hemorrhage and sudden death associated with cocaine. A 48-year-old black man died suddenly in his home, with drug paraphernalia near the body. Further investigation revealed blood stains on upholstery, and a toilet filled with fresh blood. External examination of the body revealed fresh blood draining from the anus. Internal examination revealed a dusky portion of distal ileum filled with an abundance of fresh blood. Toxicology confirmed the suspicion of acute cocaine intoxication.Review of the clinical literature revealed several case reports describing an association between cocaine use and intestinal infarction, one with hemoperitoneum. Review of the forensic literature returned one case describing an association between cocaine toxicity and intestinal infarction, but without hemorrhage. To our knowledge, our case represents the first report in the forensic literature describing massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with acute cocaine intoxication. It is important that the forensic pathologist recognize cocaine toxicity as a potential cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in younger male decedents without significant comorbidities. Scene investigation may reveal useful clues pointing to this unusual etiology.",M1
20001290,"Neuropsychological assessment of current and past <e>crack</e> cocaine users.BACKGROUND: Cognitive changes due to crack cocaine consumption remain unclear. METHODS: For clarification, 55 subjects were assigned to three groups: control group, crack cocaine current users, and ex-users. Participants were submitted to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and tasks evaluating executive functioning and verbal memory. Mood state was also measured. Intergroup comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Control group performance on the MMSE was better than that of users and ex-users. Verbal memory performance for logical memory of users was impaired. Ex-users scored lower on DSST and Trail Making Test (Part B). CONCLUSION: Chronic crack cocaine use seems to disrupt general cognitive functioning (MMSE), verbal memory, and attentional resources, but findings suggest that some of these effects could be reversed by abstinence.",M1
19957281,"The effect of posttraumatic stress disorder on risk-taking propensity among <e>crack</e>/cocaine users in residential substance abuse treatment.BACKGROUND: The co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) has been found to be associated with a range of negative clinical outcomes (e.g., relapse, suicide, legal problems, HIV infection). However, less is known about the particular factors that may be placing individuals with a co-occurring PTSD and SUD diagnosis at risk for these outcomes. The construct of risk-taking propensity may hold particular promise. METHODS: To investigate the relevance of risk-taking propensity to PTSD-SUD patients, differences in risk-taking propensity were examined among 90 crack/cocaine dependent patients in residential substance abuse treatment with (n=20) or without (n=70) a current PTSD diagnosis. Risk-taking propensity was assessed using an established behaviorally based measure, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). RESULTS: Crack/cocaine dependent patients with PTSD exhibited significantly greater levels of risk-taking propensity than patients without PTSD, and this difference remained significant even when controlling for the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and current psychotropic medication use. No evidence was found for a different pattern of change in risk-taking propensity from the beginning to the end of the task as a function of PTSD status. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, results suggest the need to further investigate risk-taking propensity as a factor that may be associated with the negative clinical outcomes observed among crack/cocaine users with PTSD.",M1
19927477,"Perceptions of sexual risks and injection for HIV among African American women who use <e>crack</e> cocaine in Nashville, Tennessee.Significant health disparities in the rates of HIV infection primarily affect African American women. Although research has demonstrated that for some individuals HIV is connected to preventable high-risk behaviors related to substance use, a further examination of how these risks are perceived by the individuals involved in these activities is warranted. This study presents the results of 11 focus groups with 89 African American women who use crack cocaine in which respondents shared their perceptions of HIV risk behaviors. The results of this study suggest that women crack cocaine users in Nashville,Tennessee, are not injecting the drug. There appeared to be high levels of perceived sexual risks associated with the use of crack cocaine by some users; however, this was not universal, as many active users have internalized HIV prevention messages. The results of this study are significant in that further understanding of the means by which individuals experience their risk behaviors will enable more effective targeting of potential interventions to reduce the spread of HIV.",M1
19910099,"Resources and obstacles to developing and implementing a structural intervention to prevent HIV in San Salvador, El Salvador.HIV prevention researchers have increasingly advocated structural interventions that address factors in the social, political and economic context to reduce disparities of HIV/AIDS among disadvantaged populations. This paper draws on data collected in three different types of low-income communities (n=6) in the San Salvador metropolitan area in El Salvador. Nine focus group discussions were conducted between January 2006 and July 2007, 6 with community leaders, and 3 with <e>crack</e> cocaine users, as well as in-depth interviews with 20 crack users and crack dealers. We explore opportunities and barriers to the implementation of a community-level, structural intervention. We first analyze the different forms of leadership, and other community resources including existing HIV prevention activities that could potentially be used to address the related problems of crack use and HIV in the communities, and the structural factors that may act as barriers to capitalizing on communities' strengths in interventions. Each of the communities studied demonstrated different resources that stem from each community's unique history and geographic location. HIV testing and prevention resources varied widely among the communities, with resources concentrated in one Older Central community despite a strong need in all communities. In many communities, fear of gang violence and non-responsiveness by government agencies to communities' needs have discouraged community organizing. In the discussion, we offer concrete suggestions for developing and implementing structural interventions to reduce HIV risks that use communities' different but complementary resources.",M1
19895301,"A psychosocial comparison of New Orleans and Houston <e>crack</e> smokers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.The purpose of this study was to compare psychological distress in a sample of African American crack cocaine users who relocated to Houston from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to African American drug users resident in Houston. Fifty-four African Americans from New Orleans were compared to a sample of 162 people in Houston. Data were collected between June 2002 and December 2005. There were no significant differences between the two groups on either depression or anxiety, but the New Orleans sample scored higher on the self-esteem scale and scored slightly lower on the risk-taking scale.",M1
19841052,"Smoking of <e>crack</e> cocaine as a risk factor for HIV infection among people who use injection drugs.BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection. METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996-Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999-Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002-Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). RESULTS: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06-7.11). INTERPRETATION: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users. This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine.",M1

19534272,"Anthracotic pigment in pleural fluid: a case report.BACKGROUND: The presence of anthracotic pigment (carbon) in pleural fluid cytologic samples is unusual and to date has only been reported in individuals who are <e>crack</e> (freebase cocaine) smokers. We report the cytologic finding of carbon-laden macrophages in pleural fluid unrelated to crack abuse. CASES: Two patients were identified with anthracotic pigment within their pleural fluid on cytologic review; an 88-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative man with a transudative effusion and a 46-year-old HIV-positive man with a history of crack abuse who presented with an exudative effusion. Dense black pigment within macrophages was identified in both the ThinPrep slide and cell block material. This pigment failed to stain for iron and was present within the cytoplasm of KP-1 immunoreactive and TFF-1 negative macrophages. CONCLUSION: Carbon-laden macrophages can be found in exudative and transudative pleural effusions and may be seen without any relationship to crack abuse. Because this finding may be secondary to a subclinical pneumothorax, its identification and reporting may be of clinical significance.",M1
19533366,"Limited utility of name-based tuberculosis contact investigations among persons using illicit drugs: results of an outbreak investigation.Persons named by a patient with tuberculosis (TB) are the focus of traditional TB contact investigations. However, patients who use illicit drugs are often reluctant to name contacts. Between January 2004 and May 2005, 18 isoniazid-resistant TB cases with matching Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes (spoligotypes) were reported in Miami; most patients frequented <e>crack</e> houses and did not name potentially infected contacts. We reviewed medical records and re-interviewed patients about contacts and locations frequented to describe transmission patterns and make recommendations to control TB in this population. Observed contacts were not named but were encountered at the same crack houses as the patients. Contacts were evaluated for latent TB infection with a tuberculosis skin test (TST). All 18 patients had pulmonary TB. Twelve (67%) reported crack use and 14 (78%) any illicit drug use. Of the 187 contacts evaluated, 91 (49%) were named, 16 (8%) attended a church reported by a patient, 61 (33%) used a dialysis center reported by a patient, and 19 (10%) were observed contacts at local crack houses. Compared to named contacts, observed contacts were eight times as likely to have positive TST results (relative risk = 7.8; 95% confidence interval = 3.8-16.1). Dialysis center and church contacts had no elevated risk of a positive TST result. Testing observed contacts may provide a higher yield than traditional name-based contact investigations for tuberculosis patients who use illicit drugs or frequent venues characterized by illicit drug use.",M1

19386968,"Drug abuse profile - patient delay, diagnosis delay and drug resistance pattern - among addict patients with tuberculosis.Socioeconomic problems limit the access of drug users to health-care services. This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out by making use of the medical records of new case tuberculosis (TB) patients hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, the national referral centre in Iran, from 2003 to 2006. Demographic and personal characteristics of the patients and type of disease were collected and categorized. Of the 944 patients with confirmed TB, 143 (15.1%) were drug users, among whom 140 (97.9%) were men with just three women drug users. The mean age of the drug users group was 43.04 +/- 13.81 years. The type of drug used was opium in 100 cases (69.9%), heroin in 29 (20.3%), opium and heroin together in four (2.8%) and all three, opium, heroin and <e>crack</e>, in two (1.4%). For 238 high-risk patients, an HIV test was performed and HIV infection was confirmed in 33 cases. Patient delay was longer in drug users (P = 0.000) against other patients, whereas diagnosis delay was shorter (P = 0.007). Drug susceptibility tests were performed for 515 patients with positive cultures. One hundred and thirty-three (14.1%) were found to have 'any resistance' to anti-TB drugs, and 10 (1.1%) individuals had multidrug-resistant TB. Twenty-six (19.5%) of the individuals who showed resistance to first-line agents were drug users. There was no significant relation between drug resistance and drug use (P = 0.4). In conclusion, it seems that active case finding for TB and HIV in addict cases must be contained in harm reduction packages. Moreover, the manifestations of the disease should be considered seriously regardless of attributing them to drug use.",M1
19386966,"Relationship between heterosexual anal sex, injection drug use and HIV infection among black men and women.US blacks carry a disproportionate risk of heterosexually transmitted HIV. This study aimed to evaluate the association between self-reported heterosexual anal intercourse and HIV. Using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), we recruited and interviewed 909 blacks from areas of high poverty and HIV prevalence in Houston, Texas, and who reported heterosexual sex in the last year. All individuals were tested for HIV. Weighted prevalence values were calculated to account for non-random recruitment associated with RDS. The weighted population prevalence of HIV infection was 2.4% and 2.5% among men and women, respectively. Education, employment status, income and <e>crack</e> cocaine use were not associated with HIV infection. Lifetime injection drug use (odds ratio [OR] 3.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-8.33%) and heterosexual anal intercourse (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.02-5.73%) were associated with HIV infection. Individuals who reported both injection drug use and heterosexual anal intercourse had 6.21 increased odds of HIV (95% CI 2.47-15.61%). Our results suggest that heterosexual anal sex may be a vector for HIV transmission, especially in the context of injection drug use. Prevention strategies directed at curbing the HIV epidemic among black heterosexuals require that we correctly identify the risks so that appropriate interventions can be developed.",M1
19380842,"Effects of chronic exposure to <e>crack</e> cocaine on the respiratory tract of mice.Smoked cocaine (crack cocaine) causes several forms of injury to the respiratory tract, including asthma exacerbations, lung edema and hemorrhage, and nasal mucosal alterations. Few studies, however, have assessed respiratory tract pathology in habitual users of crack cocaine. Here, we describe the histological alterations in the respiratory tract of mice caused by chronic inhalation of crack cocaine. Twenty 2-month-old BALB/c mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 g crack cocaine in an inhalation chamber once a day for two months and compared to controls (n = 10). We then morphometrically analyzed nose and bronchiolar epithelial alterations, bronchiolar and alveolar macrophage cell density, alveolar hemosiderin content, and in addition determined the vasoconstriction index and the wall thickness of pulmonary arteries. The serum cocaine level was 212.5 ng/mL after a single inhalation. The mucus content of the nasal epithelium increased in crack-exposed animals, and the nasal and bronchial epithelium thickness decreased significantly. The alveolar hemosiderin content and the alveolar and bronchiolar macrophage cell density increased in animals exposed to crack. The vasoconstriction index increased in the pulmonary arteries of the exposed group. Chronic crack cocaine inhalation causes extensive histological changes along the entire respiratory tract.",M1
19375250,"Valproate treatment and cocaine cue reactivity in cocaine dependent individuals.Based on prior clinical trials indicating that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-based anticonvulsant medications reduce drug craving in cocaine dependent study participants, we tested the effects of valproate treatment on cue-induced cocaine craving. <e>Crack</e> cocaine dependent individuals (N=20) were tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subjects, crossover study design. Valproate treatment was titrated up to 1500 mg/day by Day 6 of treatment, cue testing was completed on Day 8 of treatment, and all study participants underwent a washout period of 5 days between active and placebo medication treatment periods. Testing included both cocaine and neutral cue exposure sessions, presented in a random and counterbalanced order. Main effects of cue exposure were found for subjective ratings of  desire to use cocaine now , the cocaine craving index, cocaine-like high, and cocaine withdrawal. Treatment interaction effects were found with  desire to use cocaine now , which underwent a greater increase following cocaine cue exposure in the valproate condition. Main effects of medication treatment were found, in which lower blood pressure and heart rate, and higher plasma cortisol levels, were associated with valproate treatment. Valproate treatment was also associated, at a trend level, with higher pre-test cocaine craving levels. The results demonstrate that cocaine cue reactivity is a robust phenomena across two assessment sessions, but fail to support the use of valproate as a means of reducing spontaneous and cue-induced cocaine craving. The use of valproate as a treatment for cocaine dependence is not supported.",M1
19374969,"Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in substance users: a comparison across substances.BACKGROUND: Psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) are reported to be increased among persons using illicit substances, but little is known about the comparative frequency with which the symptoms occur with abuse of different substances. To establish this, we interviewed individuals who had wide experience of commonly used drugs. METHODS: Four hundred seventy-six intravenous drug users, <e>crack</e>-cocaine users, and heroin snorters recruited via street outreach were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Model to assess dependence on a number of substances including amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids. As a part of this assessment, we assessed a history of delusions and hallucinations in the context of use of, or withdrawal from, these specific substances. RESULTS: From 27.8% to 79.6% users of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, dependence for that specific substance. The prevalence of psychotic symptoms associated with each specific substance ranged from users with no diagnosis to users with severe dependence as follows: amphetamines (5.2%-100%), cannabis (12.4%-80.0%), cocaine (6.7%-80.7%), and opiates (6.7%-58.2%). The risk of psychotic symptoms increased for respondents who abused (odds ratio [OR], 12.2) or had mild (OR, 17.1), moderate (OR, 47.0), or severe dependence (OR, 114.0) on cocaine when compared to those who were users with no diagnosis. A similar pattern was evident in cannabis, opiate, and amphetamine users. CONCLUSIONS: Most users dependent on illicit substances experience psychotic symptoms in the context of use of, or withdrawal from, these substances. Psychotic symptoms increased with the severity of the substance use disorders for all 4 substances. These findings emphasize the importance of developing services to target this population as they are at a heightened risk for developing psychotic symptoms.",M1
19327917,"Factors associated with event-level stimulant use during sex in a sample of older, low-income men who have sex with men in Los Angeles.Prior research shows that stimulant use is consistently associated with high-risk sexual behavior in samples of men who have sex with men (MSM), but few studies have explored factors associated with use of <e>crack</e> or methamphetamine during sex during specific sexual events among older, very low-income MSM. This study examined stimulant use during the most recent sexual episodes in a sample of primarily older, very low-income MSM (n=779). Although crack use was more prevalent than methamphetamine use (33% vs. 22%), findings suggest that methamphetamine users may be at greater risk for HIV transmission. HIV prevalence was higher among methamphetamine users (49%) than among crack users (24%). Having unprotected sex (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.46-5.26), having sex in a public sex venue (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.52-8.64), having sex with an HIV positive rather than with an HIV negative partner (OR 6.15, 95% CI 2.14-17.62), having exchanged sex for money or drugs (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.78-9.72), and having a higher number of sexual partners (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.17-2.38) all were associated with increased odds of methamphetamine use during sex. Fewer high-risk behaviors were associated with increased odds of using crack during sex. Having unprotected sex was associated with increased odds of crack use during sex only when sex partners were perceived to be HIV negative rather than to be HIV positive or of unknown status. Findings provide observations on associations between stimulant use during sex and risk behaviors that may be important to HIV prevention and drug treatment approaches for urban, older, very poor MSM.",M1

19295339,"<e>Crack</e>-cocaine use accelerates HIV disease progression in a cohort of HIV-positive drug users.BACKGROUND: HIV infection is prevalent among substance abusers. The effects of specific illicit drugs on HIV disease progression have not been established. We evaluated the relationship between substances of abuse and HIV disease progression in a cohort of HIV-1-positive active drug users. METHODS: A prospective, 30-month, longitudinal study was conducted on 222 HIV-1 seropositive drug users in Miami, FL. History of illicit drug, alcohol, and medication use, CD4+ cell count, and viral load were performed every 6 months. RESULTS: Crack-cocaine users were 2.14 times [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08 to 4.25, P = 0.029] more likely to present a decline of CD4 to &lt;or=200 cells/mL, independent of antiretroviral use. Viral load over 30 months was significantly higher in crack users (beta = 0.315, P = 0.037) independent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over time. The only multidrug combination that significantly increased the risk of disease progression was crack cocaine with marijuana (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.042 to 5.617, P = 0.04). Of those on HAART, a significantly lower proportion of crack-cocaine users versus nonusers had controlled viral load (P &lt; 0.001), suggesting lower medication adherence, whereas crack-cocaine users not on HAART showed a greater risk for HIV disease progression than nonusers (hazard ratio = 3.946; 95% CI: 1.049 to 14.85, P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Crack-cocaine use facilitates HIV disease progression by reducing adherence in those on HAART and by accelerating disease progression independently of HAART.",M1
19266372,"Normalization of violence: experiences of childhood abuse by inner-city <e>crack</e> users.An increasing literature mostly based on retrospective surveys has been consistently documenting a correlation between physical abuse in childhood (CPA) and substance abuse in adulthood (ASA). This article uses ethnographic data to reveal the processes behind and context of this linkage for one population-poor, inner-city New York residents who became crack users. Life in the inner city is qualitatively different than in more fortunate circumstances. CPA is but one of numerous stressors and factors contributing to ASA. Approximately half of the subjects reported clear recollections of being physically beaten by their mothers or their various male partners. Although several denied being beaten in childhood, they typically reported various forms of physical assaults that they  deserved.  Physical assaults, especially by mothers, were often understood as expressions of love. As such, these respondents viewed their ongoing physical assaults as an ordinary part of their childhood and adolescence. Such physical punishment also socialized and prepared children for the violence that would likely occur during their childhood in their inner-city communities. This analysis highlights how reducing substance abuse in the inner city may require a much more comprehensive effort than a focus on reducing CPA. These findings also have important implications for quantitative research regarding CPA and ASA. Such studies should subdivide their analyses by socioeconomic status to more clearly measure how much of a risk factor CPA represents among wealthier populations and how much not being abused may serve as a protective factor among poor inner-city populations.",M1
19265736,"Condom use and duration of concurrent partnerships among men in the United States.OBJECTIVES: Concurrent partnerships accelerate dissemination of STIs. Most investigations of the features of concurrent partnerships have focused on higher risk subpopulations. GOAL: To assess condom use and the duration of concurrent sexual partnerships among men in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of concurrent sexual partnerships among men in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. We classified pairs of concurrent partnerships into 3 types: transitional, contained, and experimental concurrency, and assessed the duration of overlap. We also report the distribution of condom use at the last sexual intercourse with neither, one or both concurrent partners of each pair and characteristics of men more likely to have used condoms with neither sex partner. RESULTS: The duration of overlap was &lt;1 month in 32%, 1 to 3 months in 19%, and &gt;12 months in 25% of concurrency pairs. Half (55%) of the pairs (whites, 64%; blacks, 41%) involved unprotected sex at the last sexual intercourse with at least 1 partner. The 35% of men who were more likely to use condoms with neither sex partner at the last sexual intercourse were older, white (48%), married/cohabitating (55%), and during the previous 12 months were incarcerated (49%), or used <e>crack</e>/cocaine (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Although blacks generally experience higher rates of STIs and HIV, in this representative sample of men in the United States, blacks in concurrent partnerships seemed to use the only available protection (condoms) against infection (apart from abstinence) more than other racial/ethnic groups. Continued investigation of features of sexual partnership patterns is critical for curbing STI and HIV transmission.",M1
19233609,"The role of anxiety sensitivity and difficulties in emotion regulation in posttraumatic stress disorder among <e>crack</e>/cocaine dependent patients in residential substance abuse treatment.Current research suggests the importance of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a growing body of research has demonstrated that difficulties in emotion regulation may also play a role. This study examined the unique relationships between AS dimensions, difficulties in emotion regulation, and a probable PTSD diagnosis among a sample of inner-city crack/cocaine dependent patients in residential substance abuse treatment. Probable PTSD participants exhibited higher levels of the AS dimension of social concerns and emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties reliably distinguished probable PTSD participants from non-PTSD participants above and beyond both anxiety symptom severity and the AS dimension of social concerns. Further, social concerns did not account for unique variance when difficulties in emotion regulation was entered into the model. Results provide support for the central role of difficulties in emotion regulation relative to AS dimensions in the prediction of PTSD within a crack/cocaine dependent population.",M1

This paper gives the results of experimental studies on the effect of UV irradiation on the sensitivity of a vapor phase detection of cocaine of different origin by a technology of ion mobility increment spectrometry (IMIS). It is shown that the influence of UV irradiation on the surface of cocaine hydrochloride and crack increases the amplitude of IMIS signals by about eight times. We analyzed ions emerged by photolysis of tested cocaine samples using mass-spectrometry with atmospheric pressure ionization (API-MS). The assumption is made about structural formula of volatile products of photolysis of crack and cocaine hydrochloride. By the results of API-MS and IMIS studies on photolysis of cocaine samples it is assumed that compound C(10)H(15)NO(3) with a molecular weight of 197 amu and ecgonidine methyl ester with a molecular weight of 181 amu are responsible for the increase of an amplitude of IMIS signals upon UV irradiation of samples of crack and cocaine hydrochloride.",M1

19157045,"The use of fry (embalming fluid and PCP-laced cigarettes or marijuana sticks) among <e>crack</e> cocaine smokers.Statistics show that the prevalence of crack cocaine use and embalming fluid and phencyclidine (PCP)-laced cigarettes or marijuana sticks, commonly referred to on the street as  fry  or  wet  is a problem; however, the relationship between these substances of abuse and concurrent polydrug use is unknown. In the present study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 426 African-American crack users in Houston, Texas, to investigate the difference between those who concurrently reported lifetime (defined as at least one usage of fry in life) fry use and those who stated they never used fry. The data were analyzed using chi-square and logistic regression analyses. Fry users were significantly more likely than non-users to not have a casual sex partner (92% users vs. 84% non-users, p &lt; or = 0.05) and were more likely to have been diagnosed with gonorrhea in the past 12 months (9% users vs. 2% non-users, p &lt; or = 0.05). In addition fry users had significantly higher odds of currently trading sex for drugs (OR = 2.30, p &lt; or = 0.05), marijuana use (OR = 12.11, p &lt; or = 0.05), and codeine (syrup) use (OR = 8.10, p &lt; or = 0.05). These findings are important in determining the  cultural novelties  relative to crack and fry use among younger African Americans.",M1

The intervention was designed to diffuse health promotion and risk-reduction interventions by supporting PHAs to model prevention practices and deliver risk- and harm-reduction materials and information. We compared change in behaviors and attitudes between baseline and 6-month follow-up of 112 primarily African-American and Latino PHAs, 223 of their drug-user network contact referrals, and 118 other study recruits (total n = 523). Results indicated significant HIV risk reduction among all study participants, associated with significant health advocacy action conducted by PHAs, and a relationship between exposure to the RAP peer-delivered intervention and risk reduction among all study groups. Findings suggest that active drug users' engagement in peer health advocacy can set in motion a feedback and diffusion process that supports both the continued work of the PHAs and the adoption of harm reduction and mimicking of health advocacy by their peers.",M1
19042804,"Characteristics of drug-abusing women with children in residential treatment: a preliminary evaluation of program retention and treatment completion.An ex post facto study was conducted to investigate treatment outcomes for 80 women and 168 children admitted into a residential substance-abuse treatment program. The results indicated childhood emotional neglect is a barrier for remaining in and completing treatment for African-American women with comorbid psychological disorders but not for those with <e>crack</e> cocaine dependent disorders. African-American women with comorbid psychological disorders were also three times more likely to dropout of treatment. In addition, there were relatively few differences for between drug-exposed and nonexposed children. However, the results indicated that children of substance-abusing women who completed treatment were more likely to have behavioral problems, to receive early intervention services, and to have mothers as legal guardians by the end of treatment.

19042208,"Follow-up study of <e>crack</e> cocaine users: situation of the patients after 2, 5, and 12 years.The purpose of this study was to follow-up 131 crack users and examine drug use, treatment experience, employment status, and mortality at 2, 5, and 12 years. Consecutive crack dependent patients were re-interviewed in 1995-1996, 1998-1999, and 2005-2006. Of those subjects not using cocaine at 2 years, 19 (63%) were still abstinent at 5 years. Almost half of the users were abstinent at the same period. The abstinent group was still the most prevalent at 12 years. Twenty-seven (20.6%) patients had died by the 12-year follow-up, with homicide being the most common cause (n = 16). After 2000, however, it declined sharply with only 2 deaths in 7 years. There was a progressive movement toward abstinence over the follow-up period, with the evidence that once abstinence had been achieved it was maintained. On the other hand, the mortality rate was extremely high and probably more related with socioeconomic factors instead of the drug use itself.",M1
19016187,"Risks surrounding drug trade involvement among street-involved youth.BACKGROUND: Street-involved youth have been shown to be involved in the street-level illicit drug trade in a number of jurisdictions, though little is known about risk factors and sequelae of this behavior. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate factors associated with the street-level drug trade involvement among street-based youth. METHODS: We used logistic regression to examine factors associated with drug dealing among participants in the At-Risk Youth Study in Vancouver, Canada. We also examined motivations for drug trade involvement and types of drugs sold by participants. RESULTS: Overall, 529 street-involved youth were followed during the study period, of whom 307 (58.0%) reported having been involved in the drug trade in the last six months. In a logistic regression analysis, <e>crack</e> cocaine use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.28-2.67), homelessness (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.04-2.40), and self-reported police assault [corrected] (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.14-3.00) were independently associated with drug dealing among cohort participants. Among participants who reported drug dealing, 263 (85.6%) individuals stated that the main reason that they sold drugs was to pay for their personal drug use. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, street-involved youth implicated in the drug trade are characterized by drug-related and sociodemographic vulnerabilities. These individuals also appear to be motivated by drug dependence and report elevated levels of physical confrontation with police [corrected]. Our findings have immediate implications for drug strategies targeting street-level drug dealing.",M1

18833383,"HIV/AIDS risk among female sex workers who use <e>crack</e> in Southern Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To understand the social context of female sex workers who use crack and its impact on HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. METHODODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES: Qualitative study carried out in Foz do Iguaçu, Southern Brazil, in 2003. Twenty-six in-depth interviews and two focus groups were carried out with female commercial sex workers who frequently use crack. In-depth interviews with health providers, community leaders and public policy managers, as well as field observations were also conducted. Transcript data was entered into Atlas.ti software and grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the data and develop a conceptual model as a result of this study. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS: Female sex workers who use crack had low self-perceived HIV risk in spite of being engaged in risky behaviors (e.g. unprotected sex with multiple partners). Physical and sexual violence among clients, occasional and stable partners was widespread jeopardizing negotiation and consistent condom use. According to health providers, community leaders and public policy managers, several female sex workers who use crack are homeless or live in slums, and rarely have access to health services, voluntary counseling and testing, social support, pre-natal and reproductive care. CONCLUSIONS: Female sex workers who use crack experience a plethora of health and social problems, which apparently affect their risks for HIV infection. Low-threshold, user-friendly and gender-tailored interventions should be implemented, in order to increase the access to health and social-support services among this population. Those initiatives might also increase their access to reproductive health in general, and to preventive strategies focusing on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.",M1

18758935,"Binge use of <e>crack</e> cocaine and sexual risk behaviors among African-American, HIV-positive users.This study describes binge use of crack cocaine, binge users, and their sexual risk behaviors in a sample of 303 African-American, HIV-positive users. Recent binge use was defined as,  using as much crack cocaine as you can, until you run out of crack or are unable to use any more  in the last 30 days. Fifty-one percent reported a recent crack binge. The typical crack binge lasted 3.7 days and involved smoking 40 rocks on average. Nearly two-thirds reported their last binge was in their own or another's home. Seventy-two percent had sex during the last binge, with an average of 3.1 partners. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, recent bingers were more likely than non-bingers to consider themselves homeless, to have any income source, to have used crack longer, and to score higher on risk-taking and need for help with their drug problem. In multivariable ordinal and logistic regression analyses, recent bingers had more sex partners in the last six months and 30 days and were more likely to have never used a condom in the last 30 days. Among male users, recent bingers were more likely to report lifetime and recent exchange of money for sex and drugs for sex. Among both male and female users, recent bingers were more likely to report lifetime trading of sex for drugs. African-American, HIV-positive binge users of crack cocaine appear to be at increased risk for HIV transmission. Further investigations of binge crack use and sexual risk behaviors and interventions targeting and tailored to this group should be considered.",M1

18690803,"Large community outbreak of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 5 invasive infection in an impoverished, urban population.BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of sporadic invasive infections, but outbreaks of invasive pneumococcal disease are infrequent. In August 2006, a sudden increase in the number of patients presenting with invasive pneumococcal disease was noted at St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver, Canada). Most patients with severe disease resided in an area referred to as the Downtown Eastside, a neighborhood known for its high rates of poverty and illicit drug use. METHODS: Prospective, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease was initiated, including on-site serotyping of S. pneumoniae isolates. A vaccination campaign using 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine was launched in the Downtown Eastside. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association of sociodemographic variables and medical risk factors with S. pneumoniae serotype status. RESULTS: A single S. pneumoniae serotype (serotype 5) was responsible for 78% of invasive pneumococcal disease cases (137 of 175 cases) during the outbreak period of August 2006-July 2007. The outbreak strain, although fully susceptible to penicillin, caused significant morbidity and placed considerable strain on the acute care system within the Vancouver Coastal Health region. <e>Crack</e> cocaine use was found to be the main independent risk factor associated with invasive pneumococcal disease due to S. pneumoniae serotype 5 (odds ratio, 12.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.22-69.5). CONCLUSIONS: A targeted vaccination campaign using polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine appeared to help control this outbreak. In urban centers with high rates of illicit drug use, vaccination strategies for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease may need to be refined to include individuals who use crack cocaine.",M1
18641794,"[Characterization of the <e>crack</e> cocaine culture in the city of São Paulo: a controlled pattern of use]OBJECTIVE: To characterize the situation regarding crack cocaine use in the city of São Paulo, along with the sociodemographic profile of its users. METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES: Qualitative ethnographic study carried out with an intentional sample of crack cocaine users (n=45) and former users (n=17). The participants were recruited by means of the chain sampling method and they underwent a semi-structured interview guided by a questionnaire, in 2004 and 2005. The combination of each question and its respective responses gave rise to specific reports that were interpreted individually. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS: The predominating profile of the crack cocaine users was that they were single young men of low socioeconomic class and low schooling level, without formal employment ties. The pattern of use most frequently cited was compulsive, characterized by multiple drug use and carrying out illegal activities in exchange for crack cocaine or money. However, controlled use was also identified. This consisted of non-daily use of crack cocaine mediated by individual factors that were developed intuitively by the user. Controlled use was similar in nature to the strategies adopted by former users to achieve a state of abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: The culture of crack cocaine use has undergone changes regarding the pattern of use. Although most users do so compulsively, the existence of controlled use was observed. This deserves to be investigated in more detail, particularly with regard to the strategies adopted to attain this.",M1
18638705,"Documenting practices and perceptions of 'safer' <e>crack</e> use: a Canadian pilot study.BACKGROUND: People who smoke crack cocaine have a distinct social profile when compared to other drug user groups (e.g., injection drug users), may be at increased risk for particular health problems and experience unique social harms as a consequence of their crack use. In particular, they are exposed to dangers associated with unsafe crack pipe use and lack resources to enable safer consumption practices. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the current practices of people who smoke crack in Vancouver and to discover common attitudes towards the modification of crack smoking practices in the direction of safer crack use. METHODS: Members of a community coalition administered a short survey to street-entrenched crack cocaine users regarding their smoking equipment, their current crack smoking practices, the physical consequences of smoking crack and their attitudes towards safer crack use. RESULTS: Most respondents engaged in 'unsafe' crack use practices and experienced harmful consequences associated with crack use. Those who shared their equipment were at higher risk for experiencing these harmful consequences. CONCLUSION: The information from this study suggests that strategies aimed at reducing the harms associated with crack use, as well as safer crack use education and programming, should be incorporated into substance misuse interventions, disease prevention and health promotion policy, and that further research about these issues is needed.",M1
18615321,"Effectiveness of an outreach treatment program for inner city <e>crack</e> abusers: compliance, outcome, and client satisfaction.In a randomized controlled trial the effectiveness of an outreach treatment program (OTP) was compared with standard addiction care services for hard-drug addicts in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). The study aimed at chronic, high-risk crack abusers who were insufficiently engaged in standard addiction treatment services. Data were collected from February 2000 to December 2001. A total of 124 subjects participated in the study at baseline. Follow-up data were available for 94 subjects. Outcome measures included treatment compliance, outcome, and satisfaction. Data were collected by means of monthly registrations, EuropAsi interviews and an evaluation form. There was a high compliance with OTP in the treatment group; the average length-of-stay was 6 months, with visits three times a week. Although both groups were well represented in standard care, participation was mainly based on methadone maintenance. Subjects treated in OTP showed significant improvements in physical health, general living conditions, and psychiatric status, but no change in employment, substance abuse, and legal status. The control group remained almost unchanged. Clients of OTP reported feeling very satisfied with their treatment. On-the-spot incentives and a positive relationship with the care provider were directly associated with treatment retention. An outreach treatment program, as conducted in this study, is associated with high compliance, general improvement, and treatment satisfaction. Characteristics of this treatment modality are (1) assertive outreach, (2) a mixed program with incentives, and (3) a strong focus on individual-bound therapy. Further research is needed with larger groups and similar conditions at baseline assessment.",M1

18580615,"<e>Crack</e> cocaine, disease progression, and mortality in a multicenter cohort of HIV-1 positive women.BACKGROUND: Longitudinal associations between patterns of crack cocaine use and progression of HIV-1 disease are poorly understood, especially among women. This study explores relationships between crack use and HIV-1 disease outcomes in a multicenter cohort of infected women. METHODS: Subjects were 1686 HIV-seropositive women enrolled at six US research centers in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Approximately 80% were non-white and 29% used crack during the study period. Cox survival and random regression analysis examined biannual observations made April 1996 through September 2004. Outcome measures included death due to AIDS-related causes, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and newly acquired AIDS-defining illnesses. RESULTS: Persistent crack users were over three times as likely as non-users to die from AIDS-related causes, controlling for use of HAART self-reported at 95% or higher adherence, problem drinking, age, race, income, education, illness duration, study site, and baseline virologic and immunologic indicators. Persistent crack users and intermittent users in active and abstinent phases showed greater CD4 cell loss and higher HIV-1 RNA levels controlling for the same covariates. Persistent and intermittent crack users were more likely than non-users to develop new AIDS-defining illnesses controlling for identical confounds. These results persisted when controlling for heroin use, tobacco smoking, depressive symptoms, hepatitis C virus coinfection, and injection drug use. CONCLUSION: Use of crack cocaine independently predicts AIDS-related mortality, immunologic and virologic markers of HIV-1 disease progression, and development of AIDS-defining illnesses among women.",M1
18574684,"Stages of consistent condom use, partner intimacy, condom use attitude, and self-efficacy in African-American <e>crack</e> cocaine users.This study examined how condom use attitude, self-efficacy, and partner intimacy related to five stages of consistent condom use. Interview data were collected from sexually active, heterosexual, African-American crack cocaine smokers (N = 366). Dependent measures assessed both the participants' own responses and their perceptions about their last sex partner's own personal condom use attitude and participants' condom use self-efficacy expectations. Partner intimacy was assessed both as a continuous attitudinal and as a discrete relationship measure. Less than 10% were classified as consistent condom users. Two thirds of inconsistent users were in the Precontemplation (PC) stage. The contemplation (C) and preparation (P) stages were equal among the remainder of the inconsistent condom users. Higher partner intimacy reduced modestly readiness for consistent condom use. The stage but not the intimacy group was related to the condom use attitudes and self-efficacy measures. Last partners' perceived own negative attitudes were significantly related to the stages of consistent condom use and was especially low in the action (A) and maintenance (M) stages. Participants' own negative attitudes were unrelated to the stages. Of the self-efficacy measures, both participants' performance and situational condom use self-efficacies increased significantly after the PC stage and were highest in the P, A, and M stages. However, situational self-efficacy accounted for most of performance self-efficacy variance. In sum, consistent condom use was rare. A partner's attitudes and the participants' own situational self-efficacy expectations, rather than intimacy, determined the readiness to adopt consistent condom use.",M1

18502378," I inject less as I have easier access to pipes : injecting, and sharing of <e>crack</e>-smoking materials, decline as safer crack-smoking resources are distributed.Among injection drug users (IDUs) in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, prevalence rates of HIV (20.6 percent) and hepatitis C HCV (75.8 percent) are among the highest in Canada. Recent research evidence suggests the potential for HCV and HIV transmission through the multi-person use of crack-smoking implements. On the basis of this scientific evidence, in April 2005, Ottawa's needle exchange programme (NEP) commenced distributing glass stems, rubber mouthpieces, brass screens, chopsticks, lip balm and chewing gum to reduce the harms associated with smoking crack. This study aims to evaluate the impact of this initiative on a variety of HCV- and HIV-related risk practices. Active, street-recruited IDUs who also smoked crack consented to personal interviews and provided saliva samples for HCV and HIV testing at four time points: 6-months pre-implementation (N=112), 1-month (N=114), 6-months (N=157) and 12-months (N=167) post-implementation. Descriptive and univariate analyses were completed. Following implementation of the initiative, a significant decrease in injecting was observed. Pre-implementation, 96 percent of IDUs reported injecting in the month prior to the interview compared with 84 percent in the 1-month, and 78 percent in the 6- and 12-month post-implementation interviews (p&lt;.01). Conversely, approximately one-quarter of participants at both the 6- and 12-month post-implementation evaluation points reported that they were smoking crack more frequently since the availability of clean equipment--25 and 29 percent, respectively. In addition to a shift to a less harmful method of drug ingestion, HCV- and HIV-related risks associated with this method were reduced. Among crack-smoking IDUs sharing pipes, the proportion sharing  every time  declined from 37 percent in the 6-month pre-implementation stage, to 31 percent in the 1-month, 12 percent in the 6-month and 13 percent in the 12-month post-implementation stages (p&lt;.01). Since distributing safer crack-smoking materials by a NEP contributes to transition to safer methods of drug ingestion and significantly reduces disease-related risk practices, other NEPs should adopt this practice.",M1

To learn more about crack addiction, long-term crack smokers who had never met the DSM-IV criteria for lifetime cocaine dependence were compared with those who had. The study sample consisted of crack users (n=172) from the Dayton, Ohio, area who were interviewed periodically over 8 years. Data were collected on a range of variables including age of crack initiation, frequency of recent use, and lifetime cocaine dependence. Cocaine dependence was common with 62.8% of the sample having experienced it. There were no statistically significant differences between dependent and non-dependent users for age of crack initiation or frequency of crack use. In terms of sociodemographics, only race/ethnicity was significant, with proportionally fewer African-Americans than whites meeting the criteria for cocaine dependence. Controlling for sociodemographics, partial correlation analysis showed positive, statistically significant relationships between lifetime cocaine dependence and anti-social personality disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and lifetime dependence on alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine, sedative-hypnotics, and opioids. These results highlight the importance addressing race/ethnicity and comorbid disorders when developing, implementing, and evaluating interventions targeting people who use crack cocaine.

18495380,"A cluster analysis of drug use and sexual HIV risks and their correlates in a sample of African-American <e>crack</e> cocaine smokers with HIV infection.The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to classify a sample of HIV-seropositive African-American crack cocaine smokers into homogenous HIV drug use and sexual risk groups using a two step multivariate cluster analysis. Two hundred and fifty-eight crack cocaine smokers participated in the study. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct HIV risk groups. The highest risk group, the largest one, was characterized by frequent, daily crack use, multiple sex partners, trading sex, and inconsistent condom use. The consistent condom use group, the smallest group, was characterized by consistent condom use. The inconsistent condom use group, the second largest group, was distinguished by inconsistent condom use. Comparisons of the three HIV risk groups revealed that the highest risk group had a higher proportion of illegal sources of income, higher proportion of binged crack use, frequent, daily, alcohol use, same gender sex partners, and scored higher on depressive symptoms. Members of the consistent condom use group were more likely to have been HIV diagnosed for a shorter time, to have HIV serodiscordant casual sex partners, higher psychological motivation for condom use, and a lower frequency of vaginal sex. Members of the inconsistent condom use group were more likely to have a main sex partner, to be married, to be on public assistance, to know the HIV serostatus of their casual partner, and less likely to conceal their HIV serostatus. An alarming finding was that a large number of participants inconsistently used condoms with HIV serodiscordant sex partners. Interventions aiming to prevent the secondary spread of HIV infection in African-American crack cocaine smokers should take this variability in account and focus on the differences.",M1

Two logistic models, one restricted to female and the other to male crack smokers, were constructed to identify gender-specific risk factors associated with dual use (p &lt; 0.05). Of 437 crack smokers, 246 (56%) were dual users while 191 (44%) were never injectors. In a fitted logistic regression model, dual use among female crack smokers was associated with HCV infection (adjusted OR = 4.65, 95% CI: 1.92-9.70), exchanging sex for money, drugs, or shelter while using crack (aOR = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.56-12.80), having a casual partner who injects (aOR = 4.13, 95% CI: 1.05-16.26), having equipment broken or confiscated by police without being arrested (aOR = 3.66, 95% CI: 1.43-9.34), and HIV infection (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.18-5.96). Among male crack smokers, dual use was associated with HCV infection (aOR = 5.34, 95% CI: 2.10-13.18), exchanging sex for money, drugs, or shelter (aOR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.59-6.65), crack use history &gt;or= 5 years (aOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.29-3.63), and smoking in a group of unknown people (such as crack houses, alleys; aOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10-2.81). These findings highlight the need for evidence-based prevention and harm reduction initiatives that directly targeting crack cocaine smokers, with particular attention given to female dual users of injection drugs.",M1
18365943,"Perceived neighborhood safety and depressive symptoms among African American <e>crack</e> users.This study examined the association between perceived neighborhood safety and depressive symptoms among 443 out-of-treatment African American crack cocaine users interviewed between 2000 and 2002 in North Carolina and tested the regression of depression on perceived neighborhood safety and common predictors of depression. Perceived neighborhood safety was an important predictor of depressive symptoms in models that adjusted for other correlates of depression. The findings are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data and the complex etiology and course of depression. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between perceived neighborhood safety and depression. The study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",M1
18361854,"Sex trade in a male-to-female transgender population: psychosocial correlates of inconsistent condom use.BACKGROUND: Research suggests that because of economic necessity, many male-to-female (MTF) transgender individuals trade sex for money, drugs, housing, and other things they may need. To date, no studies have quantitatively assessed psychosocial correlates of condom use with this population. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study with 190 MTF transgender individuals involved in sex trade in San Francisco, California. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with inconsistent condom use during receptive anal sex with exchange partners. RESULTS: About one fifth of our participants reported inconsistent condom use during receptive anal sex in the past 6 months. In the multivariate model, low self-esteem [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.28, 7.47)], a history of forced sex or rape [AOR=2.91; 95% CI (1.06, 8.01)], and use of <e>crack</e>-cocaine [AOR=2.59; 95% CI (1.09, 6.13)] were independently associated with inconsistent condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight an urgent need for multilevel risk reduction interventions for MTF transgender individuals involved in sex trade. Such interventions will be most effective if they address the psychosocial context of sexual risk taking by focusing on issues such as low self-esteem, sexual violence, and illicit drug use.",M1
18327467,"Assessing risk behaviors and prevalence of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections among female <e>crack</e> cocaine users inSalvador--Bahia, Brazil.Crack cocaine use is associated with risky sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. We investigated sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics and infection rates in female crack cocaine users from impoverished communities of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. A sample of 125 female crack cocaine users was recruited. Overall, the interviewees had low educational level and high rate of unemployment (close to 90%). One-third (37%) reported having traded sex for money or drugs, and 58% reported that they had not used condoms during intercourse in the last 30 days. The prevalence of infections was low: HIV-1.6%; HCV-2.4%; HBV- 0.8%; HTLV I/II-4.0%; and syphilis-4.0%. The combination of dire poverty and high prevalence of risk behaviors turn such populations a preferential target of initiatives aiming to reduce drug-related harm and promote social development. Low infection rates should not be viewed with complacency, but as a window of opportunity to implement prevention initiatives and reduce social marginalization.",M1
18312289,"High prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among noninjecting drug users: association with sharing the inhalation implements of <e>crack</e>.BACKGROUND: Most of the prevalent cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are attributable to intravenous drug using. However, a substantial number of individuals, particularly noninjecting drug users (NIDU), report no identifiable source of HCV exposure. This may be interpreted as inaccurate reporting of past intravenous exposure or as the presence of an unidentified source of HCV infection. Because of this, we evaluated the prevalence of and factors associated with HCV infection among NIDU. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-two individuals who were attended from 2003 to 2004 in a drug addiction facility because of noninjecting drug use were included. RESULTS: HCV infection was detected in 23 (12.6%) participants. Sharing the inhalation tube of crack cocaine [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.8, P=0.01], presence of tattoos (AOR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3-9.1, P=0.02) and age &gt;or=34 years (AOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.3-11.6, P=0.01) 3.9 were independently associated with HCV infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HCV infection in NIDU is higher than in general population. HCV infection is more likely among older drug users, those with tattoos and crack cocaine users that share the inhalation implements.",M1
18307444,"Effect of chronic cocaine abuse on the elastic properties of aorta.BACKGROUND: Any unfavorable effect of cocaine on aortic elastic properties will contribute to the adverse effects of cocaine on the cardiovascular system. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the aortic elastic properties in long-term <e>crack</e> cocaine abusers. METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive chronic cocaine abusers and 36 control subjects with similar age, gender, cholesterol, and triglyceride plasma levels, as well as incidence of cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the study. Results: The average duration of cocaine abuse was 10 +/- 3.2 years. Diastolic thoracic aortic diameter was increased in cocaine users compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Aortic strain and distensibility were approximately twofold lower and aortic stiffness index approximately threefold higher in patients compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.01). The duration of cocaine abuse was related to low aortic strain and distensibility as well as increased aortic stiffness index (R =-0.32, R =-0.38, and R = 0.28, respectively, weighted for age; P &lt; 0.01). When the cocaine abusers were divided into quartiles of duration of cocaine using (first quartile: &lt;5 years; second quartile: &gt;5 and &lt;8 years; third quartile: &gt;8 and &lt;11 years; and fourth quartile: &gt;11 years), progressive increase was found in aortic stiffness index. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that chronic cocaine abuse clearly produces significant decrease in the elastic properties of aorta. This effect of cocaine is related to the duration of cocaine abuse.",M1
18299233,"Cytomorphometric analysis of <e>crack</e> cocaine effects on the oral mucosa.OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effect of smoking crack cocaine on the nuclear area (NA), the cytoplasmic area (CA), and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm area ratio (NA/CA) of oral squamous epithelial cells. STUDY DESIGN: Oral smears were collected from clinically normal-appearing mucosa by liquid-based exfoliative cytology of 40 individuals (20 crack users and 20 nonusers) and analyzed for quantitative techniques using an image analysis system. RESULTS: Mean values of NA for experimental and control groups were, respectively, 49.85 microm(2) and 62.68 microm(2) (P &lt; .01). CA showed the following mean values: 1820.9 microm(2) (experimental) and 1780.8 microm(2) (control). NA/CA for the experimental group was 0.03; the control group was 0.04 (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that crack cocaine was able to induce significant changes on the oral epithelial cells. Since this illicit drug is normally used in association with other risk factors for oral cancer (tobacco and alcohol), crack cocaine abusers should have frequent preventive oral exams.",M1
18293137,"Associations among correlates of schedule adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART): a path analysis of a sample of <e>crack</e> cocaine using sexually active African-Americans with HIV infection.Adherence to HIV medication regimens is a function of multiple dimensions including psychological functioning, social support, adherence self-efficacy and optimism regarding treatment. Active substance use can also negatively affect adherence. An understanding of the nature of the associations among the correlates of adherence can better inform the design of interventions to improve adherence. This study developed an exploratory path model of schedule adherence using data from a sample 130 African-American HIV-positive crack cocaine users on highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). This model was based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping developed by Lazarus and Folkman. Following the theory, the effects of psychological distress on schedule adherence were mediated by patients' relationship with their doctor and optimism towards antiretroviral treatment. Adherence was also associated with patients' self-efficacy regarding their medical regimen which, in turn, was associated with their social support.",M1
18293134,"Drug sharing with clients as a risk marker for increased violence and sexual and drug-related harms among survival sex workers.Previous studies have described links between violence, decreased condom use and drug sharing among intimate partners, though limited information exists about the predictors of drug sharing among female sex workers and their clients. The following analysis explored the association between sharing illicit drugs with clients and sexual and drug-related harms among survival sex workers. A total of 198 women participated in interview-administered questionnaires and confidential HIV testing. Of the total, 117 (59%) reported sharing drugs with clients/johns in the last six months and <e>crack</e> cocaine was the primary drug shared (n=108). In logistic regression analysis, sharing drugs with clients/johns was associated with borrowing a used crack pipe (AOR=5.63; 95%CI: 2.71-9.44; p&lt;0.001), intensive/daily crack cocaine smoking (AOR=3.78; 95%CI:1.60-8.92; p&lt;0.002), inconsistent condom use by a client/john (AOR=3.17; 95%CI:1.48-6.77; p&lt;0.003) and having a recent bad date (verbal harassment, physical and/or sexual assault) (AOR=2.71; 95%CI:1.17-6.32; p=0.021). Sharing illicit drugs with clients/johns may be a crucial risk marker for increased violence and sexual and drug-related harms among survival sex workers. HIV prevention and harm reduction initiatives targeting both women and clients/johns are urgently needed, including enhanced support for community and peer-driven sex work initiatives, to address some of the structural facilitators for HIV transmission.",M1
18293133,"An investigation of a personal norm of condom-use responsibility among African American <e>crack</e> cocaine smokers.The purpose of this study was to investigate the unique contribution of a personal norm of condom-use responsibility to the formation of intentions to use male condoms during vaginal sex. Data were collected from 402 male and 157 female heterosexual African American crack cocaine smokers in Houston, Texas, US. Two structural equation models of the intention to use a condom with the last sex partner were estimated. One model included measures of condom-use attitudes, subjective norms and condom-use self-efficacy. A second model included these three measures and a fourth measure of a personal norm of condom-use responsibility. Separate models were estimated for men and women. The addition of a personal norm of condom-use responsibility provided a significantly better fit to the data than did models including only outcome expectations, subjective norms and self-efficacy. Results also showed distinctly different underlying cognitive structures of condom-use intention for men and women. A personal norm of condom-use responsibility had a strong direct effect on men's intentions to use condoms with the last sex partner. Other variables appeared to have no direct effect on men's intentions. Women's intentions were strongly influenced by a personal norm and social subjective norms. Situational self-efficacy and outcome expectations had weaker, yet significant, effects on women's intentions. Given the strong effect of personal norms on men's intentions to use condoms, further research should be undertaken.",M1
18293131,"Personal and partner measures in stages of consistent condom use among African-American heterosexual <e>crack</e> cocaine smokers.Participants' personal condom use measures and those of their last sex partner's were examined in five stages of change for consistent condom use among 449 urban sexually active, heterosexual, African-American crack smokers. The measures included participants' personal and their last sex partner's perceived responsibility, personal and perceived negative attitudes, and participants' self-efficacy to use condoms. The relationships between the measures and the stages were examined using analyses of variance and multivariate logistic regression. Over 90% of participants did not use condoms, consistently. Two-thirds of the inconsistent users were in the precontemplation stage. The rest were equally divided between the contemplation and preparation stages. Personal responsibility outperformed other measures in initial intention to become a regular condom user; partner's perceived responsibility dominated continued intention and actual consistent condom use. Negative attitudes and self-efficacies had strong relationships to the stages of consistent condom use in univariate analyses but these relationships became substantially weaker when the responsibility, attitude, and self-efficacy concepts were entered simultaneously into multivariate analyses.",M1
18242881,"Rapid assessment of drug-related HIV risk among men who have sex with men in three South African cities.The current assessment was undertaken to examine the link between drug use and sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM) in locations known to have high prevalence rates of drug use and sexual risk behavior in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria, South Africa. Street intercepts and purposive snowball sampling were used to recruit drug-using MSM. A rapid assessment was undertaken which included observation, mapping, key informant interviews and focus group interviews with MSM. Drug using key informants were tested for HIV. The use of drugs like <e>crack</e> cocaine, cannabis and methamphetamine to specifically facilitate sexual encounters was evident. Drugs led to inconsistent condom use and other high-risk sexual activities despite HIV risk knowledge being high. Many injecting drug-using MSM shared needles and reused equipment. Among MSM who agreed to HIV testing, one-third tested positive. Views about drug and HIV treatment and preventive services and their efficacy were mixed. Various barriers to accessing services were highlighted including homosexual stigmatization and availability of drugs in treatment facilities. Recommendations include addressing the gap between HIV-risk knowledge and practice, extending VCT services for MSM, increasing the visibility of drug abuse services within communities, addressing concerns about drug availability in treatment centers as well as reintegration issues and the need for after-care services, reducing stigmatization in drug and HIV services for MSM and finally, strengthening the link between drug treatment services and HIV prevention by integrating HIV/drug-related risks into HIV prevention efforts and HIV risks into drug use prevention efforts.",M1
18207725,"Mapping violence and policing as an environmental-structural barrier to health service and syringe availability among substance-using women in street-level sex work.BACKGROUND: Within street-based sex work and substance-using populations, there is growing evidence to support the role of place, both physical setting and social meanings attached to place, in mediating the effectiveness and reach of health and harm reduction services. METHODS: Social mapping was used to explore how health service and syringe availability may be impacted at the geographic level by avoidance of physical settings due to violence and policing among women in street-level sex work. Through a community-based research partnership and extensive peer-led outreach over a 6-month period, women were invited to participate in interview-questionnaires and mapping of their community, working conditions, and access to resources. Results were compiled used ArcGIS software and GIS street maps. In secondary analysis, logistic regression was used to model the geographic association (using likelihood ratio and significance at p&lt;0.05) and stratified models were run to assess differential patterns of avoidance based on age, ethnicity and drug use. RESULTS: The findings reveal a significant geographic relationship between a heavily concentrated core area of health and syringe availability and avoidance of physical settings due to violence and policing by 198 women in street-level sex work in Vancouver, Canada. Of particular concern, this correlation is significantly elevated among younger and Aboriginal women, active injection drug users, and daily <e>crack</e> cocaine smokers, suggesting significant environmental-structural barriers to interventions among these vulnerable populations. CONCLUSIONS: The resultant displacement of sex work to primarily industrial settings and side streets pushes women further from health and social supports and reduces access to safer injection and drug use paraphernalia. This study offers important evidence for environmental-structural level prevention and safer environment interventions, supported by legal reforms, that facilitate safer sex work environments, including spatial programming, peer-based prevention, outreach and mobile resources, and peer-supervised safer sex work settings.",M1

Multivariate regression models indicated that social support was not a strong influence on crack use. For women, no social support variables predicted crack use, whereas for men, having a non-using partner was negatively associated with crack use. Findings indicate that existing social support is not strongly linked to drug use among African Americans, but African American men may be positively influenced by non-using sexual partners. Limitations of the sample and data are discussed. Further research is needed on the influence of social support for African American drug-using populations.",M1
18187534,"Cocaine/<e>crack</e> cocaine consumption, treatment demand, seizures, related offences, prices, average purity levels and deaths in the UK (1990 - 2004).A recent trend of escalating use of cocaine/crack cocaine was observed in the UK. The number of mentions on death certificates; last year use of cocaine; treatment demand, number of drug offenders, seizures, prices and average purity levels were the indicators used for this descriptive and correlational study. Figures (1990-2004) were taken from official UK sources. A total of 1022 cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions (i.e. deaths from any cause where the presence of cocaine/crack cocaine was also detected) were identified, with cocaine/crack cocaine being the sole drug mentioned in 36% of cases. The number of cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions showed a year-on-year increase and correlated positively with the following cocaine (powder) figures: last year use (p &lt; 0.001); number of offenders (p &lt; 0.001) and number of seizures (p &lt; 0.001), but correlated negatively with price (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the number of cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions correlated positively with the number of crack offenders (p &lt; 0.001) and seizures (p &lt; 0.001), but correlated negatively with both crack purity ( p &lt; 0.001) and price (p &lt; 0.05). With conditions of increasing drug availability having been met in the UK, decrease in cocaine prices were associated with higher consumption levels and this, in turn, contributed to the increase in number of cocaine-related fatalities. There are limitations with the information collected, since no distinction is usually made on medical death certificates between cocaine and crack cocaine. The present study being an ecological one, it proved difficult to address the role of confounding variables that may well explain some of the associations observed.",M1

Analyses were conducted on the 1,384 partners and 692 partnership combinations reported. Partnerships and partnership patterns were examined with respect to three risk behaviors-unprotected sex, alcohol use to accompany sex, and drug use to accompany sex-and with respect to three affective measures-partner intimacy, condom use responsibility, and condom use self-efficacy. Results indicate that while many partnerships were based on trading sex for money or drugs, many participants reported partners they considered a spouse or friend.

To this end, this exploratory study sought to detect HCV on crack-use paraphernalia used by street crack users. METHODS: Crack-use paraphernalia within 60 min of use was collected from 51 (N) street-crack users. HCV RNA detection was conducted through eluate sampling and manual RNA extraction. Participants provided a saliva sample to test for HCV antibody, and had a digital photograph taken of their oral cavities, to assess the presence of oral sores as a possible risk factor for oral HCV transmission. RESULTS: About 43.1% (n=22) of the study participants were HCV-antibody positive. One (2.0%) of the 51 pipes tested positive. A minority of the participants presented oral sores. The pipe on which HCV was detected was made from a glass stem; its owner was HCV-antibody positive, and there was full rater agreement on the presence of oral sores in the pipe owner's oral cavity. CONCLUSIONS: HCV transmission from an infected host onto paraphernalia as a precondition of HCV host-to-host transmission via shared crack paraphernalia use seems possible, with oral sores and paraphernalia condition constituting possible risk modifiers. Larger-scale studies with crack users are needed to corroborate our findings.",M1

Four levels of crack use characterized frequency of use in the past 30 days; readiness was assessed on three levels (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation/action). Differences between intervention groups on crack use and readiness by gender were examined from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Overall, participants reduced their crack use from baseline, with those in the EI showing greater improvement than those in the SI. A small proportion of participants improved readiness; those who improved were more likely to improve their crack use. No significant gender differences were found. These findings suggest that the readiness construct does not fully capture the dynamics of change among out-of-treatment crack users. Further research is needed to fully comprehend the dynamics of change among this group.",M1

METHODS: We undertook 44 in-depth qualitative interviews among injectors of crack-heroin speedball in Bristol and London, England, in 2006. FINDINGS: The data suggest an emerging culture of crack-based speedball injection. Injectors' narratives link speedball injection with shifts towards groin injection articulated as an acceptable risk, and not merely as a last resort in the face of increased vein deterioration associated with speedball. Accounts of vein damage linked to speedball emphasize 'missed hits' related to the local anaesthetic action of crack, the excess use of citric in the preparation of speedball injections and 'flushing' when making a hit. We find that groin injection persists despite an awareness of health risks and medical complications. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize an urgent need for reviewing harm reduction in relation to vein care in the context of shifts to crack-based speedball injection, and the use of the femoral vein, among UK injectors. There is an additional need for interventions to promote safer groin and speedball injecting as well as to prevent transitions toward groin and crack injection.",M1

The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006. RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. The infections responded to antibiotic treatment. Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed. Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.",M1

Intervention effects were examined using generalized estimated equation model. RESULTS: Significant increases in AIDS knowledge and condom use were observed in the experimental group, as well as significant changes in the subscores for sexual and drug risks. The experimental intervention was less successful in decreasing mean days of cocaine use when compared to the standard.

Little is known about the role played by HIV status disclosure in high HIV prevalence communities. 180 Black women who used drugs in the past 30 days were recruited between May 2002 and May 2004 in New York City. Women were administered a structured network questionnaire and HIV serotested. Risk practices, HIV status disclosure within networks and mixing patterns by known HIV status are examined. Most (85%) women had used <e>crack</e> in the past 30 days; 48 (27%) had injected drugs, 65 (36%) reported anal sex, and 99 (55%) reported sex work at some time. Forty (22%) women were HIV-seropositive; 29 (16%) knew their seropositive status. Of high risk individual behaviours, only a history of sex work was associated with an HIV-seropositive status [(aOR=3.0; 95%CI: 1.3-7.3), p=.01]. Few (7%) of 600 network members disclosed an HIV positive status, although 73% were sex or drug use partners. Women who knew themselves to be HIV-infected were more likely than other women to report HIV-infected network members [(OR=1.5; 95%CI: 1.1-6.4), p=.03]. However, only 51% of network members disclosed an HIV status and women disclosed to 50% of their network members.

The appropriate surgical treatment and long-term outcomes remain unclear. A retrospective chart review of all gastroduodenal perforations associated with crack cocaine use was performed. Data abstracted included details of short- and long-term outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to evaluate surgical outcomes. Over the 14-year period ending December 2005, 16 cases of crack-induced gastric perforations were identified. Most (75%) were treated with an omental patch. The other patients underwent a formal antiulcer operation, including one vagotomy and pyloroplasty (V&amp;P), one vagotomy and antrectomy, one subtotal gastrectomy, and one ulcer excision and V&amp;P. All patients after antiulcer procedures were followed for a median of 63 months (range 27-120) with no recurrences. Follow-up data were available in 75% of the omental patch patients.

Some crack-cocaine users develop coarsening changes in the appearance of their hands after prolonged use of the drug. These changes have most often been recognized in females and include: (i) Perniosis with cold, numb hands, sometimes with perniotic hyperkeratosis over the knuckles.(ii) Finger pulp atrophy of the distal part of the pulps of some digits, especially the thumbs and index fingers.(iii) Claw-like curvature of the nails. As the distal pulp is lost, it can no longer splint the nail straight and so the nail curves, claw-like, and reminiscent of a parrot's beak as it clings to the new contour. As the pulp atrophy progresses, the nail eventually also becomes smaller.This triad may be due to ischemia consequent upon peripheral vasoconstriction induced by crack-cocaine. Early changes may resolve with abstinence. In the patients described the syndrome does not appear to be to related to intravenous drug usage. It may occur without concomitant use of heroin, whether smoked or via the intravenous route. The syndrome does not occur in all crack-cocaine users. It is hypothesized that those with a vasoreactive circulation (i.e., those with vasomotor instability/perniosis) are more susceptible to this reaction pattern. The syndrome consisting of the triad of perniosis, pulp atrophy and parrot-beaked clawing of the nails should alert the clinician to the possibility of prolonged crack-cocaine misuse.",M1
17645426,"<e>Crack</e> cocaine trajectories among users in a midwestern American city.AIMS: Although crack cocaine first appeared in cities in the United States in the mid-1980s, little is known about its use over long periods of time. This study identified crack cocaine user groups on the basis of long-term trajectories. DESIGN: Following a natural history approach, data were collected periodically from 1996 to 2005. Group-based modeling assessed the probability of a crack smoker becoming abstinent during the observation period. SETTING: A targeted sampling plan guided the recruitment of a community sample of crack cocaine users in Dayton, Ohio. PARTICIPANTS: Crack smokers (n = 430) 18 years or older whose urine tested positive for cocaine metabolites at the baseline interview. MEASUREMENTS: Interviewer-administered and audio computer self-administered, structured questionnaires were used to collect data on a range of variables, including frequency of crack use. Abstinence was defined as not having used crack for at least 6 consecutive months during the study. FINDINGS: Three trajectory-based groups were identified: (1) No Change, characterized by a very low probability of abstinence; (2) Some Change, characterized by a low to moderate probability of abstinence; and (3) Dramatic Change, characterized by a high probability of abstinence. African Americans and men were significantly less likely to become abstinent. For the majority of the people (63.6%), crack use was uninterrupted by extended periods of abstinence during the study. CONCLUSION: Crack cocaine use that persists for a decade or longer may well be the norm for a large proportion of people who have experience with the drug.",M1
17554010,"Identifying injection drug users at risk of nonfatal overdose.OBJECTIVES: Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental deaths among U.S. adults aged 15-64 years. Emergency physicians have a unique opportunity to provide overdose prevention interventions, because habitual drug users are in frequent need of medical care. The authors evaluated associations between individual-level risk factors and experiencing an overdose in the past six months to determine which characteristics and behaviors may be most predictive of overdose. METHODS: The authors used data from a sample of street-recruited habitual drug users who participated in face-to-face interviews about overdose from November 2001 to February 2004. This analysis was restricted to 772 respondents who had been injecting for at least one year and who had injected heroin within the past two months. RESULTS: A total of 16.6% of participants had overdosed in the past six months. Characteristics and behaviors that were independently associated with an increased risk of a recent overdose were having had a prior overdose (odds ratio [OR], 28.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.10 to 57.96), using cocaine/<e>crack</e> in the past six months (OR, 2.07; 95% CI = 1.25 to 3.45), using alcohol in the past six months (OR, 1.90; 95% CI = 1.01 to 3.57), experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms in the past two months (OR, 2.70; 95% CI = 1.58 to 4.61), and younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Drug users who have previously experienced a nonfatal overdose are at very high risk of experiencing future overdoses. Further longitudinal studies are needed to identify robust predictors of overdose risk over time in habitual drug users, but these data suggest that drug users who have overdosed warrant aggressive prevention efforts such as agonist maintenance treatment or provision of take-home naloxone.",M1

In an attempt to ascertain beyond anecdotal evidence, the authors carried out a cross-sectional study among 482 African-American crack users to investigate the differences between those who were concurrently codeine cough syrup users and those who were not codeine cough syrup users in Houston, Texas. Logistic regression indicated that codeine use was significantly associated with lower participant age and lower education; codeine cough syrup users were significantly more likely than nonusers to not have a main sexual partner. In addition, codeine users had significantly higher odds of ever trading sex for money, marijuana use, and fry use. These findings are important in determining the  cultural novelties  relative to crack and codeine use among younger African Americans.",M1

METHODS: Maternal-child dyads (n = 208) were recruited through street outreach and snowball sampling and completed interviews about substance use and parenting. RESULTS: Regression analyses found significant main effects of youth age, family conflict, warmth, and disapproval of youth substance use on children's substance use. Age x Parenting interactions were significant for conflict and disapproval. Higher family conflict increased older youths' risk, while higher perceived maternal disapproval protected against substance use for older youth. CONCLUSIONS: Family influences may offer risk and protective effects for adolescent children of maternal drug users. Outreach and family-focused interventions that address family conflict and communication of disapproval of substance use may help reduce intergenerational risk transmission. However, longitudinal research with comprehensive parenting assessments is needed.",M1

We report on baseline data from a sample of African American crack smokers who were about to participate in an intervention designed to reduce HIV-related risk behaviors. The majority were male (80%), single (70%) and homeless (52%). Data indicated that 29% of the sample had been in a previous HIV intervention in the past 12 months, the majority in a correctional setting or CBO program. There were few systematic demographic differences between the two groups. Those who had been in an intervention reported using male and female condoms significantly more frequently on all measures of condom use, had positive condom use outcome expectations for male condoms and higher affective and situational condom-related self-efficacy beliefs. These data suggest that, at a community level, the spectrum of HIV risk-reduction programs does produce a significant improvement in condom use and related cognitions, although there is a need to cover a greater proportion of the population.

17469940,"Risk factors in the relationship between gender and <e>crack</e>/cocaine.Female inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more likely to be dependent on this drug than on any other drug. Additionally, female inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more likely to be dependent on this drug than their male counterparts, despite no consistent difference demonstrated in use and dependence across other drugs. Because no published work has empirically examined the factors underlying this link between females and crack/cocaine, the current study examined the role of theoretically relevant personality and environmental variables. Among 152 (37% female) individuals in a residential substance-use treatment program, females evidenced greater use of crack/cocaine (current and lifetime heaviest) and were significantly more likely to evidence crack/cocaine dependence than their male counterparts. In contrast, no gender differences were found for any other substance across alcohol, cannabis, and hallucinogens (including PCP). Surprisingly, females were more impulsive than their male counterparts, with impulsivity serving as a risk factor in the relationship between gender and crack/cocaine dependence and lifetime heaviest use. Females also evidenced higher levels of negative emotionality and childhood abuse, but neither variable served as a risk factor in the relationship between gender and crack/cocaine dependence or use. Limitations and future directions are discussed, including the need for further exploration of impulsivity across its various dimensions as well as the inclusion of additional variables such as social context variables to account more fully for this complex link between gender and crack/cocaine.",M1

17435927,"Brazilian female <e>crack</e> users show elevated serum aluminum levels.OBJECTIVE: There is no information in the literature on the impact of crack smoking using crushed aluminum cans as makeshift pipes, a common form of crack use in Brazil. Since aluminum intake is associated with neurological damage, we measured serum aluminum levels in crack smokers. The objective of this study was to ascertain the levels of aluminum in crack users who smoke on makeshift aluminum pipes. METHOD: 71 female crack smokers, their mean age being 28.0 (+/- 7.7), provided information about their drug use, and had blood samples tested for serum aluminum level. RESULTS: 56 (79%) subjects smoked crack from crushed can pipes, while 15 (21%) smoked from other containers. Fifty-two (73.2%) out of the 71 subjects presented a serum aluminum level of 2 microg/l and 13 (18.3%) had a serum aluminum level of 6 microg/l cut-off point, which is above the reference value. When compared to non-drug users matched by their mean age and gender, they had similar median values and interquartile ranges for serum aluminum level [3 (2-4.6) for crack smokers; 2.9 (1.6-4.1) for controls], but with different means and standard deviations (4.7 +/- 4.9 and 2.9 +/- 1.7, respectively). DISCUSSION: Crack smokers have high serum aluminum level, but we are unsure of its complete association with aluminum cans. Further studies are needed.

17435924,"<e>Crack</e> users, sexual behavior and risk of HIV infection.OBJECTIVE: To compare a sample of injecting cocaine users and crack users, assessing sexual behavior, risk for infection by HIV and its seroprevalence. METHOD: 109 injecting cocaine users and 132 crack users were assessed, using the World Health Organization questionnaire from the expanded  Cross-Site Study of Behaviors and HIV Seroprevalence among Injecting Drug Users  and HIV serology. Data were assessed by Multiple Correspondences Analysis. RESULTS: Crack users showed less time of drug consumption when compared to the injecting cocaine users. Despite this fact, they had higher rates of risky sexual activity, differences in poli-consumption of drugs, and higher rates of involvement in illegal issues. HIV seroprevalence among crack users, although lower than for injecting cocaine users (7% vs. 33%) is high when compared to the general population at the same age. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual behavior of crack users in the studied sample may be considered a risk factor for HIV infection. Crack users have access to information on HIV/ AIDS, but do not make use of it to change risk behaviors that may expose them to HIV infection and dissemination. HIV seroprevalence among crack users (7%) is concerning, which makes it necessary to create preventive strategies for HIV infection and dissemination that are specifically directed toward this population.",M1

This paper draws on qualitative interviews with 50 recent and former crack-cocaine users to explore patterns of use and distribution in three counties in rural Ohio. The findings show that variable patterns of crack use previously documented among urban crack users are evident in rural areas as well, though these are modified by the context of the rural small town. It is postulated that local social networks are the primary means by which these patterns are both transmitted and translated.

20167362,"<e>Crack</e> arrest within teeth at the dentinoenamel junction caused by elastic modulus mismatch.Enamel and dentin compose the crowns of human teeth. They are joined at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) which is a very strong and well-bonded interface unlikely to fail within healthy teeth despite the formation of multiple cracks within enamel during a lifetime of exposure to masticatory forces. These cracks commonly are arrested when reaching the DEJ. The phenomenon of crack arrest at the DEJ is described in many publications but there is little consensus on the underlying cause and mechanism. Explanations range from the DEJ having a larger toughness than both enamel and dentin up to the assumption that not the DEJ itself causes crack arrest but the so-called mantle dentin, a thin material layer close to the DEJ that is somewhat softer than the bulk dentin. In this study we conducted 3-point bending experiments with bending bars consisting of the DEJ and surrounding enamel and dentin to investigate crack propagation and arrest within the DEJ region. Calculated stress intensities around crack tips were found to be highly influenced by the elastic modulus mismatch between enamel and dentin and hence, the phenomenon of crack arrest at the DEJ could be explained accordingly via this elastic modulus mismatch.",M2

In sufficiently thin slices the enamel becomes translucent, allowing for through-thickness observations of the crack topography.

19796801,"Micro-indentation fracture behavior of human enamel.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the <e>crack</e> resistance behavior (K(R)) of human enamel in relation to its microstructure. METHODS: Human molar teeth were precision cut, polished and tested using Vickers micro-indentation at different loads ranging from 0.98 to 9.8 N. Five indentation load levels were considered, 20 indentation cracks for each load level were introduced on the surface of the test specimen (10 indentations per tooth) and their variability was evaluated using Weibull statistics and an empirical model. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to analyze the crack morphology and propagation mechanisms involved. RESULTS: The results showed that enamel exhibited increasing cracking resistance (K(R)) with increasing load. It was found that the crack propagation mainly depended on the location and the microstructure it encountered. SEM showed the formation of crack bridges and crack deflection near the indentation crack tip. The crack mode was of Palmqvist type even at larger loads of 9.8 N. This was mainly attributed to the large process zone created by the interwoven lamellar rod like microstructure exhibited by the enamel surface. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that there are still considerable prospects for improving dental ceramics and for mimicking the enamel structure developed by nature.",M2

Single edge notched bending specimens (SENB) prepared out of bovine incisors were tested in 3-point bending and subsequently analysed using optical and environmental scanning electron microscopy. Cracks propagated primarily within the protein-rich rod sheaths and crack propagation occurred under an inclined angle to initial notch direction not only due to enamel rod and hydroxyapatite crystallite orientation but potentially also due to protein shearing. Determined mode I fracture resistance curves ranged from 0.8-1.5 MPa*m(1/2) at the beginning of crack propagation up to 4.4 MPa*m(1/2) at 500 microm crack extension; corresponding mode II values ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 MPa*m(1/2).",M2
19627862,"Aging and the reduction in fracture toughness of human dentin.An evaluation of the <e>crack</e> growth resistance of human coronal dentin was performed on tissue obtained from patients between ages 18 and 83. Stable crack extension was achieved over clinically relevant lengths (0&lt; or = a &lt; or =1mm) under Mode I quasi-static loading and perpendicular to the nominal tubule direction. Results distinguished that human dentin exhibits an increase in crack growth resistance with extension (i.e. rising R-curve) and that there is a significant reduction in both the initiation (K(o)) and plateau (K(p)) components of toughness with patient age. In the young dentin (18&lt; or =age&lt; or =35) there was a 25% increase in the crack growth resistance from the onset of extension (K(o)=1.34 MPa m(0.5)) to the maximum or  plateau  toughness (K(p)=1.65 MPa m(0.5)). In comparison, the crack growth resistance of the old dentin (55&lt; or =age) increased with extension by less than 10% from K(o)=1.08 MPa m(0.5) to K(p)=1.17 MPa m(0.5). In young dentin toughening was achieved by a combination of inelastic deformation of the mineralized collagen matrix and microcracking of the peritubular cuffs. These mechanisms facilitated further toughening via the development of unbroken ligaments of tissue and posterior crack-bridging. Microstructural changes with aging decreased the capacity for near-tip inelastic deformation and microcracking of the tubules, which in turn suppressed the formation of unbroken ligaments and the degree of extrinsic toughening.",M2

Another 40 single canal premolars were randomly divided into four groups of 10 each: intact dentin, prepared but unobturated canal, canal obturated with epoxy rein (AH Plus/gutta percha), or with UDMA resin sealer (Resilon/RealSeal. The samples were prepared for Wf test parallel to dentinal tubules. Wf was compared under ANOVA with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05.

Cracks appear to initiate from tufts, hypocalcified defects at the enamel-dentin junction, and grow longitudinally around the enamel coat to produce failure. Microindentation corner cracks placed next to the tufts in the sections deflect along the tuft interfaces and occasionally penetrate into the adjacent enamel. Although they constitute weak interfaces, the tufts are nevertheless filled with organic matter, and appear to be stabilized against easy extension by self-healing, as well as by mutual stress-shielding and decussation, accounting at least in part for the capacity of tooth enamel to survive high functional forces.",M2
19427691,"On the R-curve behavior of human tooth enamel.In this study the <e>crack</e> growth resistance behavior and fracture toughness of human tooth enamel were quantified using incremental crack growth measures and conventional fracture mechanics. Results showed that enamel undergoes an increase in crack growth resistance (i.e. rising R-curve) with crack extension from the outer to the inner enamel, and that the rise in toughness is a function of distance from the dentin enamel junction (DEJ). The outer enamel exhibited the lowest apparent toughness (0.67+/-0.12 MPam(0.5)), and the inner enamel exhibited a rise in the growth toughness from 1.13 MPam(0.5)/mm to 3.93 MPam(0.5)/mm. The maximum crack growth resistance at fracture (i.e. fracture toughness (K(c))) ranged from 1.79 to 2.37 MPam(0.5). Crack growth in the inner enamel was accompanied by a host of mechanisms operating from the micro- to the nano-scale. Decussation in the inner enamel promoted crack deflection and twist, resulting in a reduction of the local stress intensity at the crack tip. In addition, extrinsic mechanisms such as bridging by unbroken ligaments of the tissue and the organic matrix promoted crack closure. Microcracking due to loosening of prisms was also identified as an active source of energy dissipation. In summary, the unique microstructure of enamel in the decussated region promotes crack growth toughness that is approximately three times that of dentin and over ten times that of bone.",M2

We tested the hypothesis that this integrity is limited by fracture of the enamel. Experiments were conducted on molar teeth, with a metal rod loaded onto individual cusps.

Median <e>cracks</e> initiated from plastic damage at the contact site, at first growing slowly and then accelerating to the tooth margin. Margin cracks appeared to originate from the cemento-enamel junction, and traversed the tooth wall adjacent to the loaded cusp from the gingival to the occlusal surface.

At higher loads, additional crack modes--such as enamel chipping and delamination--began to manifest themselves, leading to more comprehensive failure of the tooth structure.",M2

In situ observations of cracks extending longitudinally upward from the cervical margins are recorded in real time with a video camera. The cracks appear above some threshold and grow steadily within the enamel coat toward the occlusal surface in a configuration reminiscent of channel-like cracks in brittle films. Substantially higher loading is required to delaminate the enamel from the dentin, attesting to the resilience of the tooth structure. A simplistic fracture mechanics analysis is applied to determine the critical load relation for traversal of the margin crack along the full length of the side wall. The capacity of any given tooth to resist failure by margin cracking is predicted to increase with greater enamel thickness and cuspal radius.

This in vitro study of CI and PCC tested the effects of different remaining cusp wall thicknesses on marginal integrity and enamel crack formation. CI (n = 25) and PCC (n = 26) preparations were performed in extracted human molars. Functional cusps of CI and PCC were adjusted to a 2.5 mm thickness; for PCC, the functional cusps were reduced to a thickness of 2.0 mm. Non-functional cusps were adjusted to wall thicknesses of 1) 1.0 mm and 2) 2.0 mm. Ceramic restorations (Vita Mark II, Cerec3 System) were fabricated and adhesively luted to the cavities with Excite/Variolink II. The specimens were exposed to thermocycling and central mechanical loading (TCML: 5000 x 5 degrees C-55 degrees C; 30 seconds/cycle; 500000 x 72.5N, 1.6Hz). Marginal integrity was assessed by evaluating a) dye penetration (fuchsin) on multiple sections after TCML and by using b) quantitative margin analysis in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after TCML. Ceramic- and tooth-luting agent interfaces (LA) were evaluated separately. Enamel cracks were documented under a reflective light microscope. The data were statistically analyzed with the Mann Whitney U-test (alpha = 0.05) and the Error Rates Method (ERM). Crack formation was analyzed with the Chi-Square-test (alpha = 0.05) and ERM. In general, the remaining cusp wall thickness, interface, cavity design and TCML had no statistically significant influence on marginal integrity for both CI and PCC (ERM). Single pairwise comparisons showed that the CI and PCC of Group 2 had a tendency towards less microleakage along the dentin/LA interface than Group 1. Cavity design and location had no statistically significant influence on crack formation, but the specimens with 1.0 mm of remaining wall thickness had statistically significantly more crack formation after TCML than the group with 2.0 mm of remaining cusp wall thickness for CI.

The data were statistically analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test, the Fishers exact test (alpha = 0.05) and the error rates method. PCC with horizontal reduction of non-functional cusps showed statistically significant less microleakage than PCC without such a cusp coverage. Preparation designs with horizontal reduction of non-functional cusps showed a tendency to less enamel crack formation than preparation designs without cusp coverage.

The present study evaluates fatigue crack growth in human enamel, and compares that to the fatigue response of sintered hydroxyapatite (HAp) with similar crystallinity, chemistry and density. Miniature inset compact tension (CT) specimens were prepared that embodied a small piece of enamel (N=8) or HAp (N=6). The specimens were subjected to mode I cyclic loads and the steady state crack growth responses were modeled using the Paris Law. Results showed that the fatigue crack growth exponent (m) for enamel (m=7.7+/-1.0) was similar to that for HAp (m=7.9+/-1.4), whereas the crack growth coefficient (C) for enamel (C=8.7 E-04 (mm/cycle)x(MPa m(0.5))(-m)) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.0001) than that for HAp (C=2.0 E+00 (mm/cycle)x(MPa m(0.5))(-m)). Micrographs of the fracture surfaces showed that crack growth in the enamel occurred primarily along the prism boundaries. In regions of decussation, the microstructure promoted microcracking, crack bridging, crack deflection and crack bifurcation. Working in concert, these mechanisms increased the crack growth resistance and resulted in a sensitivity to crack growth (m) similar to bone and lower than that of human dentin. These mechanisms of toughening were not observed in the crack growth response of the sintered HAp. While enamel is the most highly mineralized tissue of the human body, the microstructural arrangement of the prisms promotes exceptional resistance to crack growth.",M2

Controls received composite resin cores without fiber posts. The specimens were loaded to failure and fractographically examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that specimens with fiber posts demonstrated significantly higher failure loads and favorable fracture pattern compared to the controls. At fractographic analysis, specimens with fiber posts demonstrated delamination of the veneer ceramic from intact zirconia under structure. Meanwhile, the specimens that were restored without a fiber post demonstrated micro-cracking of the composite core build-up resulting in loss of the support under the zirconia crowns which was responsible for the initiation of radial <e>crack</e> and catastrophic damage. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation of this study, the insertion of fiber post improved the support under zirconia crowns which resulted in higher fracture loads and favorable failure type compared to composite core build-up.",M2
18164757,"The effect of aging on <e>crack</e>-growth resistance and toughening mechanisms in human dentin.Crack-growth experiments in human dentin have been performed in situ in an environmental scanning electron microscope to measure, for the first time, the crack-growth resistance curve (R-curve) for clinically relevant (&lt;250 microm) crack extensions and to simultaneously identify the salient toughening mechanisms.  Young  dentin from donors 19-30 years in age and  aged  dentin from donors 40-70 years in age were evaluated. The  young  group had 0-4% of its tubules filled with apatite; the  aged  group was subdivided into  opaque  with 12-32% filled tubules and  transparent  with 65-100% filled tubules. Although crack-initiation toughnesses were similar, the crack-growth resistance of  young  dentin was higher by about 40% compared to  aged  dentin. Mechanistically, this behavior is interpreted in terms of three phenomena: (i) gross crack deflection of the growing crack, (ii) microcracks which initiated at unfilled tubules in the high stress region in the vicinity of a propagating crack (no microcracks formed at filled tubules), and (iii) crack propagation which followed a local trajectory through unfilled tubules and deflected around filled tubules. The higher toughness of the  young  dentin was related to enhanced microcracking (at unfilled tubules) ahead of the growing crack, which (i) shields the crack by activating multiple crack tips and by reducing the local stress intensity through crack deflection and (ii) leads to the formation of crack bridges from  uncracked ligaments  due to the incomplete coalescence of these microcracks with the main crack tip. With age, the role of these toughening mechanisms was diminished primarily to the lower fraction of unfilled, and hence microcracked, tubules.",M2
18021825,"In vitro evaluation of fracture resistance and failure mode of internally restored endodontically treated maxillary incisors with differing heights of residual dentin.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Some of the associated effects of different restorative systems placed in endodontically treated teeth with varying heights of residual dentin have yet to be examined in a comprehensive manner. There is a need for additional information regarding fracture resistance and mode of failure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of 3 different restorative techniques with varying amounts of remaining dentin heights on the fracture resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three groups of 40 human maxillary incisors were subdivided into 4 subgroups (n=10) with respect to the uniform height of the residual coronal dentin, defined as 0-, 2-, 4-, or 5-mm from the cemento-enamel junction, and then restored internally using a composite resin (Z100 MP) (control group), a cobalt-chromium ceramic alloy custom-made cast post and core (IPS d.SIGN 30; CCPC group), or a carbon fiber post system (Tech Xop 2000; CFP group). All specimens were then restored with nonprecious cast crowns. Static loading tests were performed on each specimen until failure (<e>crack</e> without a complete fracture). The data were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected t test for independent samples (alpha=.05). Failure was classified as either favorable (allowing repair) or catastrophic (not allowing repair). RESULTS: The fracture resistance values (N) for the 0-, 2-, 4-, and 5-mm residual dentin heights were: 88, 143, 154, and 202 for the control group, 230, 264, 364, and 383 for the CCPC group, and 153, 235, 346, and 357 for the CFP group, respectively. Generally, all the differences tested were statistically significant. The failure mode was catastrophic for no control specimens, for 36 CCPC specimens, and for 4 CFP specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The highest and lowest fracture resistances were recorded for the CCPC and control groups, respectively, at each residual dentin height. An increased height of residual dentin generally provided greater fracture resistance. The fracture resistance of the CCPC group was, however, similar or only slightly higher than that of the CFP group when 2, 4, or 5 mm of residual dentin height was present. In contrast, the failure mode was favorable for almost all of the CFP and control groups, while it was catastrophic in most of the CCPC group.",M2
17853417,"An examination of fatigue striations in human dentin: in vitro and in vivo.Although striations are often used in evaluating fatigue <e>crack</e> growth in engineering materials, they have not been used in studying the mechanics of fracture in hard tissues. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the striations resulting from fatigue crack growth in the dentin of human teeth. Compact tension (CT) specimens obtained from the coronal dentin of molars from young (17 &lt; or = age &lt; or = 37 years) and senior (age &gt; or = 50 years) patients were subjected to cyclic Mode I loads. Striations evident on the fracture surfaces were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and contact profilometer. Fatigue crack growth striations that developed in vivo were also examined on fracture surfaces of restored molars. A power spectrum analysis of surface profiles from the CT specimens showed that the striation spacing ranged from 50 to 170 microm. The average spacing in the dentin of seniors (130 +/- 23 microm) was significantly larger (p &lt; 0.001) than that in young dentin (88 +/- 13 microm). Fatigue striations in the restored teeth exhibited features that were consistent with those that developed in vitro and a spacing ranging from 59 to 95 microm. Unlike metals, the striations in dentin developed after a period of cyclic loading that ranged from 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(5) cycles. A quantitative evaluation of the striation spacing using the Bates-Clark equation suggested that cyclic crack growth within the restored teeth occurred at a stress intensity range near 0.7 MPa x m(0.5), and a stress range of approximately 12 MPa.",M2
17696060,"Cracked and broken teeth--definitions, differential diagnosis and treatment.Cracked and broken teeth present a diagnostic dilemma to the dentist and the sooner a correct diagnosis is made the greater are the chances to save the tooth. As the location, direction and size of the <e>crack</e> or fracture dictates the choice of treatment, it is important to first define the types of cracks and fractures in the coronal and radicular tooth structure. Cracks and fractures can be classified as follows: 1. craze lines 2. fractured cusps 3. cracked teeth 4. split teeth 5. vertical root fractures. The vertical root fracture has been described recently in two articles in this publication, and therefore will not be discussed here. Diagnosis of a cracked tooth is not always initially obvious. The patient's response to clinical testing is the primary diagnostic tool along with the dental history provided by the patient. Radiographs are secondary in making a diagnosis. Clinical aids for reproducing the patient's symptoms such as occlusal bite devices, observing occlusal wear facets and the application of cold water to one tooth at a time may isolate the offending tooth. In situations where an irreversible pulpitis is diagnosed, endodontic treatment is indicated. In the case of a questionable diagnosis, or one in which a potential reversible pulpitis is made, a provisional restoration can be placed for an unspecified time as a diagnostic aid. If endodontic therapy were indicated, consultation with the patient as to the compromised prognosis and the alternatives to endodontic treatment is essential.",M2
17397327,"Cementum <e>crack</e> formation by repeated loading in vitro.BACKGROUND: In this study, the hypothesis was adopted that fatigue destruction may develop on the cementum of the root surface because of the repeated occlusal stresses loaded on the tooth as in the case of prolonged occlusal trauma. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether cemental fatigue destruction occurs when repeated stresses are loaded on the occlusal surface of a tooth. METHODS: The teeth used were five human mandible premolars from individuals 14 to 22 years of age. The teeth were freshly extracted in orthodontic treatment. They were free of decay and fillings, and their roots were straight. One half of the root was embedded in cold curing acrylic resin, and a compressive load of 5.0 kgf was repeatedly applied along the tooth axis in water 1 million times with a speed of one time per second. Changes in the tooth surface were observed by taking photographs with a stereoscopic microscope and a digital camera after every 100,000 loadings. Cracks were dyed with 2% methylene blue solution, and crack areas were measured using gray-scaled and binary-processed photographs. Data were analyzed using image analysis software. RESULTS: It was confirmed that cracks significantly developed on the buccal, mesial, and distal surfaces but not on the lingual surface; crack areas showed a tendency to significantly increase after 500,000 loadings; extension of the crack from the cemento-enamel junction to the root apex increased with time, and the average extension was 0.67 +/- 0.12 mm after 1 million loadings. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that cementum cracks developed in the cervix by repeated loadings and extended toward the root apex with time, suggesting that repeated stresses by occlusion or strong stresses such as by bruxism may trigger the development of site-specific attachment loss, which is one of the potential factors inducing periodontal diseases.",M2
17200814,"Bioinspired design of dental multilayers.This paper considers the use of bioinspired functionally graded structures in the design of dental multi-layers that are more resistant to sub-surface <e>crack</e> nucleation. Unlike existing dental crown restorations that give rise to high stress concentration, the functionally graded layers (between crown materials and the joins that attach them to dentin) are shown to promote significant reductions in stress and improvements in the critical crack size. Special inspiration is drawn from the low stress concentrations associated with the graded distributions in the dentin-enamel-junction (DEJ). The implications of such functionally graded structures are also discussed for the design of dental restorations.",M2
16767736,"Effect of cyclic loading and environmental aging on the fracture toughness of dental resin composite.OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was (1) to investigate the effects of cyclic loading and environmental aging on three dental resin composites with different filler compositions: a fiber filler, a hybrid filler, and a microfill; and (2) to predict fracture in dental resin composite under mixed-mode loading conditions. METHODS: Diametral disk specimens 25 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were used in this study. Two methods were used for generating initial <e>cracks</e> in the specimen. The first method involved machining a 3-mm notch in the center of the disk specimens, and then the notch tips were sharpened with a 0.2-mm-diameter jeweler's saw blade. In the second method for obtaining sharper crack tips, a three-way wedge was forced into a 3.175-mm hole drilled in the center of the specimen, resulting in sharp cracks emanating from the notch tips. CYCLIC TESTS: The specimens were aged for 4 months in air, water, artificial saliva, and a 50/50 (by volume) mixture of ethanol and water at room temperature in sealed polyethylene containers. Both unaged and aged specimens (5 specimens for each variable) were subjected to cyclic loading at a frequency of 5 Hz with sinusoidal loads cycling for 1, 1000, and 100,000 cycles at a load level approximately 60% of the fracture load for noncycled specimens. Following load cycling, the specimens were tested in compression in a displacement-controlled loading mode at a loading rate of 1.27 mm/min. RESULTS: Test results show that aging in a 50/50 alcohol-water mixture lowered the fracture toughness of dental resin composite, which was further reduced by cyclic loading. MIXED-MODE TESTS: The maximum tensile stress (MTS) criterion was used to predict fracture in dental resin composite under mixed-mode loading conditions. The loads at failure were used as input into a finite element model. After obtaining the stress field in the specimens by the finite element method, the mixed-mode stress intensity factors were calculated using an interaction energy integral method. RESULTS: Good agreement was obtained between the fracture envelope predicted by the MTS criterion and the experimental fracture toughness data. Hence, it can be concluded that it is only necessary to characterize the mode I fracture toughness to fully characterize the mixed-mode behavior of the dental resin composites that were considered in the present study.",M2
16701778,"Effects of polar solvents on the fracture resistance of dentin: role of water hydration.Although healthy dentin is invariably hydrated in vivo, from a perspective of examining the mechanisms of fracture in dentin, it is interesting to consider the role of water hydration. Furthermore, it is feasible that exposure to certain polar solvents, e.g., those found in clinical adhesives, can induce dehydration. In the present study, in vitro deformation and fracture experiments, the latter involving a resistance-curve (R-curve) approach (i.e., toughness evolution with <e>crack</e> extension), were conducted in order to assess changes in the constitutive and fracture behavior induced by three common solvents-acetone, ethanol and methanol. In addition, nanoindentation-based experiments were performed to evaluate the deformation behavior at the level of individual collagen fibers and ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to evaluate changes in bonding. The results indicate a reversible effect of chemical dehydration, with increased fracture resistance, strength, and stiffness associated with lower hydrogen bonding ability of the solvent. These results are analyzed both in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic toughening phenomena to further understand the micromechanisms of fracture in dentin and the specific role of water hydration.",M2
16674739,"A finite element analysis of ferrule design on restoration resistance and distribution of stress within a root.AIM: To analyse the effect of ferrule height upon the mechanical resistance and stress distribution within a root to explain variations in the pattern of root fracture. METHODOLOGY: An extracted, intact, caries free, maxillary right central incisor was scanned by laser and then reconstructed on a computer to produce a model of the tooth and associated periodontal ligament. A simulated post/core/crown restoration was constructed on conventional tooth preparations with various ferrules. The crown was loaded with a simulated 500 N force and the simulated displacement of components and the tensile and compressive stress within the tooth structure were recorded. RESULTS: Without a ferrule preparation, the simulated crown tilted to the labial and rotated distally. With increasing ferrule height the displacement and rotation of the crown reduced in conventional and crown-lengthening models with maximum reduction occurring when the ferrule height reached 1.5 mm. In ferrule models, higher levels of tensile stress developed in internal (by a factor of 8) and mid-root palatal (by a factor of 90) dentine at the cervical margin of the preparation. With an increase in ferrule height, the area of tensile stress within the palatal mid-dentine expanded towards the cervical margin. Similar patterns and stress values were recorded for the crown-lengthening models. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that a ferrule increases the mechanical resistance of a post/core/crown restoration. However a ferrule creates a larger area of palatal dentine under tensile stress that may be a favourable condition for a <e>crack</e> to develop. Crown-lengthening did not alter the levels or pattern of stress within compared with conventional ferrule preparations.",M2
16343118,"Three-dimensional, non-destructive visualization of vertical root fractures using flat panel volume detector computer tomography: an ex vivo in vitro case report.AIM: To detect and to visualize radiographically vertical root fractures in extracted teeth with a prototype of a novel, high resolution, three-dimensional flat panel volume detector computer tomograph (FD-VCT) system. SUMMARY: Five teeth with root fillings and clinical symptoms such as fistulas and isolated periodontal pockets of 8 mm or more were extracted after dental radiography indicating lateral or periapical lesions. Vertical root fractures or <e>cracks</e> were suspected because of the symptoms and clinical findings were evident after extraction in all cases but fracture lines were not visible on routine dental radiographs acquired before extraction. The extracted teeth were explored with a prototype of a FD-VCT. Using the FD-VCT, in all cases vertical root fractures or crack lines could be detected clearly in different views, depiction-modes and cross-sections at a spatial resolution of 140 microm. The evaluation of the fracture lines and teeth could be performed in three-dimensional views. The FD-VCT findings were confirmed by detailed inspection of the extracted teeth. KEY LEARNING POINTS: The FD-VCT is an innovative diagnostic tool for non-destructive, three-dimensional evaluation of extracted teeth in pre-clinical and experimental studies. The FD-VCT allows precise visualization and evaluation of vertical root fractures or cracks in extracted teeth. Clinical application of the system may be possible if technical modifications reduce the exposure dose: the high resolution detector systems of the FD-VCT should be combined with radiation systems that focus the radiation to the area of interest.",M2
16338002,"Age, dehydration and fatigue <e>crack</e> growth in dentin.A preliminary study of the effects from age and dehydration on fatigue crack growth in human dentin was conducted. Compact tension (CT) fatigue specimens of coronal dentin were prepared from extracted molars and subjected to high cycle fatigue (10(5)&lt;N&lt;10(6)) under Mode I loading. Young hydrated dentin (mean age=25+/-7 years), old hydrated dentin (mean age=55+/-14 years) and young dehydrated dentin (mean age=20+/-2 years) were examined. Fatigue crack growth rates were quantified according to the Paris Law in terms of the crack growth exponent (m) and coefficient (C). The average fatigue crack growth exponent for the young hydrated dentin (m=13.3+/-1.1) was significantly less than that for the hydrated old (m=21.6+/-5.2; p&lt;0.003) and dehydrated young dentin (m=18.8+/-2.8; p&lt;0.01). Fatigue cracks in the old dentin underwent initiation at a lower stress intensity range than in young dentin and propagated at as significantly faster rate (over 100x). Differences in the microscopic features of the fracture surfaces from the old and young dentin suggested that particular mechanisms contributing to energy dissipation and crack growth resistance in the young hydrated dentin were not present in the old dentin. Based on results of this study, the fatigue crack growth resistance of human dentin decreases with both age of the tissue and dehydration.",M2
15744763,"Stress ratio contributes to fatigue <e>crack</e> growth in dentin.An experimental study of fatigue crack growth in dentin was conducted, and the influence of stress ratio (R) on the crack growth rate and mechanisms of cyclic extension were examined. Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) fatigue specimens were sectioned from bovine molars and then subjected to high cycle fatigue loading (10(5) &lt; N &lt; 10(6)) under hydrated conditions. The evaluation consisted of Mode I loads with stress ratios that ranged from -0.5 to 0.5. The fatigue crack growth rates were measured and used to estimate the crack growth exponent (m) and coefficient (C) according to the Paris Law model. The fatigue crack growth rates for steady-state extension (Region II) ranged from 1E-7 to 1E-4 mm/cycle. It was found that the rate of cyclic extension increased significantly with increasing R, and that the highest average crack growth rate occurred at a stress ratio of 0.5. However, the crack growth exponent decreased with increasing R from an average of 4.6 (R = 0.10) to 2.7 (R = 0.50). The stress intensity threshold for crack growth decreased with increasing R as well. Results from this study suggest that an increase in the cyclic stress ratio facilitates fatigue crack growth in dentin and increases the rate of cyclic extension, both of which are critical concerns in minimizing tooth fractures and maintaining lifelong oral health.",M2
15711554,"The dentin-enamel junction and the fracture of human teeth.The dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), which is the interfacial region between the dentin and outer enamel coating in teeth, is known for its unique biomechanical properties that provide a <e>crack</e>-arrest barrier for flaws formed in the brittle enamel1. In this work, we re-examine how cracks propagate in the proximity of the DEJ, and specifically quantify, using interfacial fracture mechanics, the fracture toughness of the DEJ region. Careful observation of crack penetration through the interface and the new estimate of the DEJ toughness ( approximately 5 to 10 times higher than enamel but approximately 75% lower than dentin) shed new light on the mechanism of crack arrest. We conclude that the critical role of this region, in preventing cracks formed in enamel from traversing the interface and causing catastrophic tooth fractures, is not associated with the crack-arrest capabilities of the interface itself; rather, cracks tend to penetrate the (optical) DEJ and arrest when they enter the tougher mantle dentin adjacent to the interface due to the development of crack-tip shielding from uncracked-ligament bridging.",M2
15656433,"Dentinal <e>crack</e> incidence following ultrasonic vibration to intra-radicular posts.OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of dentinal cracks on the root-face of extracted teeth containing intra-radicular posts subjected to prolonged ultrasonic vibration. Design &amp; Setting This in-vitro experiment, conducted at the University of Manchester, UK, used post type and ultrasonic vibration as dependent variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty canine teeth were decoronated and root-filled with gutta-percha and sealer. A parallel shaped post-space of 1.4 mm diameter and 10 mm depth was prepared in each root. The teeth were grouped into morphologically similar pairs, and for each pair one tooth was randomly allocated to receive a zirconium ceramic post, the other a stainless steel post. The pairs of teeth were randomly assigned to a control or to a test group. The root-face was examined for dentine cracks or fractures with direct vision and at 20x magnification with transillumination. Samples were then stored in sterile water for one week. Ultrasonic vibration was applied continuously for 30 minutes to the top of the posts in the test groups. All samples were then re-examined for dentine cracks or fractures. RESULTS: Following storage, no new cracks were evident for the control groups. Seven new cracks occurred in the test groups (following application of ultrasonic vibration), six of which were on the root-face of samples with ceramic posts. The difference in crack distribution between the two groups was significant (Fisher's Exact Test, p=0.029). CONCLUSION: Prolonged application of ultrasonic vibration to ceramic posts increased the incidence of root-face cracks.",M2
15465307,"Effect of defect size on fracture strength of dental low fusion porcelain.Various grinding defects were produced on the surface of specimen dental low fusion porcelain in an attempt to establish the relationship between defect size and fracture strength. In addition, the applicability of the process zone size-fracture criterion in assessing the material properties of dental low fusion porcelain was examined. Super porcelain AAA E3 (Noritake Co., Japan) was used as dental low fusion porcelain. The bending strength and fracture toughness value were estimated by the three-point bending test. After glazing, grinding flaws were introduced by grinding the specimen with abrasive papers of various mesh sizes. In order to calculate the fracture toughness value of dental low fusion porcelain, we introduced a surface <e>crack</e> using a Vickers indenter. The results were discussed based on the process zone size-fracture criterion. The size of cracks caused by grinding was estimated with the process zone size-fracture criterion and Newman-Raju formula. As the defect size decreased, the fracture stress approached the strength for smooth specimen without defect. The K(c) value showed a tendency to approach the K(lc) value when the defect size increased. The relationship between the fracture stress, sigma(F), and the equivalent crack length, a(e), was in good agreement with the theoretical relations deduced from the criterion in dental low fusion porcelain.",M2
15451639,"Mechanistic aspects of in vitro fatigue-<e>crack</e> growth in dentin.Although the propagation of fatigue cracks has been recognized as a problem of clinical significance in dentin, there have been few fracture mechanics-based studies that have investigated this issue. In the present study, in vitro cyclic fatigue experiments were conducted over a range of cyclic frequencies (1-50 Hz) on elephant dentin in order to quantify fatigue-crack growth behavior from the perspective of understanding the mechanism of fatigue in dentin. Specifically, results obtained for crack extension rates along a direction parallel to the dentinal tubules were found to be well described by the stress-intensity range, DeltaK, using a simple Paris power-law approach with exponents ranging from 12 to 32. Furthermore, a frequency dependence was observed for the crack-growth rates, with higher growth rates associated with lower frequencies. By using crack-growth experiments involving alternate cyclic and static loading, such fatigue-crack propagation was mechanistically determined to be the result of a  true  cyclic fatigue mechanism, and not simply a succession of static fracture events. Furthermore, based on the observed frequency dependence of fatigue-crack growth in dentin and observations of time-dependent crack blunting, a cyclic fatigue mechanism involving crack-tip blunting and re-sharpening is proposed. These results are deemed to be of importance for an improved understanding of fatigue-related failures in teeth.",M2
15368241,"Fatigue and damage tolerance of Y-TZP ceramics in layered biomechanical systems.The fatigue properties of fine-grain Y-TZP in cyclic flexural testing are studied. Comparative tests on a coarser-grain alumina provide a baseline control. A bilayer configuration with ceramic plates bonded to a compliant polymeric substrate and loaded with concentrated forces at the top surfaces, simulating basic layer structures in dental crowns and hip replacement prostheses, is used as a basic test specimen. Critical times to initiate radial <e>crack</e> failure at the ceramic undersurfaces at prescribed maximum surface loads are measured for Y-TZP with as-polished surfaces, mechanically predamaged undersurfaces, and after a thermal aging treatment. No differences in critical failure conditions are observed between monotonic and cyclic loading on as-polished surfaces, or between as-polished and mechanically damaged surfaces in monotonic loading, consistent with fatigue controlled by slow crack growth. However, the data for mechanically damaged and aged specimens show substantial declines in sustainable stresses and times to failure in cyclic loading, indicating an augmenting role of mechanical and thermal processes in certain instances. In all cases, however, the sustainable stresses in the Y-TZP remain higher than that of the alumina, suggesting that with proper measures to avoid inherent structural instabilities, Y-TZP could provide superior performance in biomechanical applications.",M2
15196977,"Enamel microstructure and microstrain in the fracture of human and pig molar cusps.The role of microstructure in enamel strain and breakage was investigated in human molar cusps and those of the pig, Sus scrofa. Rosette strain gauges were affixed to cusp surfaces (buccal human M3, n=15, and lingual pig M1, n=13), and a compressive load was applied to individual cusps using an MTS materials testing machine. Load and strain data were recorded simultaneously until cusp fracture, and these data were used to estimate enamel stresses, principal strains, and stiffness. Fractured and polished enamel fragments were examined in multiple planes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Human cusp enamel showed greater stiffness than pig enamel (P=0.02), and tensile stress at yield was higher (17.9 N/mm2 in humans versus 8.9 N/mm2 in pigs, P=0.06). SEM revealed enamel rod decussation in both human and pig enamel; however, only pig enamel showed a decussation plane between rod and inter-rod crystallites. Human inter-rod enamel was densely packed between rods, whereas in pig enamel, inter-rod enamel formed partitions between rows of enamel rods. Overall, human enamel structure enabled molar cusps to withstand horizontal tensile stress during both elastic and plastic phases of compressive loading. In contrast, pig cusp enamel was less resistant to horizontal tensile stresses, but appeared to fortify the enamel against <e>crack</e> propagation in multiple directions. These structural and biomechanical differences in cusp enamel are likely to reflect species-level differences in occlusal function.",M2
14666738,"Effects of Crest Whitestrips bleaching on surface morphology and fracture susceptibility of teeth in vitro.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of peroxide tooth bleaching, including Crest Whitestrips hydrogen peroxide treatments, on the fracture susceptibility and surface morphology of human tooth enamel in vitro. METHODOLOGY: Extracted human molars were ground and polished to prepare a uniform substrate for bleaching treatments. A cycling treatment methodology was employed which alternated ex vivo human salivary exposures with bleaching treatments under conditions of controlled temperature and durations of treatment. Bleaching treatments included commercial Crest Whitestrips bleaching gels, which utilize hydrogen peroxide as the in situ bleaching source, and several commercial carbamide peroxide bleaching gels. Control treatments included placebo gels and an untreated group. Crest Whitestrips bleaching included treatment exposures simulating recommended clinical exposures (14 hours of bleaching), along with excess bleaching simulating exposure to five times the suggested Crest Whitestrips use. At the conclusion of treatments, surface color measurements were taken to ensure tooth bleaching. Surface microhardness measures and surface morphological assessments with SEM were conducted to assess the effects of bleaching exposure on the surface morphology and mineral integrity of the teeth. These latter measures were then complemented with assessments of fracture susceptibility utilizing detailed analyses of <e>crack</e> propagation resulting from post-treatment microhardness indentations. RESULTS: Surface microhardness and SEM measures revealed no deleterious effects on the enamel surfaces from any of the bleaching products assessed. This included conditions of excess bleaching exposure or  overbleaching.  The analysis of fracture susceptibility similarly revealed no significant effects from tooth bleaching, regardless of the peroxide source. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that tooth bleaching from the selected commercial hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide bleaching systems do not produce changes in surface morphology, microhardness or fracture susceptibility of human tooth enamel under in vitro cycling conditions of treatment matching clinical bleaching exposures. These results support the clinical safety of the selected commercial bleaching systems to vital dentition, matching results obtained from the long-term use of these ingredients applied in dental offices and available in commercial formulations.",M2
14568438,"<e>Crack</e> blunting, crack bridging and resistance-curve fracture mechanics in dentin: effect of hydration.Few studies have focused on a description of the fracture toughness properties of dentin in terms of resistance-curve (R-curve) behavior, i.e., fracture resistance increasing with crack extension, particularly in light of the relevant toughening mechanisms involved. Accordingly, in the present study, fracture mechanics based experiments were conducted on elephant dentin in order to determine such R-curves, to identify the salient toughening mechanisms and to discern how hydration may affect their potency. Crack bridging by uncracked ligaments, observed directly by microscopy and X-ray tomography, was identified as a major toughening mechanism, with further experimental evidence provided by compliance-based experiments. In addition, with hydration, dentin was observed to display significant crack blunting leading to a higher overall fracture resistance than in the dehydrated material. The results of this work are deemed to be of importance from the perspective of modeling the fracture behavior of dentin and in predicting its failure in vivo.",M2

Fifty human maxillary central incisors were decoronated, and the root canals were instrumented to ISO size 50 at the working length. The apical 3 mm of the roots were resected, and cracks were artificially created in the apical dentin with an average load of 5.6 kg using a cylindrical wedge in a miniature drill press. A video microscope at x65 magnification was used to observe the cracks as they developed. Four independent examiners evaluated the root specimens using unaided/corrected vision (group 1), loupes at x3.3 magnification (group 2), a surgical operating microscope at x10 magnification (group 3), and the Orascope at x35 magnification (group 4). The examiners' proficiency at correctly identifying root ends with and without cracks was evaluated. The data were compared to the predetermined standard (27 cracked, 23 not cracked) with a one-tailed Fisher's exact test (alpha = 0.05). Statistically, the Orascope (p = 0.02) was significantly superior, whereas using unaided/corrected vision (p = 0.99), loupes (p = 0.88), or the microscope (p = 0.14) was not significantly better than guessing. The accuracy of correct identification for unaided/ corrected vision, loupes, the microscope, and the Orascope was 39%, 45%, 53%, and 58%, respectively. A two-way analysis of variance of the accuracy of crack identification showed a significant difference among the four visualization techniques (p = 0.0007) and also among the four evaluators (p = 0.006).",M2

The results of this study showed that the fracture toughness of the enamel-DEJ-dentin complex was 1.50 +/- 0.28 Mpa x m(1/2). Based on the results of this investigation, it was concluded that the DEJ complex played a critical role in resisting crack propagation from enamel into dentin. The DEJ complex is, approximately, a 100 to 150 microm broad region at the interface between enamel and dentin. The toughening mechanism of the DEJ complex may be explained by the fact that crack paths were deflected as cracks propagated across it. Understanding the mechanism of crack deflection could help in improving dentin-composite as well as ceramic-cement interfacial qualities with the aim to decrease the risk of clinical failure of restorations. Both can be viewed as being composed from a layer of material of high strength and hardness bonded to a softer but tougher substratum (dentin). The bonding agent or the luting cement layer may play the critical role of the DEJ in improving the strength of these restorations in clinical situations.",M2
12749916,"The microhardness and fracture surface of the petrodentine of Lepidosiren (Dipnoi), and of other mineralised tissues.The South American lungfish Lepidosiren has toothplates bearing an extremely hard version of dentine: petrodentine. The hardness of this tissue, and its associated ordinary dentine, was compared with that of the enamel, dentine and cement of mammalian teeth, and also with that of other mammalian bony tissues. The hardnesses of petrodentine and dentine of Lepidosiren were found to be similar to those of enamel and dentine in other, mammalian, teeth. Furthermore, the anatomical arrangement of the Lepidosiren tissues was similar to that found in the incisors of rodents, and they presumably function in the same way to keep a sharp chisel edge at the tip of the tooth. Comparison of fracture surfaces of Lepidosiren petrodentine and that of rat incisor showed, however, that petrodentine does not have the refined, <e>crack</e>-stopping structure found in rat incisor enamel.",M2
12547360,"Fracture-toughening mechanisms responsible for differences in work to fracture of hydrated and dehydrated dentine.This study investigates the nature of deformation and differences in the mechanisms of fracture and properties of dentine where there has been a loss of moisture, as may occur with removal of the pulp in the endodontic treatment of teeth. Controlled fracture toughness testing was conducted on bovine teeth to determine the influence of hydration on the work of fracture of dentine. Significant differences (p&lt;0.01) were observed between the fracture toughness of hydrated (554+/-27.7J/m2) and dehydrated (113+/-17.8J/m2) dentine. Observations of the <e>crack</e> tip region during crack extension revealed extensive ligament formation occurred behind the crack tip. These ligaments provide considerable stability to the crack by significantly increasing the work of fracture, thereby acting as a fracture-toughening mechanism. Micro-cracking, reported as a fracture-toughening mechanism in bone, is also clearly seen. A zone of in-elastic deformation may occur as hydrated specimens revealed upon crack extension, a region about the tip that appeared to suck water into the structure and to exude water behind the crack tip. In dehydrated dentine, no in-elastic zone was observed. Micro-cracking is present though the cracks are smaller, straighter and with less opening than hydrated dentine. Only limited ligament formation just behind the crack tip was observed. These differences resulted in a significantly lower work of fracture with unstable brittle fracture characteristics. Based on these results, several fracture-toughening mechanisms were identified in dentine, with micro-cracking not considered the most important. These findings may be relevant for bone, a similar mineralised hydrated tissue.",M2

Cements tested included a conventional glass-ionomer, F (Fuji 1), a resin-modified glass-ionomer, FP (Fuji Plus) and a compomer cement, D (DyractCem). Ten miniature short-bar chevron notch specimens were manufactured for each cement, each comprising a 40 microm thick chevron of lute, between two 1.5 mm thick blocks of bovine dentine, encased in resin composite. The interfacial K(IC) results (MN/m3/2) were median (range): F; 0.152 (0.14-0.16), FP; 0.306 (0.27-0.37), D; 0.351 (0.31-0.37). Non-parametric statistical analysis showed that the fracture toughness of F was significantly lower (p &lt;0.05) than those of FP or D, and all were significantly lower than values for monolithic cement specimens. Scanning electron microscopy of the specimens suggested <e>crack</e> propagation along the interface. However, energy dispersive X-ray analysis indicated that failure was cohesive within the cement.

11214760,"Treatment of tooth fracture by medium-energy CO2 laser and DP-bioactive glass paste: the interaction of enamel and DP-bioactive glass paste during irradiation by CO2 laser.Acute trauma or trauma associated with occlusal disturbance can produce tooth <e>crack</e> or fracture. Although several methods are proposed to treat the defect, however, the prognosis is generally poor. If the fusion of a tooth fracture by laser is possible, it will offer an alternative to extraction or at least serve as an adjunctive treatment in the reconstruction. We have tried to use a continuous-wave CO2 laser and a newly developed DP-bioactive glass paste (DPGP) to fuse or bridge tooth crack or fracture lines. Both the DP-bioactive glass paste and tooth enamel have strong absorption bands at the wavelength of 10.6 microm. Therefore, under CO2 laser, DPGP and enamel should have an effective absorption and melt together. The interface between DPGP and enamel could be regarded as a mixture of DPGP and enamel (DPG-E). The study focused on the phase transformation, microstructure, functional group and thermal behavior of DPG-E with or without CO2 laser irradiation, by the analytical techniques of XRD, FTIR, DTA/TGA, and SEM. The results of XRD showed that the main crystal phase in the DPG-E was dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4.2H2O). It changed into CaHPO4, gamma-Ca2P2O7, beta-Ca2P2O7 and finally alpha-Ca2P2O7 with increasing temperature. In the FTIR analysis, the 720 cm(-1) absorption band ascribed to the P-O-P linkage in pyrophosphate rose up and the intensities of the OH- bands reduced after laser irradiation. In regard to the results of DTA/TGA after irradiation, the weight loss decreased due to the removal of part of absorption water and crystallization water by the CO2 laser. SEM micrographs revealed that the melted masses and the plate-like crystals formed a tight chemical bond between the enamel and DPGP. We expect that DPGP with the help of CO2 laser can be an alternative to the treatment of tooth crack or fracture.",M2

In the study, we successfully developed a DP-bioactive glass paste which could form a melting glass within minutes after exposed to a medium energy density continuous-wave CO2 laser.

11077406,"Mechanical properties of the dentinoenamel junction: AFM studies of nanohardness, elastic modulus, and fracture.The dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) is a complex and poorly defined structure that unites the brittle overlying enamel with the dentin that forms the bulk of the tooth. In addition, this structure appears to confer excellent toughness and <e>crack</e> deflecting properties to the tooth, and has drawn considerable interest as a biomimetic model of a structure uniting dissimilar materials. This work sought to characterize the nanomechanical properties in the region of the DEJ using modified AFM based nanoindentation to determine nanohardness and elastic modulus. Lines of indentations traversing the DEJ were made at 1-2 microm intervals from the dentin to enamel along three directions on polished sagittal sections from three third molars. Nanohardness and elastic modulus rose steadily across the DEJ from bulk dentin to enamel. DEJ width was estimated by local polynomial regression fits for each sample and location of the mechanical property curves for the data gradient from enamel to dentin, and gave a mean value of 11.8 microm, which did not vary significantly with intratooth location or among teeth. Nanoindentation was also used to initiate cracks in the DEJ region. In agreement with prior work, it was difficult to initiate cracks that traversed the DEJ, or to produce cracks in the dentin. The fracture toughness values for enamel of 0.6-0.9 MPa . m(1/2) were in good agreement with recent microindentation fracture results. Our results suggest that the DEJ displays a gradient in structure and that nanoindenation methods show promise for further understanding its structure and function.",M2

However, several reports claimed that there was an increasing incidence of <e>crack</e> formation after ultrasonic root-end preparation. As yet, little work has focused on the root deformation during root-end preparation. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to measure the amount of root deformation during root-end preparation with the use of microhandpiece and ultrasonic systems by using strain gauge methods, and simultaneously to detect any cracks with the aid of the stereomicroscope, stain, and an image processing system. The results demonstrated the ultrasonic instrumentation produced significantly greater strain on average than that generated with the microhandpiece system. From the viewpoint of fracture, any technique that could diminish the strain on the root would decrease the likelihood of fracture; however, no crack was observed on any resected surface of roots in this study.",M2

9496920,"Indentation damage and mechanical properties of human enamel and dentin.Understanding the mechanical properties of human teeth is important to clinical tooth preparation and to the development of  tooth-like  restorative materials. Previous studies have focused on the macroscopic fracture behavior of enamel and dentin. In the present study, we performed indentation studies to understand the microfracture and deformation and the microcrack-microstructure interactions of teeth. It was hypothesized that <e>crack</e> propagation would be influenced by enamel rods and the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ), and the mechanical properties would be influenced by enamel rod orientation and tooth-to-tooth variation. Twenty-eight human third molars were used for the measurement of hardness, fracture toughness, elastic modulus, and energy absorbed during indentation. We examined the effect of enamel rod orientation by propagating cracks in the occlusal surface, and in the axial section in directions parallel and perpendicular to the occlusal surface. The results showed that the cracks in the enamel axial section were significantly longer in the direction perpendicular to the occlusal surface than parallel. The cracks propagating toward the DEJ were always arrested and unable to penetrate dentin. The fracture toughness of enamel was not single-valued but varied by a factor of three as a function of enamel rod orientation. The elastic modulus of enamel showed a significant difference between the occlusal surface and the axial section. It is concluded that the cracks strongly interact with the DEJ and the enamel rods, and that the mechanical properties of teeth are functions of microstructural orientations; hence, single values of properties (e.g., a single toughness value or a single modulus value) should not be used without information on microstructural orientation.",M2
8783534,"An in vitro investigation of cast post and partial core design.OBJECTIVES: Following endodontic therapy, the provision of a cast post and core restoration may be indicated. Many authors advocate retaining sound coronal dentine where possible, improving the resistance to fracture of the endodontically treated tooth. However, there is little conclusive experimental evidence to support this recommendation. This laboratory study was designed to investigate the effect of retained sound coronal dentine on the strength of a tooth restored with a cemented post and partial core restoration under direct loading. METHODS: Specimens with retained coronal dentine buccally, lingually, or buccally and lingually were restored with cast post and partial cores and tested to failure using an Instron Universal Testing Machine, Model 1195. Control post and full core restorations were also tested. The mode of failure for all specimens was recorded photographically. RESULTS: Teeth with retained buccal coronal dentine and post and partial cores were significantly less resistant to failure than controls with post and full cores (P &lt; 0.01), failure occurring through <e>crack</e> initiation and propagation at the junction of the cast partial core and dentine core. There was no statistically significant difference in the strength of teeth with retained lingual coronal dentine or buccal and lingual dentine when compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this in vitro model demonstrates that retained coronal dentine will not strengthen a tooth restored with a cast post and partial core. The clinical benefit of retaining buccal coronal dentine is brought into question when set against the increased technical effort and difficulty of producing the restoration in the dental technical laboratory and the possible overriding benefit of ferruling the crown margin onto a sound root structure.",M2

8006234,"Structure-property relations and <e>crack</e> resistance at the bovine dentin-enamel junction.The present report is a study of the fracture behavior of the dentin-enamel complex, involving enamel, dentin, and the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), that combines experimental design, computational finite element analysis, and fractography. Seven chevron-notched short-bar bovine DEJ specimens were utilized in this study. The general plane of the DEJ was approximately perpendicular to the fracture plane. All specimens were stored at 37 degrees C and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to being tested. A fracture test set-up was designed for application of tensile load on the DEJ specimens to initiate a crack at the vertex of the chevron in the enamel, across the DEJ zone and into the bulk dentin. During fracture testing, a water chamber was used to avoid dehydration of the specimen. The results showed that the lower boundary value of the fracture toughness of the DEJ perpendicular to its own plane was 3.38 +/- 0.40 MN/m1.5 and 988.42 +/- 231.39 J/m2, in terms of KIC and GKC, respectively. In addition, there was an extensive plastic deformation (83 +/- 12%) collateral to the fracture process at the DEJ zone. The fractography revealed that the deviation of the crak path involved an area which was approximately 50-100 microns deep. The parallel-oriented coarse collagen bundles with diameters of 1-5 microns at the DEJ zone may play a significant role in resisting the enamel crack. This reflects the fact, that in the intact tooth, the multiple full thickness cracks commonly found in enamel do not typically cause total failure of the tooth by crack extension into the dentin.",M2

1521693,"A simple model of <e>crack</e> propagation in dental restorations.Although natural teeth often exhibit microcracks, they rarely demonstrate bulk fracture. However, conventional full-crown restorations periodically exhibit failure due to fracture. Presented here is evaluation of a simple model of crack propagation that estimates crack growth during cyclic loading. A finite element model of a premolar tooth provides the tensile stresses adjacent to cusp loading. If the crack propagation rates for natural teeth, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and composite crowns are compared with the wear rates of their respective materials as determined in an artificial mouth, it is evident that the low wear rate of composites may predispose them to fracture. Natural teeth disperse occlusal stresses throughout the dentin so that the effect of high occlusal stress is minimized. Porcelain tends to wear the opposing dentition, which reduces areas of high occlusal stress. Composite, however, demonstrates crack propagation rates higher than those of either natural teeth or porcelain. This, in addition to its low wear rate, might predispose the material to fracture. This model should be used only as a qualitative indicator of fracture tendency. The high calculated crack propagation rates in composites may explain the observed clinical failures and microchipping at the area of occlusal contact, as noted in SEM analysis.",M2

Real-time confocal scanning optical microscopy, with a tandem-scanning reflected-light microscope, is suitable for making high-resolution images of enamel prisms in intact teeth under near-normal conditions. Blocks of enamel were held on a micro-positioning stage and advanced toward the tip of a diamond knife. The orientation of the samples was varied to simulate common clinical cutting conditions. Oil immersion objectives were used with the knife rigidly mounted in a specially made carrier. This was attached to the objective below its end-lens. The images were recorded with a sensitive video camera and cassette recorder for analysis of the cutting interactions at a slow playback speed. The presence of decussating enamel prisms was particularly effective at slowing <e>crack</e> propagation when loading was applied in an appropriate direction. Residual subsurface cracking was seen when the blade had finished cutting. This was most pronounced in regions where the enamel prisms were cut transverse to their long axis; this was equivalent to the preparation of the cervical margin of an approximately cavity.
