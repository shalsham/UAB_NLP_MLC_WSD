20176786,"Bioluminescent approaches for measuring tumor growth in a mouse model of <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.Neurofibomatosis (NF1) patients are susceptible to multiple tumors of the nervous system including neurofibromas, optic glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and astrocytoma. The Nf1+/-;Trp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model of NF1 spontaneously develops astrocytoma and MPNSTs that are very similar to human NF1 tumors. To use this model for testing potential therapeutics, we have developed systems that take advantage of bioluminescent reporters of tumor growth. We have generated E2F1 promoter-driving luciferase (ELUX) reporter mice to detect proliferating tumors in NPcis mice in vivo using bioluminescence. The power of this system is that it enables looking at tumor evolution and detecting spontaneous tumors at early stages of development as they evolve within their natural haploinsufficient microenvironment. This system can be used to identify tumors at different stages of tumorigenesis and to examine where spontaneous NF1 tumors initiate. The ability to rapidly screen multiple animals at a time increases the potential for use of this model in preclinical trials. This model will be valuable for the characterization of spontaneous NF1 tumors and will be important for studying the treatment and prevention of NF1 tumors in vivo.",M1

We report a rare case of oncogenic osteomalacia with generalized neurofibromatosis which presented to us as pathological fracture.",M1
20029240,"Genetic and pathogenetic aspects of Noonan syndrome and related disorders.Noonan syndrome (NS) and the clinically overlapping disorders cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome and <e>Neurofibromatosis</e>-Noonan syndrome share the clinical features of short stature, the same spectrum of congenital heart defects, and a similar pattern of craniofacial anomalies. It is now known that all these disorders are caused by mutations in components of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway was previously known for its involvement in tumorigenesis. This article reviews the current knowledge on underlying genetic alterations and possible pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for NS and related disorders. It discusses the relationship between a group of developmental disorders and oncogenes. Potential future treatment prospects are based on the possibility of inhibiting RAS-MAPK signaling by pharmaceuticals.",M1

19955345,"Neurooncology of familial cancer syndromes.The majority of tumors of the nervous system are sporadic. However, a subset of patients with tumors and their families are predisposed to developing cancers of the central nervous system and other organs because of a germline mutation. In the last decade, many of the genes responsible for these typically autosomal dominant familial tumor syndromes have been identified. Additionally, our understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in these syndromes has increased, allowing for more targeted therapies for these patients as well as those with sporadic cancers. Because these patients present a unique set of issues regarding diagnosis and neurooncological management, the most common familial cancer syndromes involving the nervous system are reviewed: <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 and 2; tuberous sclerosis complex; von Hippel Lindau, Li-Fraumeni, Gorlin, and Turcot syndrome.",M1

This disorder is characterized by the development of various tumors, including neurofibromas, neuroniomas, malignant and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and meningiomas. Accompanying skin changes and bone deformities are also common in NF. However, genitourinary involvement in NF is a rare condition, and penile enlargement has been reported only in a few males with plexiform NF. We report a 6-year-old boy with chronic renal failure associated with plexiform neurofibromas of the bladder and prostatic urethra which led to urinary obstruction and macrogenitalia due to genitourinary NF.",M1

However, only one report of grade 4 spondylolisthesis with neurofibromatosis has been reported in the literature. A 15-year-old boy with neurofibromatosis was admitted for back pain and neurological claudication. Radiograph showed grade 4 spondylolisthesis of the L5 vertebra with scalloping of the L4-L5 vertebrae. L4-L5 laminectomy, reduction, L3-S1 posterior instrumentation and fusion were performed. The reduction of the spondylisthesis was done entirely from the posterior approach using pedicle screws. Radiography at four months showed a broken S1 screw with a loss of reduction. The patient was re-operated on, to provide additional stability with pelvic fixation. He was pain-free with a good fusion at the two-year follow-up. Adequate posterior stabilisation with fusion gives good results in grade 4 spondylolisthesis associated with neurofibromatosis and dural ectasia.",M1
19587630,"The Neurofibromatoses. Part 1: NF1.The neurofibromatoses, including <e>neurofibromatosis</e> 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis, comprise a group of genetically distinct disorders of the nervous system unified by the predisposition to nerve sheath tumors. NF1 is the most common neurogenetic disorder, with a birth incidence of 1 in 3000. NF1 is inherited in auto-somal dominant fashion with full penetrance and variable expressivity. The hallmark lesion of NF1 is the neurofibroma, a benign tumor derived from the nerve sheath and composed of a mixture of proliferating Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, and pericytes. Other findings include gliomas, learning disability, vasculopathy, and bony abnormalities. Café au lait macules are typically the initial clinical manifestation of NF1 and tend to increase in size and number throughout childhood and puberty. Current treatment of patients with NF1 remains primarily surgical. Genetic counseling is essential for adult patients because molecular diagnostic testing can minimize the risk of transmission to children.",M1

19281485,"Multinucleate giant cells in neurofibromas: a clue to the diagnosis of <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.BACKGROUND: A 54-year-old African-American male patient underwent removal of several cutaneous neurofibromas. Histopathologic examination revealed a nonencapsulated, haphazardly arranged proliferation of slender spindle cells in a myxoid stroma consistent with neurofibroma. Interestingly, each specimen exhibited numerous, large, multinucleate giant cells with nuclei arranged in a wreath-like or linear pattern. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed these cells to be negative with S-100 and CD-34. It was subsequently learned that this patient has neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: A retrospective review of all lesions coded as neurofibroma from our institution between 1 June 2006 and 28 August 2006 was performed. RESULTS: Biopsies of 53 cutaneous neurofibromas from 51 patients were reviewed. In these, multinucleate giant cells were present in only three (5.7%), all in patients with single lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of floret-like giant cells in neurofibromas of patients with NF1 is unknown, our findings suggest that the presence of these cells might be a clue to the presence of NF1.",M1

MATERIALS-METHODS: Between December 1991-October 2006, 20 pediatric cases (age range 3-18 years, meanly 12.5 year) with at least 60% stenoses were underwent PTRA. Main presenting symptom was hypertension. The aetiologies were TA in 12, and FMD in 5, NF in three cases. RESULTS: Totally, 46 procedures were performed on 35 stenotic segments of 20 cases. A technically good result was obtained in 21/24 arteries of TA patients, 7/7 arteries of FMD patients, and 1/3 arteries of NF1 patients. Clinical followup for a mean of 55.7 months revealed 100% success in all cases. Delayed clinical response was seen in two cases with NF1. Restenosis was detected 5/12 of TA patients, 1/5 of FMD patients and 1/3 NF1 patients. CONCLUSION: PTRA can be safely performed resulting in excellent angiographic and clinical results. It should be first choice in renal artery stenosis in pediatric age when medical treatment fails to control renovascular hypertension or renal function is decreasing although initial results might be not encouraging in NF1.",M1
19238320,"Childhood and adolescent meningiomas: a report of 38 cases and review of literature.BACKGROUND: The aim is to study the clinical, radiological and pathological features of childhood and adolescent meningiomas and analyse outcome prognosticators. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of the case records of patients less than 20 years of age operated for a meningioma in our institute since 1982 was performed. The variables analysed included age, sex, presentation, associated <e>neurofibromatosis</e> (NF), imaging characteristics, extent of resection and histopathology. RESULTS: The study group included 20 males and 18 females with a mean age of 15.53 years. Eleven children (28.9%) had evidence of NF of whom three had NF2 with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The common presenting symptoms were seizures (76.3%), raised intracranial tension (71%), and focal neurological deficits (39.4%). The location of the operated tumours were as follows: ten skull base (24.4%), ten falx/parasagittal (24.4%), eight spinal (19.5%), five convexity (12.2%), three posterior fossa (7.3%), three intraventricular (7.3%) and two optic nerve sheath (4.9%). Two children (4.9%) had cystic meningiomas. Grade I excision was achieved only in twenty tumours (48.8%). On histopathology, thirty (73.2%) were grade I, nine (21.9%) were grade II and two (4.9%) were grade III meningiomas. Seven tumours recurred of which six were located at the skull base. During the mean follow up period of 4.74 years, the majority, 32 (84.2%) had a good outcome and five (13.2%) had a poor outcome. One child (2.6%) expired due to post-operative sepsis. CONCLUSION: Childhood meningiomas are uncommon but not rare lesions with a marginal male predominance. Absence of large series with long follow up precludes any definite conclusions on the clinical course and outcome. Uniform observations made in different series including ours, include a higher incidence of the skull base location and tumours with atypical histopathology. Favourable prognostic factors include younger age (&lt; than 10 years), superficial location, total excision and absence of neurofibromatosis. Location and extent of excision appear to be more important than histopathology grade in predicting outcome.",M1
19226027,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> contributing to carpometacarpal instability.Neurofibromatosis is well known to orthopedic surgeons for causing spinal curvature and tibial bowing. However, skeletal abnormalities of the hand related to this condition have rarely been reported. We present a unique case of neurofibromatosis causing bony changes possibly contributing to carpometacarpal instability. A 29-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with right hand pain after striking a wall. Swelling was difficult to assess as the hand was deformed due to a large plexiform neurofibroma over the ulnar side of the hand. Radiographs showed dorsal dislocation of the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints. Erosions, cystic changes, and rounding of the articulations were noted. Closed reduction and splinting were performed in the emergency room, but immediate redislocation occurred. Because of the inherent instability demonstrated clinically and radiographically, fixation was recommended; however, an open procedure was avoided to avoid dissecting through the neurofibroma. Percutaneous pin fixation was performed 1 week after injury, taking care to avoid the nerve lesion. Pins were removed at 6 weeks, and the patient was placed in a cast for an additional 4 weeks. At 6 months after injury, the patient was asymptomatic and had returned to prior level of function. Radiographs showed stable reduction.",M1
19165072,"Foraminal nerve sheath tumors: intermediate follow-up after cyberknife radiosurgery.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective review of outcomes in 15 patients with 18 foraminal tumors, including 17 benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors and 1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, who underwent CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery at Stanford University Medical Center from 1999 to 2006. METHODS: Symptoms and findings, <e>neurofibromatosis</e> (NF) association, previous radiation, imaging, dosimetry, tumor volume, central necrosis, and the relation of these factors to outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Before treatment, 1 asymptomatic patient had radiculopathic findings, 3 patients experienced local pain with intact neurological examinations, and 7 patients had radiculopathic complaints with intact (1 patient), radiculopathic (4 patients), or radiculomyelopathic examinations (2 patients). Five patients had myelopathic complaints and findings. Three patients had NF1-associated neurofibromas, 1 patient with NF2 had a schwannoma, and 1 patient had a schwannomatosis-related lesion. Two likely radiation-induced lesions, a neurofibroma and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, were observed. Prescribed doses ranging from 16 to 24 Gy, delivered in 1 to 3 fractions of 6 to 20 Gy, resulted in maximum tumor doses ranging from 20.9 to 30 Gy. Target volumes ranged from 1.36 to 16.9 mL. After radiosurgery, the asymptomatic case remained asymptomatic, and neurological findings improved. Thirteen of 15 symptomatic patients with (12 patients) or without (3 patients) neurological findings improved (3 cases after resection) or remained stable, and 2 patients worsened. Symptoms and examinations remained stable or improved in 8 (80%) of 10 patients with schwannomas and 3 (60%) of 5 patients with neurofibromas. Tumor volumes decreased in 12 (67%) of 18 tumors and increased in 3 tumors. Tumor volumes decreased in 8 of 10 schwannomas and 3 of 7 neurofibromas. Central necrosis developed in 8 (44%) of 18 tumors. CONCLUSION: CyberKnife radiosurgery resulted in pain relief and functional preservation in selected foraminal peripheral nerve sheath tumors and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Symptomatic and neurological improvements were more noticeable with schwannomas. Myelopathic symptoms may necessitate surgical debulking before radiosurgery.",M1

19098581,"Multiple huge epidermal inclusion cysts mistaken as <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.Epidermal inclusion cyst is one of the common benign soft tissue tumors, and it can be easily confirmed and treated by surgical excision. We experienced a patient who had multiple masses on the face and scalp region, and the masses had been misdiagnosed as neurofibromatosis because of accompanying mental retardation. We would like to introduce a case of clinical diagnosis error caused by the lack of radiologic evaluation and pathologic confirmation. A 27-year-old male patient visited with multiple masses, with a length of approximately 1 to 10 cm on the face and scalp region. These mass have developed since childhood without known etiology, and there has been no histologic examination or surgical excision done in the past. The patient's history of seizure disorder and mental retardation led the primary clinician to diagnose it as neurofibromatosis in the initial stage, and therefore, the clinician gave an advice on the possibility of frequent recurrence to the patient. As the masses increased in size, the patient came to our hospital after all. We found that the masses were soft and mobile through the physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of epidermal inclusion cyst, which is distinguished from neurofibromatosis. Based on physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging, we performed total excision and biopsies. On the histologic examination, it was diagnosed as an epidermal inclusion cyst showing keratotic material internally, and the cyst wall was composed of lamellate keratin. The follow-up period was 12 months, and a recurrence has not occurred. The wound was healed without any specific complication, and both the patient and the guardian were satisfied with the physical enhancement. We have observed a misdiagnosed case that was misconceived by the situation, accompanying mental retardation. Due to this misconception, any surgical treatment was not performed at all, and the symptoms eventually worsened as multiple huge epidermal inclusion cysts. We present this case with a brief review of literature.",M1

In this setting, the lesions may manifest as focal scattered neurofibromas or as an extensive diffuse neural hyperplasia designated ganglioneuromatosis. Occasionally, such lesions may be the initial sign of NF1 in patients without any other clinical manifestations of the disease. Rarely, cases of isolated neurofibromatosis of the large bowel with no prior or subsequent evidence of generalized neurofibromatosis have been documented. We present the case of a 52 year-old female with abdominal pain and alternating bowel habits. Colonoscopic evaluation revealed multiple small polyps in the cecum and the presence of nodular mucosa in the colon and rectum. Pathologic evaluation of the biopsies from the cecum, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum revealed tangled fascicles of spindle cells expanding the lamina propia leading to separation of the intestinal crypts. Immunohistochemical stains helped confirm the diagnosis of diffuse intestinal neurofibromatosis. A thorough clinical evaluation failed to reveal any stigmata of generalized neurofibromatosis. This case represents a rare presentation of isolated intestinal neurofibromatosis in a patient without classic systemic manifestations of generalized neurofibromatosis and highlights the need in such cases for close clinical follow-up to exclude neurofibromatosis type I or multiple endocrine neoplasia type II.",M1
19003952,"Artepillin C (ARC) in Brazilian green propolis selectively blocks oncogenic PAK1 signaling and suppresses the growth of NF tumors in mice.There are mainly three types of propolis whose major anticancer ingredients are entirely different: (1) CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester)-based propolis in Europe, Far East and New Zealand, (2) artepillin C (ARC)-based Brazilian green propolis and (3) Brazilian red propolis. It was shown previously that NF (<e>neurofibromatosis</e>)-associated tumors require the kinase PAK1 for their growth, and CAPE-based propolis extracts such as Bio 30 suppress completely the growth of NF tumors in vivo by blocking PAK1 signaling. Also it was demonstrated that ARC suppresses angiogenesis, suggesting the possibility that ARC also blocks oncogenic PAK1 signaling. Here it is shown for the first time that both ARC and green propolis extract (GPE) indeed block the PAK1 signaling selectively, without affecting another kinase known as AKT. Furthermore, it was confirmed that ARC as well as GPE suppress almost completely the growth of human NF tumor xenografts in mice, as does Bio 30. These results suggest that both CAPE-based and ARC-based propolis extracts are natural anti-PAK1 remedies and could be among the first effective NF therapeutics available on the market. Since more than 70% of human cancers such as breast and prostate cancers require the kinase PAK1 for their growth, it is quite possible that GPE could be potentially useful for the treatment of these cancers, as is Bio 30.",M1

Presentation of 43 patients]INTRODUCTION: It is known as segmental neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) a type of NF1 characterized by the features circumscribed to one or more body cutaneous and/or subcutaneous segments. This entity is recognized from recently and it is related with somatic mosaicism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 patients (29 females and 14 males) with ages below 16 years were retrospectively studied. Image study of the affected region of the body was performed in all patients to discard a subjacent organic disease, and a neurofibroma was histologically demonstrated in some cases. Somatic or gonosomal mosaicism was not investigated in any of the patients. RESULTS: Only 8 patients showed cutaneous lesion--7 with café-au-lait spots (3 of freckles type, 4 of large spots, of which, 3 were bilateral and 1 unilateral ) and 1 presented neurofibromas-. The other cases (81%) had cutaneous lesion with subjacent lesion (neurofibromas and bone dysplasia in most cases). The subcutaneous lesions were seen in all parts of the body without a preferent location. In cases with only cutaneous lesion, the clinical features were seen on the trunk skin. CONCLUSION: Segmental NF1 is considered to be the result of a somatic or gonosomal mosaicism and still is underdiagnosed. Features of segmental NF1 can be found in as many regions of the body as NF1 without mosaicism. The types of segmental NF1 that were seen less frequently in this series were those with only cutaneous features (café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas). Types with subcutaneous features that involved subjacent organs were seen in 81% of patients. Familial patients, with NF1 or segmental NF1 was shown in 15 patients (35%) and bilateral lesion in 4 cases (9.3%).",M1

18687535,"Clinical experience with radiation therapy in the management of <e>neurofibromatosis</e>-associated central nervous system tumors.PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis (NF) develop tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Radiation therapy (RT) is used to treat these lesions. To better define the efficacy of RT in these patients, we reviewed our 20-year experience. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen patients with NF with CNS tumors were treated from 1986 to 2007. Median follow-up was 48 months. Progression was defined as growth or recurrence of an irradiated tumor on serial imaging. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the date of RT completion to the date of last follow-up imaging study. Actuarial rates of overall survival (OS) and PFS were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Eighty-two tumors in 18 patients were irradiated, with an average of five tumors/patient. Median age at treatment was 25 years (range, 4.3-64 years). Tumor types included acoustic neuroma (16%), ependymoma (6%), low-grade glioma (11%), meningioma (60%), and schwanomma/neurofibroma (7%). The most common indication for treatment was growth on serial imaging. Most patients (67%) received stereotactic radiosurgery (median dose, 1,200 cGy; range, 1,000-2,400 cGy). The OS rate at 5 years was 94%. Five-year PFS rates were 75% (acoustic neuroma), 100% (ependymoma), 75% (low-grade glioma), 86% (meningioma), and 100% (schwanomma/neurofibroma). Thirteen acoustic neuromas had a local control rate of 94% with a 50% hearing preservation rate. CONCLUSIONS: RT provided local control, OS, and PFS rates similar to or better than published data for tumors in non-NF patients. Radiation therapy should be considered in NF patients with imaging progression of CNS tumors.",M1

CASE REPORT: A boy without any family history of neurocutaneous disorders who had characteristics of both neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis, as cafe-au-lait patches, six greater than 0.5 cm, macrocephaly, optic nerve glioma, focal alterations of the myelin vacuolization of the white matter from both cerebellar hemispheres, brain stem, basal ganglia, characteristic of type 1 neurofibromatosis. He also presented hypopigmentation spots, infantile spasms, and imagiologic findings of cortical areas with altered mielinization on the white matter, left talamo-caudado sulcus calcifications, cortical tubers, Taylor cortical dysplasia, subependimary nodes, characteristically of tuberous sclerosis. The child also had psycho motor development delay. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of both disorders was confirmed by genetic study. Parents study was negative, so we can confirm the simultaneous occurrence of two new mutations which is unusually rare.",M1
18326288,"[Differential diagnostics of acute inflammatory diseases and tumors of the neck]The purpose of the investigation was to assess the clinical significance of ultrasonography for differential diagnostics between acute inflammatory and tumorous lesions of the neck. One hundred and eighty-six patients with soft-tissue lesions of the neck aged 18 to 74 (mean age 31.45 +/- 8.39 years), 95 (51%) males and 91 (49%) females were examined. Basing on clinical and ultrasonographic examination, the patients were divided into two groups: 149 or 80% patients with acute inflammatory lesions (Group 1), and 37 or 20% patients with tumorous lesions (Group 2). Thirty-four of the 149 Group 1 patients (22.82%) had lymphadenitis, 30 (20.13%) had soft tissue infiltrates, 13 (8.72%) had abscesses, 19 (12.72%) had phlegmons, 32 (21.48%) had acute inflammatory changes in the major salivary glands, 3 (2.01%) had teratomas with signs of inflammation, and 17 (11.41%) patients had inflammatory changes in the tumors. Of 37 patients with tumorous lesions, 16 (43.2%) had salivary gland tumors, 12 (32.4%) had metastases in the lymphatic nodes, and 9 (24.3%) had <e>neurofibromatosis</e>. Soft tissue ultrasonography was performed using Sonos-5500 and Image-Point ultrasound scanners with 7.5 MHz sensors (Hewlett-Packard, USA), Logio-pro, Uoluson-730 Expert (General Electric, USA), and Premium Edition (ACUSON Antares, Siemens, Germany) with 5 to 13 MHz wide-frequency sensors. Visualization was performed in B-modes using tissue harmonics, color duplex scanning, Sie Scape panoramic visualization, contrast visualization and Sight 4D and 3D-Scape modes. The results of ultrasonography were analyzed taking into account additional methods such as computed and magnetic resonance tomography, intraoperative findings, the results of puncture biopsy, histological, morphological, and bacteriological studies. The study demonstrates that ultrasonography is the method of choice, which is in some cases enough to establish a diagnosis of an acute inflammatory disease or a tumorous formation of various localizations in the neck.",M1
18317084,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e>: a cause of prepubertal gynecomastia.BACKGROUND: Atypical presentations of gynecomastia not associated with obesity are often underappreciated. Unilateral manifestation, prepubertal onset, and a history of associated disorders may contribute to a unique clinical presentation for which the diagnosis and management may remain uncertain. This report reviews neurofibromatosis as a cause for atypical presentation of gynecomastia in prepubertal boys to help establish guidelines for diagnosis and management. METHODS: Six nonobese male patients (body mass index &lt;or=20) had an onset of gynecomastia at younger than 9 years and were referred for evaluation between June of 1994 and December of 2006. RESULTS: The median age of onset of breast enlargement was 7(1/2) years (range, 4 to 8 years). Three had bilateral involvement, four had localized involvement of the nipple-areola complex, and two had diffusely involved breast tissue. Five of the six patients were African American (compared with 20 percent for classic gynecomastia). Median postoperative follow-up was 7 years, and all were followed beyond puberty. No recurrences were seen, although one patient developed a metachronous lesion in the contralateral breast. No patient had an abnormal endocrine metabolic workup. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical gynecomastia may present in the prepubertal boy and appears more prevalent in African Americans. For neurofibromatosis, it is more likely unilateral, can be localized to the nipple-areola complex, or entails diffuse breast involvement. An endocrine workup appears to be noncontributory.",M1

18262243,"Cystoperitoneal shunt as alternative treatment for a giant thoracic meningocele in a patient with <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.BACKGROUND: Thoracic meningoceles are associated with neurofibromatosis 1 in 60% to 85% of all cases. Usually, these meningoceles remain asymptomatic, but back pain, headache, cough, and dyspnea are possible manifestations. Often, there is an associated kyphoscoliotic deformity of the thoracic spine. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old woman known in our department after a fossa posterior decompression for an Arnold-Chiari malformation was admitted through the emergency department because of progressive dyspnea. A giant intrathoracic meningocele was already diagnosed earlier but was left untreated because the patient was asymptomatic at that time. She now had dyspnea, and on chest x-ray and CT scan, there was an obvious shift of the mediastinum to the right. Because of the long-existing hemithoracic meningocele, we assumed that this patient actually had only 1 functional lung, and so, left-sided thoracotomy with resection of the meningocele and closure of the defect included a high operative mortality. Instead, we chose to obtain a permanent drainage of the meningocele by putting a shunt between the meningocele and the peritoneum. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and became oxygen-independent. CONCLUSION: Treatment of giant intrathoracic meningoceles in patients with progressive dyspnea can be challenging, and different options can be found in the literature. Treatment with a cystoperýtoneal shunt, as in our case, can be a less invasive alternative in patients with a high operative mortality risk. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with neurofibromatosis 1 treated in this way.",M1
18252147,"[A possible cause of misdiagnosis in tumors of the axilla: schwannoma of the brachial plexus]The Authors report a rare case of a 57 years old man affected by a left radial nerve schwannoma that occurred as an asymptomatic lesion of the axilla. At clinical examination the lump was undistinguishable from the most common axillary lymphadenopathy. A lymphoadenopathy was erroneously diagnosed with ultrasonography (US). This mistake was due to the low specificity of the instrumental methodology and to the rarity of an asymptomatic schwannoma of the infraclavicular brachial plexus. The neoplasia was excised without using the microscope. In the early post-operative follow up, a  falling  attitude of the wrist, the hand and the fingers appeared, peculiar for a lesion of the radial nerve. Furthermore a hypoaesthesia of the skin of first finger and of the first interosseus space was associated. The sensitive and motor electromyography showed a radial nerve suffering. The  stupor  of the nerve trunk was treated with steroid therapy for 7 days and the patient underwent to some series of neuro-rehabilitative physical therapy for 12 weeks. The postoperative total body CT, showed that the lesion was unique: therefore it was possible to exclude the diagnosis of <e>neurofibromatosis</e>. After 28 months electromyography and axillary US were performed showing the complete resolution of the motor and sensitive deficit and the absence of local recurrence.",M1

18172006,"Leukemia-associated NF1 inactivation in patients with pediatric T-ALL and AML lacking evidence for <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Patients with NF1 have a higher risk to develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) with a possible progression toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In an oligo array comparative genomic hybridization-based screening of 103 patients with pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and 71 patients with MLL-rearranged AML, a recurrent cryptic deletion, del(17)(q11.2), was identified in 3 patients with T-ALL and 2 patients with MLL-rearranged AML. This deletion has previously been described as a microdeletion of the NF1 region in patients with NF1. However, our patients lacked clinical NF1 symptoms. Mutation analysis in 4 of these del(17)(q11.2)-positive patients revealed that mutations in the remaining NF1 allele were present in 3 patients, confirming its role as a tumor-suppressor gene in cancer. In addition, NF1 inactivation was confirmed at the RNA expression level in 3 patients tested. Since the NF1 protein is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway (RAS-GTPase activating protein), homozygous NF1 inactivation represent a novel type I mutation in pediatric MLL-rearranged AML and T-ALL with a predicted frequency that is less than 10%. NF1 inactivation may provide an additional proliferative signal toward the development of leukemia.",M1
18160797,"Two independent chromosomal rearrangements, a very small (550 kb) duplication of the 7q subtelomeric region and an atypical 17q11.2 (NF1) microdeletion, in a girl with <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.Most patients with neurofibromatosis (NF1) are endowed with heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene. Approximately 5% show an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17q11.2 (including NF1) and in most cases also a more severe phenotype. Here we report on a 7-year-old girl with classical NF1 signs, and in addition mild overgrowth (97th percentile), relatively low OFC (10th-25th percentile), facial dysmorphy, hoarse voice, and developmental delay. FISH analysis revealed a 17q11.2 microdeletion as well as an unbalanced 7p;13q translocation leading to trisomy of the 7q36.3 subtelomeric region. The patient's mother and grandmother who were phenotypically normal carried the same unbalanced translocation. The 17q11.2 microdeletion had arisen de novo. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) demonstrated gain of a 550-kb segment from 7qter and loss of 2.5 Mb from 17q11.2 (an atypical NF1 microdeletion). We conclude that the patient's phenotype is caused by the atypical NF1 deletion, whereas 7q36.3 trisomy represents a subtelomeric copy number variation without phenotypic consequences. To our knowledge this is the first report that a duplication of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 7q containing functional genes (FAM62B, WDR60, and VIPR2) can be tolerated without phenotypic consequences. The 17q11.2 microdeletion (containing nine more genes than the common NF1 microdeletions) and the 7qter duplication were not accompanied by unexpected clinical features. Most likely the 7qter trisomy and the 17q11.2 microdeletion coincide by chance in our patient.",M1

The extent of the deleted segments was about 1.9 Mb on 17p and about 1.0 Mb on 17q. The structure of the junction between the 17p and 17q arms, especially the lack of significant homology between the juxtaposed genomic regions and the presence of short microhomology at the junction site, indicated non-homologous end joining as the most likely mechanism leading to the rearrangement. In addition to the 17p-17q junction itself, a de novo 1 kb deletion in a distance of 400 bp from the junction was identified, which arose most likely as a part of the rearrangement. The defect directly inactivated 3 genes, and the deleted terminal chromosome segments harboured 27 and 14 protein-coding genes from 17p and 17q, respectively. Several of the genes affected by the rearrangement are candidates for the symptoms observed in the patient. Additional rearrangements similar to the 1 kb deletion observed in our patient may remain undetected but can participate in the phenotype of patients with chromosomal aberrations. They can also be the reason for repeated failures to clone breakpoint junctions in other patients described in the literature.",M1

We present the case of a thirteen-year-old lady with neurofibromatosis type 1 who developed a dystrophic thoracic kyphoscoliosis. A T9 compression due to a severe scaloping of the thoracic spine caused an important deformation and a medullar compression (with dorsal pain, right sciatica and a pyramidal syndrome). The surgery consisted in medullar liberation by a T9-T10 corporectomy and an osteosynthesis with arthrodesis T3-L3. A free vascularized fibula bone graft, with an end-to-end anastomosis on a thoracic pedicle, was realized to fill the T8-T11 spinal defect. All the symptoms decreased after surgery and the patient could walk normally few months later. At one-year follow-up the radiographs showed a stable montage and a solid bony fusion. Analysing the literature, vascularized bone graft can be recommended to fill the bony spinal defect due to surgery in cases of tumor, infection, trauma or severe scoliosis. Compared to non-vascularized grafts, which are exposed to resorption, fatigue fracture and then instability, the vascularized fibula grafts provide a rapid fusion, a biomechanically stable and long-standing support with low risks of infection.",M1

The other point noted was that this situation did not change, no matter the patient's race or skin color. There have been few reports describing or discussing this hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether wounds produced in the patients with NF-1 produce keloid or hypertrophic scars. The patients with solitary neurofibroma were also included in this study; these were compared with the NF-1 group. This was conducted as a multicenter study. Patients with neurofibromatosis/solitary neurofibroma, who were operated on from 1990 to 2000, were evaluated by reviewing their medical charts and photographs retrospectively. The patients were treated in centers from five different countries. The analysis was undertaken based on the following points: 1) age and sex at surgery; 2) race of the patients; 3) past and family histories of hypertrophic scar and keloid; 4) surgical site(s); 5) diagnosis, NF1 or solitary neurofibroma; 6) surgical complications; 7) number of reoperations to manage the complications; 8) adjuvant therapy for the tumor; 9) depth of the tumors; and 10) incidence of malignant degeneration. A total of 101 cases with neurofibromatosis or solitary neurofibroma was analyzed. The age at surgery ranged from 1 year 6 months to 74 years; sex ratio was 47 males and 54 females. The racial distribution of the patients was 13 white, 13 black, 3 Hispanic, and 58 Asian. There was no past or family history of hypertrophic scar or keloid. The surgical sites were head and neck in 70 cases, trunk in 20 cases, upper extremities in 22 cases, and lower extremities in 20 cases. The clinical diagnosis was NF-1 in 57 cases, solitary neurofibroma in 35 cases, plexiform neurofibroma in four cases, and no distinct clinical diagnosis in five cases. There were no other types of neurofibromatosis. Hematoma and white wide scar were the main postoperative complications found in six cases of NF-1. Infection was also noted in four cases. However, no patient developed hypertrophic scar or keloid in the neurofibromatosis group, whereas two cases showed hypertrophic scar in the solitary neurofibroma group. The outcome showed that the patients with NF-1 and plexiform neurofibroma, no matter the racial group, produce good scars without keloid or hypertrophic changes, whereas solitary neurofibroma has a potential to cause hypertrophic scar.",M1

A case of intercostal AVF associated with NF-1 and manifesting as congestive myelopathy is described. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman with a medical history of NF-1 experienced gradually worsening gait disturbance. Neurological examination at the time of admission found spastic paraparesis, decrease of sensation in the bilateral lower extremities, and vesicorectal disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed flow void sign and a congestive lesion of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, as well as a huge mass in the paravertebral region at T10-T12. Spinal angiography revealed an intercostal AVF with a large paravertebral varix, which drained to the spinal medullary vein and caused dilation of the intradural venous plexus of the spinal cord resulting in congestive myelopathy. INTERVENTION: Direct surgery was selected for the occlusion of the draining point of the medullary vein, located in the entry of the dura. The patient underwent hemilaminectomy at T10-T12, and the dural entry of the draining vein was occluded. Postoperative angiography revealed no dilated venous plexus of the spinal cord and reduced paravertebral varix. The symptoms were gradually relieved after the surgery. CONCLUSION: The present case of a very rare intercostal AVF with an unusual manifestation of congestive myelopathy occurred in a relatively rare association with NF-1.

In this regard, de-regulated signaling in cancer cells confers a number of key tumor-associated properties, including increased cell proliferation, decreased cell death, and increased cell motility. The identification of some of these critical signaling pathways in the nervous system has come from studies of inherited cancer syndromes in which affected individuals develop brain tumors. The study of brain tumors arising in patients with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) has already uncovered several key intracellular signaling pathways important for modulating brain tumor growth.

Significant reduction in lifespan occurs in both conditions often related to complications of malignancy and hypertension. Individuals with these conditions may also be the subject of medicolegal autopsy investigation if sudden death occurs. Unexpected lethal events may be associated with intracranial neoplasia and hemorrhage or brainstem compression. Vasculopathy with fibrointimal proliferation may result in critical reduction in blood flow within the coronary or cerebral circulations, and aneurysmal dilatation may be associated with rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage. An autopsy approach to potential cases should include review of the history/hospital record, liaison with a clinical geneticist (to include family follow-up), a full external examination with careful documentation of skin lesions and nodules, measurement of the head circumference in children, photography, possible radiologic examination, a standard internal autopsy examination, documentation of the effects of previous surgery and/or chemo/radiotherapy, examination for specific tumors, specific examination and sampling of vasculature (renal, cerebral, and cardiac), formal neuropathologic examination of brain and spinal cord, possible examination of the eyeballs, examination of the gastrointestinal tract, histology to include tumors, vessels, gut, and bone marrow, toxicological testing for anticonvulsants, and sampling of blood and tissue for possible cytogenetic/molecular evaluation if required.",M1
17630606,"Diagnosis and management of benign lumps and bumps in childhood.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In every pediatric practice, skin disorders make up a large percentage of outpatient visits. In this article, we highlight three of the most common 'lumps and bumps' seen in childhood: nevus sebaceus, pilomatricoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma. RECENT FINDINGS: Historically, many authors have advocated the prompt removal of nevus sebaceus at a young age due to the risk of malignant growths arising in these lesions during childhood. Recent articles have revisited this issue, concluding that the actual incidence of malignant growths in nevus sebaceus is quite rare in young patients. Regarding pilomatricomas, new findings show that the clinical accuracy of primary care physicians in diagnosing a pilomatricoma is low. With the identification of several key features, these lesions can be more easily diagnosed. Finally, the association of juvenile xanthogranuloma with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> and chronic juvenile myeloid leukemia has been described more formally in the recent literature, but the incidence and true association of this triad remain debatable. SUMMARY: Several updates in the recent literature now afford greater understanding of these three benign pediatric tumors.

In the past, resection and radiation therapy were the mainstays of their treatment. More recently, neurosurgeons have begun to use radiosurgery in the treatment of trigeminal schwannomas because of its successful use in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. In this article the authors evaluate the radiological and clinical outcomes in a series of patients in whom Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) was used to treat trigeminal schwannomas. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with trigeminal schwannomas underwent GKS at the University of Virginia Lars Leksell Gamma Knife Center between 1989 and 2005. Five of these patients had <e>neurofibromatosis</e> and one patient was lost to follow up. The median tumor volume was 3.96 cm(3), and the mean follow-up period was 48.5 months. The median prescription radiation dose was 15 Gy, and the median prescription isodose configuration was 50%. There was clinical improvement in 18 patients (72%), a stable lesion in four patients (16%), and worsening of the disease in three patients (12%). On imaging, the schwannomas shrank in 12 patients (48%), remained stable in 10 patients (40%), and increased in size in three patients (12%). These results were comparable for primary and adjuvant GKSs. No tumor growth following GKS was observed in the patients with neurofibromatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery affords a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for patients harboring trigeminal schwannomas. Larger studies with open-ended follow-up review will be necessary to determine the long-term results and complications of GKS in the treatment of trigeminal schwannomas.",M1
17538359,"Recognizing schwannomatosis and distinguishing it from <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 or 2.BACKGROUND DATA: Schwannomatosis has become a newly recognized classification of neurofibromatosis. Although the genetic loci are on chromosome 22, it lacks the classic bilateral vestibular schwannomas as seen in NF-2. We present the surgical treatment of 4 patients with schwannomatosis, including a brother and sister. METHOD: Case 1 presented with multiple progressively enlarging peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Case 4 presented with a trigeminal schwannoma and a vagal nerve schwannoma. Three of 4 patients had spinal intradural, extramedullary nerve sheath tumors. Surgery in all was multistaged and consisted of spinal laminectomies, site-specific explorations, and microsurgical tumor dissection and resection, with intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (including somatosensory-evoked and motor-evoked potentials, upper extremity electromyography and intraoperative nerve action potential monitoring, as appropriate). RESULTS: Intraoperatively the schwannomas had cystic and solid features and in all surgical cases the tumors arose from discrete fascicles of sensory nerve roots or sensory peripheral nerve branches. None of the patients experienced neurologic worsening as a result of their resections. Pathologic analysis of specimens from all cases demonstrated schwannoma. CONCLUSIONS: Not all patients with multiple schwannomas of cranial nerve, spinal nerve root, or peripheral nerve origin have NF-1 or NF-2. In schwannomatosis, these lesions are present in the absence of cutaneous stigmata, neurofibromas, vestibular schwannomas, or parenchymal brain tumors. Schwannomas in schwannomatosis can be large, cystic, and multiple. However, the predominant nerve involvement seems to be sensory and discrete fascicular in origin, facilitating microsurgical resection with minimal deficit.",M1

17206408,"Therapeutic potential and mechanism of kinetin as a treatment for the human splicing disease familial dysautonomia.Mutations that affect the splicing of pre-mRNA are a major cause of human disease. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by a T to C transition at base pair 6 of IKBKAP intron 20. This mutation results in variable tissue-specific skipping of exon 20. Previously, we reported that the plant cytokinin kinetin dramatically increases exon 20 inclusion in RNA isolated from cultured FD cells. The goal of the current study was to investigate the nature of the FD splicing defect and the mechanism by which kinetin improves exon inclusion, as such knowledge will facilitate the development of future therapeutics aimed at regulating mRNA splicing. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of FD lymphoblast cell lines with kinetin increases IKBKAP mRNA and IKAP protein to normal levels. Using a series of minigene constructs, we show that deletion of a region at the end of IKBKAP exon 20 disrupts the ability of kinetin to improve exon inclusion, pinpointing a kinetin responsive sequence element. We next performed a screen of endogenously expressed genes with multiple isoforms resulting from exon skipping events and show that kinetin's ability to improve exon inclusion is not limited to IKBKAP. Lastly, we highlight the potential of kinetin for the treatment of other human splicing disorders by showing correction of a splicing defect in <e>neurofibromatosis</e>.",M1

Three patients were treated for massive hemothorax caused by arterial lesions associated with neurofibromatosis. Bleeding episodes were secondary to ascending cervical artery aneurysm and dissection of vertebral artery in 1 patient, and intercostal artery aneurysm with or without arteriovenous fistula in 2 patients. Patients were treated by transarterial coil embolization combined with chest drainage. In 1 patient, the ruptured ascending cervical artery aneurysm was well embolized but, shortly after the embolization, fatal hemorrhage induced by dissection of the vertebral artery occurred and the patient died. In the other 2 patients, the ruptured intercostal artery aneurysm was well embolized and they were successfully treated and discharged.

17087943,"Intestinal <e>neurofibromatosis</e> is a subtype of familial GIST and results from a dominant activating mutation in PDGFRA.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Intestinal neurofibromatosis (Online Mendelian inheritance in Man database number 162220) is an alternate form of neurofibromatosis. Patients present with neurofibromas limited to the intestine in the absence of any other typical features of NF1 and NF2. At present, the molecular basis of intestinal neurofibromatosis remains elusive. The aim of the present study was to find the gene responsible for intestinal neurofibromatosis and to characterize functionally the mutation. METHODS: Three candidate genes (NF1, KIT, and PDGFRA) were screened for mutations in 3 sisters diagnosed with intestinal neurofibromatosis. Five tumors were available for pathologic examination. Activation (phosphorylation) of PDGFRalpha was subsequently tested by Western blot analysis on a transfected 293T and Ba/F3 cell line. RESULTS: We found an inherited mutation (Y555C) in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFRA in the affected individuals. The Y555C mutation leads to autophosphorylation and thus activation of PDGFRalpha. These observations confirm that PDGFRalpha(Y555C) is an oncogenic kinase. The clinical phenotype in the reported family resembles the syndrome of familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors (familial GIST). Somatic activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA are frequent in sporadic GISTs, and mutations in both genes have also been described in familial GISTs. The tumors in the reported family are morphologically identical to intestinal neurofibromas, but, immunohistochemically, they do not express S100 or any of the known GIST markers. CONCLUSIONS: The inherited PDGFRA mutation in the reported family shows that intestinal neurofibromatosis is allelic to familial GIST caused by PDGRA mutations. We therefore propose that these tumors be classified as familial KIT-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",M1

The objective of this study was to determine the PTPN11 gene mutation rate in a cohort of clinically well-characterized Brazilian patients with Noonan or Noonan-like syndromes and to study the genotype-phenotype correlation. Fifty probands with Noonan syndrome ascertained according to well-established diagnostic criteria, 3 with LEOPARD syndrome, 5 with Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, and 3 with <e>neurofibromatosis</e>/ Noonan were enrolled in this study. Mutational analysis was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by sequencing of amplicons with an aberrant elution profile. We detected missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene in 21 probands with Noonan syndrome (42%), in all 3 patients with LEOPARD syndrome, and in 1 case with Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome. One patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome had a mutation in both the PTPN11 and NF1 genes. The only anomalies that reached statistical significance when comparing probands with and without mutations were the hematological abnormalities. Our data confirms that Noonan syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, with mutations in the PTPN11 gene responsible for roughly 50% of the cases. A definitive genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established, but the T73I mutation seems to predispose to a myeloproliferative disorder. Regarding Noonan-like syndromes, mutation of the PTPN11 gene is the main causal factor in LEOPARD syndrome, and it also plays a role in neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. Noonan- like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, part of the spectrum of Noonan syndrome, is also heterogeneous.",M1

16983570,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in childhood brainstem lesions.BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of brainstem lesions in children based on magnetic resonance imaging alone is a challenging problem. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive technique for spatial characterization of biochemical markers in tissues and gives information regarding cell membrane proliferation, neuronal damage, and energy metabolism. METHODS: We measured the concentrations of biochemical markers in five children with brainstem lesions and evaluated their potential diagnostic significance. Images and spectra were acquired on a 1.5-T imager. The concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, tetramethylamines (e.g., choline), creatine, phosphocreatine, lactate, and lipids were measured within lesions located at the brainstem using Point-resolved spectroscopy sequences. RESULTS: Diagnosis based on localized proton spectroscopy included brainstem glioma, brainstem encephalitis, demyelination, dysmyelination secondary to <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (NF 1), and possible infection or radiation necrosis. In all but one patient, diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy or by clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This small sample of patients suggests that MRS is important in the differential diagnosis between proliferative and nonproliferative lesions in patients without neurofibromatosis. Unfortunately, in cases of NF 1, MRS can have a rather misdiagnosis role.",M1

16896669,"Uptake of 4-borono-2-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine in sporadic and <e>neurofibromatosis</e> 2-related schwannoma and meningioma studied with PET.PURPOSE: Meningiomas and schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) are difficult to control by microsurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy alone. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a chemically targeted form of radiotherapy requiring increased concentration of boron-10 in tumour tissue. PET with the boron carrier 4-borono-2-[(18)F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine ([(18)F]FBPA) allows investigation of whether 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) concentrates in NF2 tumours, which would make BNCT feasible. METHODS: We studied dynamic uptake of [(18)F]FBPA in intracranial meningiomas (n=4) and schwannomas (n=6) of five sporadic and five NF2 patients. Tracer input function and cerebral blood volume were measured. [(18)F]FBPA uptake in tumour and brain was assessed with a three-compartmental model and graphical analysis. These, together with standardised uptake values (SUVs), were used to define tumour-to-brain [(18)F]FBPA tissue activity gradients. RESULTS: Model fits with three parameters K (1) (transport), k (2) (reverse transport) and k (3) (intracellular metabolism) were found to best illustrate [(18)F]FBPA uptake kinetics. Maximum SUV was two- to fourfold higher in tumour as compared with normal brain and independent of NF2 status. The increased uptake was due to higher transport of [(18)F]FBPA in tumour. In multiple-time graphical analysis (MTGA, Gjedde-Patlak plot) the tumour-to-brain [(18)F]FBPA influx constant (K (i) -MTGA) ratios varied between 1.8 and 5.4 in NF2-associated tumours while in sporadic tumours the ratio was 1-1.4. CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FBPA PET offers a viable means to evaluate BPA uptake in meningiomas and schwannomas in NF2. Based on our results on tumour uptake of [(18)F]FBPA, some of these benign neoplasms may be amenable to BNCT.",M1

A retrospective case series and literature review in a tertiary care academic medical centre is reported in which medical records, chest radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were reviewed. A total of 55 adult patients with neurofibromatosis were identified, three of whom had NF-DLD. A literature review revealed 16 articles reporting 61 additional cases, yielding a total of 64 NF-DLD cases. The mean age of patients was 50 yrs. Males outnumbered females; most reported dyspnoea.

20186797,"Monozygotic twins discordant for <e>neurofibromatosis</e> 1.We present monozygotic twins discordant for the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The affected twin was diagnosed with NF1 at age 12, based upon accepted clinical criteria for the disorder. Both twins were re-examined at ages 35 and 57, at which times the unaffected twin continued to show no clinical manifestations of NF1. Short tandem repeat marker (STR) genotyping at 10 loci on chromosome 17 and 10 additional loci dispersed across the genome revealed identical genotypes for the twins, confirming their monozygosity. The affected twin has three children, two of whom also have NF1, while the unaffected twin has two children, both unaffected. Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene. This mutation was found in all cell samples from the affected twin and her affected daughter, and in lymphoblastoid and buccal cells but not fibroblasts from the unaffected twin. We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation. All cells from the twins were heterozygous for this apparent exon 16 polymorphism and for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 2.5 kb flanking the site of the exon 40 nonsense mutation. This suggests that the NF1 gene of the unaffected twin differed in the respective lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts only at the mutation site itself, making post-zygotic mutation leading to mosaicism the most likely mechanism of phenotypic discordance. Although the unaffected twin is a mosaic, the distribution of the mutant allele among different cells and tissues appears to be insufficient to cause overt clinical manifestations of NF1.",M2

20043723,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> Type 1 and tumorigenesis: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications.Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by complex and multicellular neurofibroma tumors, and less frequently by malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and optic nerve gliomas. Significant advances have been made in elucidating the cellular, genetic, and molecular biology involved in tumor formation in NF1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is caused by germline mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which generally result in decreased intracellular neurofibromin protein levels, leading to increased cascade Ras signaling to its downstream effectors. Multiple key pathways are involved with the development of tumors in NF1, including Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Interestingly, recent studies demonstrate that multiple other developmental syndromes (in addition to NF1) share phenotypic features resulting from germline mutations in genes responsible for components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. In general, a somatic loss of the second NF1 allele, also referred to as loss of heterozygosity, in the progenitor cell, either the Schwann cell or its precursor, combined with haploinsufficiency in multiple supporting cells is required for tumor formation. Importantly, a complex series of interactions with these other cell types in neurofibroma tumorigenesis is mediated by abnormal expression of growth factors and their receptors and modification of gene expression, a key example of which is the process of recruitment and involvement of the NF1(+/-) heterozygous mast cell. In general, for malignant transformation to occur, there must be accumulation of additional mutations of multiple genes including INK4A/ARF and P53, with resulting abnormalities of their respective signal cascades. Further, abnormalities of the NF1 gene and molecular cascade described above have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of NF1 and some sporadically occurring gliomas, and thus, these treatment options may have wider applicability. Finally, increased knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved with NF1 tumorigenesis has led to multiple preclinical and clinical studies of targeted therapy, including the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which is demonstrating promising preclinical results for treatment of MPNSTs and gliomas.",M2

Learning disabilities are present in at least 50% of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1. Less common but potentially more serious manifestations include plexiform neurofibromas, optic nerve and other central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy. The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 1 is usually based on clinical findings. Neurofibromatosis 1, one of the most common Mendelian disorders, is caused by heterozygous mutations of the NF1 gene. Almost one half of all affected individuals have de novo mutations. Molecular genetic testing is available clinically but is infrequently needed for diagnosis. Disease management includes referral to specialists for treatment of complications involving the eye, central or peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular system, spine, or long bones. Surgery to remove both benign and malignant tumors or to correct skeletal manifestations is sometimes warranted. Annual physical examination by a physician familiar with the disorder is recommended. Other recommendations include ophthalmologic examinations annually in children and less frequently in adults, regular developmental assessment in children, regular blood pressure monitoring, and magnetic resonance imaging for follow-up of clinically suspected intracranial and other internal tumors.",M2

In a second cross-sectional study, 1318 unrelated anonymous samples collected in 2003-2007 from patients with a broad range of signs typically found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) but no detectable NF1 germline mutation underwent SPRED1 mutation analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of aggregated clinical features in patients with or without a SPRED1 or NF1 mutation. Functional assays were used to evaluate the pathogenicity of missense mutations. RESULTS: Among 42 SPRED1-positive individuals from the clinical cohort, 20 (48%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 32%-64%) fulfilled National Institutes of Health (NIH) NF1 diagnostic criteria based on the presence of more than 5 CALMs with or without freckling or an NF1-compatible family history. None of the 42 SPRED1-positive individuals (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7%) had discrete cutaneous or plexiform neurofibromas, typical NF1 osseous lesions, or symptomatic optic pathway gliomas. In the anonymous cohort of 1318 individuals, 34 different SPRED1 mutations in 43 probands were identified: 27 pathogenic mutations in 34 probands and 7 probable nonpathogenic missense mutations in 9 probands. Of 94 probands with familial CALMs with or without freckling and no other NF1 features, 69 (73%; 95% CI, 63%-80%) had an NF1 mutation and 18 (19%; 95% CI, 12%-29%) had a pathogenic SPRED1 mutation. In the anonymous cohort, 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.9%) of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH criteria had NFLS. CONCLUSIONS: A high SPRED1 mutation detection rate was found in NF1 mutation-negative families with an autosomal dominant phenotype of CALMs with or without freckling and no other NF1 features. Among individuals in this study, NFLS was not associated with the peripheral and central nervous system tumors seen in NF1.",M2
19919880,"PACAP and VIP affect NF1 expression in rat malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells.In our previous study we have identified PACAP, VIP and their receptors in rat malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, thus showing anti-apoptotic roles. Recently it has been shown that the tumor suppressor neurofibromin, encoded by the <e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type I (NF1) gene, promotes MPNST cells sensitivity to apoptosis after serum withdrawal. In the present study we investigated whether PACAP or VIP negatively regulate NF1 expression under normal or serum-dependent pro-apoptotic culture conditions. Results indicated that serum itself significantly influenced gene and protein levels. In fact, the low NF1 levels of cells cultured in normal serum-containing medium were remarkably increased in cells switched to low- or no-serum after 24h and 48 h. Treatment with 100 nM PACAP or VIP did not affect NF1 expression when using normal amounts of serum, whereas it significantly inhibited transcript and protein levels both in low- or no-serum cultured cells. In particular, PACAP reduced NF1 levels already after 24h in low-serum cultured cells, while VIP showed a similar effect only after serum deprivation. However, both PACAP and VIP downregulated gene and protein levels within 48 h either in low-dose and serum-starved cells. Results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, showing that 100 nM PACAP or VIP attenuated neurofibromin cytoplasmic localization only in low- or no-serum cultured cells. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of both neuropeptides effect on NF1 expression in normal, low- or serum-starved MPNST cells, ameliorating the hypothesis that resistance to apoptosis in serum-deprived cells might be correlated to PACAP-/VIP-induced NF1 inhibition.",M2
19910506,"DNA sequence capture and enrichment by microarray followed by next-generation sequencing for targeted resequencing: <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 gene as a model.BACKGROUND: The introduction and use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have taken genomic research into a new era; however, implementing such powerful techniques in diagnostics laboratories for applications such as resequencing of targeted disease genes requires attention to technical issues, including sequencing template enrichment, management of massive data, and high interference by homologous sequences. METHODS: In this study, we investigated a process for enriching DNA samples that uses a customized high-density oligonucleotide microarray to enrich a targeted 280-kb region of the NF1 (neurofibromin 1) gene. The captured DNA was sequenced with the Roche/454 GS FLX system. Two NF1 samples (CN1 and CN2) with known genotypes were tested with this protocol. RESULTS: Targeted microarray capture may also capture sequences from nontargeted regions in the genome. The capture specificity estimated for the targeted NF1 region was approximately 60%. The de novo Alu insertion was partially detected in sample CN1 by additional de novo assembly with 50% base-match stringency; the single-base deletion in sample CN2 was successfully detected by reference mapping. Interferences by pseudogene sequences were removed by means of dual-mode reference-mapping analysis, which reduced the risk of generating false-positive data. The risk of generating false-negative data was minimized with higher sequence coverage (&gt;30x). CONCLUSIONS: We used a clinically relevant complex genomic target to evaluate a microarray-based sample-enrichment process and an NGS instrument for clinical resequencing purposes. The results allowed us to develop a systematic data-analysis strategy and algorithm to fit potential clinical applications.",M2
19772601,"Pathogenesis of vestibular schwannoma in ring chromosome 22.BACKGROUND: Ring chromosome 22 is a rare human constitutional cytogenetic abnormality. Clinical features of <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 and 2 as well as different tumour types have been reported in patients with ring chromosome 22. The pathogenesis of these tumours is not always clear yet. METHODS: We report on a female patient with a ring chromosome 22 presenting with severe mental retardation, autistic behaviour, café-au-lait macules and facial dysmorphism. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were karyotyped and array CGH was performed on extracted DNA. At the age of 20 years she was diagnosed with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Tumour cells were analyzed by karyotyping, array CGH and NF2 mutation analysis. RESULTS: Karyotype on peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a ring chromosome 22 in all analyzed cells. A 1 Mb array CGH experiment on peripheral blood DNA showed a deletion of 5 terminal clones on the long arm of chromosome 22. Genetic analysis of vestibular schwannoma tissue revealed loss of the ring chromosome 22 and a somatic second hit in the NF2 gene on the remaining chromosome 22. CONCLUSION: We conclude that tumours can arise by the combination of loss of the ring chromosome and a pathogenic NF2 mutation on the remaining chromosome 22 in patients with ring chromosome 22. Our findings indicate that patients with a ring 22 should be monitored for NF2-related tumours starting in adolescence.",M2
19738042,"Glomus tumors in <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1: genetic, functional, and clinical evidence of a novel association.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common disorder that arises secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Glomus tumors are small, benign but painful tumors that originate from the glomus body, a thermoregulatory shunt concentrated in the fingers and toes. We report 11 individuals with NF1 who harbored 20 glomus tumors of the fingers and 1 in the toe; 5 individuals had multiple glomus tumors. We hypothesized that biallelic inactivation of NF1 underlies the pathogenesis of these tumors. In 12 NF1-associated glomus tumors, we used cell culture and laser capture microdissection to isolate DNA. We also analyzed two sporadic (not NF1-associated) glomus tumors. Genetic analysis showed germ line and somatic NF1 mutations in seven tumors. RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase hyperactivation was observed in cultured NF1(-/-) glomus cells, reflecting a lack of inhibition of the pathway by functional neurofibromin, the protein product of NF1. No abnormalities in NF1 or RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were found in sporadic glomus tumors. By comparative genomic hybridization, we observed amplification of the 3'-end of CRTAC1 and a deletion of the 5'-end of WASF1 in two NF1-associated glomus tumors. For the first time, we show that loss of neurofibromin function is crucial in the pathogenesis of glomus tumors in NF1. Glomus tumors of the fingers or toes should be considered as part of the tumor spectrum of NF1.",M2
19710506,"Nf1 deficiency cooperates with oncogenic K-RAS to induce acute myeloid leukemia in mice.Hyperactive RAS signaling is caused by mutations in RAS genes or a deficiency of the <e>neurofibromatosis</e> gene (NF1) and is common in myeloid malignancies. In mice, expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. The data point to a strong cooperation between Nf1 deficiency and oncogenic K-RAS.",M2
19691086,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 is a disorder of dysplasia: the importance of distinguishing features, consequences, and complications.BACKGROUND: The disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which influences the availability of activated Ras and the latter's control of cellular proliferation. Emphasis on this aspect of NF1 has focused attention on the tumor suppression function of NF1 and thereby displaced attention from the gene's role in initial normal tissue formation, maintenance, and repair. METHODS: Clinical and neuroimaging data systematically compiled over more than 30 years are analyzed to document the involvement of multiple organs and tissues, often with an embryonic origin. In addition, recent literature based on selective knockout mouse experiments is cited to corroborate embryonic dysplasia as an element of NF1 pathogenesis. RESULTS: Tissue dysplasia, both ab initio and as part of tissue maintenance and wound healing, is a key clinical and pathogenetic aspect of NF1 and thereby provides a rationale for differentiating the elements of NF1 into features, consequences, and complications. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 is a histogenesis control gene that also has properties that overlap with those of a tumor suppressor gene. Both its neoplastic and dysplastic manifestations become more amenable to understanding and treatment if they are differentiated at three levels--specifically, features, consequences and complications.",M2
19657044,"The approach to the patient with paraganglioma.The multidisciplinary management of patients with paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas remains challenging. The cornerstone of excellent multidisciplinary management of such patients is genetic classification and management in a tertiary care referral center. Up to one third of all symptomatic presentations of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma are due to germline mutations in one of six genes defining multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease, <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1, and the paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3, and 4. This genetic classification forms the basis early diagnosis and follow-up including management of relatives. Easily available clinical information such as tumor location and number, age, gender, and family history must be used to prioritize which gene should be tested. Mutation carriers should undergo regular check-up to detect and treat metachronous paraganglial and extraparaganglial tumors, and depending on syndrome, other extraparaganglial neoplasias such as medullary thyroid cancer and renal clear cell carcinomas in time. Adrenal and extraadrenal retroperitoneal tumors should be operated by surgeons highly experienced in minimal invasive, endoscopic techniques.",M2
19603524,"Genome-wide high-resolution analysis of DNA copy number alterations in NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using 32K BAC array.<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> Type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. The lifetime risk for developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in NF1 patients is approximately 10% with poor survival rates. To date, the molecular basis of MPNST development remains unclear. Here, we report the first genome-wide and high-resolution analysis of DNA copy number alterations in MPNST using the 32K bacterial artificial chromosome microarray on a series of 24 MPNSTs and three neurofibroma samples. In the benign neurofibromas, apart from loss of one copy of the NF1 gene and copy number polymorphisms, no other changes were found. The profiles of malignant samples, however, revealed specific loss of chromosomal regions including 1p35-33, 1p21, 9p21.3, 10q25, 11q22-23, 17q11, and 20p12.2 as well as gain of 1q25, 3p26, 3q13, 5p12, 5q11.2-q14, 5q21-23, 5q31-33, 6p23-p21, 6p12, 6q15, 6q23-q24, 7p22, 7p14-p13, 7q21, 7q36, 8q22-q24, 14q22, and 17q21-q25. Copy number gains were more frequent than deletions in the MPNST samples (62% vs. 38%). The genes resident within common regions of gain were NEDL1 (7p14), AP3B1 (5q14.1), and CUL1 (7q36.1) and these were identified in &gt;63% MPNSTs. The most frequently deleted locus encompassed CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP genes on 9p21.3 (33% cases). These genes have previously been implicated in other cancer conditions and therefore, should be considered for their therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic relevance in NF1 tumorigenesis.",M2
19539839,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3500 people. Significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of NF1 have been made in the last decade. While no medical therapies for NF1 are currently available, trials are ongoing to discover and test medical treatments for the various manifestations of NF1, primarily plexiform neurofibromas, learning disabilities, and optic pathway gliomas. In addition, mutational analysis has become available on a clinical basis and is useful for diagnostic confirmation in individuals who do not fulfill diagnostic criteria or when a prenatal diagnosis is desired. There are several disorders that may share overlapping features with NF1; in 2007, a disorder with cutaneous findings similar to NF1 was described. This paper addresses the dermatologist's role in diagnosis and management of NF1 and describes the variety of cutaneous and extracutaneous findings in NF1 to which the dermatologist may be exposed. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to discuss the indications and limitations of genetic testing in neurofibromatosis type 1, distinguish common and uncommon cutaneous findings, and recognize the dermatologist's role in diagnosis and management.",M2
19516012,"A quantitative assessment of the burden and distribution of Lisch nodules in adults with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1.PURPOSE: The presence of two or more Lisch nodules (melanocytic hamartomas of the iris) is one of seven diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder of dysregulated neurocutaneous growth. The hypothesis that Lisch nodules arise secondary to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight was investigated. METHODS: Lisch nodule burden was mapped and quantified in the irides of 77 adults with NF1. Lifetime sunlight (UV radiation) exposure was inventoried, NF1 neurocutaneous severity determined, and two NF1 mutations predictive of severity selectively genotyped. RESULTS: There was high interindividual variability in Lisch nodule burden. Lisch nodules were primarily located in the inferior hemifield (half) of the iris, regardless of its color (P = 3.0 x 10(-20)). Light irides harbored significantly more Lisch nodules than dark irides (P = 4.8 x 10(-5)). There was no statistically significant correlation of Lisch nodule burden to lifetime sunlight exposure  dose  or NF1 neurocutaneous severity. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in Lisch nodule burden between the superior and inferior iris hemifields is most likely due to the sunlight-shielding effects on the superior half by periocular structures. The difference in Lisch nodule burden between light and dark irides is probably due to the photoprotective effects of pigmentation. The genes underlying the control of iris color may thus be viewed as modifiers of severity of Lisch nodule burden in NF1. Given the role of UV radiation and, presumably, DNA damage in Lisch nodule pathogenesis,  benign tumor of the iris,  not  hamartoma,  may be a better descriptor.",M2
19414372,"Molecular characterization of permanent cell lines from primary, metastatic and recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) with underlying <e>neurofibromatosis</e>-1.Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) develop in patients with underlying NF1, and usually arise as a result of malignant transformation of a pre-existing plexiform neurofibroma. The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities reported in primary MPNST include complex karyotypes with chromosome numbers in the triploid or tetraploid range with recurrent abnormalities of several chromosomes including losses or imbalances. As a prelude to cell biological, pharmacological, and functional studies to investigate pathways and gene(s) associated with multistep tumorigenesis, which includes progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy in MPNST, detailed molecular cytogenetic and genetic analyses of cell lines from primary, metastatic and recurrent MPNST with underlying NF1 disorder have been performed. The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities detected in the primary tumor cell line were similar to those observed in primary cultures of this tumor. Due to the complexity of the rearrangements seen by G-banded karyotype analysis, further characterization of the clonal abnormalities in these three cell lines was performed by molecular cytogenetic techniques, including CGH and SKY. CGH analysis detected recurrent deletions of 9p, 12q21-q32, complete losses of the X-chromosome, and gains of the chromosomal segment 17q25 in all three cell lines. SKY analysis detected extensive clonal abnormalities in these cell lines. The nature and the alterations of the cell cycle regulators, particularly those associated with G1-S checkpoints and known to be deregulated in MPNST, were studied. These cell cycle regulators included those associated with Rb1-cyclin D1 and the p53 pathways. The findings are consistent with the argument that an imbalance between the cyclin activators of CDKs and inhibitory proteins such as p16 result in uncontrollable proliferation in the cell lines, associated with progression of the disease. LOH and expression of the p53 gene in metastatic and recurrent cell lines was observed, as reported by others. The role of biallelic inactivation of p53 gene in MPNST with underlying NF1 mutations, however, needs further study. Overexpression of Rb1-protein observed in metastatic and recurrent cell lines is indicative of its role in the progression of the disease. One of the most important observations of this study is that Nm23-H1 expression is closely associated with advanced or metastatic disease. In summary, MPNST cell lines derived from a patient with metastatic and recurrent disease with NF1 disorder were characterized and a gene associated with metastatic potential which is amenable to therapeutic and chemo-preventative approaches was identified. These cell lines with extensive characterization of genetic abnormalities are likely to provide important reagents for biochemical, molecular and pharmacological studies related to MPNST.",M2
19144598,"[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors in <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1]Neurofibromatosis type 1 or Recklinghausen disease is one of the most common hereditary autosomal dominant diseases. The disease-causing gene can be found on chromosome 17 as an NF1 tumor suppressor gene. The mutation of this gene leads to the loss of tumor suppressor function, which in turn causes the development of benign and malignant tumors. In 25% of the cases gastrointestinal manifestations are found, most often GIST. The close correlation of the two diseases are well known in the literature, there are more than 160 published cases. GIST develops in 7% of patients with neurofibromatosis, and among these patients the occurrence of NF1 is 150-180 times more frequent than in the general population. Neurofibromatosis associated with GIST is a different entity and, unlike sporadic GIST, it is usually multiplex and almost always develops in the small bowel. There is a slightly higher incidence among women than in men, and the disease develops at young age. Histological characteristics include spindle cell type, skeinoid fibers and frequent S100 positivity. Low mitotic activity usually suggests better prognosis. c-KIT and PDGFRA mutation is very rare, in agreement with the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of NF1-GIST is not c-KIT dependent. It is presumed that neurofibromatosis associated and sporadic GIST have different pathogenesis, and that the development of GIST tumor in neurofibromatosis is part of the hereditary disease. c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations--as shown in a few known cases--probably develop at a later step of tumor genesis. Imatinib, which has revolutionized the therapy of GIST, cannot be used in this patient group, however, as of today not enough information is available.",M2
19120036,"A severe form of Noonan syndrome and autosomal dominant café-au-lait spots - evidence for different genetic origins.AIM: The clinical overlap among Noonan syndrome (NS), cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC), LEOPARD and Costello syndromes as well as <e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 is extensive, which complicates the process of diagnosis. Further genotype-phenotype correlations are required to facilitate future diagnosis of these patients. Therefore, investigations of the genetic cause of a severe phenotype in a patient with NS and the presence of multiple café-au-lait spots (CAL) spots in the patient and four members of the family were performed. METHODS: Mutation analyses of candidate genes, PTPN11, NF1, SPRED1 and SPRED2, associated with these syndromes, were conducted using DNA sequencing. RESULTS: A previously identified de novo mutation, PTPN11 F285L and an inherited NF1 R1809C substitution in the index patient were found. However, neither PTPN11 F285L, NF1 R1809C, SPRED1 nor SPRED2 segregated with CAL spots in the family. The results indicate that the familial CAL spots trait in this family is caused by a mutation in another gene, distinct from previous genes associated with CAL spots in these syndromes. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the atypical severe symptoms in the index patient may be caused by an additive effect on the F285L mutation in PTPN11 by another mutation, for example the NF1 R1809C or alternatively, the not yet identified gene mutation associated with CAL spots in this family.",M2

Twenty-eight sequential magnetic resonance images showed multifocal hyperintense T2-weighted images in 14 patients. Seven (5 boys and 2 girls) of the 8 patients (88%) who inherited neurofibromatosis type 1 from affected mothers, and 7 (2 boys and 5 girls) of the 16 de novo patients (44%) had multifocal hyperintense T2-weighted images. In contrast, the patients who inherited this disease from affected fathers did not have any multifocal hyperintense T2-weighted images. Multiple plexiform neurofibromas were observed in 4 patients, of whom 3 boys inherited through at least 3 generations of women. They all presented severe psychomotor delay and epilepsy. These findings suggest that genetic traits, especially through the passage of several generations of women, may affect the clinical presentation in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.",M2
18984165,"Neurofibromin regulation of ERK signaling modulates GABA release and learning.We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning, indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for learning.",M2
18984156,"Nf1-dependent tumors require a microenvironment containing Nf1+/-- and c-kit-dependent bone marrow.Interactions between tumorigenic cells and their surrounding microenvironment are critical for tumor progression yet remain incompletely understood. Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas. Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1 deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression. Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor initiation.",M2
18953430,"Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a causes schwannomas by suppressing <e>neurofibromatosis</e> protein production.Signaling events leading to Schwann cell tumor initiation have been extensively characterized in the context of neurofibromatosis (NF). Similar tumors are also observed in patients with the endocrine neoplasia syndrome Carney complex, which results from inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A. Loss of PRKAR1A causes enhanced protein kinase A activity, although the pathways leading to tumorigenesis are not well characterized. Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a in neural crest precursor cells (TEC3KO mice) causes schwannomas with nearly 80% penetrance by 10 months. These heterogeneous neoplasms were clinically characterized as genetically engineered mouse schwannomas, grades II and III. At the molecular level, analysis of the tumors revealed almost complete loss of both NF proteins, despite the fact that transcript levels were increased, implying posttranscriptional regulation. Although Erk and Akt signaling are typically enhanced in NF-associated tumors, we observed no activation of either of these pathways in TEC3KO tumors. Furthermore, the small G proteins Ras, Rac1, and RhoA are all known to be involved with NF signaling. In TEC3KO tumors, all three molecules showed modest increases in total protein, but only Rac1 showed significant activation. These data suggest that dysregulated protein kinase A activation causes tumorigenesis through pathways that overlap but are distinct from those described in NF tumorigenesis.",M2

Despite the prominence of these benign tumors in NF1 patients, the mechanisms underlying the tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in plexiform neurofibromas have not been extensively studied. We performed LOH analysis on 43 plexiform neurofibromas from 31 NF1 patients, the largest study of its kind to date. A total of 13 (30%) plexiform neurofibromas exhibited LOH involving 17q markers. In three tumors, LOH was found to be confined to the NF1 gene region. However, in none of the tumors was a somatic NF1 microdeletion, mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination between either NF1-REPs or SUZ12 genes, detected. Thus, NF1 microdeletions do not appear to be frequent somatic events in plexiform neurofibromas. Determination of NF1 gene copy number by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated that although tumors with smaller regions of LOH were characterized by 17q deletions, no NF1 gene copy number changes were detected in six plexiform neurofibromas with more extensive LOH. To our knowledge, mitotic recombination has not previously been reported to be a frequent cause of LOH in plexiform neurofibromas.",M2

Patients with NF1 develop numerous neurofibromas, which contain many inflammatory mast cells that contribute to tumor formation. Subsequent to c-Kit stimulation, signaling from Ras to Rac1/2 to the MAPK pathway appears to be responsible for multiple hyperactive mast cell phenotypes; however, the specific effectors that mediate these functions remain uncertain. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is a downstream mediator of Rac1/2 that has been implicated as a positive regulator of MAPK pathway members and is a modulator of cell growth and cytoskeletal dynamics. Using an intercross of Pak 1(-/-) mice with Nf1(+/-) mice, we determined that Pak1 regulates hyperactive Ras-dependent proliferation via a Pak1/Erk pathway, whereas a Pak1/p38 pathway is required for the increased migration in Nf1(+/-) mast cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that loss of Pak1 corrects the dermal accumulation of Nf1(+/-) mast cells in vivo to levels found in wild-type mice. Thus, Pak1 is a novel mast cell mediator that functions as a key node in the MAPK signaling network and potential therapeutic target in NF1 patients.",M2

Mosaicism has been identified in several hereditary cancer syndromes including retinoblastoma, familial adenomatous polyposis coli, von Hippel-Lindau disease and neurofibromatosis type 2. Recent data support the postulate that the frequency of mosaicism is increased in cancer predisposition syndromes characterised by high new mutation rates. Since the new mutation rate is very high in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), mosaicism might reasonably be expected to be frequent among sporadic cases but this remains to be formally demonstrated. Here we summarise current knowledge of mosaicism in NF1, focusing on the types of mutations identified as well as their inferred developmental timing and representation in different cell types, and assess the potential impact of high frequency mosaicism on mutation screening in patients with apparent de novo NF1.",M2

18442999,"Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation via hyperactivation of a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway.<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a negative regulator of Ras activity. Somatic mutations in the residual normal NF1 allele within cancers of NF1 patients is consistent with NF1 functioning as a tumor-suppressor. However, the prevalent non-malignant manifestations of NF1, including learning and bone disorders emphasize the importance of dissecting the cellular and biochemical effects of NF1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell lineages. One of the least studied complications of NF1 involves cardiovascular disorders, including arterial occlusions that result in cerebral and visceral infarcts. NF1 vasculopathy is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation in the intima area of vessels resulting in lumen occlusion. We recently showed that Nf1 haploinsufficiency increases VSMC proliferation and migration via hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway, which is a signaling axis directly linked to neointima formation in diverse animal models of vasculopathy. Given this observation, we tested whether heterozygosity of Nf1 would lead to vaso-occlusive disease in genetically engineered mice in vivo. Strikingly, Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation, excessive vessel wall cell proliferation and Erk activation after vascular injury in vivo. Further, this effect is directly dependent on a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway. Therefore, these studies establish an Nf1 model of vasculopathy, which mirrors features of human NF1 vaso-occlusive disease, identifies a potential therapeutic target and provides a platform to further dissect the effect of Nf1 haploinsufficiency in cardiovascular disease.",M2

Congenital disseminated NF1 is rare with just two cases previously reported. We present a deceased baby with congenital disseminated NF1 in whom we performed molecular studies. A germline mutation (R461X) in exon 10a of the NF1 gene was found. A 2 bp deletion (3508delCA) in codon 1170 of exon 21 was identified in DNA derived from some tumor tissue. Loss of heterozygosity in NF1 and TP53 was observed in other tumor samples. No microsatellite instability was observed in the tumor samples.

It is caused by the mutation of the tumor suppressor gene NF1, which encodes neurofibromin. The main function of neurofibromin is down-regulating the biological activity of the proto-oncoprotein Ras by acting as a Ras-specific GTPase activating protein. In this study, we identified a Chinese family affected with neurofibromatosis type 1. The known gene NF1 associated with NF1 was studied by linkage analysis and by direct sequencing of the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the NF1 gene. The R1947X mutation of NF1 was identified, which was co-segregated with affected individuals in the Chinese family, but not present in unaffected family members. This is the first report, which states that the R1947X mutation of NF1 may be one of reasons for neurofibromatosis type 1 in Chinese population.",M2

The aim of this study was to determine bone mineral density (BMD) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and investigate specific bone formation and bone resorption and bone turnover markers in children with NF1. Thirty-two children and adolescents (16 boys, 16 girls; 16 prepubertal, 16 pubertal) with NF1 were recruited. Their age ranged from 3 to 17 years. They were compared with matched healthy children. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were applied to 26 patients and 27 controls. Nine of 32 subjects with NF1 had a skeletal abnormality. BMD of the lumbar spine, and femoral neck in NF1 patients significantly decreased compared to that of healthy subjects. They were also significantly decreased in pubertal patients when compared to pubertal controls and in prepubertal patients when compared to prepubertal controls. Patients with skeletal abnormalities were found to have significantly lower level of osteocalcin when compared to patients without skeletal abnormality. Other biochemical markers did not exhibit any difference between the groups. In conclusion, our findings suggest that bone formation markers rather than DEXA could be good predictors of skeletal abnormalities among NF1 patients. However, in our study the number of the NF1 patients with skeletal abnormality and the number of bone formation markers studied were all limited. It is appropriate to perform larger studies with other bone formation markers beside osteocalcin.",M2

Loss of the NF1 gene product in Schwann cells leads to the development of benign nerve sheath tumors. These neurofibromas may occur at any time but tend to arise during periods of hormonal imbalance, suggesting that hormones influence neurofibroma growth. As steroid hormone levels rise during these times, we hypothesized that progesterone has proliferative effects on neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells. We chose specific medium conditions for selective proliferation of NF (+/-) and NF (-/-) cells from human neurofibromas. Genetic characterization was not performed, but former works have shown that under the conditions used (+/-) and (-/-) cells can be selected. Different progesterone concentrations were added at different days with BrdU-staining was performed to investigate proliferation rates and DAB-staining to identify a progesterone receptor. We could demonstrate that Schwann cells from human neurofibromas express progesterone receptors. These cells show elevated proliferation rates (highest in NF(-/-) cells) under progesterone, whereas normal human Schwann cells were not affected. These data suggest that progesterone plays an important role in the development of neurofibromas in NF1.",M2

18272679,"Neurofibromin is required for barrel formation in the mouse somatosensory cortex.The rodent barrel cortex is a useful system to study the role of genes and neuronal activity in the patterning of the nervous system. Several genes encoding either intracellular signaling molecules or neurotransmitter receptors are required for barrel formation. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein that has Ras GTPase activity, thus attenuating the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and and PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways, and is mutated in humans with the condition <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (NF1). Neurofibromin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system, and a common feature of NF1 is deficits in intellectual development. In addition, NF1 is an uncommonly high disorder among individuals with autism. Thus, NF1 may have important roles in normal CNS development and function. To explore roles for neurofibromin in the development of the CNS, we took advantage of a mouse conditional allele.

Different pathogenetic mechanisms have been identified, with the majority (95%) causing intragenic lesions. Single or multiexon NF1 copy number changes occur in about 2% of patients, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind these intragenic deletions. We report here on the molecular characterization of a novel NF1 multiexonic deletion. The application of a multidisciplinary approach including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, allelic segregation analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization allowed us to map the breakpoints in IVS27b and IVS48. Furthermore, the breakpoint junction was characterized by sequencing. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified some recombinogenic motifs in close proximity to the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints and predicted the presence of a mutated messenger ribonucleic acid, which was deleted between exons 28 and 48 and encodes a neurofibromin that lacks some domains essential for its function. Through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of the mutated allele was verified, showing the junction between exons 27b and 49 and, as expected, was not subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Multiexonic deletions represent 2% of NF1 mutations, and until now, the breakpoint has been identified in only a few cases.

Besides the classic criteria café-au-lait spots (100%), freckling (48,1%), positive family history (44,1%), neurofibromas (40,7%), Lisch nodules (22,2%) and optic pathway tumors (22,2%) there were developmental delay (40,7%), macrocephaly (33,3%), strabism (29,6%), scoliosis (18,5%), epilepsy (14,8%), pubertal anomalies (14,8%), short stature (11,1%) and tics. Morphologically, CNS hamartomas (55,5%), astrocytomas (22,2%) and one pheochromocytoma became apparent. Special findings consist of one aneurysm of internal carotic arteria, juvenile xanthogranulomas, a case of pulmonary stenosis and an intracardial tumor. Four new mutations in the NF1 gene were found. Regular screening of optic glioma with MRI had no clinical significance. In contrast to other authors, one of our patients with optic glioma showed clinical progress after twelve years of age. The detection of astrocytomas led only to therapeutic consequences, when clinical signs or symptoms occurred. As with other authors, we found no potential for CNS hamartoma to proliferate. In three cases with pubertal anomalies we found CNS gliomas, which indicates the need for MRI.

The majority of cases are caused by mutations arising within the NF1 gene. NF1 microdeletion carriers present a more severe phenotype than patients with intragenic mutations, including mental retardation, cardiac anomalies and dysmorphic features. Here, we report on two brothers with mental retardation presenting a microduplication of the NF1 microdeletion syndrome region detected by array-CGH analysis. Main phenotypic features are mental deficiency, early onset of baldness (15 years old), dental enamel hypoplasia and minor facial dysmorphism. The breakpoint regions coincide with the repeats, and the recombination hot spots shown to mediate NF1 microdeletion through NAHR. A screening of the patients' familial relatives showed that this microduplication segregates in the family for at least two generations. This result demonstrates that both deletion and duplication of the NF1 region, at cytogenetic band 17q11.2, give rise to viable gametes, even if only NF1 microdeletions have been reported until now. Our study reports seven cases of NF1 microduplication within one family. Similar phenotypic abnormalities were present in most of the individuals, however, two displayed a normal phenotype, suggesting a potential incomplete penetrance of the phenotype associated with NF1 microduplication.",M2
18164202,"TORC1 is essential for NF1-associated malignancies.Inactivating mutations in NF1 underlie the prevalent familial cancer syndrome <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 [1]. The NF1-encoded protein is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) [2]. Accordingly, Ras is aberrantly activated in NF1-deficient tumors; however, it is unknown which effector pathways critically function in tumor development. Here we provide in vivo evidence that TORC1/mTOR activity is essential for tumorigenesis. Specifically, we show that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potently suppresses the growth of aggressive NF1-associated malignancies in a genetically engineered murine model. However, in these tumors rapamycin does not function via mechanisms generally assumed to mediate tumor suppression, including inhibition of HIF-1alpha and indirect suppression of AKT, but does suppress the mTOR target Cyclin D1 [3]. These results demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors may be an effective targeted therapy for this commonly untreatable malignancy. Moreover, they indicate that mTOR inhibitors do not suppress all tumor types via the same mechanism, suggesting that current biomarkers that rely on HIF-1alpha suppression may not be informative for all cancers. Finally, our results reveal important differences between the effects of mTOR inhibition on the microvasculature in genetically engineered versus xenograft models and indicate that the former may be required for effective preclinical screening with this class of inhibitors.",M2

MLPA results were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation. MLPA screening followed by real-time qPCR detected a total of 23 deletions. Of these deletions, six were single exon, eight were multi-exon, and nine were of the entire NF1 gene.

Mutation analysis of NF1 is complicated by its large size, the lack of mutation hotspots, pseudogenes and frequent de novo mutations. Additionally, the search for NF1 mutations on the mRNA level is often hampered by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of the mutant allele. In this study we searched for mutations in a cohort of 38 patients and investigated the relationship between mutation type and allele-specific transcription from the wild-type versus mutant alleles. Quantification of relative mRNA transcript numbers was done by Pyrosequencing, a novel real-time sequencing method whose signals can be quantified very accurately. We identified 21 novel mutations comprising various mutation types. Pyrosequencing detected a definite relationship between allelic NF1 transcript imbalance due to NMD and mutation type in 24 of 29 patients who all carried frame-shift or nonsense mutations. NMD was absent in 5 patients with missense and silent mutations, as well as in 4 patients with splice-site mutations that did not disrupt the reading frame. Pyrosequencing was capable of detecting NMD even when the effects were only moderate. Diagnostic laboratories could thus exploit this effect for rapid prescreening for NF1 mutations as more than 60% of the mutations in this gene disrupt the reading frame and are prone to NMD.",M2

Several independent reports have shown that individuals constitutionally homozygous for MMR allelic variants develop early onset hematological malignancies often associated to features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome. The genetic mechanism of NF1 associated to MMR gene deficiency is not fully known. We report here that a child with this form of NF1 displays a heterozygous NF1 gene mutation (c.3721C&gt;T), in addition to a homozygous MLH1 gene mutation (c.676C&gt;T) leading to a truncated MLH1 protein (p.R226X). The parents did not display NF1 features nor the NF1 mutation. This new NF1 gene mutation is recurrent and predicts a truncated neurofibromin (p.R1241X) lacking its GTPase activating function, as well as all C-terminally located functional domains. Our findings suggest that NF1 disease observed in individuals homozygous for deleterious MMR variants may be due to a concomitant NF1 gene mutation. The presence of both homozygous MLH1 and heterozygous NF1 mutation in the child studied here also provides a mechanistic explanation for early onset malignancies that are observed in affected individuals.

The molecular basis for this unique pattern of gliomagenesis is unknown. Previous studies in mouse Nf1 optic glioma models suggest that this patterning results from cooperative effects of Nf1 loss in glial cells and the action of factors derived from the surrounding Nf1+/- brain. Because CXCL12 is a stroma-derived growth factor for malignant brain tumors, we tested the hypothesis that CXCL12 functions in concert with Nf1 loss to facilitate NF1-associated glioma growth. Whereas CXCL12 promoted cell death in wild-type astrocytes, it increased Nf1-/- astrocyte survival. This increase in Nf1-/- astrocyte survival in response to CXCL12 was due to sustained suppression of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Moreover, the ability of CXCL12 to suppress cAMP and increase Nf1-/- astrocyte survival was a consequence of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-dependent inhibition of CXCL12 receptor (CXCR4) desensitization. In support of an instructive role for CXCL12 in facilitating optic glioma growth, we also show that CXCL12 expression along the optic pathway is higher in infant children and young mice and is associated with low levels of cAMP. CXCL12 expression declines in multiple brain regions with increasing age, correlating with the age-dependent decline in glioma growth in children with NF1. Collectively, these studies provide a mechanism for the unique pattern of NF1-associated glioma growth.",M2

In most cases, the disease is caused either by mutation in the NF1 gene, or by a particular or complete deletion of the NF1 gene. The NF1 gene exhibits one of the highest mutation rates of any human disorder. In this experimental study of the NF1 gene, we screened the mutational spectrum of 22 unrelated patients from the Czech Republic using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) methods.

We have previously developed a locus-specific DNA microarray for detection of copy number changes at the NF1 locus by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis. The original array contains 183 probes pooled from 444 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. In the current work, we have used 493 probes derived from single PCR products (200--998 bp in size) to construct a higher resolution array with a smaller average probe size for molecular diagnosis of NF1. This has improved the average resolution from 12.6 kb in the previous array to 4.5 kb in the current version. The performance of the newly constructed microarray was validated with 14 well-characterized NF1 mutations for CGH analysis. These mutations represent deletions from approximately 7 kb to over 2 Mb in size. Using this array, we examined a total of 55 NF1 patients for copy number changes at the NF1 locus, detecting deletions in four of them. These results demonstrate that a locus-specific microarray constructed from single PCR products can efficiently detect copy number changes at the NF1 locus, providing a simple method for the molecular diagnosis of NF1.",M2

Complicating factors include the large size of the NF1 gene, the presence of several NF1 pseudogenes, the complex interactions between cell types, and the NF1-haploinsufficient state of all cells in the body. Here, we investigate three patients with distinct NF1-associated clinical manifestations (neurofibromas only, pigmentary changes only, and association of both symptoms). For each patient, various tissues and cell types were tested with comprehensive and quantitative assays capable of detecting low-percentage NF1 mutations. This approach confirmed the biallelic NF1 inactivation in Schwann cells in neurofibromas and, for the first time, demonstrated biallelic NF1 inactivation in melanocytes in NF1-related cafe-au-lait macules. Interestingly, both disease features arise even within a background of predominantly NF1 wild-type cells. Together, the data provide molecular evidence that (1) the distinct clinical picture of the patients is due to mosaicism for the NF1 mutation and (2) the mosaic phenotype reflects the embryonic timing and, accordingly, the neural crest-derived cell type involved in the somatic NF1 mutation. The study of the affected cell types provides important insight into developmental concepts underlying particular NF1-related disease features and opens avenues for improved diagnosis and genetic counseling of individuals with mosaic NF1.",M2

Double inactivation of the NF1 gene has been reported to be the pathogenesis of CPT in NF1 cases. METHODS: We analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the NF1 gene in cases of CPT with NF1 to examine whether double inactivation was seen in the case. In addition to morphological analysis, immunoexpression of differentiation markers was examined. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The tibia tapered with the zone phenomenon from mature to immature bone with osteoblastic rimming, resembling osteofibrous dysplasia. Osteosclerotic bowed bone with a small number of osteoclasts suggested dysfunction of bone remodeling. Fibrous tissue at the site of pseudarthrosis was associated with the periosteum and demonstrated myofibroblastic differentiation accompanied by massive cartilage formation, suggesting some misdirection during the differentiation of periosteum to myofibroblasts or chondrocytes. LOH of the NF1 gene locus was not seen in fibrous tissue. This result suggests that CPT is not accompanied by double inactivation in every NF1 case.",M2

17597122,"A mouse embryonic stem cell model of Schwann cell differentiation for studies of the role of <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 in Schwann cell development and tumor formation.The neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene functions as a tumor suppressor gene. One known function of neurofibromin, the NF1 protein product, is to accelerate the slow intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras to increase the production of inactive rasGDP, with wide-ranging effects on p21ras pathways. Loss of neurofibromin in the autosomal dominant disorder NF1 is associated with tumors of the peripheral nervous system, particularly neurofibromas, benign lesions in which the major affected cell type is the Schwann cell (SC). NF1 is the most common cancer predisposition syndrome affecting the nervous system. We have developed an in vitro system for differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) that are NF1 wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), or null (-/-) into SC-like cells to study the role of NF1 in SC development and tumor formation. These mES-generated SC-like cells, regardless of their NF1 status, express SC markers correlated with their stage of maturation, including myelin proteins. They also support and preferentially direct neurite outgrowth from primary neurons. NF1 null and heterozygous SC-like cells proliferate at an accelerated rate compared to NF1 wild type; this growth advantage can be reverted to wild type levels using an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (Mek). The mESC of all NF1 types can also be differentiated into neuron-like cells. This novel model system provides an ideal paradigm for studies of the role of NF1 in cell growth and differentiation of the different cell types affected by NF1 in cells with differing levels of neurofibromin that are neither transformed nor malignant.",M2
17573495,"Is pulmonary arterial hypertension in <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 secondary to a plexogenic arteriopathy?BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common disorder of dysregulated tissue growth secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with NF1 is hypothesized to be secondary to an underlying vasculopathy. METHODS: We describe the entity we term NF1-associated PAH (NF1-PAH) in four new patients and update the data on four previously published reports of patients with PAH and NF1. We performed genetic testing of the bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene, which mutated in 70% of patients with familial PAH and approximately 25% of patients with idiopathic PAH. We report, for the first time, pathologic findings in the autopsy-obtained lung of one patient with NF1-PAH. RESULTS: Patients with NF1-PAH have a generally poor long-term prognosis. In four patients, we observed the mosaic pattern of lung attenuation on a CT scan of the chest, a radiographic finding that can be consistent with an underlying vasculopathy. No mutations or rearrangements in the BMPR2 gene were found. We observed complex plexiform lesions in the one available autopsy specimen. Similar lesions are a hallmark of plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy and are associated with several severe types of PAH. (Plexiform lesions should not be confused with plexiform neurofibromas, which are distinctive tumors seen in NF1.) CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NF1 should be considered as being  associated with PAH as outlined in the Revised Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension. Understanding the mechanism of PAH in NF1 may inform the pathogenesis of PAH, NF1-PAH itself, and other NF1-associated vasculopathies. The pulmonary vasculature should now be included among the arterial beds affected by NF1 vasculopathy.",M2
17564507,"Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in discordant monozygotic twins with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most frequent neurocutaneous disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Phenotype variability is high ranging from merely several café-au-lait spots to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors or severe disfigurement through plexiform neurofibromas. Identification of genetic factors that modify the NF1 phenotype would contribute to the understanding of NF1 pathophysiology and improve patient counselling. As even monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 may differ phenotypically, we wondered whether these variations might be inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited extrachromosomally through the cytoplasm of the oocyte and often harbours heteroplasmic sequence variations. At the time of blastomere separation, these variants may be skewedly distributed and effect phenotypic differences. Because of their co-localization with the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, which is mutated in NF1, mitochondria were particular attractive candidates for investigation. MtDNA was extracted from nucleated blood cells of four pairs of discordant MZ twins with NF1 and from cutaneous neurofibromas of one twin pair. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome and determined the state of heteroplasmy by investigating a microsatellite region of the mitochondrial D-loop (D310-tract). The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by detection of pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene. Monozygosity was verified by genotyping. However, we did not detect evidence for mtDNA sequence differences or for different degrees of heteroplasmy between individuals of the same twin pair. The phenotypic discordance of MZ twins with NF1 cannot be explained by skewed distribution of mtDNA mutations or polymorphisms.",M2

This is particularly critical for prenatal genetic testing of sporadic cases. Here we describe the use of loss of heterozygosity information in neurofibromas to obtain linkage information on the affected NF1 haplotype, which may be applied for prenatal testing in sporadic patients.

17311297,"Extensive in silico analysis of NF1 splicing defects uncovers determinants for splicing outcome upon 5' splice-site disruption.We describe 94 pathogenic NF1 gene alterations in a cohort of 97 Austrian <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 patients meeting the NIH criteria. All mutations were fully characterized at the genomic and mRNA levels. Over half of the patients carried novel mutations, and only a quarter carried recurrent minor-lesion mutations at 16 mutational warm spots. The remaining patients carried NF1 microdeletions (7%) and rare recurring mutations. Thirty-six of the mutations (38%) altered pre-mRNA splicing, and fall into five groups: exon skipping resulting from mutations at authentic splice sites (type I), cryptic exon inclusion caused by deep intronic mutations (type II), creation of de novo splice sites causing loss of exonic sequences (type III), activation of cryptic splice sites upon authentic splice-site disruption (type IV), and exonic sequence alterations causing exon skipping (type V). Extensive in silico analyses of 37 NF1 exons and surrounding intronic sequences suggested that the availability of a cryptic splice site combined with a strong natural upstream 3' splice site (3'ss)is the main determinant of cryptic splice-site activation upon 5' splice-site disruption. Furthermore, the exonic sequences downstream of exonic cryptic 5' splice sites (5'ss) resemble intronic more than exonic sequences with respect to exonic splicing enhancer and silencer density, helping to distinguish between exonic cryptic and pseudo 5'ss. This study provides valuable predictors for the splicing pathway used upon 5'ss mutation, and underscores the importance of using RNA-based techniques, together with methods to identify microdeletions and intragenic copy-number changes, for effective and reliable NF1 mutation detection.",M2
17297459,"Tumor microenvironment and <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type I: connecting the GAPs.The human disease von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (Nf1) is one of the most common genetic disorders. It is caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS signaling. Dermal and plexiform neurofibromas as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and other malignant tumors, are significant complications in Nf1. Neurofibromas are complex tumors and composed mainly of abnormal local cells including Schwann cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and additionally a large number of infiltrating inflammatory mast cells. Recent work has indicated a role for the microenvironment in plexiform neurofibroma genesis. The emerging evidence points to mast cells as crucial contributors to neurofibroma tumorigenesis. Therefore, further understanding of the molecular interactions between Schwann cells and their environment will provide tools to develop new therapies aimed at delaying or preventing tumor formation in Nf1 patients.",M2
17295913,"Functional analysis of splicing mutations in exon 7 of NF1 gene.BACKGROUND: <e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders, affecting about 1:3,500 individuals. NF1 exon 7 displays weakly defined exon-intron boundaries, and is particularly prone to missplicing. METHODS: In this study we investigated the expression of exon 7 transcripts using bioinformatic identification of splicing regulatory sequences, and functional minigene analysis of four sequence changes [c.910C&gt;T (R304X), c.945G&gt;A/c.946C&gt;A (Q315Q/L316M), c.1005T&gt;C (N335N)] identified in exon 7 of three different NF1 patients. RESULTS: Our results detected the presence of three exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and one putative exonic splicing silencer (ESS) element. The wild type minigene assay resulted in three alternative isoforms, including a transcript lacking NF1 exon 7 (NF1DeltaE7). Both the wild type and the mutated constructs shared NF1DeltaE7 in addition to the complete messenger, but displayed a different ratio between the two transcripts. In the presence of R304X and Q315Q/L316M mutations, the relative proportion between the different isoforms is shifted toward the expression of NF1DeltaE7, while in the presence of N335N variant, the NF1DeltaE7 expression is abolished. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it appears mandatory to investigate the role of each nucleotide change within the NF1 coding sequence, since a significant proportion of NF1 exon 7 mutations affects pre-mRNA splicing, by disrupting exonic splicing motifs and modifying the delicate balance between aberrantly and correctly spliced transcripts.",M2

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumours that commonly harbour oncogenic mutations in KIT or PDGFRA and are thought to arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC; the pacemaker cells of the gut). AIM: To characterise two patients with NF1 and GISTs. METHODS: Two patients were genotyped for germline mutations in NF1. GISTs from both patients were genotyped for somatic mutations in KIT and PDGFRA. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of NF1 in one GIST was assessed by genotyping seven microsatellite markers spanning 2.39 Mb of the NF1 locus in the tumour and in genomic DNA. The known germline mutation in NF1 was confirmed in GIST DNA by sequencing. The copy number of the mutated NF1 allele was determined by multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: GISTs from both patients were of wild type for mutations in KIT and PDGFRA. In the GIST with adequate DNA, all seven markers were informative and showed LOH at the NF1 locus; sequencing of NF1 from that GIST showed no wild-type sequence, suggesting that it was lost in the tumour. Multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification analysis showed that two copies of all NF1 exons were present. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of mitotic recombination resulting in a reduction to homozygosity of a germline NF1 mutation in an NF1-associated GIST. We hypothesise that the LOH of NF1 and lack of KIT and PDGFRA mutations are evidence of an alternative pathogenesis in NF1-associated GISTs.",M2
17208258,"A mild mutator phenotype arises in a mouse model for malignancies associated with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1.Defects in genes that control DNA repair, proliferation, and apoptosis can increase genomic instability, and thus promote malignant progression. Although most tumors that arise in humans with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are benign, these individuals are at increased risk for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). To characterize additional mutations required for the development of MPNST from benign plexiform neurofibromas, we generated a mouse model for these tumors by combining targeted null mutations in Nf1 and p53, in cis. CisNf1+/-; p53+/- mice spontaneously develop PNST, and these tumors exhibit loss-of-heterozygosity at both the Nf1 and p53 loci. Because p53 has well-characterized roles in the DNA damage response, DNA repair, and apoptosis, and because DNA repair genes have been proposed to act as modifiers in NF1, we used the cisNf1+/-; p53+/- mice to determine whether a mutator phenotype arises in NF1-associated malignancies. To quantitate spontaneous mutant frequencies (MF), we crossed the Big Blue mouse, which harbors a lacI transgene, to the cisNf1+/-; p53+/- mice, and isolated genomic DNA from both tumor and normal tissues in compound heterozygotes and wild-type siblings. Many of the PNST exhibited increased mutant frequencies (MF=4.70) when compared to normal peripheral nerve and brain (MF=2.09); mutations occurred throughout the entire lacI gene, and included base substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Moreover, the brains, spleens, and livers of these cisNf1+/-; p53+/- animals exhibited increased mutant frequencies when compared to tissues from wild-type littermates. We conclude that a mild mutator phenotype arises in the tumors and tissues of cisNf1+/-; p53+/- mice, and propose that genomic instability influences NF1 tumor progression and disease severity.",M2

The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades. Only recently, there is increasing evidence for WS and NFNS being allelic to NF1 in the majority of patients. In this study we describe seven novel patients from five unrelated families with variable phenotypes of the NF1-NS spectrum which were systematically analyzed for mutations in the disease-causing genes NF1 for NF1 and PTPN11 for NS. Heterozygous mutations or deletions of NF1 were identified in all patients, while no PTPN11 mutation was found. The NF1 mutation segregated with the phenotype in both familial cases. These results support the hypothesis that variable phenotypes of the NF1-NS spectrum represent variants of NF1 in the majority of cases. Constitutive deregulation of the Ras pathway either through activating mutations of PTPN11 or through haploinsufficiency of neurofibromin, which acts as a Ras-inactivating GTP-ase, is probably the common pathogenetic mechanism explaining the phenotypic overlap of NS and NF1.",M2

We assessed the ability of FTS to reverse the transformed phenotype of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumor cell lines of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: nf1 mutations were genotyped, allelic losses were analyzed, and neurofibromin expression levels were determined in MPNST cell lines ST88-14, S265P21, and 90-8. The effects of FTS on GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP) and its prominent downstream targets, as well as on cell morphology, anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth, and tumor growth in mice, were assessed. RESULTS: The MPNST cell lines were biallelic, NF1 inactive, and neurofibromin deficient. We show that FTS treatment shortened the relatively long duration of Ras activation and signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Akt, and RalA in all NF1-deficient MPNST cell lines (NF1 cells) to that observed in a non-NF1, normally expressing neurofibromin MPNST cell line. These effects of FTS led to lower steady-state levels of Ras-GTP and its activated targets. Both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of NF1 cells were dose dependently inhibited by FTS, and the inhibition correlated positively with Ras-GTP levels. NF1 cells were found to possess strong actin stress fibers, and this phenotype was also corrected by FTS. NF1 tumor growth in a nude mouse model was inhibited by oral FTS. CONCLUSIONS: FTS treatment of NF1 cells normalized Ras-GTP levels, resulting in reversal of the transformed phenotype and inhibition of tumor growth. FTS may therefore be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of NF1.",M2

Gastric carcinoid tumours are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia but have not been reported in NF1 in the absence of other predisposing factors. We report the occurrence and investigation of a gastric carcinoid tumour in a 23-year-old woman with previously uncomplicated NF1. Analysis of the tumour tissue revealed loss of heterozygosity at the NF1 gene locus but a normal karyotype and an absence of microsatellite instability. A germline NF1 gene nonsense mutation in exon 37 was detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequence analysis. This is the first reported occurrence of a gastric carcinoid tumour in a patient with NF1 in the absence of other predisposing factors such as pernicious anaemia. The analyses indicate that the carcinoid arose through NF1 gene inactivation but in the absence of an inherited NF1 gene microdeletion.

16861979,"Pancreatic endocrine tumors are a rare manifestation of the <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 phenotype: molecular analysis of a malignant insulinoma in a NF-1 patient.The tumorigenesis of sporadic endocrine tumors is still not fully understood. It is well known that patients with von Recklinghausen syndrome (NF-1) (OMIM 162200) carrying NF1 germline mutations are predisposed to endocrine tumors including pheochromocytomas and duodenal somatostatinomas. It is unclear, however, whether the rarely reported occurrence of pancreatic insulinomas in NF-1 patients represents a coincidental finding or whether insulinomas are a rare manifestation of the NF-1 syndrome. To determine the potential association between the NF-1 syndrome and pancreatic endocrine tumors, we analyzed a NF-1 patient with a well-differentiated pancreatic endocrine carcinoma for NF1 mutation, allelic loss of the NF1 gene and its expression in peripheral blood and tumor cells. The germline mutation c. 499 del TGTT known in the family was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of exon 4 in DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the NF1 gene was carried out using 3 intragenic microsatellite markers on 17q11.2. RNA expression was examined by reverse transcription and a consecutive PCR spanning intron 3 of the NF1 gene including the mutated site in exon 4. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze NF-1 protein expression. Mutation analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes confirmed the 4 base pair deletion in exon 4 starting at codon 167 (499 del TGTT). LOH analysis of tumor tissue revealed retention of both NF1 alleles. While reverse transcriptase-PCR of peripheral blood showed bi-allelic expression of both the wild-type NF1 and the mutated form, reverse transcriptase-PCR of tumor extracts demonstrated expression of the mutated but not the wild-type NF1 allele. Additionally, neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product, was absent in the tumor tissue of the NF-1 patient. These results show that the wild-type NF1 transcrips and protein are reduced, in the reported insulinoma, supposedly by epigenetic mechanisms. This provides strong evidence that there is a relationship between von Recklinghausen disease and the patient's insulinoma. In this line, insulinomas may be viewed as a rare manifestation of the NF-1 syndrome. Furthermore, the NF1 gene must be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for sporadic insulinomas and probably other pancreatic endocrine tumors.",M2

In the present study, we have used a combination of techniques (heteroduplex analysis, sequencing, loss of heterozygosity and quantification of gene dosage) to define the genetic defect in 68 individuals from a cohort of 107 NF1 Taiwanese patients of Chinese origin. Fifty-eight were initially identified using heteroduplex analytical techniques and confirmed by sequence analysis. A further five were identified by direct sequence analysis alone. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Mis-sense, non-sense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations were identified across the entire gene of which the majority (45/68) were novel in nature.

The limited success of these strategies has fueled researchers to further elucidate the molecular changes that drive tumor formation and progression.

In a childless couple referred to PGD, the male carried a de-novo mutation, precluding the possibility of typing relatives to establish the mutation-associated haplotype. We developed a single-sperm haplotype analysis strategy to establish the haplotype linked to the NF1 mutation. METHODS: Spermatozoa from freshly ejaculated semen were used as a substrate for multiplex PCR on single sperm. RESULTS: In addition to the NF1 mutation, six informative polymorphic markers flanking the NF1 gene (D17S1294, D17S1849, D17S841, D17S975, NF1TG2 and NF1AC5) were linked to individual alleles in single sperm from the affected male. CONCLUSIONS: Single-sperm analysis established the haplotypes of both mutant and wild-type NF1 alleles and enabled the implementation of a PGD protocol using polymorphic marker analysis. This method is generally applicable to PGD for any disease in which the haplotype of paternal mutations cannot be determined by typing relatives.",M2
16583938,"[<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis): from phenotype to gene]Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of about 1/3000. The clinical diagnosis of NF1 is based on the presence of two or more of the following criteria: six or more café au lait spots, &gt;2 neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal region, optic glioma, a distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis, and a first degree relative with NF1. The disease has numerous complications. The pathogenesis is not clarified. The NF1 gene is a megagene (length of app. 350 kilobases of genomic DNA), localised on the long arm of the 17th chromosome at the position 17q11.2. The mutation rate for NF1-gene is high. The half of all cases of NF1 are from new mutations. The gene protein product - neurofibromin plays an important role in the tumorogenesis as a tumor-suppressor gene. Molecular genetic evaluation for the identification of disease-causing mutations is possible in cca 20% patients. The patient care is best done in specialised neurofibromatosis centers.",M2
16542390,"Clinical and molecular aspects of an informative family with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 and Noonan phenotype.Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) has been described as a unique phenotype, combining manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome, which are separate syndromes. Potential etiologies of NFNS include a discrete syndrome of distinct etiology, co-segregation of two mutated common genes, variable clinical expressivity of NF1, and/or allelic heterogeneity. We present an informative family with an unusual NF1 mutation with variable features of NF1 and Noonan syndrome. We hypothesize that an NF1 mutant allele can lead to diagnostic manifestations of Noonan syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that NF1 allelic heterogeneity causes NFNS.",M2
16525748,"<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 gene haploinsufficiency reduces AP-1 gene expression without abrogating the anabolic effect of parathyroid hormone.Approximately 50% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients exhibit skeletal pathology, such as premature osteoporosis or pseudoarthroses. Loss of neurofibromin deregulates Ras signal transduction to affect generation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, both of which have been implicated in parathyroid hormone (PTH) anabolic mechanisms. Our aim was to determine if loss of neurofibromin impaired the anabolic effect of PTH on bone mass. Nf1 heterozygote (Nf1(+/-)) and wild type (Nf1(+/+)) mice were treated with recombinant human PTH(1-34) or vehicle once daily for 3-28 days. PTH enhanced mRNA expression of c-fos, junB, and fra2 in the distal femur metaphyses of both genotypes; expression of these transcripts was consistently lower in PTH-treated Nf1(+/-) mice. Despite lowered c-fos expression in Nf1(+/-) mice, PTH increased bone mass equivalently in both genotypes by 28 days. Ex vivo, Nf1 heterozygosity was associated with increased inducible osteoclasts in PTH-treated bone marrow cells and impairment of the actin stress fiber and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response to PTH in osteoprogenitors. Lower c-fos expression was previously thought to abrogate PTH responsiveness. Our results suggest crosstalk might occur between Ras signal transduction and the protein kinase A pathway in Nf1(+/-) mice. Ras signal transduction does not appear to be essential for the anabolic actions of PTH on bone. Because PTH was effective in the absence of Nf1, it may offer a useful approach to treat osteoporosis in NF1 patients.",M2
16470740,"Functional splicing assay shows a pathogenic intronic mutation in <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (NF1) due to intronic sequence exonization.Genomic variations with no apparent effect ( neutral polymorphisms ) may have a significant effect on splicing. The effect of this type of mutation is difficult to spot, unless a functional assay is undertaken. In our study, DNA sequencing of a patient with clinically defined neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) showed only a single polymorphism in intron 30 due to an A&gt;G transition 279 nucleotides from the 3' splice site. Using a minigene splicing assay we conclusively show that this change produces a cryptic exon with a 3' SS defined by the nucleotide change and the unexpected activation of a very weak 5'SS. Further site directed mutagenesis studies aimed at identifying the signals involved in the cryptic exon inclusion were carried out. Interestingly we find that particular characteristics of the cryptic 5' SS are essential for its inclusion. Significantly an additional single nucleotide change disrupting the cryptic 5'ss consensus sequence rescues the effect of the pathogenetic mutation resulting in normal splicing.",M2
16397217,"An imprinted locus epistatically influences Nstr1 and Nstr2 to control resistance to nerve sheath tumors in a <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 mouse model.Cancer is a complex disease in which cells acquire many genetic and epigenetic alterations. We have examined how three types of alterations, mutations in tumor suppressor genes, changes in an imprinted locus, and polymorphic loci, interact to affect tumor susceptibility in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 and in oncogenes such as KRAS have major effects on tumorigenesis due to the central roles of these genes in cell proliferation and cell survival. Imprinted genes expressed from only one parental chromosome affect tumorigenesis if their monoallelic expression is lost or duplicated. Because imprinted loci are within regions deleted or amplified in cancer, the parental origin of genomic rearrangements could affect tumorigenesis. Gene polymorphisms can vary tumor incidence by affecting rate-limiting steps in tumorigenesis within tumor cells or surrounding stroma. In our mouse model of NF1, the incidence of tumors mutant for the tumor suppressor genes Nf1 and Trp53 is strongly modified by a linked imprinted locus acting epistatically on two unlinked polymorphic loci, Nstr1 and Nstr2. This interaction of an imprinted locus and polymorphic susceptibility loci has profound implications for human mapping studies where the parental contribution of alleles is often unknown.",M2
16385324,"Molecular, genetic, and cellular pathogenesis of neurofibromas and surgical implications.<e>Neurofibromatosis</e> 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by complex and multicellular neurofibroma tumors. Significant advances have been made in the research of the cellular, genetic, and molecular biology of NF1. The NF1 gene was identified by positional cloning. The functions of its protein product, neurofibromin, in RAS signaling and in other signal transduction pathways are being elucidated, and the important roles of loss of heterozygosity and haploinsufficiency in tumorigenesis are better understood. The Schwann cell was discovered to be the cell of origin for neurofibromas, but understanding of a more complicated interplay of multiple cell types in tumorigenesis, specifically recruited heterogeneous cell types such as mast cells and fibroblasts, has important implications for surgical therapy of these tumors. This review summarizes the most recent NF1 and neurofibroma literature describing the pathogenesis and treatment of nerve sheath tumors. Understanding the biological underpinnings of tumorigenesis in NF1 has implications for future surgical and medical management of neurofibromas.",M2
16380919,"NF1 gene mutations represent the major molecular event underlying <e>neurofibromatosis</e>-Noonan syndrome.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) demonstrates phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (NS) in some patients, which results in the so-called neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). From a genetic point of view, NFNS is a poorly understood condition, and controversy remains as to whether it represents a variable manifestation of either NF1 or NS or is a distinct clinical entity. To answer this question, we screened a cohort with clinically well-characterized NFNS for mutations in the entire coding sequence of the NF1 and PTPN11 genes. Heterozygous NF1 defects were identified in 16 of the 17 unrelated subjects included in the study, which provides evidence that mutations in NF1 represent the major molecular event underlying this condition. Lesions included nonsense mutations, out-of-frame deletions, missense changes, small inframe deletions, and one large multiexon deletion. Remarkably, a high prevalence of inframe defects affecting exons 24 and 25, which encode a portion of the GAP-related domain of the protein, was observed. On the other hand, no defect in PTPN11 was observed, and no lesion affecting exons 11-27 of the NF1 gene was identified in 100 PTPN11 mutation-negative subjects with NS, which provides further evidence that NFNS and NS are genetically distinct disorders. These results support the view that NFNS represents a variant of NF1 and is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene, some of which have been demonstrated to cause classic NF1 in other individuals.",M2

Laboratory studies performed 5 years prior showed no evidence of abnormal renal function. Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I. Mutations on chromosomes 1, 11, and 19 have been reported to result in genetic forms of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. This is the first case report of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis occurring in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I.",M2
16442014,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: an update.Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly malignant cancers that account for approximately 5-10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. They occur either sporadically, in association with <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 (NF1), or subsequent to radiation therapy. Histologically, MPNSTs resemble fibrosarcomas in their basic organization. Immunohistochemistry, particularly S100, plays an important role in the diagnosis. At the molecular level, loss of the NF1 gene and high levels of Ras-activity are hallmarks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most helpful imaging technique to clearly identify tumoral extent and to suggest neurogenic origin. The presence of heterogeneity with evidence of necrosis and hemorrhage on MRI and increased uptake on positron emission tomography scan may prove helpful in detecting malignant changes. MPNSTs need to be approached by a multidisciplinary team, assuring the complete surgical removal of the lesion. Disease-free and overall survival statistics reinforce the aggressive nature of this unique soft tissue tumor.",M2
16434322,"Two <e>neurofibromatosis</e> type 1 cases associated with rhabdomyosarcoma of bladder, one with a large deletion in the NF1 gene.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common neurogenetic disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide. Mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene predispose individuals to a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an uncommon malignant soft tissue sarcoma and is also a rare tumor type in NF1 patients. We report two cases of NF1 with RMS. The first is that of an infant with overlapping phenotypic features of NF1 and Noonan syndrome (NS) who presented with RMS of the bladder. The second infant likewise exhibited NF1 features and was also associated with bladder RMS. DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples. We performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the NF1 gene by using seven intragenic markers (IVS27AAAT2.1, IVS27EVI-20, IVS27AC24.8, IVS27AC28.4, M98509, IVS27AC33.1, IVS38TG53.0) and one extragenic polymorphic marker (3'NF1).
