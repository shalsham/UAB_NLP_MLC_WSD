20304765,"Programming of rat adrenal medulla by neonatal hyperleptinemia: adrenal morphology, catecholamine secretion, and leptin signaling pathway.Leptin serum concentration in early life is an important factor for adequate future development of the offspring. Previously, we demonstrated that hyperleptinemia on lactation programmed for hyperleptinemia, central leptin resistance with lower expression of the long form of leptin receptor at hypothalamus, and higher <e>medullary</e> catecholamine levels with cardiovascular consequences at adulthood. The central objective of this study was to determine the direct effect of leptin on adrenal medullary function of adult rats that were leptin treated during lactation. Adrenal morphology was also accessed. Recombinant murine leptin was injected in the pups during the first 10 days of life (group L, leptin-programmed) or at adulthood during 6 days (group LC). The controls of both experiments received saline (groups C and CC). Both treatments resulted in hyperleptinemia at 150 days old (+78% and 2-fold increase, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Programmed animals showed hypertrophy of adrenal and higher adrenal catecholamine content at 150 days old (3-fold increase, P &lt; 0.05), and no changes were observed in the LC group. However, LC rats had lower adrenal content of tyrosine hydroxylase (-17%, P &lt; 0.05). Leptin-programmed rats had a lower response to leptin in vitro stimulation (-22%, P &lt; 0.05) and lower expression of key proteins of the leptin signaling pathway, leptin receptor and janus tyrosine kinase 2 in the medullas (-61% and -29%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). However, they presented higher expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (+2-fold, P &lt; 0.05). Leptin treatment at adulthood did not affect these parameters. The higher catecholamine synthesis and secretion in the leptin-programmed rats observed in our previous study does not seem to be a consequence of the direct effect of leptin on the medullas. We suggest that the hyperleptinemia of the programmed animals increases adrenal medullary function through sympathetic nervous system activation. In conclusion, high leptin levels on lactation program the activity of the sympathoadrenal system at adulthood that may contribute to the development of adult chronic diseases such as hypertension.",M1
20121251,"Phenylpropanoyl esters from Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) and their inhibitory effects on catecholamine secretion.Three unique phenylpropanoyl 2,7-anhydro-3-deoxy-2-octulosonic acid derivatives were isolated from Conyza canadensis (horseweed). Their structures were defined as rel-(1S,2R,3R,5S,7R)-methyl 7-caffeoyloxymethyl-2-hydroxy-3-feruloyloxy-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-5-carboxylate (1), rel-(1S,2R,3R,5S,7R)-methyl 7-feruloyloxymethyl-2-hydroxy-3-feruloyloxy-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-5-carboxylate (2), and rel-(1R,2R,3R,5S,7R)-methyl 7-feruloyloxymethyl-2-feruloyloxy-3-hydroxy-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-5-carboxylate (3). Compound 1 and a 5:3 mixture of compounds 2 and 3 were demonstrated to inhibit the catecholamine secretion induced by acetylcholine with IC(50) values of 94.65 and 42.35 microM, respectively, and to inhibit the catecholamine secretion induced by veratridine and high [K(+)] at a dose of 100 microM in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.",M1
20002295,"Characterization of Ca2+ signaling pathways in mouse adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells.In the present study, we characterized the Ca2+ responses and secretions induced by various secretagogues in mouse chromaffin cells. Activation of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) by carbachol induced a transient intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) increase followed by two phases of [Ca2+](i) decay and a burst of exocytic events. The contribution of the subtypes of AChRs to carbachol-induced responses was examined. Based on the results obtained by stimulating the cells with the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide, high K(+) and the effects of thapsigargin, it appears that activation of nAChRs induces an extracellular Ca2+ influx, which in turn activate Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release via the ryanodine receptors. Muscarine, a muscarinic receptor (mAChRs) agonist, was found to induce [Ca2+](i) oscillation and sustained catecholamine release, possibly by activation of both the receptor- and store-operated Ca2+ entry pathways. The RT-PCR results showed that mouse chromaffin cells are equipped with messages for multiple subtypes of AChRs, ryanodine receptors and all known components of the receptor- and store-operated Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, results obtained by directly monitoring endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and by disabling mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake suggest that the ER acts as a Ca2+ source, while the mitochondria acts as a Ca2+ sink. Our results show that both nAChRs and mAChRs contribute to the initial carbachol-induced [Ca2+](i) increase which is further enhanced by the Ca2+ released from the ER mediated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and mAChR activation. This information on the Ca2+ signaling pathways should lay a good foundation for future studies using mouse chromaffin cells as a model system.",M1

19845618,"Intermittent hypoxia-mediated plasticity of acute O2 sensing requires altered red-ox regulation by HIF-1 and HIF-2.This article provides a brief review of recent studies addressing the effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) on acute O2 sensing in carotid bodies (CBs) and adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells (AMCs) and the underlying mechanisms. Chronic IH upregulates hypoxic sensing ability of CBs and AMCs in adults and neonates. The effects of IH were reversible in adult rats, whereas that of neonatal IH persist into adult life. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate IH-induced changes in O2 sensing. Differential regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and 2) contribute to IH-evoked oxidative stress. HIF-1 activation by IH appears to be linked to increased pro-oxidant(s), whereas downregulation of HIF-2 by IH is coupled to transcriptional downregulation of antioxidant enzyme(s). Thus, the studies with chronic IH suggest novel, hitherto uncharacterized, roles for HIF-1 and HIF-2 in regulating red-ox status leading to plasticity of O2 sensing in CBs and AMCs.",M1
19549564,"Dual effects of lipophilic extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) on catecholamine secretion in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) is a well known traditional Chinese herb, which has been used widely in China for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in clinic. AIM OF THIS STUDY: The aim of the present study is to clarify the effects of lipophilic extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (LESM) on catecholamine (CA) secretion, a traditional Chinese medicine used widely for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LESM was evaluated for its effects on CA secretion using HPLC-ECD method. The effects of LESM on 22Na+ influx and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) were also investigated. RESULTS: Our results showed that LEMS directly stimulated basal CA secretion in an extracellular Ca2+-dependent manner. And the stimulation was not affected by combination of hexamethonium (Hex),an inhibitor of nAChR. LESM also directly elevated [Ca2+]i. In addition, using selective blockers of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, such as nitrendipine (for L-type), omega-agatoxin-IVA (for P-type) and -conotoxin-GVIA (for N-type), it was found that nitrendipine suppressed the elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by LESM, but not omega-agatoxin-IVA or omega-conotoxin-GVIA. Compared with acetylcholine (ACh) only, however, combination of LESM with ACh inhibited the raise of CA secretion, 22Na+ influx and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, LESM also inhibited CA secretion induced by veratridine (Ver), and 56 mM K+ at concentrations similar to those for [Ca2+]i rise. One of the lipophilic active compounds, cryptotanshione (Cryp), also had the same effects on CA secretion with LESM. CONCLUSIONS: All these findings suggest that LESM exerts dual effects on CA secretion in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. LESM exerts antagonistic effects on nAChR, voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels, whereas it is an agonist of L-type Ca2+ channel when it used alone.",M1
19508428,"PACAP regulates immediate catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells in an activity-dependent manner through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway.Adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells are a major peripheral output of the sympathetic nervous system. Catecholamine release from these cells is driven by synaptic excitation from the innervating splanchnic nerve. Acetylcholine has long been shown to be the primary transmitter at the splanchnic-chromaffin synapse, acting through ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to elicit action potential-dependent secretion from the chromaffin cells. This cholinergic stimulation has been shown to desensitize under sustained stimulation, yet catecholamine release persists under this same condition. Recent evidence supports synaptic chromaffin cell stimulation through alternate transmitters. One candidate is pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), a peptide transmitter present in the adrenal medulla shown to have an excitatory effect on chromaffin cell secretion. In this study we utilize native neuronal stimulation of adrenal chromaffin cells in situ and amperometric catecholamine detection to demonstrate that PACAP specifically elicits catecholamine release under elevated splanchnic firing. Further data reveal that the immediate PACAP-evoked stimulation involves a phospholipase C and protein kinase C-dependent pathway to facilitate calcium influx through a Ni2+ and mibefradil-sensitive calcium conductance that results in catecholamine release. These data demonstrate that PACAP acts as a primary secretagogue at the sympatho-adrenal synapse under the stress response.",M1
19503019,"Glucocorticoid treatment--effect on adrenal <e>medullary</e> catecholamine production.Glucocorticoid and epinephrine are important stress hormones secreted from the adrenal gland during critical illness. Adrenal glucocorticoid stimulates phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. Glucocorticoid is sometimes used in catecholamine-resistant septic shock in critically ill patients. By suppressing adrenal glucocorticoid production, glucocorticoid therapy might also reduce the secretion of epinephrine during stress. To investigate this, we used a mouse model subjected to glucocorticoid therapy under basal conditions (experiment 1) and during stress (experiment 2). In experiment 1, pellets containing 0% to 8% dexamethasone were implanted subcutaneously in mice for 4 weeks. In experiment 2, animals received 14 days of intraperitoneal injections of normal saline, low- or high-dose dexamethasone, followed by 2 h of restraint. We found that in experiment 1, adrenal corticosterone did not differ with dexamethasone treatment. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase messenger RNA levels and adrenal catecholamines were highest in the 8% dexamethasone group. Compared with experiment 1, restrained control mice in experiment 2 had high adrenal corticosterone, which decreased with dexamethasone. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase messenger RNA content doubled with restraint but decreased with dexamethasone treatment. As in experiment 1, adrenal catecholamine content increased significantly with dexamethasone treatment. We conclude that without stress, when adrenocorticotropic hormone is low, high doses of exogenous dexamethasone stimulate PNMT and catecholamine synthesis, likely independently of adrenal corticosterone concentration. After stress, adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are elevated, and exogenous dexamethasone suppresses endogenous corticosterone and PNMT production. Nonetheless, catecholamines increase, possibly due to direct neural stimulation, which may override the hormonal regulation of epinephrine synthesis during stress.",M1
19207826,"Interferon-alpha signalling in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells: involvement of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 and serine 31 phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase.Adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells are an integral part of the neuroendocrine system, playing an important role in the physiological adaptation to stress. In response to a wide variety of stimuli, including acetylcholine released from the splanchnic nerve, hormones such as angiotensin II or paracrine signals such as prostaglandins, chromaffin cells synthesise and secrete catecholamines and a number of biologically active peptides. This adrenal medullary output mediates a complex and diverse stress response. We report that chromaffin cells also respond both acutely and chronically to interferon (IFN)-alpha, thus providing a mechanism of interaction between the immune system and the stress response. Incubation of isolated bovine chromaffin cells maintained in culture, with IFN-alpha resulted in a rapid, transient activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2, which was maximal after 5 min. IFN-alpha mediated activation of ERK1/2 appeared to be responsible for the increased phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. This tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation was exclusively on serine 31, with no change in the phosphorylation of serine 19 or 40. This increase in the serine 31 phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase was prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C or ERK1/2 activation. Incubation with IFN-alpha also resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STAT)1 and 2. This response was maximal after approximately 60 min. Prolonged treatment with IFN-alpha (12-48 h) resulted in increased expression of STAT1 and, to a lesser extent, STAT2. Thus, these findings demonstrate that adrenal medullary chromaffin cells are responsive to IFN-alpha and provide a possible cellular mechanism by which this immune-derived signal can potentially influence and integrate with the stress response.",M1
19176761,"Ca2+ pathway involved in the refilling of store sites in rat adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.It has been suggested that store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOC) facilitates catecholamine secretion and synthesis in bovine adrenal medullary (AM) cells. However, there has been no experimental result clearly showing that cation channel activity is enhanced by store Ca(2+) depletion. Thus the present experiments were undertaken to address the issue of whether rat AM cells have SOC channels. Inhibition of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) (SERCA) pump resulted in a sustained increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in rat AM cells. This increase was completely suppressed by 2 mM Ni(2+) but not by 100 muM D600. A bath application of Ni(2+), but not D600, produced an outward current at -60 mV in rat AM cells, whereas exposure to a SERCA pump inhibitor did not affect either the whole cell current level or the Ni(2+)-induced outward current. The refilling of intracellular store sites was suppressed by the addition of Ni(2+) to the perfusate. RT-PCR revealed that transcripts for transient receptor potential channels 1 (TRPC1) and 5 (TRPC5) were present in rat adrenal medullas. Immunocytochemistry showed that TRPC1 channels, which have been implicated in SOC in certain types of cells, were mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and not in the plasma membrane, and that STIM1, a Ca(2+) sensor in the ER, was not expressed in rat AM cells. On the basis of these results, we conclude that rat AM cells lack the SOC mechanism.",M1
19048804,"[A new approach to the identification and the interpretation of the various forms of cribra orbitalia]The so-called cribra orbitalia lesion was described for the first time in 1885 by H.

However for 40 years the whole paleopathologist community agreed to recognize that anaemia and generally deficiency in iron, food or infections were the causes of <e>medullary</e> hyperplasia which would be the alone responsible for the damage.

18979561,"Association of an oversized adrenal cortical adenoma with expression of pheochromocytoma-like neurosecretory features.Abnormal stimulation of adrenal function may be either direct, affecting similarly cortical and <e>medullary</e> secretion, or indirect affecting primarily the medulla. Indirect activation of clinically detectable adrenomedullary function may develop as a physical consequence of a non-functional adrenal tumor exerting pressure on the medulla by its size, location and direction of growth. Our case of an oversized and overweight adrenal tumor associated with expression of late-onset pheochromocytoma-like clinical symptoms may be explained by the physical indirect rather than the biological direct activation of adrenomedullary function like hyperplasia or cancer.",M1
18848819,"Sepsis, apoptosis and complement.Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a prominent feature in human and experimental sepsis, especially as it involves the lymphoid system with resulting immunoparalysis. In addition, sepsis is associated with strong activation of the complement system, resulting in generation of the powerful anaphylatoxin, C5a, as well as the upregulation of the C5a receptor (C5aR) in a variety of different organs. The consequences of C5a interactions with C5aR can be directly linked to apoptosis of thymocytes and adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in rodents, as well as with other accompanying complications of CLP: cardiac dysfunction, consumptive coagulopathy, organ dysfunction, and lethality. This communication reviews the evidence for the adverse roles of C5a and C5aR in the setting of experimental sepsis and linkages to the various complications of sepsis, especially apoptosis as well as the roles of the two C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2) in experimental sepsis.",M1
18840998,"Endopin serpin protease inhibitors localize with neuropeptides in secretory vesicles and neuroendocrine tissues.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The endopin serpin protease inhibitors have been identified by molecular studies as components of secretory vesicles that produce neuropeptides. Endopin 1 inhibits trypsin-like serine proteases, and endopin 2 inhibits cathepsin L that produces neuropeptides in secretory vesicles. To assess the secretory vesicle and neuroendocrine tissue distribution of these endopins, the goal of this study was to define specific antisera for each endopin isoform and to examine their localization with neuropeptides and in neuroendocrine tissues. METHODS: This study utilized methods consisting of Western blots, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy for evaluation of the localization of endopin protease inhibitors in neuroendocrine tissues. RESULTS: Immunoelectron microscopy with these selective antisera demonstrated the localization of endopins 1 and 2 within secretory vesicles of adrenal medulla (bovine). Cellular immunofluorescence confocal microscopy illustrated the high level of colocalization of endopins 1 and 2 with enkephalin and NPY neuropeptides that are present in secretory vesicles of adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells in primary culture. Tissue distribution studies (by Western blots) showed the expression of endopins 1 and 2 in bovine brain, pituitary, adrenal medulla, and other neuroendocrine tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate endopins 1 and 2 as endogenous protease inhibitors in neuropeptide-containing secretory vesicles and neuroendocrine tissues.",M1
18774499,"An uncommon type of adrenal incidentaloma: a case report of a schwannoma of the adrenal medulla with cytological, histological, and ultrastructural correlation.Benign nerve sheath tumors of the adrenal gland are an extremely uncommon cause of an incidentaloma. We report a case of a schwannoma of the adrenal medulla in an asymptomatic 51-year-old woman, which was discovered incidentally on a computed tomography scan after routine workup for her degenerative joint diseases of the lumbar spine. Because of the large size and unknown biologic nature of the tumor by clinical and radiographic studies alone, an adrenalectomy was performed. The gross specimen featured a well-circumscribed <e>medullary</e> based tumor with cystic degeneration. The diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor was based on classic histological findings, supported by S-100 positivity, and ultrastructurally by the finding of typical Schwann cells. The cytological diagnosis from the fine-needle aspiration biopsy material obtained at the time of gross examination was much more challenging on retrospective review. The aspirated material showed a round- to oval-cell predominant smear with occasional striking anisonucleosis, intranuclear inclusions (so-called ancient change), and pigment deposition. A review of the histogenesis and differential diagnosis of this common nerve sheath tumor in this unusual location is discussed.",M1
18755746,"Molecular mechanisms supporting a paracrine role of GABA in rat adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.GABA is known to produce membrane depolarization and secretion in adrenal medullary (AM) cells in various species. However, whether the GABAergic system is intrinsic or extrinsic or both in the adrenal medulla and the role that GABA plays are controversial. Therefore, these issues were addressed by combining a biochemical and functional analysis. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a GABA synthesizing enzyme, and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were expressed in rat AM cells at the mRNA and protein levels, and the adrenal medulla had no nerve fibre-like structures immunoreactive to an anti-GAD Ab. The double staining for VGAT and chromogranin A indicates that GABA was stored in chromaffin granules. The alpha1, alpha3, beta2/3, gamma2 and delta subunits of GABA(A) receptors were identified in AM cells at the mRNA and protein levels. Pharmacological properties of GABA-induced Cl(-) currents, immunoprecipitation experiments and immunocytochemistry indicated the expression of not only gamma2-, but also delta-containing GABA(A) receptors, which have higher affinities for GABA and neurosteroids. Expression of GATs, which are involved in the clearance of GABA at GABAergic synapses, were conspicuously suppressed in the adrenal medulla, compared with expression levels of GABA(A) receptors. Increases in Ca(2+) signal in AM cells evoked trans-synaptically by nerve stimulation were suppressed during the response to GABA, and this suppression was attributed to the shunt effect of the GABA-induced increase in conductance. Overall Ca(2+) responses to electrical stimulation and GABA in AM cells were larger or smaller than those to electrical stimulation alone, depending on the frequency of stimulation. The results indicate that GABA functions as a paracrine in rat AM cells and this function may be supported by the suppression of GAT expression and the expression of not only gamma2-, but also delta-GABA(A) receptors.",M1
18593956,"Simvastatin inhibits catecholamine secretion and synthesis induced by acetylcholine via blocking Na+ and Ca2+ influx in bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.Simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis and has beneficial effects in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we report the effects of simvastatin on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells used as a model of sympathetic neurons. Simvastatin inhibited catecholamine secretion induced by acetylcholine, an agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels; and by high K(+), an activator of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (IC(50) = 3.8, 7.8, and 6.1 microM, respectively). Simvastatin also suppressed acetylcholine-induced (22)Na(+) influx (IC(50) = 4.3 microM) and (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50) = 6.1 microM), veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx (IC(50) = 6.6 microM) and (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50) = 12 microM), and high K(+)-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50) = 11 microM). The reduction of catecholamine secretion caused by simvastatin was not overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine or by treatment with mevalonate, the first metabolite of HMG-CoA. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on histamine-induced secretion of catecholamines was observed in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), but not in a Ca(2+)-free medium, suggesting that simvastatin does not interfere with histamine receptors nonselectively. Simvastatin also suppressed acetylcholine-induced [(14)C]catecholamine synthesis from [(14)C]tyrosine as well as tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These findings suggest that simvastatin inhibits catecholamine secretion and synthesis induced by acetylcholine through suppression of Na(+) and Ca(2+) influx in the adrenal medulla and probably in the sympathetic neurons.",M1
18561911,"Choline, CDP-choline or phosphocholine increases plasma glucagon in rats: involvement of the peripheral autonomic nervous system.The present study was designed to test the effects of choline, cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) and phosphocholine on plasma glucagon concentrations in rats. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 200-600 micromol/kg of choline, CDP-choline or phosphocholine produced a dose-dependent increase in plasma glucagon and choline concentrations. Pretreatment with hexamethonium (15 mg/kg; i.p.), a peripherally-acting ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, entirely blocked the increases in plasma glucagon by 600 micromol/kg of choline, CDP-choline or phosphocholine. The increases in plasma glucagon by these choline compounds was reduced significantly (P&lt;0.01) by about 25% by pretreatment with atropine methylnitrate (2 mg/kg), a peripherally-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Blockade of central acetylcholine receptors did not alter the increase in plasma glucagon induced by i.p. choline (600 micromol/kg). While alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blockade or bilateral adrenalectomy attenuated the increase in plasma glucagon evoked by choline compounds, blockade of alpha(1)- or beta-adrenoceptors or chemical sympathectomy failed to alter this increase. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) choline (1.5 micromol) administration also increased plasma glucagon; the effect was blocked by central pretreatment with a neuronal type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (50 microg; i.c.v.) or the neuronal choline uptake inhibitor, hemicholinium-3 (20 microg; i.c.v.). These data show that choline, CDP-choline or phosphocholine increases plasma glucagon concentrations by increasing peripheral nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmissions. Central choline also increases plasma glucagon by augmenting central nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission by acting presynaptically. Stimulation of adrenal <e>medullary</e> catecholamine release and subsequent activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors are mainly involved in the increase in plasma glucagon induced by choline, CDP-choline or phosphocholine.",M1
18554317,"Inhibition of TASK1-like channels by muscarinic receptor stimulation in rat adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.The muscarinic receptor is known to be involved in the acetylcholine-induced secretion of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla (AM) cells of various mammals. The ionic mechanisms, however, have not been elucidated yet. Thus, we investigated the issue in acutely isolated rat AM cells with the perforated patch clamp method. Bath application of 30 muM muscarine induced depolarization with the consequent generation of action potentials or an inward current at negative membrane potentials. The muscarine-sensitive current instantaneously changed in amplitude upon application of command pulses without a time-dependent component, altered the polarity as a K(+)-electrode, and showed rectification of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) type. The whole-cell current at -20 mV was inhibited by external H(+) ions with a concentration responsible for half inhibition of pH 7.09 and muscarine failed to induce a further inward current during exposure to a saline in which pH decreased to 6.5. A similar occlusion occurred in secretion when pH in muscarine-containing saline decreased to 6.6. RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry suggested that rat AM cells mainly express the TASK1 channel. This TASK channel in AM cells may directly sense a decrease in blood pH, which occurs during exercise. The muscarine action was mimicked by oxotremorine-methiodide, but not by oxotremorine. The present results indicate that activation of muscarinic receptors or a decrease in external pH in the rat AM cell induces secretion through the inhibition of TASK1-like channels.",M1
18455310,"Autocrine TGF-beta signaling is required for the GDNF/CNTF-induced neuronal differentiation of adrenal chromaffin tsAM5D cells expressing temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen.We recently established adrenal <e>medullary</e> cell line tsAM5D, which was immortalized by use of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the oncogene simian virus 40 large T-antigen. In the present study, when co-treated with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), tsAM5D cells proliferated at the permissive temperature (33 degrees C) for the T-antigen expression and differentiated into neuron-like cells at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C). Interestingly, in GDNF/CNTF-treated cultures, the addition of pan-specific transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-neutralizing antibody did not affect the cell proliferation at 33 degrees C, but significantly reduced the survival of neuronally differentiated cells at 39 degrees C. Using real-time RT-PCR for analysis of GDNF/CNTF-treated cells, we found that the expression of mRNAs for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3 was up-regulated by the temperature shift. These results suggest that autocrine TGF-beta signaling is necessary for the survival of GDNF/CNTF-differentiated tsAM5D cells upon the temperature shift.",M1
18434366,"Differential distribution of VGF-derived peptides in the adrenal medulla and evidence for their selective modulation.While vg f gene knockout mice are hyperactive and hypermetabolic, surprisingly the TLQP-21 brain VGF peptide increased energy consumption, suggesting that opposing regulatory effects could be exerted by peptides alternatively cleaved from the VGF precursor. Using antisera to the VGF precursor C-terminus and three cleavage products, we revealed a distinct differential distribution in adrenal, certain peptides (VGF(422-430): PGH peptides) being found throughout bovine and swine medulla, while C-terminus and TLQP peptides were confined to adrenaline cells in the above species and in rat and C-terminally shortened forms (VGF(604-612): HVLL peptides) to nor-adrenaline cells. Random abattoir samples of bovine and swine adrenal contained 520+/-40 and 450+/-60 pmol/g (mean+/-s.e.m. respectively) of C-terminus peptides and similar or lower amounts of others. Upon gel chromatography, bona fide VGF precursor, approximately 7.5 and approximately 3.5 kDa forms were revealed by C-terminus assays, HVLL peptides being limited to small fragments. TLQP peptides included ~7.5 kDa form and peaks accounting for TLQP-21 and predicted TLQP-30 and TLQP-42. Low molecular weight (MW) PGH peptides were revealed, together with a high MW form possibly encompassing the VGF precursor N-terminus. In acutely stressed swine, a striking increase was seen for C-terminus and TLQP peptides, with no significant differences for PGH peptides. A similar response was found in rat TLQP peptides showing a major increase upon an acute swimming stress and 30 min thereafter. A differential processing of the VGF precursor encompassing many areas of its primary sequence and selective modulations of its derived peptides occur in adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells, possibly relevant to adaptive homeostatic responses.",M1
18413277,"Evidence that exercise-induced heat storage is dependent on adrenomedullary secretion.To investigate the influence of <e>medullary</e> adrenal secretion on thermoregulation during exercise, Phy (Eserine, 5x10(-3) M) was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle of normal (INT) or bilaterally adrenodemedullated (ADM) untrained rats. Body temperature (Tb) and metabolic rate were measured in the rats while they were exercising on a treadmill (20 m min(-1), 5% inclination) until fatigue or while they were at rest after drug injection. In resting rats, Phy increased oxygen consumption in both INT or ADM rats without any effect on core temperature. During the dynamic phase of exercise (first 20 min), ADM attenuated the exercise-induced increase in core temperature (0.86+/-0.12 degrees C ADM Sal vs 1.48+/-0.21 degrees C INT Sal), thus reducing heat storage (HS) levels. Icv injection of Phy in ADM rats significantly reduced the increase in Tb (0.012+/-0.10 degrees C min(-1) Phy vs 0.042+/-0.006 degrees C min(-1) Sal; p&lt;0.02) and HS (65.8+/-56.1 cal Phy vs 207.7+/-32.7 cal Sal; p&lt;0.04) compared to ADM Sal rats. In conclusion, the exercise-induced increase in heat storage was attenuated by adrenodemedullation in rats. Furthermore, the activation of heat loss mechanisms by the central cholinergic system during exercise occurs independently of adrenal medullary secretion suppression and can be improved by previous adrenodemedullation. Our data indicate the existence of a dual mechanism of heat loss control during the dynamic phase of exercise: one involving sympathoadrenal system activation that impairs heat loss and another that counteracts the increased sympathoadrenal activity through the hypothalamic cholinergic system to promote heat loss.",M1
18355649,"Low-frequency electroacupuncture suppresses carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in mice via sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons, while high-frequency EA suppression is mediated by the sympathoadrenal <e>medullary</e> axis.Although the frequency-dependent antinociceptive mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) have been well demonstrated, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms that underlie the suppressive effects induced by different frequencies of EA stimulation on peripheral inflammation are largely unknown. We have previously reported that EA stimulation can activate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and that this activation is responsible for the EA-induced suppression of zymosan-induced leukocyte migration. The present study was designed to evaluate the differential effect of low (1Hz, LF EA) versus high (120Hz, HF EA) frequency EA stimulation on SNS activation and ultimately on carrageenan-induced inflammation. Immediately after carrageenan injection, we applied either LF EA or HF EA bilaterally to the Zusanli (ST36) acupoints. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of EA (EA-AI), paw volume and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of infiltrated leukocytes, were measured and the paw withdrawal latency to noxious heat stimulation was also assessed. Both LF EA and HF EA significantly suppressed the carrageenan-induced paw edema and MPO activity. Moreover, thermal hyperalgesia was strongly attenuated in both the LF EA and HF EA groups. Adrenalectomy significantly diminished HF EA-AI without affecting LF EA-AI. Pretreatment with the corticosterone receptor antagonist, RU-486 did not affect either LF EA- or HF EA-AI. On the other hand, administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (a neurotoxin for peripheral sympathetic nerve endings) selectively blocked LF EA-AI. Propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) completely abolished both LF EA- and HF EA-AI. The results of this study suggest that the suppressive effects of LF EA on carrageenan-induced paw inflammation are mediated by sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons, while the suppressive effects of HF EA are mediated by the sympatho-adrenal medullary axis.",M1
18258218,"Spinal subarachnoid adrenal <e>medullary</e> transplants reduce hind paw swelling and peripheral nerve transport following formalin injection in rats.Previous studies have demonstrated that adrenal medullary chromaffin cells transplanted into the spinal subarachnoid space significantly reduced pain-related behavior following hind paw plantar formalin injection in rats. The data suggests a centrally mediated antinociceptive mechanism. The spinal transplants may have effects on sciatic nerve function as well. To address this, the current study examined the effects of spinal adrenal transplants on hind paw edema and the anterograde transport of substance P (SP) that occur following formalin injection. Robust formalin-evoked edema, as well as hind paw flinching, was observed in striated muscle control-transplanted rats, which were not observed in adrenal-transplanted rats. To visualize transport of SP, the sciatic nerve was ligated ipsilateral to formalin injection and the nerve was processed 48 h later for immunocytochemistry. A significant formalin-induced accumulation of SP immunoreactivity (IR) was observed proximal to the ligation in control-transplanted rats. In contrast, there was significantly less SP IR observed from nerve of adrenal-transplanted rats, suggesting a diminution of anterograde axoplasmic transport by adrenal transplants. The change in SP IR may have been due to an alteration of transport due to formalin injection, thus, transport was visualized by the accumulation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) at the ligation site. Formalin injection did not significantly increase proximal accumulation of GAP43 IR, indicating that formalin does not increase anterograde transport. Surprisingly, however, adrenal transplants significantly diminished GAP43 IR accumulation compared to control-transplanted rats. These data demonstrate that spinal adrenal transplants can attenuate the formalin-evoked response by modulating primary afferent responses.",M1
18070242,"A morphological and histological examination of the pan-tropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) and the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) adrenal gland.The morphology and histology of the cetacean adrenal gland are poorly understood. Therefore, this study examined 32 pairs of adrenal glands from 18 pan-tropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) and 14 spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris). In both species, the cortex was pseudolobulated and contained a typical mammalian zonation. <e>Medullary</e> protrusions (0-3 per section) and a medullary band were identified in both species. For S. attenuata, no statistical differences were found in the cortex to medulla (CM) ratio or the percent cross-sectional area (PCA) of the adrenal glands compared with sex or sexual maturity. The mean CM ratio for S. attenuata was 2.34 and the PCA was 64.4% cortex, 29.4% medulla and 6.2%'other'. 'Other' indicates blood vessels, connective tissue and the gland capsule itself. For S. longirostris, there was no statistical difference in the CM ratio compared with sexual maturity. However, a statistical difference was found between the CM ratio and sex, suggesting sexual dimorphism (female CM ratio = 2.46 and males = 3.21). No statistical differences were found in the PCA of S. longirostris adrenal glands by sexual maturity. However, a statistical difference was found between the PCA by sex. Female S. longirostris adrenal glands consisted of 65.0% cortex, 27.3% medulla and 7.7% 'other', whereas male adrenal glands consisted of 71.7% cortex, 22.7% medulla and 5.6% 'other'.",M1
18038903,"Influence of polyphenolic compounds isolated from Rubus coreanum on catecholamine release in the rat adrenal medulla.The aim of the present study was to investigate whether polyphenolic compounds isolated from wine brewed from Rubus coreanum MIQUEL (PCRC) may affect the release of catecholamine (CA) from the isolated perfused rat adrenal medulla, and to establish its mechanism of action. PCRC (20-180 microg/mL) perfused into an adrenal vein for 90 min dose- and time-dependently inhibited the CA secretory responses evoked by acetylcholine (ACh, 5.32 mM), high K+ (a direct membrane-depolarizer, 56 mM), DMPP (a selective neuronal nicotinic Nn receptor agonist, 100 microM) and McN-A-343 (a selective muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, 100 microM). Also, in the presence of PCRC (60 microg/mL), the secretory responses of CA evoked by Bay-K-8644 (a L-type dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel activator, 10 microM), and cyclopiazonic acid (a cytoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, 10 microM) were significantly reduced, respectively. In the simultaneous presence of PCRC (60 microg/mL) and L-NAME (an inhibitor of NO synthase, 30 microM), the inhibitory responses of PCRC on the CA secretion evoked by ACh, high K+, DMPP, and Bay-K-8644 were considerably recovered to the extent of the corresponding control secretion compared with the inhibitory effect of PCRC alone. Taken together, these results obtained from the present study demonstrate that PCRC inhibits the CA secretory responses from the isolated perfused adrenal gland of the normotensive rats evoked by stimulation of cholinergic (both muscarinic and nicotinic) receptors as well as by direct membrane-depolarization. It seems that this inhibitory effect of PCRC is exerted by inhibiting both the calcium influx into the rat adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells and the uptake of Ca2+ into the cytoplasmic calcium store partly through the increased NO production due to the activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which are at least relevant to the direct interaction with the nicotinic receptor itself. It is also thought that PCRC might be effective in prevention of cardiovascular disease.",M1
18005392,"A physiological view of the central and peripheral mechanisms that regulate the release of catecholamines at the adrenal medulla.Here we review the tight neural control of the differential secretion into the circulation, of the adrenal <e>medullary</e> hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. One or the other catecholamines are differentially released on various stress conditions. This is specifically controlled by central nervous system nuclei at the cortex, hypothalamus and spinal cord. Different firing patterns of splanchnic nerves and nicotinic or muscarinic receptors cause the selective release of noradrenaline or adrenaline, to adapt the body to the 'fight or flight' reaction, or during severe hypoglycaemia, haemorrhage, cold, acute myocardial infarction or other severe stressful conflicts. Endogenously acetylcholine (ACh) released at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse, acting on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, causes membrane depolarization and action potentials (AP) in chromaffin cells. These changes vary with the animal species, the cell preparation (intact bisected adrenal, adrenal slices, or isolated fresh or cultured cells) or the recording technique (intracellular microelectrodes, patch-clamp, perforated-patch, cell-attached). Conflicting results leave many open questions concerning the actions of ACh on chromaffin cell excitability. The use of adrenal slices and field electrical stimulation will surely provide new insights into these mechanisms. Chromaffin cells have been thoroughly used as models to study the relationship between Ca2+ entry, cytosolic Ca2+ signals, exocytosis and endocytosis, using patch-clamp and amperometric techniques. Cells have been stimulated with single depolarizing pulses (DPs), DP trains and with simulated AP waveforms. These approaches have provided useful information but we have no data on APs generated by pulsatile secretory quanta of ACh, trying to mimic the intermittent and repetitive splanchnic nerve discharge of the neurotransmitter. We present some recent experiments using ultrashort ACh pulses (25 ms), that cause non-desensitizing repetitive APs with each ACh pulse, at low ACh concentrations (30 microM). Ultrashort pulses of a high ACh concentration (1000 microM) causes a single AP followed by a prolonged depolarization. It could be interesting trying to correlate these 'patterns of splanchnic nerve discharge' with Ca2+ signals and exocytosis. This, together with the use of adrenal slices and transmural electrical stimulation of splanchnic nerves will provide new physiologically sound data on the regulation of adrenal medullary secretion.",M1
18000306,"Neuroendocrine profiling in inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension rat strain with stress-sensitive arterial hypertension.The functions of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal <e>medullary</e> systems were studied in rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH strain). A characteristic feature of the ISIAH strain is an increase in arterial blood pressure measured both under basal conditions and after restraint stress in particular. In the control ISIAH rats, the basal plasma ACTH concentration was slightly lower than that in the normotensive Wistar albino Glaxo (WAG) rats, and no differences were found in plasma corticosterone. However, the 0.5-h restraint stress produced higher activation of the adrenal cortex in the ISIAH rats. Gluco- and mineralocorticoid responses to the blood volume reduction stresses and ACTH and corticosterone responses to social stress were stronger in the ISIAH than in the control WAG rats. An increase in epinephrine content in adrenals in the basal state and enhanced response of the sympathetic adrenal medullary system to handling stress were observed in the ISIAH rats. Restraint stress produced significantly higher expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone-mRNA in hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin-mRNA in pituitary in the ISIAH than in the WAG rats. Restraint stress produced a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression (GR-mRNA) in hippocampus in the ISIAH, but not in the WAG rats. A persistent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-mRNA in adrenals of the ISIAH rats was found. It is concluded that the ISIAH rat strain is an appropriate model of stress-sensitive hypertension with the predominant involvement of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems in its pathogenesis.",M1
17890895,"Precursor lesions of the adrenal gland.OBJECTIVE: To review the existing literature for evidence that adrenocortical and adrenomedullary tumours develop through a multistep process of carcinogenesis. RESULTS: In the adrenal cortex hyperplasia and adenomas are frequently observed tumours or tumour-like conditions. In contrast, adrenocortical carcinomas are rare. Based on well-validated histopathological scoring systems, benign and malignant adrenocortical tumours can be separated, although a small subset of tumours remains hard to classify. Although extensive follow-up studies might argue against multistep carcinogenesis, analysis of chromosomal imbalances and gene expression profiling studies in these tumours are inconclusive and could give support for both multistep pathogenesis or de novo genesis of carcinomas. A major limit to most of these studies is the small sample size and the lack of extensive clinical (follow-up) data. In the adrenal medulla, pheochromocytomas (PCC) are the most frequent tumours in adults, with an incidence of 8 per million. They can be divided into benign and malignant PCC, but the distinction can only be made when metastases are present. Arbitrarily, lesions of less than 1 cm in diameter are called hyperplastic, but it should be expected that the majority of these are early lesions and if left in situ would grow to classify as PCC. In contrast to cortical tumours, the frequent 1p and 3q loss as an early event in tumourigenesis of benign PCC is verified in multiple studies. However, studies in malignant PCC yield divergent results, due to the small numbers analysed. CONCLUSION: Taken together, there appears to be a relationship between cortical and <e>medullary</e> hyperplasia on the one hand and cortical adenomas and PCC on the other. However, whether there is a transition from benign to malignant tumours, both cortical and medullary, remains to be determined.",M1
17888406,"Effects of resveratrol, a grape polyphenol, on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.We report the effects of resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the skins of red grapes, on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Resveratrol suppressed catecholamine secretion and (22)Na(+) and (45)Ca(2+) influx induced by acetylcholine, an agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=20.4, 11.0, and 62.8 microM, respectively). Resveratrol also inhibited catecholamine secretion induced by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, and 56 mM K(+), an activator of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, at concentrations similar to those for (45)Ca(2+) influx. Resveratrol directly inhibited the current evoked by acetylcholine in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (IC(50)=25.9 microM). Furthermore, resveratrol (IC(50)=5.32 microM) attenuated (14)C-catecholamine synthesis induced by acetylcholine. The present findings suggest that resveratrol inhibits acetylcholine-induced catecholamine secretion and synthesis through suppressing ion influx in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.",M1
17717056,"Dual effects of daidzein, a soy isoflavone, on catecholamine synthesis and secretion in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.We recently demonstrated the occurrence and functional roles of plasma membrane estrogen receptors in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Here we report the effects of daidzein, a phytoestrogen of soybeans, on catecholamine synthesis and secretion in the cells. Incubation of cells with daidzein for 20 min increased the synthesis of (14)C-catecholamines from [(14)C]tyrosine but not [(14)C]dihydroxyphenylalanine, in a concentration-dependent manner (10-1000 nm). The stimulatory effect of daidzein on (14)C-catecholamine synthesis was not inhibited by ICI182,780, a classical estrogen receptor inhibitor. Acetylcholine, a physiological secretagogue, stimulated the synthesis of (14)C-catecholamines, which was suppressed by daidzein at 1 mum. Daidzein at high concentrations (1-100 microm) suppressed catecholamine secretion induced by acetylcholine. Furthermore, daidzein (10-1000 nm) inhibited the specific binding of [(3)H]17beta-estradiol to plasma membranes isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. The present findings suggest that daidzein at low concentrations stimulates catecholamine synthesis through plasma membrane estrogen receptors but at high concentrations inhibits catecholamine synthesis and secretion induced by acetylcholine in bovine adrenal medulla. The latter effect of daidzein may be a beneficial action on the cardiovascular system.",M1
17702812,"Increased secretory capacity of mouse adrenal chromaffin cells by chronic intermittent hypoxia: involvement of protein kinase C.Previous studies have shown that catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla plays a critical role in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-induced alterations in cardiovascular function. In the present study we examined the cellular mechanisms associated with the effects of CIH on adrenal chromaffin cell catecholamine secretion. Experiments were performed on adult male mice (C57/BL6) that were exposed to 1-4 days of CIH or to normoxia. Perforated patch electrical capacitance recordings were performed on freshly prepared adrenal <e>medullary</e> slices that permit separating the chromaffin cell secretion from sympathetic input. CIH resulted in a significant increase in the readily releasable pool (RRP) of secretory granules, and decreased stimulus-evoked Ca(2+) influx. Continuous hypoxia (CH) either for 2.5 h (equivalent to hypoxic duration accumulated over 4 days of CIH) or for 4 days were ineffective in evoking changes in the RRP and Ca(2+) influx. CIH activated PKC in adrenal medullae as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of PKC at Thr(514) and PKC inhibitors prevented CIH-induced increases in the RRP and restored stimulus-evoked attenuation of Ca(2+) influx. CIH resulted in elevated thio-barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs, an index of oxidized proteins) and an antioxidant prevented CIH-induced changes in the RRP, suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results demonstrate that CIH increases the RRP in adrenal chromaffin cells via ROS-mediated activation of PKC and suggest that CIH can directly affect the secretory capacity of chromaffin cells and contribute, in part, to elevated catecholamine levels.",M1
17671739,"Neuropeptide Y and glucocorticoid secretion from guinea pig adrenal gland: an in vivo and in vitro study.The effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on adrenal glucocorticoid secretion are controversial, and we have investigated this issue in guinea pigs, where, like in humans and cows, the main glucocorticoid hormone is cortisol. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged NPY administration markedly lowered cortisol plasma concentration not only in normal guinea pigs, but also in animals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone and captopril. In vitro experiments ruled out the possibility that in vivo glucocorticoid anti-secretagogue action of NPY can ensue from a direct effect on the adrenal gland. In fact, NPY did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig inner adrenocortical cells. In contrast, NPY raised cortisol production from adrenal slices containing <e>medullary</e> tissue, and this effect was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol. This finding, coupled with the demonstration that NPY enhanced catecholamine release from guinea pigadrenomedullary tissue, strongly suggests that NPY may stimulate glucocorticoid secretion in this species through an indirect mechanism involving catecholamines, that in a paracrine manner promote the secretion of inner adrenocortical cells. In light of these observations, the conclusion is drawn that the in vivo effects of NPY are mediated by mechanism(s) independent of either the suppression of the main adrenal agonists ACTH and angiotensin-II or the direct inhibition of adrenal secretion. The possibility merits an investigation into whether NPY enhances the production of peptides, which, like leptin, inhibit adrenal glucocorticoid secretion acting as circulating hormones.",M1
17534949,"Neuropathological study 16 years after autologous adrenal <e>medullary</e> transplantation in a Parkinson's disease patient.To date, there is no clinicopathological correlation of adrenal medullary transplant cases in patients with survival beyond a few years. Postmortem examination of a brain from a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 years after autologous adrenal medullary transplant, was performed using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and chromogranin A. The patient experienced a four-year initial improvement in motor function followed by resumption of the progressive nature of her disease that continued until her death. She expired 16 years following grafting. At autopsy, TH stain of the brain revealed severe loss of TH-immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and Lewy bodies, confirming the diagnosis of PD. The transplant site was identified by the presence of scarring and there was complete absence of any TH staining cells at the site of the transplant. There were few surviving cells staining with chromogranin A. The absence of TH-staining cells in the transplant 16 years after surgery provides further evidence that adrenal medullary transplants do not survive in the long term.",M1

17324261,"Sry delivery to the adrenal medulla increases blood pressure and adrenal <e>medullary</e> tyrosine hydroxylase of normotensive WKY rats.BACKGROUND: Our laboratory has shown that a locus on the SHR Y chromosome increases blood pressure (BP) in the SHR rat and in WKY rats that had the SHR Y chromosome locus crossed into their genome (SHR/y rat). A potential candidate for this Y chromosome hypertension locus is Sry, a gene that encodes a transcription factor that is responsible for testes development and the Sry protein may affect other target genes. METHODS: The following study examined if exogenous Sry would elevate adrenal Th, adrenal catecholamines, plasma catecholamines and blood pressure. We delivered 10 mug of either the expression construct, Sry1/pcDNA 3.1, or control vector into the adrenal medulla of WKY rats by electroporation. Blood pressure was measured by the tail cuff technique and Th and catecholamines by HPLC with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: In the animals receiving Sry there were significant increases after 3 weeks in resting plasma NE (57%) and adrenal Th content (49%) compared to vector controls. BP was 30 mmHg higher in Sry injected animals (160 mmHg, p &lt; .05) compared to vector controls (130 mmHg) after 2-3 weeks. Histological analysis showed that the electroporation procedure did not produce morphological damage. CONCLUSION: These results provide continued support that Sry is a candidate gene for hypertension. Also, these results are consistent with a role for Sry in increasing BP by directly or indirectly activating sympathetic nervous system activity.",M1
17277731,"Salivary alpha-amylase levels and hyperbolic discounting in male humans.OBJECTIVE: Little is known regarding the role of the sympathetic-adrenal-<e>medullary</e> (SAM) system in self-control and impulsivity in intertemporal choice (delay discounting), although the roles of dopaminergic and serotonergic systems have been extensively examined. This study was aimed to examine the relationships between salivary alpha-amylase (sAA, a non-invasive biological marker of adrenergic/SAM activities) levels and hyperbolic discounting, which is of interest in psychoneuroendocrinology and neuroeconomics. METHODS: We assessed degrees to which delayed monetary gains were discounted (hyperbolic discount rates) in healthy male students. Participants' sAA were also assessed. RESULTS: We observed negative relationships between sAA and hyperbolic discounting of small, medium, and large monetary gains. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that subjects with low sAA are impulsive in intertemporal choice. Implications for the roles of adrenergic and SAM systems in self-control in intertemporal choice are discussed.",M1
17225960,"Short-term exposure to somatostatin or muscarinic agonists reduce acetylcholine-induced 3H-MPP+ release from bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of a short-term exposure to somatostatin (SS), its receptors (SSTR) selective agonists as well as muscarinic receptors agonists upon acetylcholine-induced release of (3)H-MPP(+ )from bovine adrenal medullary cells. Acetylcholine (ACH, 100, 500 microM) was found to increase the release of (3)H-MPP(+ )by these cells (to 175 and 171% of basal release, respectively). ACH-elicited (3)H-MPP(+) release was significantly reduced by hexamethonium (100 microM) and atropine (100 microM), selective nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists, respectively. Previous exposure to any of two muscarinic agonists, oxotremorine or pilocarpine, led to a significant reduction of (3)H-MPP(+) release in response to 100 microM ACH, to about a maximum of 51% and 78% of control, respectively. Somatostatin (SS, 0.01-0.1 microM), previously applied to the preparation, depressed ACH-elicited (3)H-MPP(+ )release by 25-27%, but only when a 500 microM ACH concentration was used. The inhibition exerted by SS upon ACH-evoked (3)H-MPP(+) release appeared to be mediated by its SSTR: (1) SSTR2, 3 and 4 subtype agonists mimicked the effects seen with SS, and (2) the SSTR non-selective antagonist, cyclo-SS, counteracted the SS inhibitory effect. When SS was tested in the presence of any of the muscarinic agonists, oxotremorine or pilocarpine, its inhibitory effect on 500 microM ACH-induced (3)H-MPP(+) release was no longer detectable. These results, showing a somewhat similar effect of short-term exposure to SS and muscarinic agonists over ACH-induced release of (3)H-MPP(+), as well as the loss of effect of SS by the presence of the muscarinic agonists, suggest that these compounds may share signalling pathways.",M1
17218354,"Neonatal hyperleptinaemia programmes adrenal <e>medullary</e> function in adult rats: effects on cardiovascular parameters.Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between stressful events (nutritional, hormonal or environmental) in early life and development of adult diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular failure. It is known that gestation and lactation are crucial periods for healthy growth in mammals and that the sympathoadrenal system is markedly influenced by environmental conditions during these periods. We previously demonstrated that neonatal hyperleptinaemia in rats programmes higher body weight, higher food intake and hypothalamic leptin resistance in adulthood. Using this model of programming, we investigated adrenal medullary function and effects on cardiovascular parameters in male rats in adulthood. Leptin treatment during the first 10 days of lactation (8 microg 100 g(-1) day(-1), s.c.) resulted in lower body weight (6.5%, P &lt; 0.05), hyperleptinaemia (10-fold, P &lt; 0.05) and higher catecholamine content in adrenal glands (18.5%, P &lt; 0.05) on the last day of treatment. In adulthood (150 days), the rats presented higher body weight (5%, P &lt; 0.05), adrenal catecholamine content (3-fold, P &lt; 0.05), tyrosine hydroxylase expression (35%, P &lt; 0.05) and basal and caffeine-stimulated catecholamine release (53% and 100%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were also higher in adult rats (7% and 6%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Our results show that hyperleptinaemia in early life increases adrenal medullary function in adulthood and that this may alter cardiovascular parameters. Thus, we suggest that imprinting factors which increase leptin and catecholamine levels during the neonatal period could be involved in development of adult chronic diseases.",M1
17211600,"Stimulation of catecholamine synthesis via activation of p44/42 MAPK in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells by milnacipran.Milnacipran is a serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and is used clinically as an antidepressant. We report here the effect of milnacipran on catecholamine synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Incubation of adrenal medullary cells with milnacipran (300 ng/ml, 1,065 nM) for 20 min resulted in a significant increase in 14C-catecholamine synthesis from [14C]tyrosine, but not from [14C]DOPA, whereas the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), paroxetine (300 ng/ml, 800 nM) and fluvoxamine (300 ng/ml, 691 nM), had little effect. Milnacipran, but not paroxetine or fluvoxamine, increased the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step of catecholamine biosynthesis, in a concentration-dependent manner (100-300 ng/ml, 355-1,065 nM). U0126 (1 microM), an inhibitor of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, abolished the stimulatory effects of milnacipran on tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Furthermore, incubation of cells with milnacipran (30-100 ng/ml) for 5 min activated p44/42 MAPK, whereas paroxetine and fluvoxamine did not. The present findings suggest that milnacipran activates tyrosine hydroxylase and then stimulates catecholamine synthesis through a p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathway in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.",M1
17102111,"Treatment of bilateral pheochromocytoma and adrenal <e>medullary</e> hyperplasia.The risk for bilateral tumors and long-term outcome after conservative cortical-sparing adrenal surgery was studied in a consecutive single-center series. One hundred fifty-four patients were operated on (1950-2004) for pheochromocytoma (PC=137), or abdominal paraganglioma (PG=17). Twenty had MEN 2 (16 MEN 2A; 4 MEN 2B), 15 von Recklinghausen's disease (VRD), and 1 von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Twelve patients had, or developed, bilateral adrenal medullary tumors; four with MEN 2A, four with MEN 2B, three with VRD, and one with probably hereditary PC associated with brain tumors/meningioma. Two patients with MEN 2B and one with MEN 2A with had bilateral adrenalectomy (adx). Three VRD patients, two MEN 2B and one MEN 2A patients had cortical-sparing surgery. Two patients were operated on unilaterally, but developed small contralateral tumors; one of these (MEN 2A) had a second asymptomatic PC diagnosed at an older age, so surgery was withheld; the other patient (hereditary PC syndrome) had a small contralateral PC diagnosed at autopsy 9 years later. Only three of nine patients with bilateral operations needed corticosteroid replacement after surgery. Four of six patients died of associated tumors (MTC and meningioma). The mean follow-up was 13 (1-25) years. Twelve MEN 2A patients with unilateral adx have been followed up for 20 (4-36) years without developing a second PC. Cortical-sparing adrenal surgery can safely be performed in the majority of patients with bilateral PC. On the basis of our long-term experience of MEN 2A we perform contralateral adrenal resection only if a second PC is confirmed. Five patients underwent adrenal exploration because of clinical and biochemical findings compatible with PC. Four had asymmetrical positive MIBG scans. They all underwent unilateral adx and diffuse medullary hyperplasia was confirmed (medullary weight estimated morphometrically to 1.0-3.4 g vs. normal weight 0.3-0.5 g in matched controls). These patients have been followed for 19 (5-27) years with normal clinical and biochemical findings. In this rare condition removal of the largest adrenal seems adequate.",M1
17081354,"Organelles containing inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 in adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.To identify which organelles contained inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor type 2 (InsP(3)R2) in adrenal medullary (AM) cells, immunocytochemical and biochemical studies were performed on AM cells of several species. InsP(3)R2-like immunoreactive materials produced by two different anti-InsP(3)R2 antibodies (Abs) (Chemicon and Sigma) were distributed in rat AM cells in agreement with BODIPY-FL-InsP(3) binding sites. For two other Abs (KM1083 and Santa Cruz), some of the anti-InsP(3)R2 immunoreactive materials were stained with an anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase Ab, but not by BODIPY-FL-InsP(3). BODIPY-FL-thapsigargin binding sites were consistent with a distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) identified by an anti-calnexin Ab, and a prior application of thapsigargin significantly eliminated BODIPY-FL-thapsigargin bindings, suggesting that BODIPY-FL-thapsigargin bindings were mediated by thapsigargin, but not the fluorescence molecule. The anti-InsP(3)R2 Ab that produced stainings consistent with BODIPY-FL-InsP(3) bindings recognized a protein with about 250 kDa. A fractional analysis of bovine adrenal medullae revealed that the 250 kDa InsP(3)R2 was detected in a crude membrane fraction, but not in a secretory granule fraction. The results suggest that the InsP(3)R2 was present in the ER, but not in secretory granules in AM cells.",M1
17067620,"Morphological changes in the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) adrenal gland associated with chronic stress.Beach-stranded Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (n=68) were categorized as either  acutely stressed  (if they died from net entanglement, boat strike, or acute infection; 31 animals) or  chronically stressed  (if they suffered from or died as a result of long-term disease or debilitating injury; 37 animals). No significant differences in mass between the right and left adrenal glands were found within each category. However, the average gland mass (AGM), based on the right and left glands together, was 5.2g for acutely stressed animals and 11.01 g for chronically stressed animals (P&lt;0.001). Significant differences were also found, in terms of the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the cortex to medulla, between acutely stressed (ratio 1.22) and chronically stressed (ratio 1.63) animals (P=0.027). Adrenal glands of acutely stressed animals consisted of 48% cortex, 41% medulla, and 11% other tissue elements (connective tissue, blood vessels and gland capsule), whereas the corresponding figures for chronically stressed animals were 53%, 36%, and 11%. The mean estimated mass values for cortex, medulla and other tissue were, for acutely stressed animals, 2.36, 1.9, and 0.54, respectively, whereas for chronically stressed animals the corresponding figures were 6.06, 4.04, and 1.29 (P&lt;0.001 for each of the three comparisons). Overstaining with haematoxylin (HEM) and immunohistochemical labelling (IHC) of the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine) were used to determine the percentage of epinephrine-producing cells in relation to the overall cross-sectional area of the adrenal gland. The percentage values in acutely as compared with chronically stressed dolphins were 6.7% and 15.93%, respectively (P=0.021). The results therefore suggest that in bottlenose dolphins chronic stress results in increases in (1) adrenal mass, (2) cortex to medulla ratio, and (3) epinephrine-producing cells within the medulla, giving rise to an increase in the thickness of the <e>medullary</e> band.",M1
17034880,"Exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells: new tasks for actin.Most secretory cells undergoing calcium-regulated exocytosis in response to cell surface receptor stimulation display a dense subplasmalemmal actin network, which is remodeled during the exocytotic process. This review summarizes new insights into the role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in exocytosis. Many earlier findings support the actin-physical-barrier model whereby transient depolymerization of cortical actin filaments permits vesicles to gain access to their appropriate docking and fusion sites at the plasma membrane. On the other hand, data from our laboratory and others now indicate that actin polymerization also plays a positive role in the exocytotic process. Here, we discuss the potential functions attributed to the actin cytoskeleton at each major step of the exocytotic process, including recruitment, docking and fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. Moreover, we present actin-binding proteins, which are likely to link actin organization to calcium signals along the exocytotic pathway. The results cited in this review are derived primarily from investigations of the adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cell, a cell model that is since many years a source of information concerning the molecular machinery underlying exocytosis.",M1
17028848,"Capsaicin inhibits catecholamine secretion and synthesis by blocking Na+ and Ca2+ influx through a vanilloid receptor-independent pathway in bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.We report here the effects of capsaicin, a flavoring ingredient in the hot pepper Capsicum family, on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Capsaicin inhibited catecholamine secretion (IC(50)=9.5, 11.8, and 62 microM) stimulated by carbachol, an agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, and by high K(+), an activator of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, respectively. Capsaicin also suppressed carbachol-induced (22)Na(+) influx (IC(50)=5.0 microM) and (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50)=24.4 muM), veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx (IC(50)=2.4 microM) and (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50)=1.1 microM), and high K(+)-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx (IC(50)=5.8 microM). The reduction in catecholamine secretion caused by capsaicin was not overcome by increasing the concentration of carbachol. Furthermore, capsazepine (10 microM), a competitive antagonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, and ruthenium red (30 microM), a nonselective cation channel antagonist, did not block the inhibition by capsaicin of catecholamine secretion. Capsaicin also suppressed both basal and carbachol-stimulated (14)C-catecholamine synthesis (IC(50)=10.6 and 26.4 microM, respectively) from [(14)C] tyrosine but not from L: -3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl [3-(14)C] alanine ([(14)C] DOPA) as well as tyrosine hydroxylase activity (IC(50)=8.4 and 39.0 microM, respectively). The present findings suggest that capsaicin inhibits catecholamine secretion and synthesis via suppression of Na(+) and Ca(2+) influx through a vanilloid receptor-independent pathway.",M1
16913447,"A case of a composite adrenal <e>medullary</e> tumor of pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma masquerading as acute pancreatitis.Composite adrenal medullary tumors, composed of both pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma, are extremely rare, as are pheochromocytomas masquerading as acute relapsing pancreatitis. We recently experienced a case of a 48-year-old male with both these phenomena. The patient complained of an acute onset of intense abdominal discomfort. At the same time, pancreatic enzymes were increased in concentration. An abdominal computed tomographic scan revealed an enlarged pancreas and a 3-cm left adrenal incidentaloma. Biochemical and 131I-MIBG scintigraphic findings were compatible with a pheochromocytoma. Yet, he had no clinical manifestations suggesting pheochromocytoma. An adrenalectomy was performed and a composite adrenal medullary tumor of pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma was confirmed during a pathologic examination. This case illustrates two points: 1) acute abdominal intense discomfort and hyperamylasemia may be unusual presentations of pheochromocytomas; and 2) the possibility of the pheochromocytoma, albeit rare, should be considered when a relapsing pancreatitis of uncertain etiology develops.",M1
16831469,"Effect of coping on endocrinoimmune functions in different stress situations.The objective of this study was to examine the effects of coping strategies on the endocrine and immune functions in different stress situations. Thirty-eight medical students were enrolled in this study. Cell-mediated immune function was measured using the lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production during the nonexamination period and during the preexamination period. Endocrine functions were assessed by measuring the plasma levels of norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. The Global Assessment of Recent Stress (GARS) scale, the Stress Response Inventory, the anxiety, depression, and somatization subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-revised, the Way of Coping-revised, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Anger Expression Scale were used as psychometric measures. The subjects with higher levels of total GARS scores showed significantly higher IL-2 production during the nonexam period than those with lower levels of total GARS scores. During the same period, IL-2 production in the less positive reappraisal group was significantly higher than in the more positive reappraisal group. Lymphocyte proliferation in the group seeking less social support was also significantly higher than in the group seeking more social support. However, no significant association was found between the coping strategies and each of the hormone levels. These results suggest that positive reappraisal and seeking social support can be associated with the alteration of immune function during a chronic stress period. In particular, positive reappraisal is likely to reverse the stress-induced immune responses. This study did not find that neuroendocrine function such as the sympathetic-adrenal <e>medullary</e> axis or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is playing a mediating role in the relationship between coping and immunity.",M1

16697281,"Endogenous ligands of PACAP/VIP receptors in the autocrine-paracrine regulation of the adrenal gland.Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are the main endogenous ligands of a class of G protein-coupled receptors (Rs). Three subtypes of PACAP/VIP Rs have been identified and named PAC(1)-Rs, VPAC(1)-Rs, and VPAC(2)-Rs. The PAC(1)-R almost exclusively binds PACAP, while the other two subtypes bind with about equal efficiency VIP and PACAP. VIP, PACAP, and their receptors are widely distributed in the body tissues, including the adrenal gland. VIP and PACAP are synthesized in adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, and are released in the adrenal cortex and medulla by VIPergic and PACAPergic nerve fibers. PAC(1)-Rs are almost exclusively present in the adrenal medulla, while VPAC(1)-Rs and VPAC(2)-Rs are expressed in both the adrenal cortex and medulla. Evidence indicates that VIP and PACAP, acting via VPAC(1)-Rs and VPAC(2)-Rs coupled to adenylate cyclase (AC)- and phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent cascades, stimulate aldosterone secretion from zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells. There is also proof that they can also enhance aldosterone secretion indirectly, by eliciting the release from <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells of catecholamines and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn may act on the cortical cells in a paracrine manner. The involvement of VIP and PACAP in the regulation of glucocorticoid secretion from inner adrenocortical cells is doubtful and surely of minor relevance. VIP and PACAP stimulate the synthesis and release of adrenomedullary catecholamines, and all three subtypes of PACAP/VIP Rs mediate this effect, PAC(1)-Rs being coupled to AC, VPAC(1)-Rs to both AC and PLC, and VPAC(2)-Rs only to PLC. A privotal role in the catecholamine secretagogue action of VIP and PACAP is played by Ca(2+). VIP and PACAP may also modulate the growth of the adrenal cortex and medulla. The concentrations attained by VIP and PACAP in the blood rule out the possibility that they act as true circulating hormones. Conversely, their adrenal content is consistent with a local autocrine-paracrine mechanism of action.",M1
16691441,"Gene expression of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice during stress exposure.1. AIMS: Epinephrine (EPI) synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, EC 2.1.1.28) is primarily localized in the adrenal medulla (AM). We have recently described existence of the PNMT gene expression in cardiac atria and ventricles and in sympathetic ganglia of adult rats and mice. The aim of the present work was to study regulation of the PNMT gene expression in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice (CRH KO) and matched control wild-type mice (WT) under normal and stress conditions. 2. METHODS: Levels of the PNMT mRNA were determined by RT-PCR; PNMT immunoprotein and protein of transcription factor EGR-1 by Western Blot. Plasma EPI and corticosterone (CORT) levels were determined by radioenzymatic and RIA methods. Immobilization (IMMO) was used as a stressor. 3. RESULTS: Stress-induced increases in the PNMT mRNA and protein levels observed in WT mice were almost completely absent in CRH KO mouse adrenal medulla, stellate ganglia, and cardiac atria, while ventricular PNMT mRNA elevation was not CRH-dependent. Plasma EPI and CORT levels were markedly reduced in CRH KO compared to WT mice both before and after the stress. Levels of EGR-1, crucial transcription factor for regulation of the PNMT were highly increased in stressed WT and CRH KO mice in cardiac areas, but not in the adrenal medulla. 4. CONCLUSIONS: Data show that the CRH deficiency can markedly prevent immobilization-triggered induction of the PNMT mRNA and protein levels in the adrenal medulla and stellate ganglia. Reduced plasma epinephrine and corticosterone levels and adrenal <e>medullary</e> EGR-1 protein levels in CRH knockout versus WT mice during stress indicate that the HPA axis plays a crucial role in regulation of the PNMT gene expression in these organs. Cardiac atrial PNMT gene expression with stress is also dependent on intact HPA axis. However, in cardiac ventricles, especially after the single stress exposure, its expression is not impaired by CRH deficiency. Since cardiac EGR-1 protein levels in CRH KO mice are also not affected by the single stress exposure, we propose existence of different regulation of the PNMT gene expression, especially in the cardiac ventricles.Overall, our findings reveal that the PNMT gene expression is regulated through the HPA in both sympathoadrenal system and the heart and also via EGR-1 in the adrenal medulla, but apparently not in the heart. Regulation of the PNMT gene expression in various compartments of heart includes both corticosterone-dependent and independent mechanisms.",M1
16675526,"Regulation of alternative splicing of Slo K+ channels in adrenal and pituitary during the stress-hyporesponsive period of rat development.Stress triggers release of ACTH from the pituitary, glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, and epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. Although functions differ, these hormone systems interact in many ways. Previous evidence indicates that pituitary and steroid hormones regulate alternative splicing of the Slo gene at the stress axis-regulated exon (STREX), with functional implications for the calcium-activated K+ channels prominent in adrenal <e>medullary</e> and pituitary cells. Here we examine the role of corticosterone in Slo splicing regulation in pituitary and adrenal tissues during the stress-hyporesponsive period of early rat postnatal life. The sharp drop in plasma corticosterone (CORT) that defines this period offers a unique opportunity to test CORT's role in Slo splicing. We report that in both adrenal and pituitary tissues, the percentage of Slo transcripts having STREX declines and recovers in parallel with CORT. Moreover, addition of 500 nm CORT to cultures of anterior pituitary cells from 13-, 21-, and 30-d postnatal animals increased the percentage of Slo transcripts with STREX, whereas 20 microm CORT reduced STREX representation. Applied to adrenal chromaffin cells, 20 microm CORT decreased STREX inclusion, whereas neither 500 nm nor 2 microm had any effect. The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist RU28318 abolished the effect of 500 nm CORT on splicing in pituitary cells, whereas the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 blocked the effect of 20 microm CORT on adrenal chromaffin cells. These results support the hypothesis that the abrupt, transient drop in CORT during the stress-hyporesponsive period drives the transient decline in STREX splice variant representation in pituitary, but not adrenal.",M1
16621326,"The four-dimensional stress test: psychological, sympathetic-adrenal-<e>medullary</e>, parasympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses following inhalation of 35% CO2.BACKGROUND: Hypercapnia is a threat to homeostasis and results in neuroendocrine, autonomic and anxiogenic responses. The inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) may, therefore, provide a good paradigm for exploring the pathways by which stress can lead to increased susceptibility to ill-health through physiological and psychological stress reactivity. The current study was designed, therefore, to assess the psychological and physiological responses to the inhalation of CO2. METHODS: Healthy participants (N = 24) inhaled a single vital capacity breath of a mixture of CO2 (35%) and oxygen (65%). Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded for 5 min before and after the test and blood and saliva samples were taken immediately before and 2, 10, 20 and 30 min post-inhalation for the measurement of noradrenaline, salivary and serum cortisol and salivary alpha amylase. In addition, psychosomatic symptoms were recorded immediately before and after the test. The same protocol was repeated 4-6 weeks later at the same time of day. RESULTS: A single inhalation of CO2 increased blood pressure, noradrenaline, salivary alpha amylase and psychosomatic symptoms, but decreased heart rate at both testing sessions. Analyses of salivary cortisol data revealed that 70% of the sample could be reliably classified as either responders (i.e. demonstrated a post-CO2 cortisol increase) or non-responders (i.e. responded with a decrease or no change in cortisol following CO2) at both test sessions. Responders also perceived the test to be more aversive than non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of 35% CO2 reliably stimulated the key mechanisms involved in the human stress response. The inter-individual differences in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis were also related to differences in the perception of the test.",M1
16596016,"[Neurotrophic factor responsiveness of adrenal <e>medullary</e> cell line tsAM5D immortalized with temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen]We established adrenal medullary cell lines from transgenic mice expressing an oncogene, the temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen, under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. A clonal cell line, named tsAM5D, conditionally grew at a permissive temperature of 33 degrees C and exhibited the dopaminergic chromaffin cell phenotype as exemplified by the expression pattern of mRNA for catecholamine synthesizing-enzymes and secretory vesicle-associated proteins. tsAM5D cells proliferated at the permissive temperature in response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). At a nonpermissive temperature of 39 degrees C, GDNF and CNTF acted synergistically to differentiate tsAM5D cells into neuron-like cells. In addition, tsAM5D cells caused to differentiate by GDNF plus CNTF at 39 degrees C became dependent solely on nerve growth factor for their survival and showed markedly enhanced neurite outgrowth. In the presence of GDNF plus CNTF, the morphological change induced by the temperature shift was associated with up-regulated expression of neuronal marker genes including microtubule-associated protein 2, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament, and growth-associated protein-43, indicating that the cells underwent neuronal differentiation. Thus, we demonstrated that tsAM5D cells could proliferate at permissive 33 degrees C, and also had the capacity to terminally differentiate into neuron-like cells in response to GDNF plus CNTF when the oncogene was inactivated by shifting the temperature to nonpermissive 39 degrees C. These results suggest that tsAM5D cells should be a good tool to allow a detailed study of mechanisms regulating neuronal differentiation.",M1
16556729,"Targeted ablation of the chromogranin a (Chga) gene: normal neuroendocrine dense-core secretory granules and increased expression of other granins.Chromogranin A (CgA), originally identified in adrenal chromaffin cells, is a member of the granin family of acidic secretory glycoproteins that are expressed in endocrine cells and neurons. CgA has been proposed to play multiple roles in the secretory process. Intracellularly, CgA may control secretory granule biogenesis and target neurotransmitters and peptide hormones to granules of the regulated pathway. Extracellularly, peptides formed as a result of proteolytic processing of CgA may regulate hormone secretion. To investigate the role of CgA in the whole animal, we created a mouse mutant null for the Chga gene. These mice are viable and fertile and have no obvious developmental abnormalities, and their neural and endocrine functions are not grossly impaired. Their adrenal glands were structurally unremarkable, and morphometric analyses of chromaffin cells showed vesicle size and number to be normal. However, the excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine was significantly elevated in the Chga null mutants. Adrenal <e>medullary</e> mRNA and protein levels of other dense-core secretory granule proteins including chromogranin B, and secretogranins II to VI were up-regulated 2- to 3-fold in the Chga null mutant mice. Hence, the increased expression of the other granin family members is likely to compensate for the Chga deficiency.",M1
16525720,"Atrial natriuretic peptide enhances cortisol secretion from guinea-pig adrenal gland: evidence for an indirect paracrine mechanism probably involving the local release of <e>medullary</e> catecholamines.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a regulatory hormone widely expressed, along with its receptors, in organs and body tissues. ANP is well known to inhibit aldosterone secretion from mammalian adrenals, but its effect on glucocorticoid-hormone production is controversial. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged ANP administration raised the plasma concentration of cortisol in both normal and dexamethasone/captopril-treated guinea pigs (i.e. in animals with pharmacologically interrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system). ANP did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig zona fasciculata-reticularis cells, but enhanced catecholamine release from adrenomedullary cells. ANP stimulated cortisol output from guinea pig adrenal slices containing medullary chromaffin tissue, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol blocked this effect. The conclusion is drawn that ANP, when the structural integrity of the adrenal gland is preserved, is able to enhance glucocorticoid secretion in guinea pigs, through an indirect mechanism involving the rise in the catecholamine release, which in turn, acting in a paracrine manner, stimulate secretion of inner adrenocortical cells.",M1
16408233,"Influence of the menstrual cycle on proenkephalin peptide F responses to maximal cycle exercise.Proenkephalin peptide F [107-140] is an enkephalin-containing peptide found predominantly within the adrenal medulla and is co-packaged with epinephrine within adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin granules. Peptide F has been shown to have the classic opioid analgesia effects along with immune cell interactions. This is only the second peptide F study in women, and in it we compare the responses of peptide F to a maximal cycle exercise test and recovery values over the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Eight untrained (directly documented in this study) women who were eumenorrheic performed a progressive maximal exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer, once during the follicular phase, and once during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Blood was obtained pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise and at 0, 15, and 30 min into recovery. Typical exercise changes in response to the cycle tests were observed with blood lactate increases that remained elevated 30 min into recovery. No significant exercise-induced elevations were observed for peptide F concentrations with exercise nor were any differences observed between the two menstrual phases. Thus, the effects of the menstrual cycle on peptide F concentrations appear to be minimal under the conditions of this investigation. With high concentrations of peptide F observed at rest (approx. 0.2-0.3 pmol ml(-1)) pre-exercise arousal mechanisms may have obviated any exercise-induced response. In addition, inhibition via elevated epinephrine may have inhibited any post-exercise increases and finally adrenal medullary capacity for circulatory concentrations of peptide F may have been reached in such untrained women. Pre-exercise arousal mechanisms potentially related to analgesia may also be involved to prepare untrained women for the stress of maximal exercise.",M1
16374612,"Fine ultrastructure of chromaffin granules in rat adrenal medulla indicative of a vesicle-mediated secretory process.Observation by transmission electron microscopy, coupled with morphometric analysis and estimation procedure, revealed unique ultrastructural features in 25.94% of noradrenaline (NA)-containing granules and 16.85% of adrenaline (A)-containing granules in the rat adrenal medulla. These consisted of evaginations of the granule limiting membrane to form budding structures having different morphology and extension. In 14.8% of NA granules and 12.0% of A granules, outpouches were relatively short, looked like small blebs emerging from the granule surface and generally contained electron-dense material. A proportion of 11.2% of NA granules and 4.9% of A granules revealed the most striking ultrastructural features. These secretory organelles presented thin, elongated, tail-like or stem-like appendages, which were variably filled by chromaffin substance and terminated with spherical expansions of different electron density. A cohort of vesicles of variable size (30-150 nm in diameter) and content was found either close to them or in the intergranular cytosol. Examination of adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells fixed by zinc iodide-osmium tetroxide (ZIO) revealed fine electron dense precipitates in chromaffin granules, budding structures as well as cytoplasmic vesicles. These data indicate that a common constituent is revealed by the ZIO histochemical reaction in chromaffin cells. As catecholic compounds are the main tissue targets of ZIO complexes, catecholamines are good candidates to be responsible for the observed ZIO reactivity. This study adds further to the hypothesis that release of secretory material from chromaffin granules may be accomplished by a vesiclular transport mechanism typical of piecemeal degranulation.",M1
16352394,"Phospholipase C isozymes are differentially distributed in the rat adrenal medulla.Immunohistochemistry has been used to examine the distribution of selected phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes within the adrenal medulla of the rat. PLCbeta isozymes were expressed at moderate levels in the chromaffin cells but more strongly in association with ganglion cell clusters. PLCbeta2 and PLCbeta3 staining of clusters did not overlap suggesting selective PLC isozyme expression in two distinct ganglionic types. The distribution of PLCbeta4 immunoreactivity was very similar to PLCbeta3 with the strongest staining observed in the same cell clusters. Antibodies to PLCbeta1 labelled multiple bands on Western blots and were not therefore used for immunohistochemistry. The chromaffin cells were also immunoreactive for PLCgamma1, although the strongest staining with this antibody was seen in cells surrounding large sinus vessels. PLCdelta1 and PLCdelta2 had quite distinct distributions, with the former selectively localized to an endothelial cell population surrounding the chromaffin cells. This observation was supported by experiments on isolated bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells where PLCdelta1 expression was lost when the cell preparation was enriched for chromaffin cells. Antibodies to PLCdelta2 labelled a network of nerve fibres throughout the medulla and clusters of ganglion cells located primarily at the medullary-cortical boundary. PLCdelta2 immunoreactivity was also present in nerve fibres within the adrenal capsule where it appeared to be co-localized with PLCbeta4 staining.",M1

MGluR2/3, mGluR4a and GluR2/3 immunoreactivities were observed in large-sized, centrally located type I adrenal medullary ganglion neurons. Furthermore, the small-sized type II adrenal ganglion neurons identified by their immunoreactivity to brain nitric oxide synthase (bNOS), also expressed mGluR2/3, mGluR4a and GluR2/3. These cells were disposed in the peripheral portion of the adrenal medulla. None of the type I neurons were positively labeled for bNOS.

16307725,"Stimulation of catecholamine synthesis through unique estrogen receptors in the bovine adrenomedullary plasma membrane by 17beta-estradiol.Incubation of cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) (0.3-100nM) or membrane-impermeable E(2)-bovine serum albumin (100nM) acutely increased (14)C-catecholamine synthesis from [(14)C]tyrosine. The stimulatory effect of E(2) was not inhibited by ICI182,780, a nuclear estrogen receptor inhibitor. E(2) also increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity and p44/42MAPK phosphorylation, the former of which was attenuated by U0126, an inhibitor of p44/42MAPK kinase. The plasma membrane isolated from the gland showed two classes of specific binding sites of [(3)H]E(2) with apparent K(d)s of 3.2 and 106nM, and B(max)s of 0.44 and 8.5pmol/mg protein, respectively. The high-affinity binding of [(3)H]E(2) was most strongly inhibited by E(2) and phytoestrogens, and to lesser extents by other steroid hormones, while it was enhanced by ICI182,780 and environmental estrogenic pollutants. These findings suggest that E(2) acutely stimulates catecholamine synthesis via activation of p44/42MAPK through unique estrogen receptors in the plasma membrane of bovine adrenal medulla.",M1

The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to measure K+ currents in dissociated adult ovine chromaffin cells as well as SK channel currents expressed in the H4IIE cell line. 3. Diphenyliodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, had no effect on the hypoxia-evoked closure of K+ channels in primary AMCC, whereas the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone abolished the hypoxia-evoked response. Both these compounds significantly reduced K+ current amplitude under normoxic conditions. 4. One possible mechanism through which the oxygen sensor may modulate K+ channel activity is by altering the redox state of the cell. In sheep AMCC, altering the redox state by the addition of H2O2 to the extracellular solution increased K+ conductance. 5. The oxygen-sensitive K+ (Ko2) channels in sheep chromaffin cells are from the SK family and the whole-cell conductance of cells expressing mouse SK2 or SK3, but not human SK1, was increased by H2O2 and decreased by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. 6. These studies show that, in sheep AMCC, Ko2 channels are modulated via a rotenone-sensitive mechanism and that alteration of the cellular redox state mimics the change produced by alterations in Po2. In a heterologous expression system, SK2 and SK3 channels, the channels that initiate hypoxia-evoked changes in AMCC function, are modulated appropriately by changes in cellular redox state.",M1
16158449,"Effects of zotepine and olanzapine on noradrenaline transporter in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.BACKGROUND: Previously, it was demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and risperidone on noradrenaline transporter (NAT) might in part be associated with their clinical profile. The present study examined the effects of zotepine on NAT in the cells and compared them with those of olanzapine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adrenal medullary cells were isolated by a method of collagenase digestion of slices of fresh bovine adrenal medulla and the cells were plated at a density of 4 x 10(6) cells. Cells were incubated with [3H]noradrenaline (NA) in the presence or absence of zotepine or olanzapine. The amount of radioactivity taken into the cells was counted by a liquid scintillation counter. Plasma membranes of bovine adrenal medulla were prepared, and the binding of [3H]desipramine (DMI) was determined by incubating the membrane suspension in binding buffer together with zotepine or olanzapine. Specific binding of [3H] DMI was defined as that binding which was inhibited by nisoxetine. RESULTS: Both zotepine (10-1000 ng/ml) and olanzapine (10-1000 ng/ml) decreased [3H]NA uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of zotepine and olanzapine on [3H]NA uptake were 10 +/- 4 and 14 +/- 8 ng/ml, respectively. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of [3H]NA uptake showed that treatment with zotepine and olanzapine decreased the V(max) of uptake without changing the K(m). Both zotepine (10-1000 ng/ml) and olanzapine (30-1000 ng/ml) inhibited [3H]DMI binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of zotepine and olanzapine on [3H]DMI binding were 50 +/- 18, and 120 +/- 38 ng/ml, respectively. Scatchard plot analysis of [3H]DMI binding showed that zotepine and olanzapine decreased the B(max) of binding without altering the K(d). CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effects of zotepine and olanzapine might be responsible in part for their clinical profile.",M1
16153610,"Effect of prolonged exposure to milnacipran on norepinephrine transporter in cultured bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.The antidepressants milnacipran and paroxetine are used clinically worldwide. In the present study, we report here the effects of treatment with milnacipran and paroxetine on the functional activity, binding sites, and mRNA of the norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. In acute treatment with antidepressants for 20 min, both milnacipran and paroxetine competitively inhibited NET function in cultured adrenal medullary cells. Prolonged treatment of adrenal medullary cells with milnacipran produced time (48-96h)- and concentration (35-355 nM)-dependent increases in [3H]NE uptake and [3H]DMI binding without any increase in NET mRNA. At a high concentration (800 nM, 72 h), paroxetine suppressed [3H]NE uptake. To examine whether milnacipran-induced [3H]NE uptake is mediated by newly synthesized mRNAs or proteins, we used actinomycin D, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of ribosomal protein synthesis. Cycloheximide (1 micorM, 72 h) abolished the effect of milnacipran on [3H]NE uptake, while the stimulatory effect of milnacipran was observed in actinomycin D-treated cells. The present findings suggest that prolonged exposure to milnacipran up-regulates the NET function, probably through a post-transcriptional process of NET or other proteins.",M1
16146570,"Rats with steroid-induced polycystic ovaries develop hypertension and increased sympathetic nervous system activity.BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder associated with ovulatory dysfunction, abdominal obesity, hyperandrogenism, hypertension, and insulin resistance. METHODS: Our objectives in this study were (1) to estimate sympathetic-adrenal <e>medullary</e> (SAM) activity by measuring mean systolic blood pressure (MSAP) in rats with estradiol valerate (EV)-induced PCO; (2) to estimate alpha1a and alpha2a adrenoceptor expression in a brain area thought to mediate central effects on MSAP regulation and in the adrenal medulla; (3) to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation by measuring adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in response to novel-environment stress; and (4) to measure abdominal obesity, sex steroids, and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: The PCO rats had significantly higher MSAP than controls, higher levels of alpha1a adrenoceptor mRNA in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and lower levels of alpha2a adrenoceptor mRNA in the PVN and adrenal medulla. After exposure to stress, PCO rats had higher ACTH and CORT levels. Plasma testosterone concentrations were lower in PCO rats, and no differences in insulin sensitivity or in the weight of intraabdominal fat depots were found. CONCLUSION: Thus, rats with EV-induced PCO develop hypertension and increased sympathetic and HPA-axis activity without reduced insulin sensitivity, obesity, or hyperandrogenism. These findings may have implications for mechanisms underlying hypertension in PCOS.",M1
16139964,"Dysfunction of releasing adrenaline in asthma by nerve growth factor.In early embryo period, adrenal medulla development is parallel with adrenergic nerves. For this reason, adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells may be provided with potential ability of transdifferentiation toward nerve cells. In vitro, it was well testified that if adrenal medullary cells are treated with nerve growth factor, then the cells will be transdifferentiated toward sympathetic neurons characterized by morphous, biochemistry and physiological functions. As a result, adrenal medullary cells after being transdifferentiated may be impaired in the functions of endocrine secretion, and the composition and level of adrenal medullary hormone are changed. The above mentioned may be regarded as the reflection of cellular redundancy, besides the transdifferentiation, multiple organelle copies, cellular plasticity and so on are all reflections of cellular redundancy. According to cellular redundancy, in addition to their regular and specific functions, some cells(types) are of other additional functions which will be activated in special state such as diseases, external interference and so on. The theory of cellular redundancy is seemed to unpuzzle the dysfunction of releasing adrenaline in asthma. Compared with the normal control group, the study showed that the levels of adrenaline in the asthmatic patients were not increased when patients encountered the strong stimuli. Subsequently, overexpression of nerve growth factor was also detected in asthmatic patients and animals. However, accompanied with alleviation of airway inflammation, these phenomena were changed when asthmatic models were treated with antibody of nerve growth factor. What makes these phenomena linked? The existence of functional redundancy of medullary cells may be the most important factor. This hypothesis suggests that overexpression of nerve growth factor activate functional redundancy of adrenal medullary cells, which makes these cells transdifferentiated toward sympathetic neurons. The transdifferentiation (tendency) may impair the functions of endocrine secretion of adrenal medullary cells. As a result, adrenal medulla cannot release enough adrenaline to relieve bronchoconstriction in asthmatic attack.",M1
16047163,"Expression of the noradrenaline transporter and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in normal human adrenal gland and phaeochromocytoma.Expression of the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) was examined in normal human adrenal medulla and phaeochromocytoma by using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) were used as catecholamine biosynthetic markers and chromogranin A (CGA) as a marker for secretory granules. Catecholamine content was measured by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In normal human adrenal medulla (n=5), all chromaffin cells demonstrated strong TH, PNMT and NAT immunoreactivity. NAT was co-localized with PNMT and was located within the cytoplasm with a punctate appearance. Human phaeochromocytomas demonstrated strong TH expression (n=20 samples tested) but variable NAT and PNMT expression (n=24). NAT immunoreactivity ranged from absent (n=3) to weak (n=10) and strong (n=11) and, in some cases, occupied an apparent nuclear location. Unlike the expression seen in normal human adrenal <e>medullary</e> tissue, NAT expression was not consistently co-localized with PNMT. PNMT also showed highly variable expression that was poorly correlated with tumour adrenaline content. Immunoreactivity for CGA was colocalized with NAT within the cytoplasm of normal human chromaffin cells (n=4). This co-localization was not consistent in phaeochromocytoma tumour cells (n=7). The altered pattern of expression for both NAT and PNMT in phaeochromocytoma indicates a significant disruption in the regulation and possibly in the function of these proteins in adrenal medullary tumours.",M1
16026475,"Estrogen regulates adrenal <e>medullary</e> function producing sexual dimorphism in nociceptive threshold and beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated hyperalgesia in the rat.Epinephrine produces sexually dimorphic beta(2)-adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanical hyperalgesia, with male rats exhibiting greater hyperalgesia. Because female rats have higher plasma epinephrine levels, and beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity is affected by chronic exposure to agonists, we tested the hypothesis that this sexual dimorphism is due to epinephrine-induced desensitization of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Following gonadectomy, epinephrine hyperalgesia, as measured by the Randall-Selitto paw-withdrawal test, was unchanged in male rats while in females it was increased. Prepubertal male and female rats do not demonstrate sexual dimorphism in either plasma epinephrine level or epinephrine-induced hyperalgesia. Adrenal medullectomy and adrenal denervation both significantly enhanced epinephrine hyperalgesia, but only in females. In contrast, the sexually dimorphic hyperalgesia induced by prostaglandin E(2), another agent that acts directly to sensitize primary afferent nociceptors, was not enhanced by adrenal medullectomy or denervation. Chronic administration of epinephrine in male rats, to produce plasma levels similar to those of gonad-intact females, significantly attenuated epinephrine-induced hyperalgesia, making it similar to that in females. These results strongly support the suggestion that estrogen regulates plasma epinephrine in female rats and differential sensitivity to beta(2)-adrenergic agonists accounts for the sexual dimorphism in epinephrine-induced hyperalgesia. Unexpectedly, regulation of adrenal medullary function by estrogen was also found to modulate baseline nociceptive threshold such that females had a lower nociceptive threshold.",M1
15977598,"Asymptomatic adrenal <e>medullary</e> hyperplasia detected with intraoperative hypertension: a case report.We report a rare case of asymptomatic adrenal medullary hyperplasia detected by chance with intraoperative hypertension during surgery for ipsilateral renal cell carcinoma. A 41-year-old male visited our hospital with a complaint of left flank pain. He had normal blood pressure and plasma catecholamine level was within normal limits. Ultrasonogram and CT scan revealed a left renal tumor but did not showed any abnormal masses in the left adrenal gland. The clinical diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma and we performed left total nephrectomy. In the process of operative manipulation, however, the blood pressure and pulse rate of this patient showed a marked increase. Pathological examination of the extirpated kidney revealed renalcell carcinoma, while the resected adrenal gland was diagnosed as adrenal medullary hyperplasia.",M1
15929555,"NMDA antagonist peptide supplementation enhances pain alleviation by adrenal <e>medullary</e> transplants.Spinal transplantation of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells has been shown to decrease pain responses in several animal models. Improved potency may be possible by engineering cells to produce greater levels of naturally derived analgesics. As an initial screen for potential candidates, adrenal medullary transplants were evaluated in combination with exogenously administered neuropeptides in rodent pain models. Histogranin is a 15-amino acid peptide that exhibits NMDA receptor antagonist activity. The stable derivative [Ser1]histogranin (SHG) can attenuate pain symptoms in some animal models. The formalin model for neurogenic inflammatory pain and the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model for neuropathic pain were used to evaluate the combined effects of chromaffin cell transplantation and intrathecal (IT) SHG injections. Animals were implanted with either adrenal medullary or control striated muscle tissue in the spinal subarachnoid space. For evaluation of formalin responses, animals were pretreated with SHG (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 microg) followed by an intraplantar injection of formalin, and flinching responses were quantified. Pretreatment with SHG had no significant effect on flinching behavior in control animals at lower doses, with incomplete attenuation only at the highest dose. In contrast, 0.5 microg SHG significantly reduced flinching responses in animals with adrenal medullary transplants, and 1.0 microg nearly completely eliminated flinching in these animals in the tonic phase. For evaluation of effects on neuropathic pain, animals received transplants 1 week following CCI, and were tested for thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia before and following SHG treatment. The addition of low doses of SHG nearly completely eliminated neuropathic pain symptoms in adrenal medullary transplanted animals, while in control transplanted animals only thermal hyperalgesia was attenuated, at the highest dose of SHG. These results suggest that SHG can augment adrenal medullary transplants, and the combination may result in improved effectiveness and range in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.",M1
15927540,"A new focus on interoceptive properties of adrenal medulla.The adrenal medulla is an important part of the sympathoadrenal system. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla respond to a broad spectrum of stressful situations by releasing epinephrine and norepinephrine. Originally, it was accepted that this response is controlled exclusively by central nervous system structures. However, it was also demonstrated that a surgically denervated adrenal medulla can respond directly by secreting epinephrine and norepinephrine during an imbalance of internal environment (hypoglycemia, asphyxia). Published data had documented the innervation of the adrenal medulla by sensory neurons of spinal dorsal root ganglia. In addition, recent data showed that ganglion cells of the adrenal medulla project ascending axons. These data suggested potential transmission of information from the adrenal medulla to the central nervous system regarding metabolic changes in the blood. This paper presents an overview of possible involvement of adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells in the detection of changes in the internal environment and in the transmission of this information to the central nervous system.",M1
15837122,"Up-regulation of ret by reserpine in the adult rat adrenal medulla.The receptor tyrosine kinase, ret, is activated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin and related ligands that bind to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-tailed receptors GFRalpha1-4. Ret expression is developmentally regulated and detectable only at very low levels in adult adrenal medulla. However, mutations of ret that cause constitutive activation or alter signal transduction give rise to adrenal <e>medullary</e> hyperplasia and pheochromocytomas in humans with hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes 2A and 2B and in animal models. These discordant observations pose the conundrum of how a molecule barely detectable in the adult adrenal can contribute to development of adrenal medullary pathology that typically occurs in adults. We recently reported that depolarization and phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C act synergistically with neurturin to up-regulate ret protein and mRNA expression in adult rat chromaffin cell cultures. Those findings suggested that ret expression in vivo is not static and might be regulated in part by neurally derived signals. We show here that the anti-hypertensive agent reserpine, which is known to cause a reflex increase in trans-synaptic stimulation of chromaffin cells, increases expression of ret mRNA and protein in adult rat adrenal medullary tissue in vivo. Elevated ret protein levels are detectable both by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry, which shows immunoreactive ret in chromaffin cells and neurons after reserpine administration. The finding that ret expression is subject to up-regulation by environmental signals in vivo suggests that epigenetic factors might influence the development of adrenal medullary disease by affecting the expression of ret. It is known that long-term administration of reserpine leads to the development of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytomas in rats. Our findings suggest potential utility of the rat model for studying the roles of ret in the adrenal medulla and the mechanisms of its involvement in MEN 2 and other pheochromocytoma syndromes.",M1
15771677,"Morphology and histology of the atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) adrenal gland with emphasis on the medulla.This study provides the first detailed description of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) adrenal gland with emphasis on the medulla. Thirty-one dolphins of varying age and sex were used in this study. No statistical differences were found between the right and left gland mass, however, the left was typically greater. Mean mass for the right and left adrenal glands were 4.99 +/- 0.513 and 5.36 +/- 0.558 g, respectively. No statistical differences were found between average gland mass and sexual maturity or sex. The average cortex/medulla ratio was 1.22 +/- 0.060 meaning approximately 48% is cortex, 41% is medulla, and 11% was categorized as other (i.e. blood vessels, connective tissue, etc.). The cortex contained pseudolobules and the typical zonation. A <e>medullary</e> band, consisting of highly basophilic staining cells was found at the periphery of the medulla. Projections of the medulla to the gland capsule were noted. Immunolabelling with polyclonal antibodies against the enzymes dopamine beta hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase indicated that noradrenaline producing cells are found throughout the medulla including the medullary band while adrenaline producing cells are only found within the medullary band. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of two distinct cell populations within the medullary band and a single cell population throughout the medulla.",M1
15764017,"The role of the anterodorsal thalami nuclei in the regulation of adrenal <e>medullary</e> function, beta-adrenergic cardiac receptors and anxiety responses in maternally deprived rats under stressful conditions.Maternal separation can interfere with growth and development of the brain and represents a significant risk factor for adult psychopathology. In rodents, prolonged separation from the mother affects the behavioral and endocrine responses to stress for the lifetime of the animal. Limbic structures such as the anterodorsal thalamic nuclei (ADTN) play an important role in the control of neuroendocrine and sympathetic-adrenal function. In view of these findings we hypothesized that the function of the ADTN may be affected in an animal model of maternal deprivation. To test this hypothesis female rats were isolated 4.5 h daily, during the first 3 weeks of life and tested as adults. We evaluated plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), cardiac adrenoreceptors and anxiety responses after maternal deprivation and variable chronic stress (VCS) in ADTN-lesioned rats. Thirty days after ADTN lesion, in non-maternally deprived rats basal plasma NE concentration was greater and cardiac beta-adrenoreceptor density was lower than that in the sham-lesioned group. Maternal deprivation induced a significant increase in basal plasma NE concentration, which was greater in lesioned rats, and cardiac beta-adrenoreceptor density was decreased in lesioned rats. After VCS plasma catecholamine concentration was much greater in non-maternally deprived rats than in maternally-deprived rats; cardiac beta-adrenoreceptor density was decreased by VCS in both maternally-deprived and non-deprived rats, but more so in non-deprived rats, and further decreased by the ADTN lesion. In the plus maze test, the number of open arm entries was greater in the maternally deprived and in the stressed rats. Thus, sympathetic-adrenal medullary activation produced by VCS was much greater in non-deprived rats, and was linked to a down regulation of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. The ADTN are not responsible for the reduced catecholamine responses to stress in maternally-deprived rats. Maternal deprivation or chronic stress also induced a long term anxiolytic effect, which was also not affected by ADTN lesion.",M1
15736041,"Immunocytochemical developmental patterns of the thoracolumbar sympathetic chain in the chick and a comparison with its adrenal counterpart.The immunocytochemical development of the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion and its adrenal counterpart was studied in the chick from days 3.5 to 12 of incubation, using antibodies to 17 separate antigens, including antibodies to pan-neuroendocrine markers, catecholamine-synthesizing and proprotein-processing enzymes, and neuropeptides. Some of the antigens studied (Go protein-alpha subunit, thyrosine hydroxylase, and galanin) were strongly expressed from the first days of development, whereas others (chromogranin-A, chromogranin-B, 7B2 protein, and somatostatin) showed a diverse immunoreactive expression at different stages. Three different patterns were found in the development of both adrenal medulla and thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion. In the first (chromogranin-A and B, Go protein-alpha subunit, tyrosine hydroxylase, HNK-1, and galanin), virtually all <e>medullary</e> and thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion cells were strongly immunostained from day 4 onward. Except for HNK-1, chromogranin-A and B, there was a steady increase in immunoreactive cells for all the remaining antigens up to day 12. In the second (7B2 protein, proprotein convertase 2, and secretogranin II), full antigenic expression was reached in medullary and thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion cells by day 10. In the third pattern (proprotein convertase 3, somatostatin, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, neuron-specific enolase, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and met-enkephalin), differences in immunoreactivity were observed between the medullary and thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion cells.",M1
15714298,"Selective blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by pimobendan, a drug for the treatment of heart failure: reduction of catecholamine secretion and synthesis in adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells.Pimobendan, a Ca(2+) sensitizer, is used clinically in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Although chronic heart failure is associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system, it remains unknown whether pimobendan affects the function of sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Here, we report the inhibitory effects of pimobendan on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Pimobendan decreased the catecholamine secretion (IC(50)=29.5 microM) elicited by carbachol, an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but not that elicited by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, or by high K(+), an activator of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. Pimobendan also inhibited carbachol-induced influx of (22)Na(+) (IC(50)=25.9 microM) and (45)Ca(2+) (IC(50)=26.0 microM), but not veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx or high K(+)-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx. The reduction of catecholamine secretion caused by pimobendan was not overcome by increasing the concentration of carbachol. UD-CG 212, an active metabolite of pimobendan, lowered carbachol-induced catecholamine secretion with a concentration/inhibition curve similar to that of pimobendan. In experiments in situ, pimobendan suppressed both basal and carbachol-stimulated (14)C-catecholamine synthesis (IC(50)=5.3 and 4.9 microM) from [(14)C] tyrosine [but not from L: -3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl [3-(14)C] alanine ([(14)C]DOPA)], as well as tyrosine hydroxylase activity (IC(50)=3.8 and 4.3 microM). These findings suggest that pimobendan inhibits carbachol-induced catecholamines secretion and synthesis through suppression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",M1
15695243,"Subunit composition and role of Na+,K+-ATPases in adrenal chromaffin cells.Adrenal <e>medullary</e> (AM) cells are exposed to high concentrations of cortical hormones, one of which is a ouabain-like substance. Thus, the effects of ouabain on catecholamine secretion and distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase alpha and beta subunits in rat and guinea-pig AM cells were examined using amperometry and immunological techniques. While exposure to 1 microm ouabain did not have a marked effect on resting secretion, it induced an increase in secretion due to mobilization of Ca2+ ions that were stored during a 4 min interval between muscarine applications. Immunocytochemistry revealed that Na+,K+-ATPase alpha1 subunit-like and beta3 subunit-like immunoreactive (IR) materials were distributed ubiquitously at the cell periphery, whereas alpha2- and beta2-like IR materials were present in restricted parts of the cell periphery. The alpha1 and alpha2 subunits were mainly immunoprecipitated from AM preparations by anti-beta3 and anti-beta2 antisera, respectively. Peripheral BODIPY-FL-InsP3 binding sites were localized below membrane domains with alpha2- and beta2-like IR materials. The results indicate that in AM cells, alpha1beta3 isozymes of Na+,K+-ATPase were present ubiquitously in the plasma membrane, while alpha2beta2 isozymes were in the membrane domain closely associated with peripheral Ca2+ store sites. This close association of the alpha2beta2 isozyme with peripheral Ca2+ store sites may account for the facilitation of mobilization-dependent secretion in the presence of 1 microm ouabain.",M1
15677423,"Psychosocial stress-induced activation of salivary alpha-amylase: an indicator of sympathetic activity?Assessment of sympathoadrenal <e>medullary</e> system (SAM) activity is only possible to date via measurement of catecholamines in blood plasma or via electrophysiological methods. Both ways of measurement are restricted to endocrinological or psychophysiological laboratories, as both require either immediate freezing of blood samples or complex recording devices. Efforts have therefore been undertaken to find a method comparable to salivary cortisol measurements, in which noninvasive samples can be taken at any place and stored at room temperature for sufficient time before later analysis in the laboratory. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) is a candidate that may prove useful in this context. We show here that sAA activity is increased by acute psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test) and that increases in sAA correlate with increases in norepinephrine. We further report that sAA exhibits a stable circadian pattern that mirrors that of salivary cortisol. In conclusion, the current data show that salivary alpha-amylase may serve as an easy-to-use index for SAM activity. However, some questions remain to be answered; for example, what impact does salivary flow rate exert on stress-induced sAA activity?",M1
15637337,"Upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase mRNA and protein in adrenal medulla of water-deprived rats.Experiments were performed to investigate whether adrenal neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA and protein expression are responsive to alterations in body volume. Using an RT-PCR technique, the relative quantities of nNOS mRNA as well as the tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA in the adrenals of water-deprived rats significantly increased from 12 hr to 4 days. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical study showed that water deprivation activated nNOS mRNA and protein expression in the adrenal medulla. Four days after water deprivation, nNOS protein expression determined by Western blot significantly increased in the adrenal gland. Our results are the first to demonstrate that nNOS syntheses in the adrenal medulla are markedly increased in water-deprived rats. This study also indicates that the upregulation of nNOS synthesis of the adrenal medulla is associated with the activation of adrenal <e>medullary</e> function in the face of volume depletion.",M1
15614787,"Modulation of hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine by estrogen in the female rat.Clinical studies have demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy suppresses stress-induced increases in plasma catecholamines. The present study determined whether normal circulating levels of estrogen can modulate hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine (EPI). In anesthetized female rats, insulin-induced hypoglycemia (0.25 U/kg) increased plasma EPI concentration to a significantly greater extent in 14-day ovariectomized (OVEX) rats compared to that in sham-operated controls. In 17beta-estradiol (E2)-replaced OVEX rats, the hypoglycemia-induced rise in plasma EPI was reduced significantly when compared to that in vehicle-replaced OVEX rats. OVEX and E2 replacement had no effect on tyrosine hydroxylase or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA levels in the adrenal medulla. In isolated adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells, agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ were unaffected by 48-hr exposure to 10 nM E2. In contrast, acute (3-min) exposure to micromolar concentrations of E2 dose-dependently and reversibly inhibited agonist-induced Ca2+ transients. In addition, in OVEX rats, a constant infusion of E2 significantly reduced the insulin-induced increase in plasma EPI concentration compared to that in vehicle-infused controls. These data demonstrate that physiologic levels of circulating E2 can modulate hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma EPI. This effect seems independent of steroid influence on adrenal medullary secretion or biosynthesis. In contrast, acute exposure to high levels of E2 can also suppress hypoglycemia-induced increases in plasma epinephrine, due at least in part to inhibition of stimulus-secretion coupling.",M1
15597192,"Expression of agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck ( Anas platyrhynchos).The presence and distribution of agouti-related protein (AgRP) immunoreactivity were investigated in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Expression of AgRP mRNA was also studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A partial coding sequence (cds) of the duck AgRP gene was identified. Western blot analysis showed the presence of an AgRP-like peptide having a molecular weight consistent with the number of predicted amino acids of the avian AgRP. In the hypothalamus, AgRP immunoreactivity was found in neurons of the nucleus infundibularis and in fibers projecting to the median eminence. In the adrenals, AgRP immunoreactivity was observed in <e>medullary</e> cells. These findings suggest that in the duck, AgRP may play a role in regulating energy homeostasis and adrenal endocrine functions.",M1
15541571,"Useful cell lines derived from the adrenal medulla.Five approaches for the preparation of adrenal chromaffin cell lines have been developed. Initially, continuous chromaffin lines were derived from spontaneous pheochromocytoma tumors of the medulla, either from murine or human sources, such as the rat PC12 cell line and the human KNA and KAT45 cell lines. Over the last few decades, more sophisticated molecular methods have allowed for induced tumorigenesis and targeted oncogenesis in vivo, where isolation of specific populations of mouse cell lines of endocrine origin have resulted in model cells to examine a variety of regulatory pathways in the chromaffin phenotype. As well, conditional immortalization with retroviral infection of chromaffin precursors has provided homogeneous and expandable chromaffin cells for transplant studies in animal models of pain. This same strategy of immortalization with conditionally expressed oncogenes has been expanded recently to create the first disimmortalizable chromaffin cells, with an excisable oncogenic cassette, as might be envisioned for the creation of human chromaffin cell lines. Eventually, as we increase our understanding of regulating the phenotypic fate of chromaffin cells in vitro, stem or progenitor adrenal <e>medullary</e> cell lines will be derived as an alternative source for expansion and clinical use.",M1
15532540,"The tyrosine [correction of tryrosine] phosphorylation and cytoskeletal translocation of phospholipase C gamma 1 in bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells.The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor BpV(phen) stimulated a concentration-dependent increase of phospholipase C (PLC) activity in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. This response was accompanied by an increase in PLCgamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its cytosketetal translocation. Insulin, at high concentrations, stimulated PLC activity to a similar extent as BpV(phen), a response that was also accompanied by an increase in PLCgamma1 translocation but not its tyrosine phosphorylation. BpV(phen) strongly enhanced the insulin-stimulated increase in PLC activity and caused a small rise in PLCgamma1 translocation above that seen with insulin alone. Despite the synergistic rise in activity PLCgamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation did not increase beyond that seen with BpV(phen) alone. These results indicate that PLCgamma1 activation in chromaffin cells may be more closely associated with its cytoskeletal translocation than its tyrosine phosphorylation although other factors may also be important for activation of enzyme activity.",M1
15521652,"Adrenomedullary and glycemic responses to ACTH, corticosterone, aldosterone, epinephrine and norepinephrine administrations in the soft-shelled turtle.The aim of the current investigation was to ascertain the role of ACTH and adrenal hormones on adrenomedullary and glycemic functions in soft-shelled turtles, Lissemys punctata punctata. All the experiments were carried out on sexually immature animals. Findings revealed that: (1) ACTH administration (0.5 IU/1.0 IU/2.0 IU per 100 g body wt. daily for 10 days) in all doses stimulated adrenomedullary function by increasing <e>medullary</e> cell nuclear diameter with elevations of norepinephrine, epinephrine and blood sugar levels. Only moderate and higher doses (50 microg/100 microg per 100 g body wt. daily for 10 days) of dexamethasone suppressed adrenomedullary activity and blood sugar level by reversing the changes to those of ACTH; the responses were dose-dependent. But these changes were no longer observed after ACTH treatment in dexamethasone (DMS) recipients (DMS: 100 microg/ 100 g body wt daily for the first 10 days and ACTH: 0.5 IU / 100 g body wt daily for the next 10 days); (2) Only moderate and higher doses (50 microg/100 microg per 100 g body wt daily for 10 days) of corticosterone increased adrenomedullary activity and blood sugar level and the responses were also dose-dependent. But aldosterone treatment in all doses (same as for corticosterone) had no significant effect on the adrenal medulla or blood sugar level; (3) Only moderate and higher doses of norepinephrine or epinephrine (same as for corticosterone) caused adrenomedullary atrophy with depletions of norepinephrine and epinephrine levels but elevated the glycemic level. The findings are briefly discussed.",M1
15486222,"Stimulation of catecholamine synthesis by environmental estrogenic pollutants.Environmental estrogenic pollutants are compounds that have been shown to have estrogenic effects on fetal development and reproductive systems. Less attention, however, has been paid to their influence on neuronal functions. We report here the effects of estrogenic pollutants on catecholamine synthesis in bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells used as a model system of noradrenergic neurons. Treatment of cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells with p-nonylphenol and bisphenol A at 10 nM for 3 d stimulated [14C]catecholamine synthesis from [14C]tyrosine and tyrosine hydroxylase activity, an effect that was not inhibited by ICI 182,780, an antagonist of estrogen receptors. Significant effects of p-nonylphenol on [14C]catecholamine synthesis were observed at 0.1 nM, which is 45 times lower than that of the international regulatory standard (4.5 nM), and the maximum effects were around 10-100 nM. The concentrations (0.1-10 nM) used in the present study are similar to the range observed in rivers in the United States or Europe. On the other hand, short-term treatment of cells with 10 nM p-nonylphenol for 10 min also activated tyrosine hydroxylase, which was suppressed by U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase. Furthermore, treatment of cells with p-nonylphenol for 5 min increased the phospho-p44/42MAPK in a concentration-dependent (1-1000 nM) manner, whereas p-nonylphenol (100 nm, 2 d) enhanced both levels of non-phospho- and phospho-p44/42MAPK. These findings suggest that short-term and long-term treatment of cells with estrogenic pollutants at environmental concentrations stimulates catecholamine synthesis and MAPK through an estrogen receptor-independent pathway.",M1
15450357,"Adrenal medulla calcium channel population is not conserved in bovine chromaffin cells in culture.During the stress response adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells release catecholamines to the bloodstream. Voltage-activated calcium channels present in the cell membrane play a crucial role in this process. Although the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of chromaffin cell calcium channels have been studied in detail, the molecular composition of these channels has not been defined yet. Another aspect that needs to be explored is the extent to which chromaffin cells in culture reflect the adrenal medulla calcium channel characteristics. In this sense, it has been described that catecholamine release in the intact adrenal gland recruits different calcium channels than those recruited during secretion from cultured chromaffin cells. Additionally, recent electrophysiological studies show that chromaffin cells in culture differ from those located in the intact adrenal medulla in the contribution of several calcium channel types to the whole cell current. However there is not yet any study that compares the population of calcium channels in chromaffin cells with that one present in the adrenal medulla. In order to gain some insight into the roles that calcium channels might play in the adrenal medullary cells we have analyzed the alpha1 subunit mRNA expression profile. We demonstrate that the expression pattern of voltage-dependent calcium channels in cultured bovine chromaffin cells markedly differs from that found in the native adrenal medulla and that glucocorticoids are only partially involved in those differences. Additionally, we show, for the first time, that the cardiac isoform of L-type calcium channel is present in both bovine adrenal medulla and cultured chromaffin cells and that its levels of expression do not vary during culture.",M1
15279077,"Comparison of c-Fos immunoreactivity in pancreatic beta cells and cells with neural crest, endoderm and mesoderm origin in rats.AIMS: Pancreatic beta cells are known to share many similarities with neuronal cells, but their origin remains controversial. It has been hypothesized that pancreatic beta cells are derived from neural crest cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the similarities between pancreatic beta cells and cells with neural crest, endoderm and mesoderm origin with respect to c-Fos immunoreactivity (c-Fos-ir), which has a role in important cellular processes including cellular proliferation, growth, differentiation and apoptosis. METHODS: c-Fos-ir was analyzed by immunohistochemical methods in formaline-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of rat pancreatic beta cells (BCs), in adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin cells (CCs) that are derived from neural crest, in exocrine pancreatic acinar cells (ACs) that are derived from endoderm, and in adrenal cortex zona reticularis cells (RCs) that are derived from mesoderm. RESULTS: The statistical comparisons revealed no significant differences between BCs and CCs with respect to c-Fos-ir (p&gt;0.05). However, a highly significant difference (p&lt;0.001) with respect to c-Fos-ir both between ACs and RCs, and between these two cell types and each of the two other cell types was noted. CONCLUSIONS: As opposed to findings in cells without neural crest origin, the observed similarity between BCs and CCs with respect to c-Fos-ir, provides additional evidence for the similarity of these cells with cells derived from neural crest.",M1
15249143,"Nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are essential for the long-term response of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression to chronic nicotine treatment in rat adrenal medulla.Nicotine induces tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA by interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in cultured adrenal <e>medullary</e> cell systems; however, the mechanisms responsible for the induction of adrenal TH in response to systemically administered nicotine under in vivo conditions are more complex. In the present study, we tested whether nAChRs and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) participate in the induction of adrenal TH observed after long-term treatment with nicotine. Chronic nicotine treatment (1.6 mg/kg, two daily injections spaced 12 h apart for 7 days) induced TH mRNA, TH protein and TH activity in rat adrenal medulla. This induction of TH gene expression was totally blocked when an antagonist of either nAChRs or mAChRs was administered prior to each nicotine injection. Repeated injections of the mAChR agonist bethanechol (5 mg/kg injected twice per day for 7 days) also produced increases in TH mRNA levels; however, TH protein levels and TH activity did not increase in response to bethanechol. In denervated adrenal glands chronic nicotine treatment did not lead to induction of either TH mRNA, TH protein or TH activity, whereas chronic bethanechol treatment led to induction of TH mRNA, but not TH protein or activity. These results suggest that agonist occupation of both nAChRs and mAChRs are essential for the complete response of TH gene expression to chronic nicotine treatment in rat adrenal medulla, but that stimulation of either cholinergic receptor by itself is not sufficient to elicit a full response. The results also suggest that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms may potentially need to be regulated to induce TH protein in response to some stimuli.",M1
15240937,"Study of migration of neural crest cells to adrenal medulla by three-dimensional reconstruction.Adrenal <e>medullary</e> cells are derived from the neural crest. To study the formation process of the adrenal medulla in the embryonic period, we visualized chromaffin cells of rat embryos at 13 to 17 days of gestation using anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antiserum, and created three-dimensional images from serial tissue sections. Between 13 and 15 days of gestation, TH-positive cells (chromaffin cells) migrated from a group of TH-positive cells present dorsal to the adrenal primordium via the medial cranial end of the adrenal primordium into the adrenal primordium. At or after 16 days of gestation, the adrenal capsule was formed except on the ventral aspect of the cranial end of the adrenal gland, from which TH-positive cells penetrated into the adrenal gland. The reconstructed images showed that TH-positive cells were present contiguously from the sympathetic chain ganglia through a group of TH-positive cells ventral to the adrenal gland into the adrenal cortex, and that the group of TH-positive cells ventral to the adrenal gland communicated with the preaortic ganglion present ventral and caudal to the adrenal gland. These results suggest that neural crest cells use the same pathway to migrate to the sympathetic chain ganglia dorsal to the adrenal gland, to the adrenal gland, and to the preaortic ganglion.",M1
15240354,"Integration of systemic and visceral sensory information by <e>medullary</e> catecholaminergic systems during peripheral inflammation.The nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) is topographically organized with respect to the distribution of afferent sensory innervation and efferent projection patterns. Evidence suggests that the cells within the nTS, including medullary catecholaminergic (CA) neurons, are functionally diverse and that during peripheral inflammation they are recruited in a topographically organized manner that reflects their associations with afferent sensory systems. It is therefore feasible that topographically organized subdivisions of the nTS and the medullary CA neurons contained within them are differentially involved in signaling systemic (e.g., derived from blood-borne signals) versus visceral sensory information (e.g., derived from afferent sensory signals within the vagus nerve) during peripheral inflammation. The purpose of this review is to summarize (1) the topographic organization of afferent sensory input from vagal and systemic signaling pathways to the nTS in relation to medullary CA neurons and (2) the functional evidence to support the differential involvement of topographically organized subpopulations of CA and non-CA neurons in relaying signals of visceral versus systemic sensory information.",M1
15233980,"Adrenal <e>medullary</e> overactivity in lean, borderline hypertensive young men.BACKGROUND: There may be a link among stress, adrenal medullary activation, and the development of hypertension. Obesity is characterized by sympathetic activation and predisposes to hypertension, but may be associated with low or normal adrenal medullary activity. We hypothesized that plasma epinephrine (E) levels and adrenal medullary responsiveness to mental stress are lower in overweight than in lean borderline hypertensive subjects. METHODS: We compared groups of lean (n = 62) and overweight (n = 29) borderline hypertensive young men as well as lean (n = 36) and overweight (n = 7) normotensive young men from the same population. Plasma catecholamines and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest during a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp and during mental arithmetic-induced stress. RESULTS: Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and E, HR, and responses to stress were increased in borderline hypertensive subjects. Our results showed that NE was increased only in lean borderline hypertensive subjects at rest, but in overweight subjects as well during stress, with DeltaNE being similar in lean and overweight subjects. We found that E was higher in lean than in overweight borderline hypertensive subjects at rest and during stress (both P &lt;.001), as were DeltaE and DeltaHR (both P &lt;.05). Independent of BP status, body mass index was negatively related to E during stress (P &lt;.01) and waist circumference negatively related to resting E (P &lt;.001) and DeltaHR (P =.02). CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic neural activity and responsiveness are increased in borderline hypertensive young men, but measures of overweight are independently related to lower plasma E and HR responses. We suggest that adrenal medullary activation in borderline hypertension mainly characterizes lean subjects.",M1
15215636,"Proof of the mysterious efficacy of ginseng: basic and clinical trials: suppression of adrenal <e>medullary</e> function in vitro by ginseng.The root of Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER has been reported to have an anti-stress action. Therefore, the effects of ginseng components on functions of adrenal medulla, which is one of the most important organs responsive to stress, were investigated in vitro. First, the components of ginseng were mainly divided into two fractions, that is, the saponin-rich and non-saponin fractions. The saponin-rich fraction greatly reduced the secretion of catecholamines from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells stimulated by acetylcholine (ACh), whereas the non-saponin fraction did not affect it at all. The protopanaxatriol-type saponins inhibited the ACh-evoked secretion much more strongly than the protopanaxadiol-type. On the other hand, the oleanane-type saponin, ginsenoside-Ro, had no such effect. Recent reports have demonstrated that the saponins in ginseng are metabolized and absorbed in digestive tracts following oral administration of ginseng. All of the saponin metabolites greatly reduced the ACh-evoked secretion. M4 was the most effective inhibitor among the metabolites. M4 blocked ACh-induced Na(+) influx and ion inward current into the chromaffin cells and into the Xenopus oocytes expressing human alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptors, respectively, suggesting that the saponin metabolites modulate nicotinic ACh receptors followed by the reduction of catecholamine secretion. It is highly possible that these effects of ginsenosides and their metabolites are associated with the anti-stress action of ginseng.",M1
15182418,"Mechanisms for hypoxia detection in O2-sensitive cells.Since O(2) is the bare necessity for multicellular organisms, they develop multiple protective mechanisms against hypoxia.

Although much work has been done to elucidate molecular mechanisms for O(2)-sensing for the last ten years, the majority of the mechanisms remain unclear. We will review mechanisms proposed for hypoxia detection in carotid body type I cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, adrenal medullary cells, and liver cells, with the special focus on adrenal medullary cells.",M1
15174145,"Characterization and location of post-translational modifications on chromogranin B from bovine adrenal <e>medullary</e> chromaffin granules.Bovine chromoganin B (CGB)/secretogranin I, an acidic protein with a sequence of 626 residues and an isoelectric point of 5.2 is a major member of the chromogranin/secretogranin (CG/Sg) family. The difference between the theoretical molecular mass (76 kDa) and the value estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results from post-translational modifications (glycosylation, phosphorylation and sulfation) and from the abundance of acidic residues (D 4.6%, and E 16.5%). Although the sequence of CGB is known, the structural analyses of the post-translational modifications have so far not been carried out. In the present study, using a combination of proteomic techniques including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western blot, high-performance liquid chromatography purification, enzymatic digestion, sequencing, carbohydrate analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, we have located 18 post-translational modifications on bovine CGB, isolated from adrenal medulla chromaffin granules. Furthermore, we have identified at the molecular level the presence of a mutation M/V on position 577 of natural CGB. All together these data reflect the complex structure of this protein marker of the neuroendocrine system.",M1
15165838,"Enhanced antinociception by nicotinic receptor agonist epibatidine and adrenal <e>medullary</e> transplants in the spinal subarachnoid space.Adrenal medullary transplants in the spinal subarachnoid space can reduce nociception, via the release of catecholamines and other analgesic substances, and this may be enhanced by stimulation of transplanted chromaffin cell surface nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In addition, spinal nAChRs have been implicated in modulating nociception and can interact synergistically with alpha-adrenergic agents. Thus, enhanced antinociception by potent nAChR agonists such as frog skin derivative epibatidine in adrenal-transplanted animals could potentially occur via multiple mechanisms, including nicotinic-alpha-adrenergic synergy and stimulation of chromaffin cell nicotinic receptors. In order to test this, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with intrathecal catheters and either adrenal medullary or control striated muscle transplants in the spinal subarachnoid space at the lumbar enlargement. Animals were tested for nociceptive responses before and after intrathecal injection of several doses of epibatidine using acute analgesiometric tests (tail flick, paw pressure) and the formalin test. After adrenal medullary, but not control, transplantation, nociceptive thresholds to acute noxious stimuli were slightly but consistently elevated, and phase 2 formalin responses decreased. Following intrathecal injection of epibatidine, acute nociceptive response latencies were modestly elevated and phase 2 formalin flinches modestly suppressed in control animals, but only at the highest dose test, with some attendant motor side-effects. In contrast, in adrenal medullary-transplanted animals, epibatidine elevated responses to acute noxious stimuli and markedly suppressed phase 2 formalin responses in a dose-related fashion. The enhanced antinociceptive effect following epibatidine was attenuated with either nAChR antagonist mecamylamine or alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. The current results demonstrate that intrathecal injection of the nAChR ligand epibatidine can produce significant antinociception in adrenal-transplanted rats in both acute and tonic nociceptive tests and suggest that the use of nicotinic agents in combination with adrenal medullary transplantation could provide maximal therapeutic benefit by synergistically improving antinociception while avoiding the detrimental side-effects of these agents.",M1

15094322,"Adrenal <e>medullary</e> function and expression of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in mice with hypothalamic obesity.The mechanisms underlying the onset of obesity are complex and not completely understood. An imbalance of autonomic nervous system has been proposed to be a major cause of great fat deposits accumulation in hypothalamic obesity models. In this work we therefore investigated the adrenal chromaffin cells in monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated obese female mice. Newborn mice were injected daily with MSG (4 mg/g body weight) or saline (controls) during the first five days of life and studied at 90 days of age. The adrenal catecholamine content was 56.0% lower in the obese group when compared to lean controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals. However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group. There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57.3%, P &lt; 0.004) in adrenal glands of obese mice. Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47.0%, P &lt; 0.005). Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected. Our results show that in the MSG model, obesity status is associated with a defective adrenal chromaffin cell function. We conclude that in MSG obesity the low total catecholamine content is directly related to a decrease of key catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, which by its turn may lead to a defective catecholamine secretion.",M1
15093697,"Central stresscopin modulates cardiovascular function through the adrenal medulla in conscious rats.Stresscopin (SCP or urocortin III), a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neuropeptide family, is a high-affinity ligand for the type 2 CRF receptor (CRF(2)). When administered peripherally, SCP suppresses food intake, delays gastric emptying and decreases heat-induced edema. Central administration of CRF produces marked hypertension and increased plasma catecholamine. However, the effects of SCP on the cardiovascular system are unknown. Thus, the present study compared the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CRF and SCP on cardiovascular function. Central administration of SCP (0.05 or 0.5 nmol) elicited transient increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR), and the higher dose of SCP (0.5 nmol) resulted in increased plasma epinephrine. In contrast, central administration of CRF provoked long-lasting increases in MABP, HR and plasma catecholamine levels (norepinephrine and epinephrine). Intravenously administered CRF and SCP (0.5 nmol) did not elicit significant changes in MABP and HR. Therefore, these data suggest that centrally administered SCP modulates cardiovascular function, likely through the sympatho-adrenal-<e>medullary</e> (SAM) system.",M1
20463235,"Functional characterization of alpha9-containing cholinergic nicotinic receptors in the rat adrenal medulla: implication in stress-induced functional plasticity.An increase in circulating adrenal catecholamine levels constitutes one of the mechanisms whereby organisms cope with stress. Accordingly, stimulus-secretion coupling within the stressed adrenal <e>medullary</e> tissue undergoes persistent remodeling. In particular, cholinergic synaptic neurotransmission between splanchnic nerve terminals and chromaffin cells is upregulated in stressed rats. Since synaptic transmission is mainly supported by activation of postsynaptic neuronal acetylcholine nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), we focused our study on the role of alpha9-containing nAChRs, which have been recently described in chromaffin cells. Taking advantage of their specific blockade by the alpha-conotoxin RgIA (alpha-RgIA), we unveil novel functional roles for these receptors in the stimulus-secretion coupling of the medulla. First, we show that in rat acute adrenal slices, alpha9-containing nAChRs codistribute with synaptophysin and significantly contribute to EPSCs. Second, we show that these receptors are involved in the tonic inhibitory control exerted by cholinergic activity on gap junctional coupling between chromaffin cells, as evidenced by an increased Lucifer yellow diffusion within the medulla in alpha-RgIA-treated slices. Third, we unexpectedly found that alpha9-containing nAChRs dominantly (&gt;70%) contribute to acetylcholine-induced current in cold-stressed rats, whereas alpha3 nAChRs are the main contributing channels in unstressed animals. Consistently, expression levels of alpha9 nAChR transcript and protein are overexpressed in cold-stressed rats. As a functional relevance, we propose that upregulation of alpha9-containing nAChR channels and ensuing dominant contribution in cholinergic signaling may be one of the mechanisms whereby adrenal medullary tissue appropriately adapts to increased splanchnic nerve electrical discharges occurring in stressful situations.",M2

This study was designed to investigate the full spectrum of clinical findings, topography, and pathogenesis of patients with acute CO infarct. METHODS: A total of 64 patients with CO infarct were recorded. Risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and cardiopathy were recorded. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 64.2 years. There were 46 patients (71.8%) in large-infarct group and 18 patients (28.1%) in small-infarct group. The most frequent risk factor was hypertension (89.1%). Other risk factors included smoking (39%), diabetes mellitus (29.7%), hyperlipidemia (28.1%), transient ischemic attack (15%), carotid stenosis (9%), atrial fibrillation (21%), other potential cardiac source of embolism (39%), and myocardial infarct (4%). The main clinical feature was faciobrachiocrural paralysis associated dysarthria (51.6%). Other clinical characteristics were facial, upper and lower extremity paralysis with sensorial deficits and/or dysarthria (26.6%), hemiparesis including face (12.5%), and either facial and upper or upper and lower extremity paralysis with hemisensorial deficit (9.4%). The baseline Barthel index was found to be less than 50 in 22 patients (34.4%) and greater than 50 in 42 patients (65.6%) for the entire group whereas 72% of patients were independent at discharge. CONCLUSION: In this article, risk factors, clinical spectrum, and features of CO infarcts were correlated in a large patient group. The majority of CO infarcts were large and had a poorer outcome compared to previous reports.",M2

A 65-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups and disabling spells of vertigo, lasting 30 seconds that became much more frequent and associated with lateropulsion to the right. A strong left beating HSN was evident. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, and intra-arterial cerebral digital subtracted angiography showed subacute ischemic lesions in the right lateral medulla and ipsilateral inferior cerebellar hemisphere, and two tight stenoses of the V1 and V4 segments of the right vertebral artery. Patient was treated by intravenous heparin and oral clopidogrel. After 48 hours, hiccups disappeared. One month later, vertigo spells were less frequent but still disabling. Endovascular stenting of the right vertebral artery stenoses was then performed. In the subsequent four years, the patient had no further episodes of hiccups or vertigo. Less intense HSN persisted. Hiccups followed by vertigo, lateropulsion, and HSN had been the clinical presentation of LMI and cerebellar ischemia, without other major neurologic or ocular motor findings. This unusual clinical variant of LMI could mimic a more benign labyrinthine lesion, and possibly leading to a dangerously delayed treatment.",M2
20364882,"Suppression of third ventricular NPY-elicited feeding following <e>medullary</e> reticular formation infusions of muscimol.The appetitive component of feeding is controlled by forebrain substrates, but the consummatory behaviors of licking, mastication, and swallowing are organized in the brainstem. The target of forebrain appetitive signals is unclear but likely includes regions of the medullary reticular formation (RF). This study was undertaken to determine the necessity of different RF regions for mastication induced by a descending appetitive signal. We measured solid food intake in response to third ventricular (3V) infusions of the orexigenic peptide neuropeptide Y 3-36 in awake, freely moving rats and determined whether focal RF infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol suppressed eating. RF infusions were centered in either the lateral tegmental field, comprising the intermediate (IRt) and parvocellular (PCRt) RF, or in the nucleus gigantocellularis (Gi). Infusions of NPY 3-36 (5 microg/5 microl) into 3V significantly increased feeding of solid food over a 90-min period compared with the noninfused condition (4.3 g +/- 0.56 vs. 0.57 g +/- 0.57, p &lt; .001). NPY 3-36-induced food intake was suppressed (1.7 g +/- 0.48) by simultaneous infusions of muscimol (0.6 mM/100 nl) into the IRt/PCRt (p &lt; .01). Coincident with the decrease in feeding was a decrease in the amplitude of anterior digastric muscle contractions in response to intraoral sucrose infusions. In contrast, infusions of muscimol into Gi had no discernible effect on food intake or EMG amplitude. These data suggest that the IRt/PCRt is essential for forebrain-initiated mastication, but that the Gi is not a necessary link in this pathway.",M2
20357023,"Adaptive trends in respiratory control: a comparative perspective.In 1941, August Krogh published a monograph entitled The Comparative Physiology of Respiratory Mechanisms (Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1941). Since that time comparative studies have continued to contribute significantly to our understanding of the fundamentals of respiratory physiology and the adaptive trends in these processes that support a broad range of metabolic performance under demanding environmental conditions. This review specifically focuses on recent advances in our understanding of adaptive trends in respiratory control. Respiratory rhythm generators most likely arose from, and must remain integrated with, rhythm generators for chewing, suckling, and swallowing. Within the central nervous system there are multiple  segmental  rhythm generators, and through evolution there is a caudal shift in the predominant respiratory rhythm-generating site. All sites, however, may still be capable of producing or modulating respiratory rhythm under appropriate conditions. Expression of the respiratory rhythm is conditional on (tonic) input. Once the rhythm is expressed, it is often episodic as the basic <e>medullary</e> rhythm is turned on/off subject to a hierarchy of controls. Breathing patterns reflect differences in pulmonary mechanics resulting from differences in body wall and lung architecture and are modulated in different species by various combinations of upper and lower airway mechanoreceptors and arterial chemoreceptors to protect airways, reduce dead space ventilation, enhance gas exchange efficiency, and reduce the cost of breathing.",M2

Yet, studies testing associations between sleep and neuroendocrine activity in children are scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether actigraphy-based sleep pattern is associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and sympatho-adrenal-medullary system activity in children. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a birth cohort in Helsinki, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 282 8-yr-old children. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured diurnal salivary cortisol and salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (a sympatho-adrenal-medullary system marker) responses to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C). RESULTS: Children with short (&lt;or=7.7 h) vs. average sleep duration (7.8-9.3 h) displayed higher cortisol awakening response and nadir (P &lt; 0.042). Those with low (&lt;or=77.4%) vs. average-high sleep efficiency (&gt;77.4%) displayed higher diurnal cortisol levels across the entire day (P &lt; 0.03), higher cortisol levels after the TSST-C stressor (P &lt; 0.04), and higher overall alpha-amylase levels across the entire TSST-C protocol (P &lt; 0.05). The effects were not confounded by factors that may alter sleep or hormonal patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep may signal altered neuroendocrine functioning in children.

METHODS: Data from consecutive patients with acute ischemic lesions primarily involving the medulla were analyzed. All patients underwent MRI including DWI, PWI and MR angiography. The patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of a perfusion delay in the medulla and/or inferior cerebellum. RESULTS: Among 35 patients, all but 1 had a PWI of interpretable quality. Of these 34 patients, 18 had a normal perfusion status, while 16 had perfusion defects in the medulla and/or inferior cerebellum. The abnormal PWI group had poor clinical outcomes at 7 days and 1 month after the onset of symptoms. There was no difference in DWI patterns between these 2 groups. The angiographic findings demonstrated that a stenosis of &gt;or=50% or an occlusion of the ipsilesional vertebral artery was frequently observed in the abnormal PWI group (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that abnormal PWI and DWI patterns were independently associated with poor early and late outcomes following medullary infarctions. CONCLUSIONS: PWI may be a feasible modality for assessing the perfusion status of the posterior circulation and predicting clinical outcomes following medullary infarctions.",M2
20142271,"Select spinal lesions reveal multiple ascending pathways in the rat conveying input from the male genitalia.The specific white matter location of all the spinal pathways conveying penile input to the rostral medulla is not known. Our previous studies using rats demonstrated the loss of low but not high threshold penile inputs to <e>medullary</e> reticular formation (MRF) neurons after acute and chronic dorsal column (DC) lesions of the T8 spinal cord and loss of all penile inputs after lesioning the dorsal three-fifths of the cord. In the present study, select T8 lesions were made and terminal electrophysiological recordings were performed 45-60 days later in a limited portion of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (Gi) and Gi pars alpha. Lesions included subtotal dorsal hemisections that spared only the lateral half of the dorsal portion of the lateral funiculus on one side, dorsal and over-dorsal hemisections, and subtotal transections that spared predominantly just the ventromedial white matter. Electrophysiological data for 448 single unit recordings obtained from 32 urethane-anaesthetized rats, when analysed in groups based upon histological lesion reconstructions, revealed (1) ascending bilateral projections in the dorsal, dorsolateral and ventrolateral white matter of the spinal cord conveying information from the male external genitalia to MRF, and (2) ascending bilateral projections in the ventrolateral white matter conveying information from the pelvic visceral organs (bladder, descending colon, urethra) to MRF. Multiple spinal pathways from the penis to the MRF may correspond to different functions, including those processing affective/pleasure/motivational, nociception, and mating-specific (such as for erection and ejaculation) inputs.",M2
20117251,"High CO2/H+ dialysis in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (Loeschcke's area) increases ventilation in wakefulness.Central chemoreception, the detection of CO(2)/H(+) within the brain and the resultant effect on ventilation, was initially localized at two areas on the ventrolateral medulla, one rostral (rVLM-Mitchell's) the other caudal (cVLM-Loeschcke's), by surface application of acidic solutions in anesthetized animals. Focal dialysis of a high CO(2)/H(+) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) that produced a milder local pH change in unanesthetized rats (like that with a approximately 6.6mm Hg increase in arterial P(CO2)) delineated putative chemoreceptor regions for the rVLM at the retrotrapezoid nucleus and the rostral <e>medullary</e> raphe that function predominantly in wakefulness and sleep, respectively. Here we ask if chemoreception in the cVLM can be detected by mild focal stimulation and if it functions in a state dependent manner. At responsive sites just beneath Loeschcke's area, ventilation was increased by, on average, 17% (P&lt;0.01) only in wakefulness. These data support our hypothesis that central chemoreception is a distributed property with some sites functioning in a state dependent manner.",M2

We report four MS cases with unusual wedge-shaped lesions in the paramedian ventral medulla oblongata demonstrated on MRI. The clinical features and MRI characteristics of the medullary lesions suggest an impairment of venous drainage. We propose that the formation of these wedge-shaped lesions may be related to the pattern of venous drainage in the ventral medulla and raised venous pressure due to chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency which has recently been described in MS.",M2
20023528,"Ruptured aneurysm originating from an aberrant <e>medullary</e> branch of the proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery: case report.OBJECTIVE: Aneurysms that arise from a small branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are very rare. All reported PICA branch aneurysms originated from the choroidal branches or PICA communicating branches. No aneurysms of the PICA medullary branch have been reported previously. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. Angiography showed a globular-shaped aneurysm arising from an aberrant branch of the anterior medullary segment of the left PICA. At the time of operation, the arterial branch was found to send some perforators into to the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. INTERVENTION: Aneurysm trapping was performed. Postoperatively, the patient had a mild transient difficulty in swallowing that may have been caused by manipulation of the vagus nerve rootlets. CONCLUSION: Aneurysms can develop from a proximal medullary branch of the PICA and lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. Trapping can be judiciously attempted to treat this precarious aneurysm.",M2
20016098,"Sustained morphine-induced sensitization and loss of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls in dura-sensitive <e>medullary</e> dorsal horn neurons.Overuse of medications used to treat migraine headache can produce a chronic daily headache, termed medication overuse headache (MOH). Although  overuse  of opioids, triptans, and over-the-counter analgesics can all produce MOH, the neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Headache pain is likely to be produced by stimulation of primary afferent neurons that innervate the intracranial vasculature and the resulting activation of medullary dorsal horn (MDH) neurons. The present study compared the receptive field properties of MDH dura-sensitive neurons in rats treated with morphine to those given vehicle. Animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps or pellets for sustained subcutaneous administration of morphine or vehicle 6-7 d before recording from dura-sensitive neurons. Electrical and mechanical activation thresholds from the dura were significantly lower in chronic morphine-treated animals when compared to vehicle controls. In addition, sustained morphine increased the cutaneous receptive field sizes. The presence of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs) was examined by placing the tail in 55 degrees C water during concomitant noxious thermal stimulation of the cutaneous receptive field, usually located in the ophthalmic region. The DNIC stimulus produced significant inhibition of heat-evoked activity in vehicle- but not chronic morphine-treated animals. Inactivation of the rostral ventromedial medulla with 4% lidocaine reinstated DNICs in chronic morphine-treated animals. These results are consistent with studies demonstrating a loss of DNICs in patients that suffer from chronic daily headache and may partially explain why overuse of medication used to treat migraine can induce headaches.",M2
19926534,"Neuroanatomic relationships between the GABAergic and serotonergic systems in the developing human medulla.gamma-Amino butyric (GABA) critically influences serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the raphé and extra-raphé of the medulla oblongata. In this study we hypothesize that there are marked changes in the developmental profile of markers of the human <e>medullary</e> GABAergic system relative to the 5-HT system in early life. We used single- and double-label immunocytochemistry and tissue receptor autoradiography in 15 human medullae from fetal and infant cases ranging from 15 gestational weeks to 10 postnatal months, and compared our findings with an extensive 5-HT-related database in our laboratory. In the raphé obscurus, we identified two subsets of GABAergic neurons using glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67) immunostaining: one comprised of small, round neurons; the other, medium, spindle-shaped neurons. In three term medullae cases, positive immunofluorescent neurons for both tryptophan hydroxylase and GAD65/67 were counted within the raphé obscurus. This revealed that approximately 6% of the total neurons counted in this nucleus expressed both GAD65/67 and TPOH suggesting co-production of GABA by a subset of 5-HT neurons. The distribution of GABA(A) binding was ubiquitous across medullary nuclei, with highest binding in the raphé obscurus. GABA(A) receptor subtypes alpha1 and alpha3 were expressed by 5-HT neurons, indicating the site of interaction of GABA with 5-HT neurons. These receptor subtypes and KCC2, a major chloride transporter, were differentially expressed across early development, from midgestation (20 weeks) and thereafter. The developmental profile of GABAergic markers changed dramatically relative to the 5-HT markers. These data provide baseline information for medullary studies of human pediatric disorders, such as sudden infant death syndrome.",M2
19912474,"Participation of the prolactin-releasing peptide-containing neurones in caudal medulla in conveying haemorrhagic stress-induced signals to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.The prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) has been proposed to be a co-transmitter or modulator of noradrenaline (NA) because it colocalises with NA in the A1 (in the ventrolateral reticular formation) and A2 (in the nucleus of the solitary tract; NTS) cell groups in the caudal medulla. The baroreceptor signals, originating from the great vessels, are transmitted primarily to the NTS, and then part of the signals is conveyed to the hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurones via the ascending NA neurones. The hypotensive haemorrhagic paradigm was employed to examine whether the PrRP-containing neurones in the caudal medulla participate in conveying signals to the hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurones. Among the caudal <e>medullary</e> A1 or A2 neurones, the majority of the PrRP-immunoreactive (-ir) neurones became c-Fos-ir at 2 h after hypotensive haemorrhage. Hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone-ir neurones and vasopressin-ir neurones became c-Fos positive in parallel with the activation of medullary PrRP-ir neurones. After delivery of retrograde tracer fluorogold (FG) to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), part of the PrRP/FG double-labelled neurones in the A1 and A2 became c-Fos-ir after haemorrhage, demonstrating that PrRP-ir neurones participate in conveying the haemorrhagic stress-induced signals from the medulla to the PVN. PrRP and/or NA were microinjected directly to the PVN of conscious rats, and they presented a synergistic action on arginine vasopressin release, whereas an additive action was observed for adrenocorticotrophin release. These results suggest that the PrRP-containing NA neurones in the caudal medulla may relay the haemorrhagic stress-induced medullary inputs to the hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurones.",M2
19833110,"Central amygdaloid axon terminals are in contact with retrorubral field neurons that project to the parvicellular reticular formation of the medulla oblongata in the rat.The retrorubral field (RRF) contains numerous dopaminergic neurons and projects to the parvicellular reticular formation (RFp) of the <e>medullary</e> and pontomedullary brainstem, where many premotor neurons project to the orofacial motor nuclei. To know how the amygdala affects the RRF-RFp pathway in the rat, we first examined the synaptic organization between the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) fibers and the RFp-projecting RRF neurons by using combined anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. After ipsilateral injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the CeA and Fluoro-gold (FG) into the RFp, the prominent overlapping distribution of BDA-labeled axon terminals and FG-labeled neurons was found in the lateral part of the RRF ipsilateral to the injection sites, where the BDA-labeled axon terminals made symmetrical synapses with somata and dendrites of the FG-labeled neurons. Using a combination of retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), we secondly demonstrated that the RFp-projecting RRF neurons were immunonegative for TH. Using a combination of anterograde tracing and immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), we finally revealed that the CeA axon terminals in the RRF were immunoreactive for GAD. The present results suggest that GABAergic CeA neurons may exert inhibitory influences on non-dopaminergic RRF neurons that project to the RFp in the control of orofacial movements closely related to emotional behavior.",M2
19828895,"Regulation of trigeminal respiratory motor activity in the brainstem.The trigeminal motor system participates in the control of respiration as well as suckling and mastication. However, the central mechanism underlying respiratory activity in trigeminal motoneurons is not well-understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate brainstem circuitry for rhythm generation and signal transmission of trigeminal respiratory activity in in vitro neonatal rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations. We further examined the role of midline-crossing trigeminal interneurons in the bilateral synchronization of respiratory and suckling activity in trigeminal motor nerves. The results of brainstem-sectioning experiments indicated that respiratory rhythms were generated in the medulla and ipsilaterally transmitted to trigeminal motoneurons in the pons. We conclude that the trigeminal motor system, as well as the hypoglossal and phrenic motor system, is regulated by <e>medullary</e> respiratory networks, and that pontine interactions between bilateral trigeminal interneurons are not critical for the generation or synchronization of trigeminal respiratory activity, but are crucial for trigeminal suckling activity.",M2
19822543,"Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressing ventrolateral <e>medullary</e> neurons increases sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure in rats.To explore the specific contribution of the C1 neurons to blood pressure (BP) control, we used an optogenetic approach to activate these cells in vivo. A lentivirus that expresses channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of the catecholaminergic neuron-preferring promoter PRSx8 was introduced into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). After 2-3 weeks, ChR2 was largely confined to Phox2b-expressing neurons (89%). The ChR2-expressing neurons were non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic and predominantly catecholaminergic (54%). Photostimulation of ChR2-transfected RVLM neurons (473 nm, 20 Hz, 10 ms, 9 mW) increased BP (15 mmHg) and sympathetic nerve discharge (SND; 64%). Light pulses at 0.2-0.5 Hz evoked a large sympathetic nerve response (16 x baseline) followed by a silent period (1-2 s) during which another stimulus evoked a reduced response. Photostimulation activated most (75%) RVLM baroinhibited neurons sampled with 1/1 action potential entrainment to the light pulses and without accommodation during 20 Hz trains. RVLM neurons unaffected by either CO(2) or BP were light-insensitive. Bötzinger respiratory neurons were activated but their action potentials were not synchronized to the light pulses. Juxtacellular labelling of recorded neurons revealed that, of these three cell types, only the cardiovascular neurons expressed the transgene. In conclusion, ChR2 expression had no discernable effect on the putative vasomotor neurons at rest and was high enough to allow precise temporal control of their action potentials with light pulses. Photostimulation of RVLM neurons caused a sizable sympathoactivation and rise in blood pressure. These results provide the most direct evidence yet that the C1 neurons have a sympathoexcitatory function.",M2

19788055,"Schwannosis induced <e>medullary</e> compression in VACTERL syndrome.A 7-year-old boy with a history of VACTERL syndrome was found collapsed in bed. MRI had shown basilar invagination of the skull base and narrowing of the foramen magnum. Angulation, swelling and abnormal high signal at the cervicomedullary junction were felt to be secondary to compression of the medulla. Neuropathologic examination showed bilateral replacement of the medullary tegmentum by an irregularly circumscribed cellular lesion which was composed of elongated GFAP/S 100-positive cells with spindled nuclei and minimal atypia. The pathologic findings were interpreted as intramedullary schwannosis with mass effect. Schwannosis, is observed in traumatized spinal cords where its presence may represent attempted, albeit aberrant, repair by inwardly migrating Schwann cells ofperipheral origin. In our view the compressive effect of the basilar invagination on this boy's medulla was of sufficient magnitude to have caused tumoral medullary schwannosis with resultant intermittent respiratory compromise leading to reflex anoxic seizures.",M2
19777579,"Real-time imaging of the <e>medullary</e> circuitry involved in the generation of spontaneous muscle sympathetic nerve activity in awake subjects.To understand the central neural processes involved in blood pressure regulation we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) via a tungsten microelectrode in the common peroneal nerve while performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brainstem at 3T. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in signal intensity were measured over 4 s every 8 s (200) volumes; MSNA was recorded during the previous 4 s epoch, which takes into account peripheral conduction delays along unmyelinated axons and neurovascular coupling delays. Analysis of temporal coupling between BOLD signal intensity and nerve signal intensity revealed sites in which the two signals covaried, but only in the medulla. Because scans were conducted in a caudorostral direction, we could constrain the analysis to the medulla by only examining the first 1 s of the fMRI and nerve signals. Increases in MSNA were associated with robust bilateral increases in signal intensity in the dorsolateral region of the medulla that corresponds to the human equivalent of the rostal ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Reciprocal decreases in signal intensity occurred in the regions of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Group analysis also revealed increases in signal intensity in the caudal pressor area (CPA), medullary raphé (MR), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX). We have shown for the first time that this combined approach of recording sympathetic neural activity and fMRI provides real-time imaging of the neural processes responsible for the generation of sympathetic nerve activity in awake human subjects.",M2
19772899,"5-HT2 receptors modulate excitatory neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons within the nucleus ambiguus evoked during and after hypoxia.To examine the role of 5-HT2 receptors in the central cardiorespiratory network, and in particular the respiratory modulation of parasympathetic activity to the heart, we used an in vitro <e>medullary</e> slice that allowed simultaneous examination of rhythmic inspiratory-related activity recorded from hypoglossal rootlet and excitatory inspiratory-related neurotransmission to cardioinhibitory vagal neurons (CVNs) within the nucleus ambiguus (NA). Focal application of ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, did not significantly alter the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic excitatory currents (EPSCs) in CVNs in control conditions. However, ketanserin diminished spontaneous excitatory neurotransmission to CVNs during hypoxia. The inhibitory action of ketanserin was on 5-HT3 mediated EPSCs during hypoxia since these responses were blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. In addition, a robust inspiratory-related excitatory neurotransmission was recruited during recovery from hypoxia. Focal application of ketanserin during this posthypoxia period evoked a significant augmentation of the frequency of inspiratory-related, but not spontaneous EPSCs in CVNs. This excitatory effect of ketanserin was prevented by application of the purinergic receptor blocker pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS). These results demonstrate 5-HT2 receptors differentially modulate excitatory neurotransmission to CVNs during and after hypoxia. Activation of 5-HT2 receptors acts to maintain excitatory neurotransmission to CVNs during hypoxia, likely via presynaptic facilitation of 5-HT3 receptor-mediated neurotransmission to CVNs. However, activation of 5HT2 receptors diminishes the subsequent inspiratory-related excitatory neurotransmission to CVNs that is recruited during the recovery from hypoxia likely exerting an inhibitory action on inspiratory-related purinergic signaling.",M2
19745186,"Micro-opioid receptor agonist injections into the presumed pre-Botzinger complex and the surrounding region of awake goats do not alter eupneic breathing.Opioids are clinically important in the alleviation of pain. An undesirable side effect of opioids is depression of breathing. Data from isolated preparations suggest this effect is due to attenuation of discharge activity of neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötzC), a <e>medullary</e> area with respiratory rhythmogenic properties. The purpose of this study was to examine how [d-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, affected breathing after injection into the presumed preBötzC of the adult awake goat. We hypothesized that DAMGO would cause breathing to decrease and become irregular when injected into the presumed preBötzC and the surrounding region of the conscious animal. We further hypothesized that ventilatory sensitivity to CO(2) and hypoxia would be blunted after the injection of DAMGO. Microtubules were bilaterally implanted into the presumed preBötzC of 10 adult female goats. After recovery from the surgery, DAMGO (0.5-10 mul, 1 nM-10 muM) was injected into the presumed preBötzC during the awake state. DAMGO had no effect on pulmonary ventilation [inspiratory minute ventilation (Vi)], respiratory rhythm and pattern, the activation pattern of inspiratory and expiratory muscles, or arterial blood gases during eupneic breathing conditions (P &gt; 0.10). However, DAMGO attenuated (P &lt; 0.05) the evoked increase in breathing frequency when inspired CO(2) was increased, and DAMGO attenuated the Vi response to reduction of inspired O(2) to 10.8% (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that our data do not provide support for the concept that in awake mammals opioid depression of breathing is due to a directed action of opioids on preBötzC neurons.",M2
19741123,"Astroglia in <e>medullary</e> dorsal horn (trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis) are involved in trigeminal neuropathic pain mechanisms.The aim of this study was to investigate whether astroglia in the medullary dorsal horn (trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis; Vc) may be involved in orofacial neuropathic pain following trigeminal nerve injury. The effects of intrathecal administration of the astroglial aconitase inhibitor sodium fluoroacetate (FA) were tested on Vc astroglial hyperactivity [as revealed by glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) labeling], nocifensive behavior, Vc extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (pERK), and Vc neuronal activity in inferior alveolar nerve-transected (IANX) rats. Compared with sham-control rats, a significant increase occurred in GFAP-positive cells in ipsilateral Vc at postoperative day 7 in IANX rats, which was prevented following FA administration. FA significantly increased the reduced head withdrawal latency to high-intensity heat stimulation of the maxillary whisker pad skin in IANX rats, although it did not significantly affect the reduced escape threshold to low-intensity mechanical stimulation of the whisker skin in IANX rats. FA also significantly reduced the increased number of pERK-like immunoreactive cells in Vc and the enhanced Vc nociceptive neuronal responses following high-intensity skin stimulation that were documented in IANX rats, and glutamine administration restored the enhanced responses. These various findings provide the first documentation that astroglia is involved in the enhanced nociceptive responses of functionally identified Vc nociceptive neurons and in the associated orofacial hyperalgesia following trigeminal nerve injury.",M2
19732757,"Unmyelinated fibers of the anterior ethmoidal nerve in the rat co-localize with neurons in the <e>medullary</e> dorsal horn and ventrolateral medulla activated by nasal stimulation.The anterior ethmoidal nerve (AEN) innervates the nasal passages and external nares, and serves as the afferent limb of the nasopharyngeal and diving responses. However, although 65% of the AEN is composed of unmyelinated fibers, it has not been determined whether this afferent signal is carried by unmyelinated or myelinated fibers. We used the transganglionic tracers WGA-HRP, IB4-HRP, and CTB-HRP to trace the central projections of the AEN of the rat. Interpretation of the labeling patterns suggests that AEN unmyelinated fibers project primarily to the ventral tip of the ipsilateral medullary dorsal horn (MDH) at the level of the area postrema. Other unmyelinated projections were to the ventral paratrigeminal nucleus and ventrolateral medulla, specifically the Bötzinger and RVLM/C1 regions. Myelinated AEN fibers projected to the ventral paratrigeminal and mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei. Stimulating the nasal passages of urethane-anesthetized rats with ammonia vapors produced the nasopharyngeal response that included apnea, bradycardia and an increase in arterial blood pressure. Central projections of the AEN co-localized with neurons within both MDH and RVLM/C1 that were activated by nasal stimulation. Within the ventral MDH the density of AEN terminal projections positively correlated with the rostral-caudal location of activated neurons, especially at and just caudal to the obex. We conclude that unmyelinated AEN terminal projections are involved in the activation of neurons in the MDH and ventrolateral medulla that participate in the nasopharyngeal response in the rat. We also found that IB4-HRP was a much less robust tracer than WGA-HRP.",M2
19729586,"Prenatal nicotine-exposure alters fetal autonomic activity and <e>medullary</e> neurotransmitter receptors: implications for sudden infant death syndrome.During pregnancy, exposure to nicotine and other compounds in cigarette smoke increases the risk of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) two- to fivefold. Serotonergic (5-HT) abnormalities are found, in infants who die of SIDS, in regions of the medulla oblongata known to modulate cardiorespiratory function. Using a baboon model, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to nicotine alters 5-HT receptor and/or transporter binding in the fetal medullary 5-HT system in association with cardiorespiratory dysfunction. At 87 (mean) days gestation (dg), mothers were continuously infused with saline (n = 5) or nicotine (n = 5) at 0.5 mg/h. Fetuses were surgically instrumented at 129 dg for cardiorespiratory monitoring. Cesarean section delivery and retrieval of fetal medulla were performed at 161 (mean) dg for autoradiographic analyses of nicotinic and 5-HT receptor and transporter binding. In nicotine-exposed fetuses, high-frequency heart rate variability was increased 55%, possibly reflecting increases in the parasympathetic control of heart rate. This effect was more pronounced with greater levels of fetal breathing and age. These changes in heart rate variability were associated with increased 5-HT(1A) receptor binding in the raphé obscurus (P = 0.04) and increased nicotinic receptor binding in the raphé obscurus and vagal complex (P &lt; 0.05) in the nicotine-exposed animals compared with controls (n = 6). The shift in autonomic balance in the fetal primate toward parasympathetic predominance with chronic exposure to nicotine may be related, in part, to abnormal 5-HT-nicotine alterations in the raphé obscurus. Thus increased risk for SIDS due to maternal smoking may be partly related to the effects of nicotine on 5-HT and/or nicotinic receptors.",M2
19686447,"Neuropeptide W has cell phenotype-specific effects on the excitability of different subpopulations of paraventricular nucleus neurones.The administration of the neuropeptide W (NPW) and neuropeptide B (NPB) in rodents has been shown to influence the activity of a variety of autonomic and neuroendocrine systems. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a major autonomic and neuroendocrine integration site in the hypothalamus, and neurones within this nucleus express the receptor for these ligands, NPB/W receptor 1 (NPBWR1). In the present study, we used whole cell patch clamp recordings coupled with single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine the effects of neuropeptide W-23 (NPW-23) on the excitability of identified PVN neurones. Oxytocin, vasopressin and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone neurones were all found to be responsive to 10 nm NPW-23, although both depolarising and hyperpolarising effects were observed in each of these cell groups. By contrast, corticotrophin-releasing hormone cells were unaffected. Further subdivision of chemically phenotyped cell groups into magnocellular, neuroendocrine or pre-autonomic neurones, using their electrophysiological fingerprints, revealed that neurones projecting to <e>medullary</e> and spinal targets were predominantly inhibited by NPW-23, whereas those that projected to median eminence or neural lobe showed almost equivalent numbers of depolarising and hyperpolarising cells. The demonstration of particular phenotypic populations of PVN neurones showing NPW-induced effects on excitability reinforces the importance of the NPB/NPW neuropeptide system as a regulator of autonomic function.",M2

In this study, the unbiased quantitative method of the optical disector was applied to analyze neuronal densities, nuclear volumes, and total neuron numbers of the hypoglossal nucleus (XII), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), medial vestibular nucleus (MedVe), cuneate nucleus (Cu), nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, principal inferior olivary nucleus (PION), medial inferior olivary nucleus (MION), and dorsal inferior olivary nucleus (DION) in adults (16 male, six female; mean age: 37 years) and infants (five male, five female; mean age: 5 months). In both infants and adults, higher neuronal densities were found in the more ventrally located nuclei of the spinal trigeminal tract (mean values (coefficient of variation): 20,947 (0.29) and 8,990 (0.18) neurons/mm(3), respectively) and inferior olivary complex (PION: 20,010 (0.15) and 9,076 (0.10); MION: 18,667 (0.20) and 9,989 (0.13); DION: 22,424 (0.17) and 10,986 (0.20), respectively) than in the nuclei of the medullary tegmentum, that is, XII (2,747 (0.39) and 1,026 (0.31)), DMNV (2,876 (0.19) and 1,553 (0.26)), NTS (7,993 (0.17) and 2,877 (0.13)), MedVe (7,010 (0.17) and 2,918 (0.12)), and Cu (2,563 (0.23) and 1,038 (0.16)). All the medullary nuclei showed higher volumes and lower neuronal densities in adults than in infants, without statistically significant differences in total neuron numbers, probably because of postnatal development of the neuropil and microvascularization.",M2
19682608,"Descending bulbospinal pathways and recovery of respiratory motor function following spinal cord injury.The rodent respiratory system is a relevant model for study of the intrinsic post-lesion mechanisms of neuronal plasticity and resulting recovery after high cervical spinal cord injury. An unilateral cervical injury (hemisection, lateral section or contusion) interrupts unilaterally bulbospinal respiratory pathways to phrenic motor neurons innervating the diaphragm and leads to important respiratory defects on the injured side. However, the ipsilateral phrenic nerve exhibits a spontaneous and progressive recovery with post-lesion time. Shortly after a lateral injury, this partial recovery depends on the activation of contralateral pathways that cross the spinal midline caudal to the injury. Activation of these crossed phrenic pathways after the injury depends on the integrity of phrenic sensory afferents. These pathways are located principally in the lateral part of the spinal cord and involve 30% of the <e>medullary</e> respiratory neurons. By contrast, in chronic post-lesion conditions, the medial part of the spinal cord becomes sufficient to trigger substantial ipsilateral respiratory drive. Thus, after unilateral cervical spinal cord injury, respiratory reactivation is associated with a time-dependent anatomo-functional reorganization of the bulbospinal respiratory descending pathways, which represents an adaptative strategy for functional compensation.",M2

During torpor, body temperature drops to 0-4 degrees C, and the cortex is electrically silent, yet the brain stem continues to regulate cardiorespiratory function. The mechanisms underlying selective inhibition in the brain during torpor are not known. To test whether altered GABAergic function is involved in regional and seasonal differences in neuronal activity, cortical and <e>medullary</e> slices from summer-active (SA) and interbout aroused (IBA) squirrels were placed in a standard in vitro recording chamber. Silicon multichannel electrodes were placed in cortex, ventral respiratory column (VRC), and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) to record spontaneous neuronal activity. In slices from IBA squirrels, bath-applied pentobarbital sodium (300 microM) nearly abolished cortical neuronal activity, but VRC and NTS neuronal activity was unaltered. In contrast, pentobarbital sodium (300 microM) nearly abolished all spontaneous cortical, VRC, and NTS neuronal activity in slices from SA squirrels. Muscimol (20 microM; GABA(A) receptor agonist) abolished all neuronal activity in cortical and medullary slices from both IBA and SA squirrels, thereby demonstrating the presence of functional GABA(A) receptors. Pretreatment of cortical slices from IBA squirrels with bicuculline (100 microM; GABA(A) receptor antagonist) blocked pentobarbital-dependent inhibition of spontaneous neuronal activity. We hypothesize that GABA(A) receptors undergo a seasonal modification in subunit composition, such that cardiorespiratory neurons are uniquely unaffected by surges of an endogenous positive allosteric modulator.",M2
19651653,"Pontine respiratory activity involved in inspiratory/expiratory phase transition.Control of the timing of the inspiratory/expiratory (IE) phase transition is a hallmark of respiratory pattern formation. In principle, sensory feedback from pulmonary stretch receptors (Breuer-Hering reflex, BHR) is seen as the major controller for the IE phase transition, while pontine-based control of IE phase transition by both the pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and parabrachial complex is seen as a secondary or backup mechanism. However, previous studies have shown that the BHR can habituate in vivo. Thus, habituation reduces sensory feedback, so the role of the pons, and specifically the KF, for IE phase transition may increase dramatically. Pontine-mediated control of the IE phase transition is not completely understood. In the present review, we discuss existing models for ponto-<e>medullary</e> interaction that may be involved in the control of inspiratory duration and IE transition. We also present intracellular recordings of pontine respiratory units derived from an in situ intra-arterially perfused brainstem preparation of rats. With the absence of lung inflation, this preparation generates a normal respiratory pattern and many of the recorded pontine units demonstrated phasic respiratory-related activity. The analysis of changes in membrane potentials of pontine respiratory neurons has allowed us to propose a number of pontine-medullary interactions not considered before. The involvement of these putative interactions in pontine-mediated control of IE phase transitions is discussed.",M2
19651652,"Central and peripheral chemoreceptors evoke distinct responses in simultaneously recorded neurons of the raphé-pontomedullary respiratory network.The brainstem network for generating and modulating the respiratory motor pattern includes neurons of the <e>medullary</e> ventrolateral respiratory column (VRC), dorsolateral pons (PRG) and raphé nuclei. Midline raphé neurons are proposed to be elements of a distributed brainstem system of central chemoreceptors, as well as modulators of central chemoreceptors at other sites, including the retrotrapezoid nucleus. Stimulation of the raphé system or peripheral chemoreceptors can induce a long-term facilitation of phrenic nerve activity; central chemoreceptor stimulation does not. The network mechanisms through which each class of chemoreceptor differentially influences breathing are poorly understood. Microelectrode arrays were used to monitor sets of spike trains from 114 PRG, 198 VRC and 166 midline neurons in six decerebrate vagotomized cats; 356 were recorded during sequential stimulation of both receptor classes via brief CO(2)-saturated saline injections in vertebral (central) and carotid arteries (peripheral). Seventy neurons responded to both stimuli. More neurons were responsive only to peripheral challenges than those responsive only to central chemoreceptor stimulation (PRG, 20 : 4; VRC, 41 : 10; midline, 25 : 13). Of 16 474 pairs of neurons evaluated for short-time scale correlations, similar percentages of reference neurons in each brain region had correlation features indicative of a specific interaction with at least one target neuron: PRG (59.6%), VRC (51.0%) and raphé nuclei (45.8%). The results suggest a brainstem network architecture with connectivity that shapes the respiratory motor pattern via overlapping circuits that modulate central and peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated influences on breathing.",M2
19646973,"Immune challenge and satiety-related activation of both distinct and overlapping neuronal populations in the brainstem indicate parallel pathways for viscerosensory signaling.Caudal brainstem viscerosensory nuclei convey information about the body's internal state to forebrain regions implicated in feeding behavior and responses to immune challenge, and may modulate ingestive behavior following immune activation. Illness-induced appetite loss might be attributed to accentuated  satiety  pathways, activation of a distinct  danger channel  separate from satiety pathways, or both. To evaluate neural substrates that could mediate the effects of illness on ingestive behavior, we analyzed the pattern and phenotypes of <e>medullary</e> neurons responsive to consumption of a preferred food, sweetened milk, and to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide challenge that reduced sweetened milk intake. Brainstem sections were stained for c-Fos, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) immunoreactivity. Sweetened milk intake activated many neurons throughout the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), including A2 noradrenergic neurons in the caudal half of the NTS. LPS challenge activated a similar population of neurons in the NTS, in addition to rostral C2 adrenergic and mid-level A2 noradrenergic neurons in the NTS, many C1 and A1 neurons in the ventrolateral medulla, and in GLP-1 neurons in the dorsal medullary reticular nucleus. Increased numbers of activated GLP-1 neurons in the NTS were only associated with sweetened milk ingestion. Evidence for parallel processing was reflected in the parabrachial nucleus, where sweetened milk intake resulted in activation of the inner external lateral, ventrolateral and central medial portions, whereas LPS challenge induced c-Fos expression in the outer external lateral portions. Thus, signals generated in response to potentially dangerous physiological conditions seem to be propagated via specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS and VLM, and likely include a pathway through the external lateral PBN. The data indicate that immune challenge engages multiple ascending neural pathways including both a distinct catecholaminergic  danger  pathway, and a possibly multimodal pathway derived from the NTS.",M2
19645020,"The mesencephalic reticular formation as a conduit for primate collicular gaze control: tectal inputs to neurons targeting the spinal cord and medulla.The superior colliculus (SC), which directs orienting movements of both the eyes and head, is reciprocally connected to the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), suggesting the latter is involved in gaze control. The MRF has been provisionally subdivided to include a rostral portion, which subserves vertical gaze, and a caudal portion, which subserves horizontal gaze. Both regions contain cells projecting downstream that may provide a conduit for tectal signals targeting the gaze control centers which direct head movements. We determined the distribution of cells targeting the cervical spinal cord and rostral <e>medullary</e> reticular formation (MdRF), and investigated whether these MRF neurons receive input from the SC by the use of dual tracer techniques in Macaca fascicularis monkeys. Either biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was injected into the SC. Wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase was placed into the ipsilateral cervical spinal cord or medial MdRF to retrogradely label MRF neurons. A small number of medially located cells in the rostral and caudal MRF were labeled following spinal cord injections, and greater numbers were labeled in the same region following MdRF injections. In both cases, anterogradely labeled tectoreticular terminals were observed in close association with retrogradely labeled neurons. These close associations between tectoreticular terminals and neurons with descending projections suggest the presence of a trans-MRF pathway that provides a conduit for tectal control over head orienting movements. The medial location of these reticulospinal and reticuloreticular neurons suggests this MRF region may be specialized for head movement control.",M2

19628797,"Medial <e>medullary</e> infarction: clinical, imaging, and outcome study in 86 consecutive patients.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical-imaging correlation and long-term clinical outcomes remain to be investigated in medial medullary infarction (MMI). METHODS: We studied clinical, MRI, and angiographic data of 86 consecutive MMI patients. The lesions were correlated with clinical findings, and long-term outcomes, divided into mild and severe (modified Rankin scale &gt;3), were assessed by telephone interview. Central poststroke pain (CPSP) was defined as persistent pain with visual numeric scale &gt; or = 4. RESULTS: The lesions were located mostly in the rostral medulla (rostral 76%, rostral+middle 16%), while ventro-dorsal lesion patterns include ventral (V, 20%), ventral+middle (VM, 33%), and ventral+middle+dorsal (VMD, 41%). Clinical manifestations included motor dysfunction in 78 patients (91%), sensory dysfunction in 59 (73%), and vertigo/dizziness in 51 (59%), each closely related to involvement of ventral, middle, and dorsal portions, respectively (P&lt;0.001, each). Vertebral artery (VA) atherosclerotic disease relevant to the infarction occurred in 53 (62%) patients, mostly producing atheromatous branch occlusion (ABO). Small vessel disease (SVD) occurred in 24 (28%) patients. ABO was more closely related to VMD (versus V+VM) than was SVD (P=0.035). During follow-up (mean 71 months), 11 patients died, and recurrent strokes occurred in 11. Old age (P=0.001) and severe motor dysfunction at admission (P=0.001) were factors predicting poor prognosis. CPSP, occurring in 21 patients, was closely (P=0.013) related to poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: MMI usually presents with a rostral medullary lesion, with a good clinical ventro-dorsal imaging correlation, caused most frequently by ABO followed by SVD. A significant proportion of patients remain dependent or have CPSP.",M2
19625526,"<e>Medullary</e> circuitry regulating rapid eye movement sleep and motor atonia.Considerable data support a role for glycinergic ventromedial medulla neurons in the mediation of the postsynaptic inhibition of spinal motoneurons necessary for the motor atonia of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in cats. These data are, however, difficult to reconcile with the fact that large lesions of the rostral ventral medulla do not result in loss of REM atonia in rats. In the present study, we sought to clarify which medullary networks in rodents are responsible for REM motor atonia by retrogradely tracing inputs to the spinal ventral horn from the medulla, ablating these medullary sources to determine their effects on REM atonia and using transgenic mice to identify the neurotransmitter(s) involved. Our results reveal a restricted region within the ventromedial medulla, termed here the  supraolivary medulla  (SOM), which contains glutamatergic neurons that project to the spinal ventral horn. Cell-body specific lesions of the SOM resulted in an intermittent loss of muscle atonia, taking the form of exaggerated phasic muscle twitches, during REM sleep. A concomitant reduction in REM sleep time was observed in the SOM-lesioned animals. We next used mice with lox-P modified alleles of either the glutamate or GABA/glycine vesicular transporters to selectively eliminate glutamate or GABA/glycine neurotransmission from SOM neurons. Loss of SOM glutamate release, but not SOM GABA/glycine release, resulted in exaggerated muscle twitches during REM sleep that were similar to those observed after SOM lesions in rats. These findings, together, demonstrate that SOM glutamatergic neurons comprise key elements of the medullary circuitry mediating REM atonia.",M2
19598285,"Vagal gustatory reflex circuits for intraoral food sorting behavior in the goldfish: cellular organization and neurotransmitters.The sense of taste is crucial in an animal's determination as to what is edible and what is not. This gustatory function is especially important in goldfish, who utilize a sophisticated oropharyngeal sorting mechanism to separate food from substrate material. The computational aspects of this detection are carried out by the <e>medullary</e> vagal lobe, which is a large, laminated structure combining elements of both the gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract and the nucleus ambiguus. The sensory layers of the vagal lobe are coupled to the motor layers via a simple reflex arc. Details of this reflex circuit were investigated with histology and calcium imaging. Biocytin injections into the motor layer labeled vagal reflex interneurons that have radially directed dendrites ramifying within the layers of primary afferent terminals. Axons of reflex interneurons extend radially inward to terminate onto both vagal motoneurons and small, GABAergic interneurons in the motor layer. Functional imaging shows increases in intracellular Ca++ of vagal motoneurons following electrical stimulation in the sensory layer. These responses were suppressed under Ca(++)-free conditions and by interruption of the axons bridging between the sensory and motor layers. Pharmacological experiments showed that glutamate acting via (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-ethylisoxazole-4-propioinc acid (AMPA)/kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors mediate neurotransmission between reflex interneurons and vagal motoneurons. Thus, the vagal gustatory portion of the viscerosensory complex is linked to branchiomotor neurons of the pharynx via a glutamatergic interneuronal system.",M2
19567253,"Ventrolateral lesions at the ponto-<e>medullary</e> junction and the effects of noradrenaline on respiratory rhythm in rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations.AIMS: We examined whether responses of respiratory frequency (fR) to noradrenaline (NA) were eliminated by mechanical lesions in the ventrolateral area at the ponto-medullary junction in preparations of newborn rat pons-medulla-spinal cord (PMS). MAIN METHODS: Preparations obtained from 2- to 4-day-old rats were superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid that was equilibrated with oxygenated (95% O2 plus 5% CO2 gas, and fR was monitored at the C4 ventral root at 24 degrees C. Bilateral lesions were made in the ventrolateral area between the VIth cranial nerve root and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in PMS (n=11). The resting fR and response to exogenous NA (7 microM) were compared with those of medulla-spinal cord (MS) preparations (n=6). Immunohistochemistry of PMS preparations was performed to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons at the ponto-medullary junction. KEY FINDINGS: PMS preparations with the lesions had (1) a significantly higher resting fR but 2 significantly less fR facilitation after NA application than those of intact PMS preparations, and (3) significantly lower resting fR and (4) significantly less fR reduction after NA application than those of MS preparations. TH-positive neurons were detected in the region from the rostral dorsolateral to the caudal ventrolateral pons (the A5 area), as well as in the ventral area near the facial nucleus. SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that ventrolateral area at ponto-medullary junction plays a significant role in exogenous NA-induced fR changes under the influence of pons-induced tonic fR inhibition in newborn rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations.",M2
19562359,"Topographical correlations of lateral <e>medullary</e> infarction with caloric- and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential results.This study investigated the correlation of caloric- and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) results with topographical lesions of lateral medullary infarction. Five patients with lateral medullary infarction were enrolled in this study. Each patient underwent a battery of tests, including audiometry, caloric test, VEMP test, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Gaze nystagmus was observed in four patients (80%), while abnormal pursuit, saccade, and optokinetic nystagmus tests were noted in all patients (100%). MRI demonstrated infarction at the ponto-medullary junction in one patient and upper medulla in one patient. Both patients revealed caloric areflexia and normal VEMPs. In contrast, another three patients with infarction at the middle inferior olive level, all displayed abnormal (including absent or delayed) VEMPs, and one patient showed caloric areflexia. Topographical correlations of lateral medullary infarction with caloric and VEMP tests reveal that caloric areflexia is possibly linked with rostrally located infarction, while absent or delayed VEMPs relate to caudally located infarction.",M2

Through histological, morphometrical and immunohistochemical methods in 65 cases of perinatal and infant victims (29 stillbirths, 7 newborns and 29 infants), who died of both unknown and known cause, the authors observed developmental anomalies of the hypoglossal nucleus (HGN) in high percentage of sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths. In particular, HGN hypoplasia, hyperplasia, positive expression of somatostatin and absence of interneurons were frequently found particularly in infant deaths, with a significant correlation with maternal smoking.",M2
19550082,"Facilitation of reflex swallowing from the pharynx and larynx.To evaluate the cooperative effect of afferent signals from the pharynx and larynx on reflex swallowing, the interactive effect of afferent signals from the pharyngeal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN-ph) and superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) was analyzed in detail in urethane-anesthetized rats. The electromyographic activity of the mylohyoid muscle was recorded as an indicator of swallowing activity. The onset latency of reflex swallowing was measured to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation of these nerves, and found to become shorter following an increase in the GPN-ph and/or SLN stimulus frequency. During simultaneous electrical stimulation of the GPN-ph and SLN (frequency: 5-10 Hz, intensity: 30 muA, duration: 1.0 ms for each), the onset latency of reflex swallowing became shorter than that for stimulation of each nerve independently. The present findings suggest that spatiotemporal summation of afferent signals from the GPN-ph and SLN results in an increase of motoneuronal activity in the <e>medullary</e> swallowing center, thus enhancing reflex swallowing.",M2
19549567,"Maps of cardiovascular and respiratory regions of rat ventral medulla: focus on the caudal medulla.The ventral medulla oblongata is critical for cardiorespiratory regulation. Here we review previous literature relating to sites within the ventral medulla that have been identified as having a 'cardiovascular' or 'respiratory' function. Together with the maps generated here, of sites from which cardiovascular and respiratory responses were evoked by glutamate microinjection, specific 'cardiovascular' regions have been defined and delineated. Commonly investigated regions, including the vasopressor rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and vasodepressor caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), or areas only described by others, such as the <e>medullary</e> cerebral vasodilator area, are included for completeness. Emphasis is given to the caudal medulla, where three pressor regions, the caudal pressor area (CPA), the intermediate pressor area (IPA) and the medullo-cervical pressor area (MCPA), caudal to the vasodepressor CVLM were defined in the original data provided. The IPA is most responsive under pentobarbitone rather than urethane anaesthesia clearly delineating it from both the rostrally located CPA and the caudally located MCPA. The description of these multiple pressor areas appears to clarify the confusion that surrounds the identification of the 'CPA'. Also noted is a vasopressor region adjacent to the vasodepressor CVLM. Apart from the well described ventral respiratory column, a region medial to the pre-Bötzinger is described, from which increases in both phrenic nerve frequency and amplitude were evoked. Limitations associated with the technique of glutamate microinjection to define functionally specific regions are discussed. Particular effort has been made to define and delineate the regions with respect to ventrally located anatomical landmarks rather than the commonly used ventral surface or dorsal landmarks such as the obex or calamus scriptorius that may vary with the brain orientation or histological processing. This should ensure that a region can easily be defined by all investigators. Study of defined regions will help expedite the identification of the role of the multiple cell groups with diverse neurotransmitter complements that exist even within each of the regions described, in coordinating the delivery of oxygenated blood to the tissues.",M2
19505861,"Fluorescence imaging of active respiratory networks.Breathing in mammals is controlled by neural networks in the brainstem such as the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) and the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG). Exploring these rhythmogenic networks and their interactions is greatly facilitated by live fluorescence imaging that enables analysis of (i) spatiotemporal patterns of respiratory (population) activities, (ii) (sub)cellular signaling in identified respiratory neurons, and (iii) membrane properties of respiratory neurons that are fluorescence-tagged for characteristic markers. Transversal <e>medullary</e> slices containing the preBötC and  en bloc  brainstem-spinal cord preparations with a functional preBötC/pFRG dual respiratory center which interacts, e.g., with pontine structures, are used for respiratory imaging in perinatal rodents.

In these in situ models, imaging with voltage and Ca2+ sensitive dyes is established for assessment of respiratory (population) activities.

19505592,"The conditional nature of the  Central Rhythm Generator  and the production of episodic breathing.Episodic breathing patterns have been observed in species of all vertebrate classes under certain conditions and/or at certain times in development. This breathing pattern can be considered part of a continuum between no breathing and continuous breathing. In birds and mammals it is also generally part of a developmental continuum in which episodic breathing occurs early in development and rarely in adults. Production of this pattern appears to be an intrinsic property of the <e>medullary</e> rhythm generating mechanism (possibly due to interactions between different rhythm generating sites) that is stabilized by pontine or midbrain inputs and, in intact animals, is primarily regulated by afferent inputs from chemoreceptors and pulmonary stretch receptors; i.e. there is a hierarchy of control. In all cases, episodes appear to be produced by quantal expression of a fundamental rhythm. At present NO, GABA(A) and glycine mediated processes, and possibly mu-opioid receptor mediated processes, are implicated in the clustering of breaths into episodes. The inter-breath interval, which may occur at either the end of the inspiratory or the expiratory phase in different species, is the primary regulated variable in this pattern. The biological significance of clustering breaths into episodes may relate to reducing the oxidative cost of breathing, enhancing gas exchange or minimizing oxidative damage to tissues.",M2
19481178,"<e>Medullary</e> serotonin defects and respiratory dysfunction in sudden infant death syndrome.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an infant less than 12 months of age that occurs during sleep and remains unexplained after a complete autopsy, death scene investigation, and review of the clinical history. It is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the developed world. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but is postulated to involve impairment of brainstem-mediated homeostatic control. Extensive evidence from animal studies indicates that serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the medulla oblongata play a role in the regulation of multiple aspects of respiratory and autonomic function. A subset of SIDS infants have several abnormalities in medullary markers of 5-HT function and genetic polymorphisms impacting the 5-HT system, informing the hypothesis that SIDS results from a defect in 5-HT brainstem-mediated control of respiratory (and autonomic) regulation. Here we review the evidence from postmortem human studies and animal studies to support this hypothesis and discuss how the pathogenesis of SIDS is likely to originate in utero during fetal development.",M2
19481009,"Identification of brain target neurons using a fluorescent conjugate of corticotropin-releasing factor.Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a peptide well known for its role in coordinating various neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral components of the vertebrate stress response, including rapid enhancement of locomotor activity. Although CRF's locomotor enhancing properties are well documented, the neuronal mechanisms and specific target neurons that underlie the peptide's effect on locomotor behavior remain poorly understood. In the present study, we describe the synthesis and functional characteristics of a CRF rhodamine analogue TAMRA-X conjugate mixture (CRF-TAMRA 1), to be used for tracking this peptide's internalization into target neurons in the brainstem of an amphibian, the roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa). CRF-TAMRA 1 conjugate administration into the lateral cerebral ventricle resulted in a rapid, endosomal-like internalization of fluorescence into brainstem <e>medullary</e> neurons. In addition, central CRF-TAMRA 1 administration produced neurobehavioral effects comparable to the native peptide, effects that were blocked by pre-treatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF. Taken together, our results show the efficacy of CRF-TAMRA 1 as a novel tool for tracking CRF internalization into targets neurons in vivo and ultimately, aiding in elucidating the neuronal mechanisms and circuitry underlying CRF's influence on behavioral and physiological responses to stress.",M2
19433074,"Localization of serotoninergic neurons that participate in regulating diaphragm activity in the cat.Although a considerable body of literature indicates that serotoninergic neurons affect diaphragm activity both through direct inputs to phrenic motoneurons and multisynaptic connections involving the brainstem respiratory groups, the locations of the serotoninergic neurons that modulate breathing have not been well defined. The present study identified these neurons in cats by combining the transneuronal retrograde transport of rabies virus from the diaphragm with the immunohistochemical detection of the N-terminal region of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), the brain-specific isoform of the enzyme responsible for the initial and rate-limiting step in serotonin synthesis. TPH2-immunopositive neurons were present in the midline raphe nuclei, formed a column in the ventrolateral medulla near the lateral reticular nucleus, and were spread across the dorsal portion of the pons just below the fourth ventricle. In most animals, only a small fraction of neurons (typically &lt;20%) labeled for TPH2 in each of the <e>medullary</e> raphe nuclei and the medullary ventrolateral column were infected with rabies virus. However, the percentage of medullary neurons dual-labeled for both rabies and TPH2 was much higher in animals with very advanced infections where virus had spread transneuronally through many synapses. Furthermore, in all cases, TPH2-immunopositive neurons that were infected by rabies virus were significantly less prevalent in the pons than the medulla. These findings suggest that although serotoninergic neurons with direct influences on diaphragm activity are widely scattered in the brainstem, the majority of these neurons are located in the medulla. Many non-serotoninergic neurons in the raphe nuclei were also infected with rabies virus, indicating that midline cells utilizing multiple neurotransmitters participate in the control of breathing.",M2
19429902,"Depletion of <e>medullary</e> serotonergic neurons in patients with multiple system atrophy who succumbed to sudden death.Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by prominent autonomic failure with ataxia and/or parkinsonism. The leading cause of death in MSA is sudden death. We have shown that the early development of autonomic failure is an independent risk factor for sudden death. The depletion of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal intermediolateral cell column (IML) and its afferent medullary catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons has been proposed to be partly responsible for autonomic failure in MSA. In this study, we investigated whether the depletion of neurons in any of these autonomic neuron groups contributes to sudden death in MSA. Out of 52 autopsy-proven patients with MSA, we selected 12 individuals who had died within 3.5 years after disease onset to define the accurate levels of slices and identify early neuropathological changes of autonomic nuclei in MSA. Four patients succumbed to sudden death and eight patients died through established causes. Serial 10 mum sections were obtained from the 8th segment of the thoracic cord and the rostral medulla oblongata. Sections from the medulla oblongata were immunostained for thyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. The total cell number in the five sections was computed for comparison. Compared with the control, the MSA group showed a marked depletion of neurons in the IML (38.0 +/- 7.1 versus 75.2 +/- 7.6 cells, P &lt; 0.001), thyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) (17.4 +/- 5.1 versus 72.8 +/- 13.6 cells, P &lt; 0.01) and tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the VLM (15.6 +/- 9.2 versus 60.8 +/- 17.0 cells, P &lt; 0.01), nucleus raphe obscurus (19.3 +/- 4.4 versus 75.3 +/- 8.6 cells, P &lt; 0.001), nucleus raphe pallidus (2.1 +/- 2.7 versus 9.0 +/- 3.4 cells, P &lt; 0.03), and arcuate nucleus (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.3 +/- 1.5 cells, P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in patients who succumbed to sudden death, when compared with patients who had established causes of death, we found a marked depletion of tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the VLM (7.3 +/- 3.5 versus 21.8 +/- 6.5 cells, P &lt; 0.02) and nucleus raphe obscurus (15.0 +/- 2.0 versus 22.5 +/- 2.1 cells, P &lt; 0.01). The results indicate that the spinal IML and medullary catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved even in the early stages of MSA, and the dysfunction of the medullary serotonergic system regulating cardiovascular and respiratory systems could be responsible for sudden death in patients with MSA.",M2
19429047,"Correlation of discharges of rostral ventrolateral <e>medullary</e> neurons with the low-frequency sympathetic rhythm in rats.The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is critically important in the generation of sympathetic activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether discharges of RVLM neurons contribute to low-frequency (LF) sympathetic rhythms. Blood pressure (BP), renal sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), and neuronal activity in the RVLM were simultaneously recorded in seven anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rats. Fifty-one RVLM neurons were recorded and classified into three differential functional groups according to their activities related to baroreceptor input. Those in the category of spike firing inhibited by a BP increase (BP(I)) and which excited sympathetic discharges was the most abundant (24%). Coherence analysis was used to examine the relationship of the firing frequency of RVLM neurons with the LF (0.2-0.8Hz) rhythm of SNA. Forty-one percent of RVLM neurons showed a significant correlation to LF rhythms, and BP(I) neurons with sympathoexcitatory properties were the major contributors. In another 4 baroreceptor-denervated rats, 36 RVLM neurons were recorded. In these rats, RVLM neuronal activities no longer changed with BP fluctuations. Nevertheless, more than 40% of RVLM neurons were sympathoexcitatory, and 36% of RVLM neurons were still correlated with the LF SNA rhythm. Our results suggest that there are RVLM neurons involved in generating the LF rhythm in SNA and that the baroreflex can induce the participation of more neurons in LF rhythm generation.",M2
19427365,"Dorsomedial pontine neurons with descending projections to the <e>medullary</e> reticular formation express orexin-1 and adrenergic alpha2A receptor mRNA.Neurons located in the dorsomedial pontine rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-triggering region send axons to the medial medullary reticular formation (mMRF). This pathway is believed to be important for the generation of REM sleep motor atonia, but other than that they are glutamatergic little is known about neurochemical signatures of these pontine neurons important for REM sleep. We used single-cell reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether dorsomedial pontine cells with projections to the mMRF express mRNA for selected membrane receptors that mediate modulatory influences on REM sleep. Fluorescein (FITC)-labeled latex microspheres were microinjected into the mMRF of 26-34-day-old rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. After 5-6 days, rats were sacrificed, pontine slices were obtained and neurons were dissociated from 400 to 600 microm micropunches extracted from dorsomedial pontine reticular formation. We found that 32 out of 51 FITC-labeled cells tested (63+/-7% (SE)) contained the orexin type 1 receptor (ORX1r) mRNA, 27 out of 73 (37+/-6%) contained the adrenergic alpha(2A) receptor (alpha(2A)r) RNA, and 6 out of 31 (19+/-7%) contained both mRNAs. The percentage of cells positive for the ORX1r mRNA was significantly lower (p&lt;0.04) for the dorsomedial pontine cells that were not retrogradely labeled from the mMRF (32+/-11%), whereas alpha(2A)r mRNA was present in a similar percentage of FITC-labeled and unlabeled neurons. Our data suggest that ORX and adrenergic pathways converge on a subpopulation of cells of the pontine REM sleep-triggering region that have descending projections to the medullary region important for the motor control during REM sleep.",M2

19396608,"Interleukin-6 and the serotonergic system of the medulla oblongata in the sudden infant death syndrome.Mild infection may trigger sudden death in the vulnerable infant by cytokine interactions with a compromised <e>medullary</e> serotonergic (5-HT) system, leading to disrupted cardiorespiratory regulation and sleep-related sudden death. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in SIDS. We tested the hypothesis that the expression of IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) and/or gp130 (involved in IL-6R signaling) is altered in the medullary 5-HT system in SIDS. Immunohistochemistry of IL-6R and gp130 was performed on medullae from 25 SIDS infants, 20 infectious deaths, and 14 controls using a semi-quantitative grading system. In the SIDS cases, mean IL-6R intensity grade in the arcuate nucleus (major component of medullary 5-HT system) was significantly higher than in the control group (2.00 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.08, P = 0.04), with no other differences in IL-6R or gp130 expression at any other site. Arcuate 5-HT neurons expressed IL-6R, indicating a site of IL-6/5-HT interaction. In SIDS, IL-6R expression is abnormal in the arcuate nucleus, the putative human homolog of rodent ventral medullary chemosensitivity sites involving 5-HT. Aberrant interactions between IL-6 and the arcuate nucleus may contribute to impaired responses to hypercapnia generated by infection (hyper-metabolism) combined with rebreathing.",M2
19386986,"Dorsomedial <e>medullary</e> 5-HT2 receptors mediate immediate onset of initial hyperventilation, airway dilation, and ventilatory decline during hypoxia in mice.The dorsomedial medulla oblongata (DMM) includes the solitary tract nucleus and the hypoglossal nucleus, to which 5-HT neurons project. Effects of 5-HT in the DMM on ventilatory augmentation and airway dilation are mediated via 5-HT2 receptors, which interact with the CO(2) drive. The interaction may elicit cycles between hyperventilation with airway dilation and hypoventilation with airway narrowing. In the present study, effects of 5-HT2 receptors in the DMM on hypoxic ventilatory and airway responses were investigated, while 5-HT release in the DMM was monitored. Adult male mice were anesthetized, and then a microdialysis probe was inserted into the DMM. The mice were placed in a double-chamber plethysmograph. After recovery from anesthesia, the mice were exposed to hypoxic gas (7% O(2) in N(2)) for 5 min with or without a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist (LY-53857) perfused in the DMM. 5-HT release in the DMM was increased by hypoxia regardless of the presence of LY-53857. Immediate onset and the peak of initial hypoxic hyperventilatory responses were delayed. Subsequent ventilatory decline and airway dilation during initial hypoxic hyperventilation were suppressed with LY-53857. These results suggest that 5-HT release increased by hypoxia acts on 5-HT2 receptors in the DMM, which contributes to the immediate onset of initial hypoxic hyperventilation, airway dilation, and subsequent ventilatory decline. Hypoxic ventilatory and airway responses mediated via 5-HT2 receptors in the DMM may play roles in immediate rescue and defensive adaptation for hypoxia and may be included in periodic breathing and the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea.",M2
19379780,"Angiotensin II type-2 (AT2) receptor antagonism alters cardiovascular responses to static exercise and simultaneously changes glutamate/GABA levels within the ventrolateral medulla.Angiotensin II receptors (Ang II), classified into AT1 and AT2 subtypes, are located in different regions of the central nervous system, including the cardiovascular control centers in the medulla oblongata. We previously reported the role of Ang II AT1 receptors within the medulla on cardiovascular responses and glutamate/GABA neurotransmission during the exercise pressor reflex [Patel, D., Böhlke, M., Phattanarudee, S., Kabadi, S., Maher, T.J., Ally, A., 2008. Cardiovascular responses and neurotransmitter changes during blockade of angiotensin II receptors within the ventrolateral medulla. Neurosci. Res. 60 (3), 340-348]. In this study, we investigated the role of the AT2 receptor subtype within the ventrolateral <e>medullary</e> region (VLM) in modulating increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in response to static skeletal muscle contraction. METHODS: Using microdialysis methods in anesthetized rats, we administered AR-AT2 antagonists into the rostral (RVLM) and caudal (CVLM) VLM and determined its effects on cardiovascular responses and glutamate/GABA neurotransmission following muscle contraction. Bilateral microdialysis of a selective AT2 antagonist, PD 123319 (10 microM), for 30 min into the RVLM augmented MAP and HR responses during a static muscle contraction. Simultaneously, the drug increased glutamate and decreased GABA levels within the RVLM. After 60 min of discontinuation of the drug, only MAP and HR values but not the neurotransmitter levels in response to a muscle contraction returned to baseline. In contrast, bilateral microdialysis of the drug into the CVLM attenuated cardiovascular responses during a static muscle contraction, decreased glutamate and increased GABA. However, only the cardiovascular responses recovered after 60 min of discontinuation of the drug. These results demonstrate that AT2 within both RVLM and CVLM plays important differential roles in modulating neurotransmission and cardiovascular function during the exercise pressor reflex.",M2
19321769,"Raphé neurons stimulate respiratory circuit activity by multiple mechanisms via endogenously released serotonin and substance P.Brainstem serotonin (5-HT) neurons modulate activity of many neural circuits in the mammalian brain, but in many cases endogenous mechanisms have not been resolved. Here, we analyzed actions of raphé 5-HT neurons on respiratory network activity including at the level of the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) in neonatal rat <e>medullary</e> slices in vitro, and in the more intact nervous system of juvenile rats in arterially perfused brainstem-spinal cord preparations in situ. At basal levels of activity, excitation of the respiratory network via simultaneous release of 5-HT and substance P (SP), acting at 5-HT(2A/2C), 5-HT(4), and/or neurokinin-1 receptors, was required to maintain inspiratory motor output in both the neonatal and juvenile systems. The midline raphé obscurus contained spontaneously active 5-HT neurons, some of which projected to the pre-BötC and hypoglossal motoneurons, colocalized 5-HT and SP, and received reciprocal excitatory connections from the pre-BötC. Experimentally augmenting raphé obscurus activity increased motor output by simultaneously exciting pre-BötC and motor neurons. Biophysical analyses in vitro demonstrated that 5-HT and SP modulated background cation conductances in pre-BötC and motor neurons, including a nonselective cation leak current that contributed to the resting potential, which explains the neuronal depolarization that augmented motor output. Furthermore, we found that 5-HT, but not SP, can transform the electrophysiological phenotype of some pre-BötC neurons to intrinsic bursters, providing 5-HT with an additional role in promoting rhythm generation. We conclude that raphé 5-HT neurons excite key circuit components required for generation of respiratory motor output.",M2

19302154,"Tolerance to non-opioid analgesics in PAG involves unresponsiveness of <e>medullary</e> pain-modulating neurons in male rats.Opiate analgesia can be hampered by a reduction in pharmacological effectiveness (tolerance), and this crucially depends on the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Non-opioids like metamizol (dipyrone) or aspirin also induce PAG-dependent analgesia and tolerance, but the neuronal bases of this tolerance are unknown. Metamizol is a pyrazolon derivative and cyclooxygenase inhibitor with widespread use as an analgesic in Europe and Latin America. Metamizol was microinjected into the PAG of awake male rats, and antinociception was assessed by the tail flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests. Microinjection twice daily for 2.5 days caused tolerance to metamizol. The rats were then anesthetized and recordings from pain-facilitating on-cells and pain-inhibiting off-cells of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) were performed. PAG microinjection of morphine or metamizol depresses on-cells, activates off-cells and thus inhibits nociception, including TF and HP. In metamizol-tolerant rats, however, PAG microinjection of metamizol failed to affect on- or off-cells, and this is interpreted as the reason for tolerance. In metamizol-tolerant rats morphine microinjection into PAG also failed to affect RVM neurons or nociception (cross-tolerance). In naïve, non-tolerant rats the antinociceptive effect of PAG-microinjected metamizol or morphine was blocked when CTOP, a mu-opioid antagonist, was previously microinjected into the same PAG site. These results emphasize a close relationship between opioid and non-opioid analgesic mechanisms in the PAG and show that, like morphine, tolerance to metamizol involves a failure of on- and off-cells to, respectively, disfacilitate and inhibit nociception. Cross-tolerance between non-opioid and opioid analgesics should be important in the clinical setting.",M2
19295165,"Adrenergic and noradrenergic innervation of the midbrain ventral tegmental area and retrorubral field: prominent inputs from <e>medullary</e> homeostatic centers.Adrenergic agents modulate the activity of midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. However, the sources of noradrenergic and adrenergic inputs are not well characterized. Immunostaining for dopamine beta-hydroxylase revealed fibers within dopamine (DA) neuron areas, with the highest density in the retrorubral field (A8 cell group), followed by the VTA (A10 cell group), and very few fibers within substantia nigra compacta. A less dense, but a similar pattern of fibers was also found for the epinephrine marker, phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase. Injection of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin-apo (inactivated) horseradish peroxidase conjugated to colloidal gold, or cholera toxin subunit b, revealed that the noradrenergic innervation of the A10 and A8 regions arise primarily from A1, A2, A5, and locus ceruleus neurons. Selective lesions of the ventral noradrenergic bundle confirmed a prominent innervation from A1 and A2 areas. Retrogradely labeled epinephrine neurons were found mainly in the C1 area. The identification of medullary noradrenergic and adrenergic afferents to DA neuron areas indicates new pathways for visceral-related inputs to reward-related areas in the midbrain.",M2

To our surprise, palatal weakness was on the right side, instead of being on the left side as expected in typical Wallenberg syndrome. The palatal paresis was noted during voluntary phonation but turned into normal movement while gag reflex was induced. An involvement of corticobulbar fibers before synapsing into the ipsilateral caudal medulla or a selective involvement of the peri-ambigual reticular formation and/or its post-synaptic connection fiber destined to the contralateral swallowing center presumably underlies such a rare contralateral palatal paresis.",M2

19259966,"<e>Medullary</e> pain facilitating neurons mediate allodynia in headache-related pain.OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a model of cutaneous allodynia triggered by dural inflammation for pain associated with headaches. To explore neural mechanisms underlying cephalic and extracephalic allodynia. METHODS: Inflammatory mediators (IM) were applied to the dura of unanesthetized rats via previously implanted cannulas, and sensory thresholds of the face and hind-paws were characterized. RESULTS: IM elicited robust facial and hind-paw allodynia, which peaked within 3 hours. These effects were reminiscent of cutaneous allodynia seen in patients with migraine or other primary headache conditions, and were reversed by agents used clinically in the treatment of migraine, including sumatriptan, naproxen, and a calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist. Consistent with clinical observations, the allodynia was unaffected by a neurokinin-1 antagonist. Having established facial and hind-paw allodynia as a useful animal surrogate of headache-associated allodynia, we next showed that blocking pain-facilitating processes in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) interfered with its expression. Bupivacaine, destruction of putative pain-facilitating neurons, or block of cholecystokinin receptors prevented or significantly attenuated IM-induced allodynia. Electrophysiological studies confirmed activation of pain-facilitating RVM  on  cells and transient suppression of RVM  off  cells after IM. INTERPRETATION: Facial and hind-paw allodynia associated with dural stimulation is a useful surrogate of pain associated with primary headache including migraine and may be exploited mechanistically for development of novel therapeutic strategies for headache pain. The data also demonstrate the requirement for activation of descending facilitation from the RVM for the expression of cranial and extracranial cutaneous allodynia, and are consistent with a brainstem generator of allodynia associated with headache disorders.",M2
19259030,"Sudden unexpected death related to <e>medullary</e> brain lesions.The sudden unexpected death of a person believed healthy has occasionally been followed by a detailed postmortem examination that revealed no cause of death except for the unexpected presence of a medullary brain lesion. Our review of all available cases of sudden unexpected death related to medullary brain lesions (SUD-MBL) revealed the absence of any specific constellation of ante-mortem disease characteristics, together with the finding that major motor and sensory pathways were grossly preserved in most cases. The wide variety in ages of the victims, and in specific types of tissue pathology affecting the medulla, makes this illness extremely difficult to anticipate when the medullary lesions are not otherwise known to exist during life. SUD-MBL may be a specific clinico-neuropathologic disease entity, having significant importance for forensic investigators trying to establish the cause of sudden unexpected death in a victim of any age. Because victims often harbor their medullary lesions for days or weeks before SUD-MBL, clinical physicians as well need to consider the possibility of medullary brain involvement by any disease process, neurologic or systemic, while managing their patients.",M2

Spontaneously breathing rabbits were anesthetized by ketamine and xylazine i.m., followed by pentobarbitone i.v. Excitatory neurotoxin kainic acid (2 mg/ml in artificial CSF, total volume of 55-100 nl) was pressure microinjected into the medullary midline, rostral to the obex (2 microinjections at 2 different depths). The lesion (mostly affected the obscurus and magnus raphe nuclei) reduced the number of reflex expirations by 80% and expiratory amplitudes of esophageal pressure, abdominal EMG moving averages, and abdominal EMG powers by 71%, 62%, and 57%, respectively (in all cases P&lt;0.05). The duration of abdominal activity in post-lesion responses was not altered. Control microinjections of artificial CSF had no effect on the reflex responses. We conclude that in rabbits, the medullary raphe nuclei participate in the control of expiratory expulsions originating from the trachea.",M2
19235901,"Brainstem mechanisms underlying the sudden infant death syndrome: evidence from human pathologic studies.The brainstem hypothesis is one of the leading hypotheses concerning the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It states that SIDS, or an important subset of SIDS, is due to abnormal brainstem mechanisms in the control of respiration, chemosensitivity, autonomic regulation, and/or arousal which impairs the infant's response to life-threatening, but often occurring, stressors during sleep (e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, asphyxia, hyperthermia) and leads to sudden death in a vulnerable developmental period. In this review, we summarize neuropathologic evidence from SIDS cases that support this hypothesis, beginning with the seminal report of subtle brainstem gliosis three decades ago. We focus upon recent neurochemical studies in our laboratory concerning the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and its key role in mediating protective responses to homeostatic stressors via <e>medullary</e> circuits. The possible fetal origin of brainstem defects in SIDS is reviewed, including evidence for adverse effects of prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and alcohol upon the postnatal development of human brainstem 5-HT pathways.",M2

We compared 2 cases of pontine vascular lesions with 3 cases of lateral medullary infarction; all the patients had presented with body lateropulsion. The patients with pontine lesions tended to full on the side contralateral to the lesion,whereas the patients with lateral medullary infarction, fell on the ipsilateral side. Lateropulsion itself improved within 1 or 2 weeks in all the patients. The pontine lesion was localized to the paramedian tegmentum, just ventral to the fourth ventricle, while the medullary infarction was localized to the lateral surface of the medulla oblongata. The present findings support the possibility that body lateropulsion in patients with pontine vascular lesion is attributed to lesions in the graviceptive pathway that ascends through the paramedian pontine tegmentum.",M2
19154800,"Respiratory response to systemic inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger type 3 in intact rats.The Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) are a family of antiporters involved in the maintenance of neural steady-state intracellular pH. The NHE3 seems to be the predominant subtype in central chemosensitive cells. We aimed to analyze the effect of a selective NHE3 inhibition on the respiratory pattern in spontaneously breathing rats with intact vagi. Rats were intravenously infused for 10 min with the selective NHE3 inhibitor AVE1599 (Aventis Pharma Deustchland, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg) or with phosphate buffer. Whole-body plethysmography was used to monitor breathing pattern before, during, and up to 30 min after the drug infusion. Immunohistochemistry for the c-Fos protein was performed in the animal brains and c-Fos-positive cells were counted along the brainstem. Selective NHE3 inhibition induced a significant increase in the respiratory frequency and in the number of c-Fos immunopositive cells in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the pre-Bötzinger complex and a rostral extension of the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parapyramidal region (p&lt;0.05, ANOVA).

Here we investigated a differential role of the raphe magnus (RMg), pallidus (RPa) and the obscurus (ROb) nuclei in the neural control of DIA and GH muscle activity in rats under volatile anesthesia. In order to characterize a topographical organization of the raphe nuclei we analyzed changes in DIA and GH during high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 10-130 Hz, 60 micros pulse width, 40-160 microA, 30s). HFS of the RMg and the ROb induced apnea, in the latter case apnea was associated with massive tonic discharge in the GH. By contrast, HFS of the RPa induced tachypnea. At caudal stimulation sites the tachypnea was accompanied by tonic DIA activity and cessation of GH. These data suggest a differential distribution of inhibitory and excitatory drives of DIA and GH muscles within distinct raphe nuclei.",M2

METHODS: Neonatal (0-3 days) SD rats of either sex were used in this study. The medulla oblongata brain slice containing the medial region of the nucleus retrofacialis (mNRF) and the hypoglossal nerve rootlets was prepared, and the surgical procedure was performed in the modified Kreb's solution (MKS) with continuous carbogen (95% O(2) and 5% CO(2)) within 3 min. The rhythmical respiratory discharge activity (RRDA) of the hypoglossal nerve rootlets was recorded using suction electrode. Eighteen medulla oblongata slice preparations were divided into 3 groups and treated for 20 min with Gly receptor specific agonist Gly (10 micromol/L), Gly receptor antagonist strychnine (STR, 1 micromol/L), or Gly+STR after a 20 min Gly application. The changes in RRDA of the hypoglossal nerve rootlets were observed. RESULTS: Gly significantly decreased the inspiratory time and integral amplitude (IA), but the changes of respiratory cycle (RC) and expiratory time (TE) were not statistically significant. STR induced a decrease in expiratory time and respiratory cycle without significantly affecting the inspiratory time or integral amplitud. The effect of Gly on the respiratory rhythm was partially reversed by additional application of STR. CONCLUSION: Gly may play an important role in the modulation of RRDA in the medulla oblongata slice of neonatal rats.",M2

Using a split bath preparation to isolate the pons from the medulla, antagonists for alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoreceptors were applied to only the medulla at postnatal days 0, 2 and 4, before and after transection of the pons. Blocking alpha1 and alpha2 receptors in the medulla in the absence of a pons reduced burst frequency at all ages with a more pronounced effect in younger animals. At all ages the presence of a pons diminished the effect of blocking alpha2 receptors in the medulla and eliminated the effect of blocking alpha1 receptors. These results indicate that there is a tonic release of catecholamines within the medulla that is under influence from the pons. Additionally, transection experiments indicated that during development, the net influence of the pons changed from one of excitation to one of inhibition.",M2
19108851,"Hemimedullary infarct with ipsilateral hemiplegia: a vertebral artery dissection syndrome?BACKGROUND: Hemimedullary syndrome is very rare and combines the clinical features of lateral and medial <e>medullary</e> infarctions. In patients with hemimedullary syndrome, the presence of ipsilateral, rather than contralateral hemiplegia, is rare. OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with an infarction in the right hemimedulla with an ipsilateral motor deficit due to dissection of the right vertebral artery (VA) and to assess whether the ipsilateral hemiplegia may be the result of a specific stroke mechanism. METHODS: We reviewed the reports of hemimedullary syndrome in the literature and compared the characteristics of patients with dissection of the VA with those with VA atherosclerotic disease. RESULTS: In our patient, magnetic resonance angiography showed dissection of the right VA to be the cause of the stroke. In a review of the literature (including our case), hemiplegia was ipsilateral to the infarction in four of the five patients with VA dissection, but contralateral in all six patients with atherosclerotic disease of the VA (p=0.01). In all five cases of VA dissection, the right hemimedulla was involved, while, in the six cases of atherosclerotic disease, the left side of the medulla oblongata was affected in five instances and the right side in one (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Dissection of the VA may provoke a hemimedullary lesion at a lower level than atherosclerosis, thus affecting medullary-penetrating branches that irrigate the medulla immediately below the pyramidal decussation. Hemimedullary syndrome accompanied by ipsilateral motor deficit should raise suspicion of dissection of the VA.",M2
19095841,"Nicotinic receptors partly mediate brainstem autonomic dysfunction evoked by the inhaled anesthetic isoflurane.BACKGROUND: Isoflurane is one of the most commonly used volatile anesthetics, yet the cardiorespiratory depression that occurs with its use remains poorly understood. In this study, the author examined isoflurane modulation of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) and alterations of GABAergic function by targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on GABAergic presynaptic terminals. METHODS: Rhythmic inspiratory-related activity was recorded from the hypoglossal rootlet of 800 microm <e>medullary</e> sections. CVNs were identified by retrograde fluorescent labeling, and GABAergic neurotransmission to CVNs were examined using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques. RESULTS: Isoflurane at concentrations of &gt;50 microM significantly suppressed inspiratory bursting frequency, amplitude, and duration. Isoflurane dose-dependently decreased the frequency and increased the decay time of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CVNs. To test whether the inhibition of GABAergic activity to CVNs was mediated by presynaptic nicotinic receptors, the nicotinic antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine in an alpha(4)beta(2)-selective concentration (3 microM), was used. Dihydro-beta-erythroidine (3 microM) prevented the isoflurane-evoked depression of spontaneous GABAergic IPSC frequency, yet isoflurane still increased the IPSC decay time. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane inhibit brainstem respiratory rhythmogenesis, prolong inhibitory GABAergic postsynaptic currents and reduce GABA activity in CVNs. The decrease of GABAergic IPSCs frequency is dependent upon inhibition of presynaptic alpha(4)beta(2) nicotinic receptors.",M2
19090786,"NAADP-mediated channel 'chatter' in neurons of the rat medulla oblongata.NAADP (nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is a potent Ca(2+)-mobilizing messenger that stimulates Ca(2+) release in a variety of cells. NAADP-sensitive Ca(2+) channels are thought to reside on acidic Ca(2+) stores and to be functionally coupled to IP(3) (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and/or ryanodine receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether NAADP-sensitive Ca(2+) channels 'chatter' to other channels, however, is not clear. In the present study, we have used a cell-permeant NAADP analogue to probe NAADP-mediated responses in rat medulla oblongata neurons. NAADP-AM (NAADP-acetoxymethyl ester) evoked global cytosolic Ca(2+) signals in isolated neurons that were reduced in amplitude by removal of external Ca(2+), abolished by disruption of acidic compartments and substantially inhibited by blockade of ryanodine receptors. In rat <e>medullary</e> slices, NAADP-AM depolarized neurons from the nucleus ambiguus in the presence of intracellular EGTA, but not of the faster Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA [1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid]. Depolarization was also dependent upon extracellular Ca(2+), acidic stores and ryanodine receptors. In voltage-clamp mode, NAADP-AM induced an inward current with a reversal potential of approx. 0 mV. The results of the present study reveal the presence of acidic NAADP-sensitive Ca(2+) stores in medulla neurons, the mobilization of which results not only in global Ca(2+) signals but also in local signals that activate non-selective cation channels on the cell surface resulting in depolarization. Thus NAADP is capable of co-ordinating channels both within the cell interior and at the cell membrane representing a novel mechanism for excitation of central neurons.",M2

Similar approaches may also be useful when applied at the supraspinal pain control system as the system includes pronociceptive (facilitatory) components. We performed a study aimed to analyse the migration of HSV-1 along with the inhibition of pronociception from the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt), a major facilitatory component of the supraspinal pain control system. To study the migration, a HSV-1 vector expressing lacZ under control of the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter was injected in the DRt and the expression of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) was detected at 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days. Numerous beta-gal-immunoreactive neurons were observed at the injection site until day 4, and at some of the brain areas projecting to the DRt until day 7. To block the pronociceptive effects of the DRt, a HSV-1 vector expressing the preproenkephalin transgene, under the control of hCMV promoter, was injected into the DRt. Behavioural evaluation was performed at the time-points referred above, using the paw withdrawal latency test to evaluate thermal nociceptive responses. Anti-hyperalgesic effects persisted during 4 days, decreasing after that time-point. The present study demonstrates that selective migration of HSV-1 should be considered in gene therapy strategies based on HSV-1 injections into the brain. The study also shows that it is possible to decrease pain facilitation from the brain using opioidergic inhibition of pronociceptive supraspinal areas.",M2
19042981,"To breathe or not to breathe? That is the question.Our understanding of the role of the brain in respiratory rhythm generation and regulation began the early nineteenth century. Over the next 150 years the neuronal groups in the medulla oblongata and pons that were involved in eupnoea and in gasping were identified by techniques involving the lesioning of areas of the lower brainstem, several transections across the brainstem and focal electrical stimulation. An incomplete picture emerged that stressed the importance of the ventral medulla. Subsequent electrophysiological studies in in vivo, in situ and in vitro preparations have revealed the importance of restricted groups of neurones in this area, within the Bötzinger and pre-Bötzinger nuclei, that are the essential kernel for rhythm generation. The outputs to the spinal motoneurones responsible for the patterning of inspiratory and expiratory discharge are shaped by inputs from these neurones and others within the respiratory complex that determine the activity of respiratory bulbospinal neurones. It is clear that the developmental stage of the preparation is often critical for the pattern of respiratory activity that is generated and that these patterns have important physiological consequences. The models that are currently considered to explain rhythmogenesis are critically evaluated. The respiratory network is subject to regulation from peripheral and central chemoreceptors, amongst other afferent inputs, which act to ensure respiratory homeostasis. The roles of peripheral chemoreceptors as primarily O(2) sensors are considered, and the evolution of ideas surrounding their roles is described. New insights into the transduction mechanisms of chemoreception in the carotid body and chemosensitive areas of the ventral <e>medullary</e> surface, specifically in monitoring CO(2) levels, are reviewed. As new experimental tools, both genetic and cellular, are emerging, it can be expected that the detailed network architecture and synaptic interactions that pattern respiratory activity in relation to behavioural activity will be revealed over the next years.",M2
19041367,"Neurons in the preBötzinger complex and VRG are located in proximity to arterioles in newborn mice.The constant cyclic respiratory activity in the brainstem requires an un-interrupted blood flow providing glucose and O(2) to neurons generating respiratory rhythm. Here we used a combination of classical vascular visualization techniques, and calcium imaging, to compare the microvascular structure and localization of active respiratory neurons in the brainstem of newborn mice at the level of the preBötzinger complex (PBC) and ventral respiratory group. The brainstem is supplied with perforating arteries, which enter primarily in the midline and in a circumscribed region mid-laterally in the medulla. Presumed arterioles then pass dorso-medially with a high density immediately lateral to the midline, and mid-laterally at approximately 60% of the midline-to-lateral edge distance. Calcium imaging, using Fluo-8, AM, showed that active PBC/VRG neurons are located in the same region where a high density of arterioles is found. We conclude that the striking co-localization of <e>medullary</e> arterioles and the PBC/VRG could imply that respiratory neurons may derive part of their glucose and oxygen consumption directly from arterioles, and that humoral factors affecting ventilation may reach respiratory neurons by precapillary transport mechanisms.",M2
19015226,"Anti-Hu-associated brainstem encephalitis.OBJECTIVE: A series of patients with anti-Hu-associated brainstem encephalitis is reviewed to better define the clinical presentation and to improve its recognition. METHODS: Data were collected from 14 patients diagnosed by members of the Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndromes Euronetwork, and eight patients from the literature who presented with isolated brainstem encephalitis and had anti-Hu antibodies. RESULTS: The median age of the 22 patients was 64 years (range 42-83), and 50% were men. All patients developed a subacute neurological syndrome, in days or weeks. Brain MRI was always normal. Mild cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was reported in only two patients. The following syndromes were identified on admission: A <e>medullary</e> syndrome was seen in 11 (50%) patients. Seven of them presented with dysphagia, dysarthria and central hypoventilation. The other four in addition of bulbar symptoms, without central hypoventilation, presented pontine manifestations. Six (27%) patients developed a pontine syndrome with paresis of the VI or VII cranial nerves, nystagmus, usually vertical, and gait ataxia. There was a rapid downward progression to the medulla in all patients. Five (23%) patients presented a ponto-mesencephalic syndrome with uni- or bilateral palsy of the III and VI cranial nerves and gait ataxia, but rapidly progressed to complete gaze paresis and medullary dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the predominant medullary involvement but also shows that half of the patients present with clinical features that indicate an upper, mainly pontine, dysfunction before downward progression.",M2
18986852,"The development of nicotinic receptors in the human medulla oblongata: inter-relationship with the serotonergic system.Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy adversely affects fetal development and increases the risk for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In SIDS we have reported abnormalities in the <e>medullary</e> serotonergic (5-HT) system, which is vital for homeostatic control. In this study we analyzed the inter-relationship between nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), to which nicotine in cigarette smoke bind, and the medullary 5-HT system in the human fetus and infant as a step towards determining the mechanisms whereby smoking increases SIDS risk in infants with 5-HT defects. Immunohistochemistry for the alpha4 nAChR subunit and 5-HT neurons was applied in fetal and infant medullae (15-92 postconceptional weeks, n=9). The distribution of different nAChRs was determined from 39-82 postconceptional weeks (n=5) using tissue autoradiography for 3H-nicotine, 3H-epibatidine, 3H-cytisine, and 125I-bungarotoxin; the findings were compared to laboratory 5-HT1A and 5-HT transporter binding data, and 5-HT neuronal density. Alpha4 immunoreactivity was ubiquitously expressed in medullary nuclei related to homeostatic functions from 15 weeks on, including rhombic lip germinal cells. At all ages, alpha4 co-localized with 5-HT neurons, indicating a potential site of interaction whereby exogenous nicotine may adversely affect 5-HT neuronal development and function. Binding for heteromeric nAChRs was highest in the inferior olive, and for homomeric nAChRs, in the vagal complex. In the paragigantocellularis lateralis, 5-HT1A receptor binding simultaneously increased as alpha7 binding decreased across infancy. This study indicates parallel dynamic and complex changes in the medullary nicotinic and 5-HT systems throughout early life, i.e., the period of risk for SIDS.",M2
18986225,"Segmental neuropathic pain does not develop in male rats with complete spinal transections.In a previous study using male rats, a correlation was found between the development of  at-level  allodynia in T6-7 dermatomes following severe T8 spinal contusion injury and the sparing of some myelinated axons within the core of the lesion epicenter. To further test our hypothesis that this sparing is important for the expression of allodynia and the supraspinal plasticity that ensues, an injury that severs all axons (i.e., a complete spinal cord transection) was made in 15 male rats. Behavioral assessments were done at level throughout the 30-day recovery period followed by terminal electrophysiological recordings (urethane anesthesia) from single <e>medullary</e> reticular formation (MRF) neurons receiving convergent nociceptive inputs from receptive fields above, at, and below the lesion level. None of the rats developed signs of at-level allodynia (versus 18 of 26 male rats following severe contusion). However, the terminal recording (206 MRF neurons) data resembled those obtained previously post-contusion. That is, there was evidence of neuronal hyper-excitability (relative to previous data from intact controls) to high- and low-threshold mechanical stimulation for  at-level  (dorsal trunk) and  above-level  (eyelids and face) cutaneous territories. These results, when combined with prior data on intact controls and severe/moderate contusions, indicate that (1) an anatomically incomplete injury (some lesion epicenter axonal sparing) following severe contusion is likely important for the development of allodynia and (2) the neuronal hyper-excitability at the level of the medulla is likely involved in nociceptive processes that are not directly related to the conscious expression of pain-like avoidance behaviors that are being used as evidence of allodynia.",M2
18974365,"Neural circuits controlling diaphragm function in the cat revealed by transneuronal tracing.Although a number of studies have considered the neural circuitry that regulates diaphragm activity, these pathways have not been adequately discerned, particularly in animals such as cats that utilize the respiratory muscles during a variety of different behaviors and movements. The present study employed the retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify the extended neural pathways that control diaphragm function in felines. In all animals deemed to have successful rabies virus injections into the diaphragm, large, presumed motoneurons were infected in the C(4)-C(6) spinal segments. In addition, smaller presumed interneurons were labeled bilaterally throughout the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. While in short and intermediate survival cases, infected interneurons were concentrated in the vicinity of phrenic motoneurons, in late survival cases, the distribution of labeling was more expansive. Within the brain stem, the earliest infected neurons included those located in the classically defined pontine and <e>medullary</e> respiratory groups, the medial and lateral medullary reticular formation, the region immediately ventral to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, raphe pallidus and obscurus, and the vestibular nuclei. At longer survival times, infection appeared in the midbrain, which was concentrated in the lateral portion of the periaqueductal gray, the region of the tegmentum that contains the locomotion center, and the red nucleus. Considerable labeling was also present in the fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum, portions of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and the adjacent fields of Forel known to contain hypocretin-containing neurons and the precruciate gyrus of cerebral cortex. These data raise the possibility that several parallel pathways participate in regulating the activity of the feline diaphragm, which underscores the multifunctional nature of the respiratory muscles in this species.",M2
18971354,"Heme oxygenase is necessary for the excitatory response of cultured neonatal rat rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons to hypoxia.Heme oxygenase has been linked to the oxygen-sensing function of the carotid body, pulmonary vasculature, cerebral vasculature, and airway smooth muscle. We have shown previously that the cardiorespiratory regions of the rostral ventrolateral medulla are excited by local hypoxia and that heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) is expressed in the hypoxia-chemosensitive regions of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the respiratory pre-Bötzinger complex, and C1 sympathoexcitatory region. To determine whether heme oxygenase is necessary for the hypoxic-excitation of dissociated RVLM neurons (P1) cultured on confluent <e>medullary</e> astrocytes (P5), we examined their electrophysiological responses to hypoxia (NaCN and low Po(2)) using the whole-cell perforated patch clamp technique before and after blocking heme oxygenase with tin protoporphyrin-IX (SnPP-IX). Following the electrophysiological recording, immunocytochemistry was performed on the recorded neuron to correlate the electrophysiological response to hypoxia with the expression of HO-2. We found that the responses to NaCN and hypoxia were similar. RVLM neurons responded to NaCN and low Po(2) with either depolarization or hyperpolarization and SnPP-IX blocked the depolarization response of hypoxia-excited neurons to both NaCN and low Po(2) but had no effect on the hyperpolarization response of hypoxia-depressed neurons. Consistent with this observation, HO-2 expression was present only in the hypoxia-excited neurons. We conclude that RVLM neurons are excited by hypoxia via a heme oxygenase-dependent mechanism.",M2
18945911,"Central respiratory rhythmogenesis is abnormal in lbx1- deficient mice.Lbx1 is a transcription factor that determines neuronal cell fate and identity in the developing medulla and spinal cord. Newborn Lbx1 mutant mice die of respiratory distress during the early postnatal period. Using in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparations we tested the hypothesis that Lbx1 is necessary for the inception, development and modulation of central respiratory rhythmogenesis. The inception of respiratory rhythmogenesis at embryonic day 15 (E15) was not perturbed in Lbx1 mutant mice. However, the typical age-dependent increase in respiratory frequency observed in wild-type from E15 to P0 was not observed in Lbx1 mutant mice. The slow respiratory rhythms in E18.5 Lbx1 mutant preparations were increased to wild-type frequencies by application of substance P, thyrotropin releasing hormone, serotonin, noradrenaline, or the ampakine drug 1-(1,4-benzodioxan-6-yl-carbonyl) piperidine. Those data suggest that respiratory rhythm generation within the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is presumably functional in Lbx1 mutant mice with additional neurochemical drive. This was supported by anatomical data showing that the gross structure of the preBötC was normal, although there were major defects in neuronal populations that provide important modulatory drive to the preBötC including the retrotrapezoid nucleus, catecholaminergic brainstem nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, and populations of inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial <e>medullary</e> nuclei. Finally, we determined that those defects were caused by abnormalities of neuronal specification early in development or subsequent neuronal migration.",M2
18929640,"Calretinin-immunoreactive systems in the cerebellum and cerebellum-related lateral-line <e>medullary</e> nuclei of an elasmobranch, Scyliorhinus canicula.Calretinin immunohistochemistry was used to study the organization of some cerebellar structures and lateral line medullary nuclei of an elasmobranch, the lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. In the cerebellar molecular layer, stellate cells are strongly calretinin-immunoreactive (CR-ir). Perikarya and dendrites of Purkinje cells are contacted by numerous stellate cell small CR-ir boutons. Some Purkinje cell perikarya are contacted by CR-ir climbing fibers forming complex axo-somatic contacts. In the granular layer, numerous CR-ir mossy fibers exhibited large swellings. Notable differences in density and diameter of mossy fibers are observed between the auricles and cerebellar body. Thin beaded CR-ir fibers are also present in the granular layer of the body. The lateral line nuclei of the octavolateralis region are comprised of a molecular-like cerebellar crest that covers the dorsal (electroreceptive) and the medial octavolateralis nuclei (mechanoreceptive). The cerebellar crest exhibited numerous CR-ir stellate cells. In the dorsal octavolateralis nucleus, the presence of conspicuous CR-ir cells and neuropil closely associated to the region of primary fiber terminals distinguishes it clearly from the medial nucleus, revealing major differences between the electroreceptive and mechanoreceptive primary nuclei of elasmobranchs. Moreover, CR distribution in the dogfish cerebellum showed interesting differences with those reported in cerebella of other vertebrates, indicating a high variability of cerebellar CR expression in phylogeny.",M2
18924146,"Cervical prephrenic interneurons in the normal and lesioned spinal cord of the adult rat.Although monosynaptic bulbospinal projections to phrenic motoneurons have been extensively described, little is known about the organization of phrenic premotor neurons in the adult rat spinal cord. Because interneurons may play an important role in normal breathing and recovery following spinal cord injury, the present study has used anterograde and transneuronal retrograde tracing to study their distribution and synaptic relations. Exclusive unilateral, first-order labeling of the phrenic motoneuron pool with pseudorabies virus demonstrated a substantial number of second-order, bilaterally distributed cervical interneurons predominantly in the dorsal horn and around the central canal. Combined transneuronal and anterograde tracing revealed ventral respiratory column projections to prephrenic interneurons, suggesting that some propriospinal relays exist between <e>medullary</e> neurons and the phrenic nucleus. Dual-labeling studies with pseudorabies virus recombinants also showed prephrenic interneurons integrated with either contralateral phrenic or intercostal motoneuron pools. The stability of interneuronal pseudorabies virus labeling patterns following lateral cervical hemisection was then addressed. Except for fewer infected contralateral interneurons at the level of the central canal, the number and distribution of phrenic-associated interneurons was not significantly altered 2 weeks posthemisection (i.e., the point at which the earliest postinjury recovery of phrenic activity has been reported). These results demonstrate a heterogeneous population of phrenic-related interneurons. Their connectivity and relative stability after cervical hemisection raise speculation for potentially diverse roles in modulating phrenic function normally and postinjury.",M2
18841547,"[Crossed pattern of sensory loss with left thoracic level in a right dorsolateral <e>medullary</e> infarction]INTRODUCTION: Medullary infarctions as consequence of vertebro-basilar strokes are frequent findings in clinical practice. Medulla oblongata, the lowest segment of the brainstem, is a dense anatomic structure with different conglomerate of nuclei, ascending and descending pathways within a very small area and tiny insults can present with expressive clinical manifestations. Sensory dysfunction is often a noteworthy element in lateral medullary infarctions and its distribution depends of the site and shape of the lesion within the medulla oblongata. From etiological point of view the most frequent cause of lateral medullary infarctions is atherosclerosis although vertebral dissection has to be carefully ruled out. CASE REPORT: A 65 year-old man with a left pain and temperature sensory level up to T4 in a right lateral medullary infarctions due to ipsilateral PICA territory infarction. Crossed pattern of sensory loss with a sensory level is a quite unusual presentation of lateral medullary infarctions and expresses the involvement of the most external aspect of the spinothalamic tract.",M2
18826652,"Rhythm generation by the pre-Bötzinger complex in <e>medullary</e> slice and island preparations: effects of adenosine A(1) receptor activation.BACKGROUND: The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is a central pattern generator within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata's ventral respiratory group that is important for the generation of respiratory rhythm. Activation of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)R) depresses preBötC rhythmogenesis. Although it remains unclear whether A(1)R activation is important for organisms in a normal metabolic state, A(1)R activation is important to the response of the preBötC to metabolic stress, such as hypoxia. This study examined mechanisms linking A(1)R activation to depression of preBötC rhythmogenesis in medullary slice and island preparations from neonatal mice. RESULTS: Converting medullary slices to islands by cutting away much of the medullary tissue adjacent to the preBötC decreased the amplitude of action potential bursts generated by a population of neurons within the preBötC (recorded with an extracellular electrode, and integrated using a hardware integrator), without noticeably affecting burst frequency. The A(1)R agonist N6-Cyclopentyladenosine (NCPA) reduced population burst frequency in slices by ca. 33% and in islands by ca. 30%. As in normal (drug-free) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), NCPA decreased burst frequency in slices when GABA(A)ergic or GABA(A)ergic and glycinergic transmission were blocked, and in islands when GABA(A)ergic transmission was antagonized. Converting slices to island preparations decreased synaptic input to inspiratory neurons. NCPA further decreased the frequency of synaptic inputs to neurons in island preparations and lowered the input resistance of inspiratory neurons, even when chemical communication between neurons and other cells was impeded. CONCLUSION: Together these data support the suggestion that depression of preBötC activity by A(1)R activation involves both decreased neuronal excitability and diminished inter-neuronal communication.",M2
18786526,"Hox gene colinear expression in the avian medulla oblongata is correlated with pseudorhombomeric domains.The medulla oblongata (or caudal hindbrain) is not overtly segmented, since it lacks observable interrhombomeric boundaries. However, quail-chick fate maps showed that it is formed by 5 pseudorhombomeres (r7-r11) which were empirically found to be delimited consistently at planes crossing through adjacent somites (Cambronero and Puelles, 2000). We aimed to reexamine the possible segmentation or rostrocaudal regionalisation of this brain region attending to molecular criteria. To this end, we studied the expression of Hox genes from groups 3 to 7 correlative to the differentiating nuclei of the medulla oblongata. Our results show that these genes are differentially expressed in the mature medulla oblongata, displaying instances of typical antero-posterior (3' to 5') Hox colinearity. The different sensory and motor columns, as well as the reticular formation, appear rostrocaudally regionalised according to spaced steps in their Hox expression pattern. The anterior limits of the respective expression domains largely fit boundaries defined between the experimental pseudorhombomeres. Therefore the medulla oblongata shows a Hox-related rostrocaudal molecular regionalisation comparable to that found among rhombomeres, and numerically consistent with the pseudorhombomere list. This suggests that <e>medullary</e> pseudorhombomeres share some AP patterning mechanisms with the rhombomeres present in the rostral, overtly-segmented hindbrain, irrespective of variant boundary properties.",M2
18784601,"Transient urinary retention in acute right lateral <e>medullary</e> infarction.Urinary disturbance has rarely been reported in patients with a medullary lesion. We evaluated a patient with acute infarction in the right lateral medulla who had voiding difficulty as an initial manifestation.

The urinary retention in this patient might be caused by interruption of descending fibers from facilitatory pontine tegmentum micturition centers.",M2
18772326,"Hypoglossal premotor neurons of the intermediate <e>medullary</e> reticular region express cholinergic markers.The inspiratory drive to hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons originates in the caudal medullary intermediate reticular (IRt) region. This drive is mainly glutamatergic, but little is known about the neurochemical features of IRt XII premotor neurons. Prompted by the evidence that XII motoneuronal activity is controlled by both muscarinic (M) and nicotinic cholinergic inputs and that the IRt region contains cells that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a marker of cholinergic neurons, we investigated whether some IRt XII premotor neurons are cholinergic. In seven rats, we applied single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to acutely dissociated IRt neurons retrogradely labeled from the XII nucleus. We found that over half (21/37) of such neurons expressed mRNA for ChAT and one-third (13/37) also had M2 receptor mRNA. In contrast, among the IRt neurons not retrogradely labeled, only 4 of 29 expressed ChAT mRNA (P &lt; 0.0008) and only 3 of 29 expressed M2 receptor mRNA (P &lt; 0.04). The distributions of other cholinergic receptor mRNAs (M1, M3, M4, M5, and nicotinic alpha4-subunit) did not differ between IRt XII premotor neurons and unlabeled IRt neurons. In an additional three rats with retrograde tracers injected into the XII nucleus and ChAT immunohistochemistry, 5-11% of IRt XII premotor neurons located at, and caudal to, the area postrema were ChAT positive, and 27-48% of ChAT-positive caudal IRt neurons were retrogradely labeled from the XII nucleus. Thus the pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic effects previously described in XII motoneurons may originate, at least in part, in medullary IRt neurons.",M2
18771686,"Claude Bernard and the heart-brain connection: further elaboration of a model of neurovisceral integration.The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model. Specifically we review recent neuroanatomical studies that implicate inhibitory GABAergic pathways from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala and additional inhibitory pathways between the amygdala and the sympathetic and parasympathetic <e>medullary</e> output neurons that modulate heart rate and thus heart rate variability. We propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. We next review the evidence on the role of vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) in the regulation of physiological, affective, and cognitive processes. Low HRV is a risk factor for pathophysiology and psychopathology. Finally we review recent work on the genetics of HRV and suggest that low HRV may be an endophenotype for a broad range of dysfunctions.",M2

Epidemiological, clinical and neuroradiological characteristics of neoplastic (glial tumors, non-glial tumors, metastasis, primary melanomas) and non-neoplastic lesions (granulomatous lesions, abscess, parasitic infections, vascular, demyelinating and dysembryogenetic lesions) are discussed. Main MR imaging characteristics used to differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions consist in pathological spinal cord expansion, gadolinium-enhancement and tumoural cyst formation. Management strategies differ substantially, depending on the kind of lesion. According to the suspected pathological entity radical resection, biopsy or conservative treatments are reasonable options.

18793700,"Endogenous hydrogen sulfide is involved in regulation of respiration in <e>medullary</e> slice of neonatal rats.The purpose of the present study was to verify our assumption that rhythmic respiratory activity may be regulated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in the medullary slices of neonatal rats. We found that a moderate concentration of donor of H(2)S, NaHS, mainly induced diphasic respiratory responses indicated by changes of discharge frequency (DF) of hypoglossal rootlets, an initial inhibitory stage followed by a later excitatory one. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) substrate, cysteine (CYS), exerted similar effects. CBS inhibitor, NH(2)OH, could eliminate both inhibitory and excitatory effects in the two stages induced by CYS. K(ATP) channel blocker, glibenclamide (Gl), could eliminate the decrease in DF in the initial stage, but not the increase in the later one. On the other hand, adenyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor, SQ-22536 (SQ) could eliminate the increase in DF in the later stage, but not the decrease in the initial one, of the rootlets caused by NaHS. Co-application of Gl and SQ eliminated both inhibitory and excitatory effect induced by NaHS. The cAMP level was increased in the later stage but not in the initial one by NaHS, and the increase in the cAMP level could be eliminated by SQ. It can be concluded that the endogenous H(2)S could be produced through the CBS-H(2)S pathway and could be involved in the control of the central rhythmic respiration in the in vitro medullary slices of neonatal rats by opening K(ATP) channels and activating AC-cAMP pathway of the neurons.",M2
