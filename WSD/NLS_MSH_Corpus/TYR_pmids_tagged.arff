20391575,"Binuclear terbium(III) complex as a probe for tyrosine phosphorylation.By using the luminescence from binuclear complexes of Tb(III) (Tb(2)-L(1) and Tb(2)-L(2)), phosphorylated <e>Tyr</e> residue in peptides was selectively detected in neutral aqueous solutions. Neither the non-phosphorylated Tyr, pSer, pThr, nor the other phosphate-containing biomolecules tested affected the luminescence intensity to any notable extent. Upon the binding of the pTyr to these Tb(III) complexes, the luminescence from the metal ion was notably promoted, as the light energy absorbed by the benzene ring of pTyr is efficiently transferred to the Tb(III) center. The binding activity of the binuclear Tb(III) complexes towards pTyr is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the corresponding mononuclear complex. These binuclear complexes were successfully used for real-time monitoring of enzymatic phosphorylation of a peptide by a tyrosine kinase.",M1
20390592,"A preliminary investigation of the role of the phenylalanine:tyrosine ratio in children with early and continuously treated phenylketonuria: toward identification of  safe  levels.Children with early and continuously treated phenylketonuria (ECT-PKU) remain at risk of developing executive function (EF) deficits. There is some evidence that a high phenylalanine to tyrosine ratio (phe:<e>tyr</e>) is more strongly associated with impaired EF development than high phenylalanine alone. This study examined EF in a sample of 11 adolescents against concurrent and historical levels of phenylalanine, phe:tyr, and tyrosine. Lifetime measures of phe:tyr were more strongly associated with EF than phenylalanine-only measures. Children with a lifetime phe:tyr less than 6 demonstrated normal EF, whereas children who had a lifetime phe:tyr above 6, on average, demonstrated clinically impaired EF.",M1
20388777,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 binding to the fibroblast growth factor receptor is activated by receptor amplification.Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinases that function in cell proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant FGFR signaling occurs in diverse cancers due to gene amplification, but the associated oncogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a proteomics approach, we identified signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) as a receptor-binding partner that is mediated by <e>Tyr</e>(677) phosphorylation on FGFR. Binding to activated FGFR was essential for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, along with activation of its downstream target genes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was also dependent on concomitant FGFR-dependent activity of SRC and JAK kinases. Lastly, tyrosine (but not serine) phosphorylation of STAT3 required amplified FGFR protein expression, generated either by enforced overexpression or as associated with gene amplification in cancer cells. Our findings show that amplified FGFR expression engages the STAT3 pathway, and they suggest therapeutic strategies to attack FGFR-overexpressing cancers.",M1
20375009,"Phosphorylation of the cool-1/beta-Pix protein serves as a regulatory signal for the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells.Previously we showed that Cool-1 (Cloned out of library-1)/beta-Pix (Pak-interactive exchange factor) is phosphorylated at a specific tyrosine residue (<e>Tyr</e>-442) in a Src-dependent manner and serves as a dual function guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)/signaling-effector for Cdc42 that is essential for transformation by Src. Here, we show that knocking-down Cool-1 or overexpressing a Cool-1 mutant that contains substitutions within its Dbl homology domain and is defective for GEF activity, inhibits Src-promoted cell migration. Similarly, the expression of a Cool-1 mutant containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at position 442, making it incapable of being phosphorylated in response to serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or Src, also causes a significant inhibition of the migration and invasive activity of cells expressing oncogenic Src. We further demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Cool-1 at Tyr-442 weakens its ability to bind to one of its primary interaction-partners, Cat-1 (Cool-associated tyrosine phosphosubstrate-1)/Git-1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor-1), thus making Cat more accessible for binding to paxillin. This enables cells to alternate between states where they contain large numbers of focal complexes (i.e. conditions favoring Cool-1-Cat interactions) versus reduced numbers of focal complexes (conditions favoring Cat-paxillin interactions). Overall, these findings show that the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of Cool-1 at Tyr-442 can serve as a key regulatory signal for focal complex assembly-disassembly, and consequently, for the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells.",M1
20368329,"Combinatorial signals from CD28 differentially regulate human immunodeficiency virus transcription in T cells.Activation through the T-cell receptor and the costimulatory receptor CD28 supports efficient HIV transcription as well as reactivation of latent provirus. To characterize critical signals associated with CD28 that regulate HIV-1 transcription, we generated a library of chimeric CD28 receptors that harbored different combinations of key tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail, <e>Tyr</e>-173, Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200. We found that Tyr-191 and Tyr-200 induce HIV-1 transcription via the activation of NF-kappaB and its recruitment to the HIV-long terminal repeat. Tyr-188 modifies positive and negative signals associated with CD28. Importantly, signaling through Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200 is required to overcome the inhibition posed by Tyr-173. CD28 also regulates P-TEFb activity, which is necessary for HIV-1 transcription processivity, by limiting the release of P-TEFb from the HEXIM1-7SK inhibitory complex in response to T-cell receptor signaling. Our studies reveal that CD28 regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription through a complex interplay of positive and negative signals that may be manipulated to control HIV-1 transcription and replication.",M1
20360007,"Cdc25 phosphatases are required for timely assembly of CDK1-cyclin B at the G2/M transition.Progression through mitosis requires the coordinated regulation of Cdk1 kinase activity. Activation of Cdk1 is a multistep process comprising binding of Cdk1 to cyclin B, relocation of cyclin-kinase complexes to the nucleus, activating phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Thr(161) by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK; Cdk7 in metazoans), and removal of inhibitory Thr(14) and <e>Tyr</e>(15) phosphorylations. This dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the dual specific Cdc25 phosphatases, which occur in three isoforms in mammalian cells, Cdc25A, -B, and -C. We find that expression of Cdc25A leads to an accelerated G(2)/M phase transition. In Cdc25A-overexpressing cells, Cdk1 exhibits high kinase activity despite being phosphorylated on Tyr(15). In addition, Tyr(15)-phosphorylated Cdk1 binds more cyclin B in Cdc25A-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Consistent with this observation, we demonstrate that in human transformed cells, Cdc25A and Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C phosphatases have an effect on timing and efficiency of cyclin-kinase complex formation. Overexpression of Cdc25A or Cdc25B promotes earlier assembly and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes, whereas repression of these phosphatases by short hairpin RNA has a reverse effect, leading to a substantial decrease in amounts of cyclin B-bound Cdk1 in G(2) and mitosis. Importantly, we find that Cdc25A overexpression leads to an activation of Cdk7 and increase in Thr(161) phosphorylation of Cdk1. In conclusion, our data suggest that complex assembly and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at G(2)/M is tightly coupled and regulated by Cdc25 phosphatases.",M1
20353940,"The human Cdc34 carboxyl terminus contains a non-covalent ubiquitin binding activity that contributes to SCF-dependent ubiquitination.Cdc34 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that functions in conjunction with SCF (Skp1.Cullin 1.F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase to catalyze covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains to a target protein. Here we identified direct interactions between the human Cdc34 C terminus and ubiquitin using NMR chemical shift perturbation assays. The ubiquitin binding activity was mapped to two separate Cdc34 C-terminal motifs (UBS1 and UBS2) that comprise residues 206-215 and 216-225, respectively. UBS1 and UBS2 bind to ubiquitin in the proximity of ubiquitin Lys(48) and C-terminal tail, both of which are key sites for conjugation. When bound to ubiquitin in one orientation, the Cdc34 UBS1 aromatic residues (Phe(206), <e>Tyr</e>(207), Tyr(210), and Tyr(211)) are probably positioned in the vicinity of ubiquitin C-terminal residue Val(70). Replacement of UBS1 aromatic residues by glycine or of ubiquitin Val(70) by alanine decreased UBS1-ubiquitin affinity interactions. UBS1 appeared to support the function of Cdc34 in vivo because human Cdc34(1-215) but not Cdc34(1-200) was able to complement the growth defect by yeast Cdc34 mutant strain. Finally, reconstituted IkappaBalpha ubiquitination analysis revealed a role for each adjacent pair of UBS1 aromatic residues (Phe(206)/Tyr(207), Tyr(210)/Tyr(211)) in conjugation, with Tyr(210) exhibiting the most pronounced catalytic function. Intriguingly, Cdc34 Tyr(210) was required for the transfer of the donor ubiquitin to a receptor lysine on either IkappaBalpha or a ubiquitin in a manner that depended on the neddylated RING sub-complex of the SCF. Taken together, our results identified a new ubiquitin binding activity within the human Cdc34 C terminus that contributes to SCF-dependent ubiquitination.",M1
20231286,"Incorporation of tyrosine and glutamine residues into the soluble guanylate cyclase heme distal pocket alters NO and O2 binding.Nitric oxide (NO) is the physiologically relevant activator of the mammalian hemoprotein soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). The heme cofactor of alpha1beta1 sGC has a high affinity for NO but has never been observed to form a complex with oxygen. Introduction of a key tyrosine residue in the sGC heme binding domain beta1(1-385) is sufficient to produce an oxygen-binding protein, but this mutation in the full-length enzyme did not alter oxygen affinity. To evaluate ligand binding specificity in full-length sGC we mutated several conserved distal heme pocket residues (beta1 Val-5, Phe-74, Ile-145, and Ile-149) to introduce a hydrogen bond donor in proximity to the heme ligand. We found that the NO coordination state, NO dissociation, and enzyme activation were significantly affected by the presence of a tyrosine in the distal heme pocket; however, the stability of the reduced porphyrin and the proteins affinity for oxygen were unaltered. Recently, an atypical sGC from Drosophila, Gyc-88E, was shown to form a stable complex with oxygen. Sequence analysis of this protein identified two residues in the predicted heme pocket (tyrosine and glutamine) that may function to stabilize oxygen binding in the atypical cyclase. The introduction of these residues into the rat beta1 distal heme pocket (Ile-145 --&gt; <e>Tyr</e> and Ile-149 --&gt; Gln) resulted in an sGC construct that oxidized via an intermediate with an absorbance maximum at 417 nm. This absorbance maximum is consistent with globin Fe(II)-O(2) complexes and is likely the first observation of a Fe(II)-O(2) complex in the full-length alpha1beta1 protein. Additionally, these data suggest that atypical sGCs stabilize O(2) binding by a hydrogen bonding network involving tyrosine and glutamine.",M1
20231273,"Platelet-derived growth factor-DD targeting arrests pathological angiogenesis by modulating glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation.Platelet-derived growth factor-DD (PDGF-DD) is a recently discovered member of the PDGF family. The role of PDGF-DD in pathological angiogenesis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, using different animal models, we showed that PDGF-DD expression was up-regulated during pathological angiogenesis, and inhibition of PDGF-DD suppressed both choroidal and retinal neovascularization. We also demonstrated a novel mechanism mediating the function of PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD induced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) Ser(9) phosphorylation and <e>Tyr</e>(216) dephosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased cell survival. Consistently, GSK3beta activity was required for the antiangiogenic effect of PDGF-DD targeting. Moreover, PDGF-DD regulated the expression of GSK3beta and many other genes important for angiogenesis and apoptosis. Thus, we identified PDGF-DD as an important target gene for antiangiogenic therapy due to its pleiotropic effects on vascular and non-vascular cells. PDGF-DD inhibition may offer new therapeutic options to treat neovascular diseases.",M1
20211602,"Block of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel by the antidepressant desipramine.Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant for psychiatric disorders that can induce QT prolongation, which may lead to torsades de pointes. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels is an important cause of acquired long QT syndrome, we investigated the acute effects of desipramine on hERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its pro-arrhythmic potential. We examined the effects of desipramine on the hERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes using two-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques. Desipramine-induced concentration-dependent decreases in the current amplitude at the end of the voltage steps and hERG tail currents. The IC(50) for desipramine needed to block the hERG current in Xenopus oocytes decreased progressively relative to the degree of depolarization. Desipramine affected the channels in the activated and inactivated states but not in the closed states. The S6 domain mutations, <e>Tyr</e>-652 located in the S6 domain of the hERG channel reduced the potency of the channel block by desipramine more than a mutation of Phe-656 in the same region. These results suggest that desipramine is a blocker of the hERG channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the arrhythmogenic side effects during the clinical administration of desipramine.",M1
20204861,"Incorporation of 3-azidotyrosine into proteins through engineering yeast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and its application to site-selective protein modification.An efficient method for site-selective introduction of 3-azidotyrosine into proteins has been developed. This method utilizes the yeast amber suppressor tRNA(<e>Tyr</e>)/mutant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Y43G) pair as the carrier of 3-azidotyrosine in an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system. Using rat calmodulin (CaM) as a model protein, we prepared an unnatural CaM molecule carrying a 3-azidotyrosine residue at the predetermined position 80. The synthesized CaM containing 3-azidotyrosine was site-specifically modified via azido group with a fluorescent alkyne derivative by click chemistry. This method will be useful to prepare not only a cross-linkable protein containing 3-azidotyrosine but also a fluorescent protein with a single fluorophore to facilitate the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of protein functions and protein-to-protein networks.",M1
20196542,"Physical evidence for substrate binding in preventing cyclooxygenase inactivation under nitrative stress.Prostaglandin biosynthesis is catalyzed by two spatially and functionally distinct active sites in cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Despite the crucial role of COXs in biology, molecular details regarding the function and regulation of these enzymes are incompletely defined. Reactive nitrogen species, formed during oxidative stress, produce modifications that alter COX functionalities and prostaglandin biosynthesis. We previously established that COX-1 undergoes selective nitration on Tyr385 via a mechanism that requires the presence of bound heme cofactor. As this is a critical residue for COX-1 catalysis, nitration at this site results in enzyme inactivation. We now show that occupancy of the COX-1 active site with substrate protects against Tyr385 nitration and redirects nitration to alternative <e>Tyr</e> residues on COX-1, preserving catalytic activity. This study reveals a novel role for the substrate in protecting COX-1 from inactivation by nitration in pathophysiological settings.",M1
20159998,"Functional replacement of the endogenous tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNATyr pair by the archaeal tyrosine pair in Escherichia coli for genetic code expansion.Non-natural amino acids have been genetically encoded in living cells, using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs orthogonal to the host translation system. In the present study, we engineered Escherichia coli cells with a translation system orthogonal to the E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS)-tRNA(<e>Tyr</e>) pair, to use E. coli TyrRS variants for non-natural amino acids in the cells without interfering with tyrosine incorporation. We showed that the E. coli TyrRS-tRNA(Tyr) pair can be functionally replaced by the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tyrosine pairs, which do not cross-react with E. coli TyrRS or tRNA(Tyr). The endogenous TyrRS and tRNA(Tyr) genes were then removed from the chromosome of the E. coli cells expressing the archaeal TyrRS-tRNA(Tyr) pair. In this engineered strain, 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and 3-azido-L-tyrosine were each successfully encoded with the amber codon, using the E. coli amber suppressor tRNATyr and a TyrRS variant, which was previously developed for 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and was also found to recognize 3-azido-L-tyrosine. The structural basis for the 3-azido-L-tyrosine recognition was revealed by X-ray crystallography. The present engineering allows E. coli TyrRS variants for non-natural amino acids to be developed in E. coli, for use in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells for genetic code expansion.",M1
20159857,"Nitration of specific tyrosines in FoF1 ATP synthase and activity loss in aging.It has been reported that C-nitration of proteins occurs under nitrative/oxidative stress; however, its role in pathophysiological situations is not fully understood. In this study, we determined that nitration of <e>Tyr</e>(345) and Tyr(368) in the beta-subunit of the mitochondrial F(o)F(1)-ATPase is a major target for nitrative stress in rat liver under in vivo conditions. The chemical characteristics of these Tyr make them suitable for a facilitated nitration (solvent accessibility, consensus sequence, and pK(a)). Moreover, beta-subunit nitration increased significantly with the age of the rats (from 4 to 80 weeks old) and correlated with decreased ATP hydrolysis and synthesis rates. Although its affinity for ATP binding was unchanged, maximal ATPase activity decreased between young and old rats by a factor of two. These changes directly impacted the available ATP concentration in vivo, and it was expected that they would affect multiple cellular ATP-dependent processes. For instance, at least 50% of available [ATP] in the liver of older rats would have to be committed to sustain maximal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, whereas only 30% would be required for young rats. If this requirement was not fulfilled, the osmoregulation and Na(+)-nutrient cotransport in liver of older rats would be compromised. On the basis of our studies, we propose that targeted nitration of the beta-subunit is an early marker for nitrative stress and aging.",M1
20152470,"Electrochemical determination of L-Tryptophan, L-Tyrosine and L-Cysteine using electrospun carbon nanofibers modified electrode.A novel and simple method for the direct and quantitative determination of L-tryptophan (Trp), L-tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) and L-cysteine (Cys) was proposed in this work. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs), made by electrospinning technique, were used to modify carbon paste electrode (CPE) without any treatment to study the electrochemical behaviors of the three amino acids using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant potential amperometric method. The results demonstrated that the CNFs modified carbon paste electrode (CNF-CPE) exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and good analytical performance towards the oxidation of the three amino acids. The linear ranges of Trp, Tyr and Cys were 0.1-119, 0.2-107 and 0.15-64 microM with correlation coefficients of 0.9994, 0.9985 and 0.9996, respectively. All the detection limits of the analytes were 0.1 mM (S/N=3). In addition, the CNF-CPE displayed good reproducibility, high sensitivity and good selectivity towards the determination of the amino acids, making it suitable for the determination of Trp, Tyr and Cys in clinical and medicine.",M1
20144948,"Evolutionary conservation of residues in vertebrate DNA polymerase N conferring low fidelity and bypass activity.POLN is a nuclear A-family DNA polymerase encoded in vertebrate genomes. POLN has unusual fidelity and DNA lesion bypass properties, including strong strand displacement activity, low fidelity favoring incorporation of T for template G and accurate translesion synthesis past a 5S-thymine glycol (5S-Tg). We searched for conserved features of the polymerase domain that distinguish it from prokaryotic pol I-type DNA polymerases. A Lys residue (679 in human POLN) of particular interest was identified in the conserved 'O-helix' of motif 4 in the fingers sub-domain. The corresponding residue is one of the most important for controlling fidelity of prokaryotic pol I and is a nonpolar Ala or Thr in those enzymes. Kinetic measurements show that K679A or K679T POLN mutant DNA polymerases have full activity on nondamaged templates, but poorly incorporate T opposite template G and do not bypass 5S-Tg efficiently. We also found that a conserved <e>Tyr</e> residue in the same motif not only affects sensitivity to dideoxynucleotides, but also greatly influences enzyme activity, fidelity and bypass. Protein sequence alignment reveals that POLN has three specific insertions in the DNA polymerase domain. The results demonstrate that residues have been strictly retained during evolution that confer unique bypass and fidelity properties on POLN.",M1
20135051,"Glucosylthioureidocalix[4]arenes: Synthesis, conformations and gas phase recognition of amino acids.The gas-phase recognition of native amino acids and the conformational properties of three glucosylthioureidocalix[4]arenes () were studied theoretically and experimentally using ab initio calculations, ESI-FTICR,(1)H and (13)C NMR MS. The conformational and complexation properties of the glucocalixarenes were dependent on the number of glucose units at the upper rim and the length of the alkyl chains at the lower rim of the calixarene skeleton. ESI-MS experiments showed the compounds to form 1 : 1 complexes with the amino acids, with a marked preference for amino acids containing an aromatic nucleus and an additional H-bonding group in their side chain (Trp, <e>Tyr</e>, Phe &gt;&gt; Ser, Leu and Asp). The experimental data were rationalized by the results of ab initio calculations. ESI-MS competitions carried out with enantiomeric-labelled (EL) amino acids showed enantiomeric selectivities ranging from 0.61 (Phe(D)/Phe(L) with ligand ) to 2.58 (Tyr(D)/Tyr(L) with ligand ). In gas-phase hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions, diglucosylcalix[4]arene exhibited extremely slow exchange rates, which were attributed to the close proximity and strong hydrogen bonding between the facing glucosylthioureido groups. H/D exchange rates were much higher for the tetraglucosylcalix[4]arenes and and their amino acid complexes, and the more rigid tetrapropoxy derivative showed more selective H/D exchange reactions than the calixarene . Bi- or trimodal H/D exchange distribution was observed for the tetraglucosyl derivatives indicating that these ligands exist in multiple isomeric forms in gas phase.",M1
20133944,"c-Cbl promotes T cell receptor-induced thymocyte apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.The ability of thymocytes to assess T cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength and initiate the appropriate downstream response is crucial for determining their fate. We have previously shown that a c-Cbl RING finger mutant knock-in mouse, in which the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl is inactivated, is highly sensitive to TCR-induced death signals that cause thymic deletion. This high intensity signal involves the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant c-Cbl protein promoting a marked increase in the activation of Akt. Here we show that this high intensity signal in c-Cbl RING finger mutant thymocytes also promotes the enhanced induction of two mediators of TCR-directed thymocyte apoptosis, Nur77 and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bim. In contrast, a knock-in mouse harboring a mutation at <e>Tyr</e>-737, the site in c-Cbl that activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, shows reduced TCR-mediated responses including suppression of Akt activation, a reduced induction of Nur77 and Bim, and greater resistance to thymocyte death. These findings identify tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl as a critical sensor of TCR signal strength that regulates the engagement of death-promoting signals.",M1
20124700,"Studies on a <e>Tyr</e> residue critical for the binding of coenzyme and substrate in mouse 3(17)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21): structure of the Y224D mutant enzyme.Mouse 3(17)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) is the only aldo-keto reductase that catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of 3- and 17-ketosteroids to the corresponding 3(17)alpha-hydroxysteroids. The Y224D mutation of AKR1C21 reduced the K(m) value for NADP(H) by up to 80-fold and completely reversed the 17alpha stereospecificity of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the Y224D mutant at 2.3 A resolution revealed that the mutation resulted in a change in the conformation of the flexible loop B, including the V-shaped groove, which is a unique feature of the active-site architecture of wild-type AKR1C21 and is formed by the side chains of Tyr224 and Trp227. Furthermore, mutations (Y224F and Q222N) of residues involved in forming the safety belt for binding of the coenzyme showed similar alterations in kinetic constants for 3alpha-hydroxy/3-ketosteroids and 17-hydroxy/ketosteroids compared with the wild type.",M1
20100837,"Mutation of actin <e>Tyr</e>-53 alters the conformations of the DNase I-binding loop and the nucleotide-binding cleft.All but 11 of the 323 known actin sequences have Tyr at position 53, and the 11 exceptions have the conservative substitution Phe, which raises the following questions. What is the critical role(s) of Tyr-53, and, if it can be replaced by Phe, why has this happened so infrequently? We compared the properties of purified endogenous Dictyostelium actin and mutant constructs with Tyr-53 replaced by Phe, Ala, Glu, Trp, and Leu. The Y53F mutant did not differ significantly from endogenous actin in any of the properties assayed, but the Y53A and Y53E mutants differed substantially; affinity for DNase I was reduced, the rate of nucleotide exchange was increased, the critical concentration for polymerization was increased, filament elongation was inhibited, and polymerized actin was in the form of small oligomers and imperfect filaments. Growth and/or development of cells expressing these actin mutants were also inhibited. The Trp and Leu mutations had lesser but still significant effects on cell phenotype and the biochemical properties of the purified actins. We conclude that either Tyr or Phe is required to maintain the functional conformations of the DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) in both G- and F-actin, and that the conformation of the D-loop affects not only the properties that directly involve the D-loop (binding to DNase I and polymerization) but also allosterically modifies the conformation of the nucleotide-binding cleft, thus increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange. The apparent evolutionary  preference  for Tyr at position 53 may be the result of Tyr allowing dynamic modification of the D-loop conformation by phosphorylation (Baek, K., Liu, X., Ferron, F., Shu, S., Korn, E. D., and Dominguez, R. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 11748-11753) with effects similar, but not identical, to those of the Ala and Glu mutations.",M1
20100830,"Endotoxin conditioning induces VCP/p97-mediated and inducible nitric-oxide synthase-dependent Tyr284 nitration in protein phosphatase 2A.Endotoxins activate Toll-like receptors and reprogram cells to be refractory to secondary exposure. Here we found that activation of different Toll-like receptors elicited a time- and dose-dependent increase in the levels of the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) but not its partner A subunit. We purified the lipopolysaccharide-induced form of PP2A by chromatography plus immunoprecipitation and used mass spectrometry to identify VCP/p97 as a novel partner for PP2Ac. Endogenous VCP/p97 and PP2Ac were co-immunoprecipitated from primary murine macrophages and human lymphocytes. GST-VCP/p97 bound purified PP2A in pulldown assays, showing direct protein-protein interaction. Endotoxin conditioning of macrophages induced formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in the PP2Ac associated with VCP/p97, a response severely reduced in macrophages from iNOS knock-out mice. The reaction of purified PP2A with peroxynitrite dissociated the A subunit, and 3-nitro-<e>Tyr</e>(284) was identified in PP2Ac by mass spectrometry. Myc-PP2Ac (Y284F) expressed in cells was resistant to peroxynitrite-induced nitration and reduction of A subunit binding. Transient expression of either VCP/p97 or PP2Ac was sufficient to elevate levels of the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP1, reduce p38 MAPK activation, and suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. We propose that VCP/p97-mediated Tyr nitration of PP2A increases the levels of phosphatases PP2A and DUSP1 to contribute to the refractory response of conditioned cells.",M1
20080974,"A noncatalytic domain of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is essential for activity.Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) isoforms, GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta, are serine/threonine kinases involved in numerous cellular processes and diverse diseases, including Alzheimer disease, cancer, and diabetes. GSK-3 isoforms function redundantly in some settings, while, in others, they exhibit distinct activities. Despite intensive investigation into the physiological roles of GSK-3 isoforms, the basis for their differential activities remains unresolved. A more comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic basis for GSK-3 isoform-specific functions could lead to the development of isoform-specific inhibitors. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta in mammalian cells. We deleted the noncatalytic N and C termini in both GSK-3 isoforms and generated point mutations of key regulatory residues. We examined the effect of these mutations on GSK-3 activity toward Tau, activity in Wnt signaling, interaction with Axin, and GSK-3alpha/beta <e>Tyr</e>(279/216) phosphorylation. We found that the N termini of both GSK-3 isoforms were dispensable, whereas progressive C-terminal deletions resulted in protein misfolding exhibited by deficient activity, impaired ability to interact with Axin, and a loss of Tyr(279/216) phosphorylation. Our data predict that small molecules targeting the divergent C terminus may lead to isoform-specific GSK-3 inhibition through destabilization of the GSK-3 structure.",M1
20075158,"Amino acid residues Arg(659), Arg(660), and <e>Tyr</e>(661) in the spacer domain of ADAMTS13 are critical for cleavage of von Willebrand factor.Previous studies have shown that ADAMTS13 spacer domain is required for cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). However, the exact amino acid residues within this domain critical for substrate recognition are not known. Epitope mapping of anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G from patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and sequence alignment of the ADAMTS13 spacer domains of human, mouse, and zebrafish with these of human and murine ADAMTS1, a closely related member of ADAMTS family, have provided hints to investigate the role of the amino acid residues between Arg(659) and Glu(664) of the ADAMTS13 spacer domain in substrate recognition. A deletion of all these 6 amino acid residues (ie, Arg(659)-Glu(664)) from the ADAMTS13 spacer domain resulted in dramatically reduced proteolytic activity toward VWF73 peptides, guanidine-HCl denatured VWF, and native VWF under fluid shear stress, as well as ultralarge VWF on endothelial cells. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic analyses, and peptide inhibition assays have further identified a role for amino acid residues Arg(659), Arg(660), and Tyr(661) in proteolytic cleavage of various substrates under static and fluid shear stress conditions. These findings may provide novel insight into the structural-function relationship of ADAMTS13 and help us to understand pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and other arterial thromboses associated with compromised VWF proteolysis.",M1
20064930,"Mutual regulation of Src family kinases and the neurotrophin receptor TrkB.The neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB is critical to diverse biological processes. We investigated the interplay of Src family kinases (SFKs) and TrkB to better understand mechanisms of TrkB signaling in physiological and pathological conditions. We compared and contrasted the role of SFKs in TrkB signaling following activation of TrkB by two mechanisms, its transactivation by zinc, and its activation by its prototypic neurotrophin ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using biochemical, pharmacological, and chemical genetic studies of cultured rodent neurons, we found that zinc promotes preferential phosphorylation of <e>Tyr</e>-705/Tyr-706 of TrkB by a SFK-dependent but TrkB kinase-independent mechanism, a signaling event critical for transactivation of TrkB by zinc. By contrast, SFK activity is not essential for BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB, yet SFK activity is increased as a consequence of TrkB activation by BDNF. Moreover, BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-705/Tyr-706 of TrkB was inhibited by SFK inhibitors, implicating a regulatory role of SFKs in TrkB activation by BDNF. In sum, SFKs are activated by TrkB and, in turn, SFKs can promote TrkB activation. We propose models depicting the mutual regulation of SFKs and TrkB following activation of TrkB by zinc and BDNF.",M1
20052993,"Investigation of anticapsin biosynthesis reveals a four-enzyme pathway to tetrahydrotyrosine in Bacillus subtilis.Bacillus subtilis produces the antibiotic anticapsin as an L-Ala-L-anticapsin dipeptide precursor known as bacilysin, whose synthesis is encoded by the bacA-D genes and the adjacent ywfGH genes. To evaluate the biosynthesis of the epoxycyclohexanone amino acid anticapsin from the primary metabolite prephenate, we have overproduced, purified, and characterized the activity of the BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG proteins. BacA is an unusual prephenate decarboxylase that avoids the typical aromatization of the cyclohexadienol ring by protonating C(8) to produce an isomerized structure. BacB then catalyzes an allylic isomerization, generating a conjugated dienone with a 295 nm chromophore. Both the BacA and BacB products are regioisomers of H(2)HPP (dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate). The BacB product is then a substrate for the short chain reductase YwfH which catalyzes the conjugate addition of hydride at the C(4) olefinic terminus using NADH to yield the cyclohexenol-containing tetrahydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate H(4)HPP. In turn, this keto acid is a substrate for YwfG, which promotes transamination (with L-Phe as amino donor), to form tetrahydrotyrosine (H(4)<e>Tyr</e>). Thus BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG act in sequence in a four enzyme pathway to make H(4)Tyr, which has not previously been identified in B. subtilis but is a recognized building block in cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptides such as micropeptins and aeruginopeptins.",M1
20032467,"Carbohydrate recognition properties of human ficolins: glycan array screening reveals the sialic acid binding specificity of M-ficolin.Ficolins are oligomeric innate immune recognition proteins consisting of a collagen-like region and a fibrinogen-like recognition domain that bind to pathogen- and apoptotic cell-associated molecular patterns. To investigate their carbohydrate binding specificities, serum-derived L-ficolin and recombinant H- and M-ficolins were fluorescently labeled, and their carbohydrate binding ability was analyzed by glycan array screening. L-ficolin preferentially recognized disulfated N-acetyllactosamine and tri- and tetrasaccharides containing terminal galactose or N-acetylglucosamine. Binding was sensitive to the position and orientation of the bond between N-acetyllactosamine and the adjacent carbohydrate. No significant binding of H-ficolin to any of the 377 glycans probed could be detected, providing further evidence for its poor lectin activity. M-ficolin bound preferentially to 9-O-acetylated 2-6-linked sialic acid derivatives and to various glycans containing sialic acid engaged in a 2-3 linkage. To further investigate the structural basis of sialic acid recognition by M-ficolin, point mutants were produced in which three residues of the fibrinogen domain were replaced by their counterparts in L-ficolin. Mutations G221F and A256V inhibited binding to the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid derivatives, whereas Y271F abolished interaction with all sialic acid-containing glycans. The crystal structure of the Y271F mutant fibrinogen domain was solved, showing that the mutation does not alter the structure of the ligand binding pocket. These analyses reveal novel ficolin ligands such as sulfated N-acetyllactosamine (L-ficolin) and gangliosides (M-ficolin) and provide precise insights into the sialic acid binding specificity of M-ficolin, emphasizing the essential role of <e>Tyr</e>(271) in this respect.",M1
20018903,"Plant cell division is specifically affected by nitrotyrosine.Virtually all eukaryotic alpha-tubulins harbour a C-terminal tyrosine that can be reversibly removed and religated, catalysed by a specific tubulin-tyrosine carboxypeptidase (TTC) and a specific tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. The biological function of this post-translational modification has remained enigmatic. 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (nitrotyrosine, NO(2)<e>Tyr</e>), can be incorporated into detyrosinated alpha-tubulin instead of tyrosine, producing irreversibly nitrotyrosinated alpha-tubulin. To gain insight into the possible function of detyrosination, the effect of NO(2)Tyr has been assessed in two plant model organisms (rice and tobacco). NO(2)Tyr causes a specific, sensitive, and dose-dependent inhibition of cell division that becomes detectable from 1 h after treatment and which is not observed with non-nitrosylated tyrosine. These effects are most pronounced in cycling tobacco BY-2 cells, where the inhibition of cell division is accompanied by a stimulation of cell length, and a misorientation of cross walls. NO(2)Tyr reduces the abundance of the detyrosinated form of alpha-tubulin whereas the tyrosinated alpha-tubulin is not affected. These findings are discussed with respect to a model where NO(2)Tyr is accepted as substrate by TTL and subsequently blocks TTC activity. The irreversibly tyrosinated alpha-tubulin impairs microtubular functions that are relevant to cell division in general, and cell wall deposition in particular.",M1
20017523,"Interactions of tyrosine in Leu-enkephalin at a membrane-water interface: an ultrafast two-dimensional infrared study combined with density functional calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.The interactions of neuropeptides and membranes play an important role in peptide hormone function. Our current understanding of peptide-membrane interactions remains limited due to the paucity of experimental techniques capable of probing such interactions. In this work, we study the nature of opioid peptide-membrane interactions using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. The high temporal resolution of 2D IR is particularly suited for studying highly flexible opioid peptides. We investigate the location of the tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) side chain of leucine-enkephalin (Lenk) in lipid bilayer membranes by measuring spectral diffusion of the phenolic ring vibrational mode in three different systems: Lenk in lipid bilayer membranes (bicelles), Lenk in deuterated water, and p-cresol in deuterated water. Frequency-frequency correlation functions obtained from waiting-time-dependent 2D IR spectra reveal an ultrafast decaying component with an approximately 1 ps time constant that is common for all three systems. On the basis of density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, this spectral diffusion component is attributed to hydrogen-bond dynamics of the phenolic hydroxyl group interacting with bulk water. Unlike p-cresol in water, both Lenk systems exhibit static spectral inhomogeneity, which can be attributed to conformational distributions of Lenk that do not interconvert within 4 ps. Our results suggest that the Tyr side chain of Lenk in bicelles is located at the water-abundant region at the membrane-water interface and not embedded into the hydrophobic core.",M1
20006932,"Assisted sonodynamic damage of bovine serum albumin by metronidazole under ultrasonic irradiation combined with photosensitive antitumor drug-Amsacrine.By research, it was found that the Amsacrine (AMSA) can interact with bovine serum albumin (BSA). In this work, the AMSA was adopted as a sonosensitizer and the Metronidazole (MET) was used as a sensitizer to further damage BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation. It could be concluded that the damage degree of BSA molecules in the presence of AMSA and MET was more serious than in the presence of pure AMSA. That is, MET could aggravate the damage to BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation combined with AMSA. Meanwhile, the damage degree of BSA molecules was also influenced by some factors, such as ultrasonic irradiation time, MET concentration and solution acidity. In addition, the damage site of BSA molecules was estimated by synchronous fluorescence spectra. It was found that the tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) and tryptophan (Typ) residues were damaged almost averagely. Perhaps, these research results are of great significance for driving sonodynamic method to treat tumor in clinic application.",M1
20004638,"Low-temperature electron transfer suggests two types of Q(A) in intact photosystem II.The correlation between the reduction of Q(A) and the oxidation of <e>Tyr</e>(Z) or Car/Chl(Z)/Cyt(b559) in spinach PSII enriched membranes induced by visible light at 10 K is studied by using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Similar g=1.95-1.86 Q(A)(-*)EPR signals are observed in both Mn-depleted and intact samples, and both signals are long lived at low temperatures. The presence of PPBQ significantly diminished the light induced EPR signals from Q(A)(-*), Car(+*)/Chl(+*) and oxidized Cyt(b559), while enhancing the amplitude of the S(1)Tyr(Z)* EPR signal in the intact PSII sample. The quantification and stability of the g=1.95-1.86 EPR signal and signals arising from the oxidized Tyr(Z) and the side-path electron donors, respectively, indicate that the EPR-detectable g=1.95-1.86 Q(A)(-*) signal is only correlated to reaction centers undergoing oxidation of the side-path electron donors (Car/Chl(Z)/Cyt(b559)), but not of Tyr(Z). These results imply that two types of Q(A)(-*) probably exist in the intact PSII sample. The structural difference and possible function of the two types of Q(A) are discussed.",M1
19959481,"Interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange reveals the stable core of the remarkably helical molten globule of alpha-beta parallel protein flavodoxin.Kinetic intermediates that appear early during protein folding often resemble the relatively stable molten globule intermediates formed by several proteins under mildly denaturing conditions. Molten globules have a substantial amount of secondary structure but lack virtually all tertiary side-chain packing characteristics of natively folded proteins. Due to exposed hydrophobic groups, molten globules are prone to aggregation, which can have detrimental effects on organisms. The molten globule that is observed during folding of alpha-beta parallel flavodoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii is a remarkably non-native species. This folding intermediate is helical and contains no beta-sheet and is kinetically off-pathway to the native state. It can be trapped under native-like conditions by substituting residue Phe(44) for <e>Tyr</e>(44). To characterize this species at the residue level, in this study, use is made of interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by NMR spectroscopy. In the molten globule of flavodoxin, the helical region comprising residues Leu(110)-Val(125) is shown to be better protected against exchange than the other ordered parts of the folding intermediate. This helical region is better buried than the other helices, causing its context-dependent stabilization against unfolding. Residues Leu(110)-Val(125) thus form the stable core of the helical molten globule of alpha-beta parallel flavodoxin, which is almost entirely structured. Non-native docking of helices in the molten globule of flavodoxin prevents formation of the parallel beta-sheet of native flavodoxin. Hence, to produce native alpha-beta parallel protein molecules, the off-pathway species needs to unfold.",M1
19954184,"Hydrogen exchange rate of tyrosine hydroxyl groups in proteins as studied by the deuterium isotope effect on C(zeta) chemical shifts.We describe a new NMR method for monitoring the individual hydrogen exchange rates of the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) residues in proteins. The method utilizes (2S,3R)-[beta(2),epsilon(1,2)-(2)H(3);0,alpha,beta,zeta-(13)C(4);(15)N]-Tyr, zeta-SAIL Tyr, to detect and assign the (13)C(zeta) signals of Tyr rings efficiently, either by indirect (1)H-detection through 7-8 Hz (1)H(delta)-(13)C(zeta) spin couplings or by direct (13)C(zeta) observation. A comparison of the (13)C(zeta) chemical shifts of three Tyr residues of an 18.2 kDa protein, EPPIb, dissolved in H(2)O and D(2)O, revealed that all three (13)C(zeta) signals in D(2)O appeared at approximately 0.13 ppm ( approximately 20 Hz at 150.9 MHz) higher than those in H(2)O. In a H(2)O/D(2)O (1:1) mixture, however, one of the three signals for (13)C(zeta) appeared as a single peak at the averaged chemical shifts, and the other two appeared as double peaks at exactly the same chemical shifts in H(2)O and D(2)O, in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) at 40 degrees C. These three peaks were assigned to Tyr-36, Tyr-120, and Tyr-30, from the lower to higher chemical shifts, respectively. The results indicate that the hydroxyl proton of Tyr-120 exchanges faster than a few milliseconds, whereas those of Tyr-30 and Tyr-36 exchange more slowly. The exchange rate of the Tyr-30 hydroxyl proton, k(ex), under these conditions was determined by (13)C NMR exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) to be 9.2 +/- 1.1 s(-1). The Tyr-36 hydroxyl proton, however, exchanges too slowly to be determined by EXSY. These profound differences among the hydroxyl proton exchange rates are closely related to their relative solvent accessibility and the hydrogen bonds associated with the Tyr hydroxyl groups in proteins.",M1
19944076,"Rational design of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase specific for p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine.The Methanococcus jannaschii tRNA(<e>Tyr</e>)/tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase pair has been engineered to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins in Escherichia coli site-specifically. In order to add other unnatural amino acids into proteins by this approach, the amino acid binding site of M. jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase need to be mutated. The crystal structures of M. jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and its mutations were determined, which provided an opportunity to design aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for other unnatural amino acids. In our study, we attempted to design aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases being able to deliver p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine into proteins. p-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine was superimposed on tyrosyl in M. jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase-tyrosine complex. Tyr32 needed to be changed to non-polar amino acid with shorter side chain, Val, Leu, Ile, Gly or Ala, in order to reduce steric clash and provide hydrophobic environment to acetyl on p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine. Asp158 and Ile159 would be changed to specific amino acids for the same reason. So we designed 60 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Binding of these aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine indicated that only 15 of them turned out to be able to bind p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine with reasonable poses. Binding affinity computation proved that the mutation of Tyr32Leu and Asp158Gly benefited p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine binding. And two of the designed aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases had considerable binding affinities. They seemed to be very promising to be able to incorporate p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine into proteins in E. coli. The results show that the combination of homology modeling and molecular docking is a feasible method to filter inappropriate mutations in molecular design and point out beneficial mutations.",M1
19940136,"The XPA-binding domain of ERCC1 is required for nucleotide excision repair but not other DNA repair pathways.The endonuclease ERCC1-XPF incises the damaged strand of DNA 5' to a lesion during nucleotide excision repair (NER) and has additional, poorly characterized functions in interstrand cross-link repair, double-strand break repair, and homologous recombination. XPA, another key factor in NER, interacts with ERCC1 and recruits it to sites of damage. We identified ERCC1 residues that are critical for the interaction with XPA and assessed their importance for NER in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of two conserved residues (Asn-110 and <e>Tyr</e>-145) located in the XPA-binding site of ERCC1 dramatically affected NER but not nuclease activity on model DNA substrates. In ERCC1-deficient cells expressing ERCC1(N110A/Y145A), the nuclease was not recruited to sites of UV damage. The repair of UV-induced (6-4)photoproducts was severely impaired in these cells, and they were hypersensitive to UV irradiation. Remarkably, the ERCC1(N110A/Y145A) protein rescues the sensitivity of ERCC1-deficient cells to cross-linking agents. Our studies suggest that ERCC1-XPF engages in different repair pathways through specific protein-protein interactions and that these functions can be separated through the selective disruption of these interactions. We discuss the impact of these findings for understanding how ERCC1 contributes to resistance of tumor cells to therapeutic agents such as cisplatin.",M1
19938027,"Galectin-1-asialofetuin interaction is inhibited by peptides containing the <e>tyr</e>-xxx-tyr motif acting on the glycoprotein.Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a ubiquitous beta-galactoside-binding protein expressed by various normal and pathological tissues, has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in consequence of its regulatory role in adhesion, cell viability, proliferation, and angiogenesis. The functions of Gal-1 depend on its affinity for beta-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates; accordingly, the inhibition of sugar binding blocks its functions, hence promising potential therapeutic tools. The Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptide motifs have been reported to be glycomimetic sequences, mainly on the basis of their inhibitory effect on the Gal-1-asialofetuin (ASF) interaction. However, the results regarding the efficacy of the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr motif as a glycomimetic inhibitor are still controversial. The present STD and trNOE NMR experiments reveal that the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides studied do not bind to Gal-1, whereas their binding to ASF is clearly detected. (15)N,(1)H HSQC titrations with (15)N-labeled Gal-1 confirm the absence of any peptide-Gal-1 interaction. These data indicate that the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides tested in this work are not glycomimetics as they interact with ASF via an unrevealed molecular linkage.",M1
19934005,"A point mutation in Sec61alpha1 leads to diabetes and hepatosteatosis in mice.OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. To better understand the genetic factors we used forward genetics to discover genes that have not previously been implicated in the development of hyperglycemia or diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Offspring of ethylnitrosurea-mutagenized C57BL/6 mice were bred to homozygosity, maintained on high-fat diet, and screened for hyperglycemia. The phenotype in one diabetic family of mice was mapped among hybrid F2s with single nucleotide polymorphic markers, followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify the gene harboring the causative mutation. Subsequent analysis was done on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice on a pure C57BL/6 background. RESULTS: Diabetes mapped to a point mutation in the Sec61a1 gene that encodes a His to <e>Tyr</e> substitution at amino acid 344 (Y344H). Metabolic profiling, histological examination, and electron microscopy revealed that hyperglycemia was a result of insulin insufficiency due to beta-cell apoptosis brought on by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Transgenic beta-cell-specific expression of Sec61a1 in mutant mice rescued diabetes, beta-cell apoptosis, and ER stress. In vitro experiments showed that Sec61alpha1 plays a critical role in the beta-cell response to glucose. CONCLUSIONS: Here we phenotypically characterize diabetes in mice with a novel point mutation in a basic component of the cell's ER protein translocation machinery, Sec61alpha1. Translocation by the mutant protein does not appear to be affected. Rather, ER homeostasis is perturbed leading to beta-cell death and diabetes.",M1
19925861,"Increased blood phenylalanine to tyrosine ratio in HIV-1 infection and correction following effective antiretroviral therapy.OBJECTIVE: Higher blood levels of the essential amino acid phenylalanine (phe) have been documented in patients with HIV-1 infection. They may relate to a diminished conversion of phe to tyrosine (<e>tyr</e>) by the enzyme phenylalanine-hydroxylase (PAH). PAH is rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of dopamine, and impaired PAH activity is reflected by an increased phe to tyr ratio (phe/tyr). METHODS: Plasma phe/tyr was measured in 107 patients with HIV-1 infection before and after 12 months of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results were compared with CD4+ cell counts, HIV-1 RNA levels and concentrations of immune activation marker neopterin. RESULTS: Before ART, phe/tyr was mean+/-S.D.: 0.99+/-0.57 micromol/micromol. Phe/tyr correlated significantly with plasma and urine neopterin concentrations (rs=0.434, and rs=0.392; both p&lt;0.001) and less strongly with HIV-RNA levels (rs=0.173) and CD4+ counts (rs=-0.182, both p&lt;0.05). After ART, phe/tyr dropped to 0.72+/-0.16 (=-27%; U=5.21, p=0.01) which was due to an average decline of -14% of phe concentrations from 73.1+/-34.0 micromol/L at baseline to 62.9+/-17.8 micromol/L after ART (U=2.51, p=0.01) and a concomitant increase of tyr concentrations (+13%, U=2.46, p=0.01). In parallel, significant reductions of plasma and urine neopterin concentrations were observed during ART. CONCLUSIONS: Increased phe/tyr is frequent in patients with HIV-1 infection and is related to immune activation. ART was found to decrease phe/tyr and this change could indicate and influence on PAH activity. Future studies might be able to show whether the decline of phe/tyr under ART may concur with the often improved neuropsychiatric status in treated patients.",M1
19924991,"Proteases that can distinguish among different post-translational forms of tyrosine engineered using multicolor flow cytometry.We report the isolation of a highly active (k(cat)/K(M) approximately 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)) variant of the E. coli endopeptidase OmpT that selectively hydrolyzes peptides after 3-nitrotyrosine while effectively discriminating against similar peptides containing unmodified tyrosine (160-fold), sulfotyrosine (3600-fold), phosphotyrosine (&gt;8000-fold), and phosphoserine (&gt;8000-fold). The isolation of endopeptidase variants that can discriminate between substrates based on the post-translational modification of <e>Tyr</e> was made possible by implementing a multicolor flow cytometric assay for the screening of large mutant libraries. For the multicolor assay, a desired selection substrate was used simultaneously with multiple counterselection fluorescent substrates to isolate rare enzyme variants that displayed finely tuned substrate specificity.

19920249,"PKM2 tyrosine phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism signal a different view of the Warburg effect.New evidence suggests that the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) directly phosphorylates pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), resulting in reduced conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which is further catabolized to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase A. Mutation of the critical tyrosine <e>Tyr</e>(105) to Phe rendered PKM2 more active but was associated with decreased cellular lactate production, increased oxygen consumption, and decreased hypoxic cell proliferation relative to wild-type PKM2. The apparent paradoxical effect of growth signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation, which decreases rather than increases PKM2 activity, stimulates a revised perspective of the Warburg effect. This effect, which describes the propensity for cancer cells to convert glucose to lactate at a high rate, must now accommodate links among glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glutamine metabolism in cancer cells.",M1
19920137,"RPE65, visual cycle retinol isomerase, is not inherently 11-cis-specific: support for a carbocation mechanism of retinol isomerization.The mechanism of retinol isomerization in the vertebrate retina visual cycle remains controversial. Does the isomerase enzyme RPE65 operate via nucleophilic addition at C(11) of the all-trans substrate, or via a carbocation mechanism? To determine this, we modeled the RPE65 substrate cleft to identify residues interacting with substrate and/or intermediate. We find that wild-type RPE65 in vitro produces 13-cis and 11-cis isomers equally robustly. All <e>Tyr</e>-239 mutations abolish activity. Trp-331 mutations reduce activity (W331Y to approximately 75% of wild type, W331F to approximately 50%, and W331L and W331Q to 0%) establishing a requirement for aromaticity, consistent with cation-pi carbocation stabilization. Two cleft residues modulate isomerization specificity: Thr-147 is important, because replacement by Ser increases 11-cis relative to 13-cis by 40% compared with wild type. Phe-103 mutations are opposite in action: F103L and F103I dramatically reduce 11-cis synthesis relative to 13-cis synthesis compared with wild type. Thr-147 and Phe-103 thus may be pivotal in controlling RPE65 specificity. Also, mutations affecting RPE65 activity coordinately depress 11-cis and 13-cis isomer production but diverge as 11-cis decreases to zero, whereas 13-cis reaches a plateau consistent with thermal isomerization. Lastly, experiments using labeled retinol showed exchange at 13-cis-retinol C(15) oxygen, thus confirming enzymatic isomerization for both isomers. Thus, RPE65 is not inherently 11-cis-specific and can produce both 11- and 13-cis isomers, supporting a carbocation (or radical cation) mechanism for isomerization. Specific visual cycle selectivity for 11-cis isomers instead resides downstream, attributable to mass action by CRALBP, retinol dehydrogenase 5, and high affinity of opsin apoproteins for 11-cis-retinal.",M1
19913839,"Unresponsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.Conflicting results have been reported concerning the efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase, for reducing phenylalanine (Phe) concentration in phenylketonuria (PKU). We aimed to test quantitatively the effects of BH4 in PKU patients. Seven fully characterized patients were selected among a population of 130 PKU subjects as harboring PKU mutations predicted as BH4 responsive and previously considered responsive to a cofactor challenge. They received a simple Phe (100 mg/kg) and 2 combined Phe (100 mg/kg) and BH4 (20 mg/kg) oral loading tests. Cofactor was administered either before or after the amino acid. The concentrations of Phe, tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>), and biopterin were measured over 24 hours after loading. The comparative analysis of the loading tests showed that in all patients plasma Phe concentrations peaked within 3 hours, and fell within 24 hours by about 50% in benign, 20% in mild, and 15% in severe phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency regardless of BH4 administration. A consistent or moderate increase of plasma Tyr, again independent of the cofactor challenge, was observed only in the less severe forms of PAH deficiency. Mean blood biopterin concentration increased 6 times after simple Phe and 34 to 39 times after combined loading tests. The administration of BH4 does not alter Phe and Tyr metabolism in PKU patients. The clearance of plasma Phe after oral loading and, as well as Tyr production, is not related to cofactor challenge but to patient's phenotype. The assessment of BH4 responsiveness by the methods so far used is not reliable, and the occurrence of BH4-responsive forms of PKU still has to be definitely proven.",M1
19909828,"A single Phe54Tyr substitution improves the catalytic activity and thermostability of Trigonopsis variabilis D-amino acid oxidase.The industrial importance of Trigonopsis variabilisd-amino acid oxidase (TvDAAO) is represented by its biocatalytic oxidative deamination of cephalosporin C (CPC) to yield glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid (GL-7-ACA). The process has been incorporated into a two-step bioconversion to produce 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, the crucial synthetic nucleus for several semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics. A homology model of TvDAAO indicated that residue F54 is in a close proximity to the in silico docked CPC. Substitution of this F54 to <e>Tyr</e> (F54Y) resulted in 6-fold improvement in k(cat,app) and approximately 2.5-fold increase in K(i) of GL-7-ACA. Heat treatment (55 degrees C, 60 min) did not decrease the activity of F54Y. It is suggested that the Tyr substitution might initiate hydrogen bond formation with the amino group of CPC and facilitate deamination. Faster substrate turnover, reduced GL-7-ACA inhibition and improved thermostability of the F54Y substitution render it a useful candidate in industrial production of semi-synthetic cephems.",M1
19903461,"Structural and dynamic changes of the serum response element and the core domain of serum response factor induced by their association.Transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF) is dependent on its binding to the CC(A/T)(6)GG box (CArG box) of serum response element (SRE). By Raman spectroscopy, we carried out a comparative analysis, in solution, of the complexes obtained from the association of core-SRF with 20-mer SREs bearing wild-type and mutated c-fos CArG boxes. In case of association with the wild type c-fos CArG box, the complex does not bring out the expected Raman signature of a stable bending of the targeted SRE but keeps a bend-linear conformer oligonucleotide interconversion. The linear conformer population is larger than that of free oligonucleotide. In the core-SRF moiety of the wild-type complex a large spectral change associated with the CO-groups from Asp and/or Glu residues shows that their ionization states and the strength of their interactions decrease as compared to those of mutated non-specific complexes. Structural constraints evidenced on the free core-SRF are released in the wild-type complex and environmental heterogeneities appear in the vicinity of <e>Tyr</e> residues, due to higher water molecule access. The H-bonding configuration of one Tyr OH-group, in average, changes with a net transfer from H-bond acceptor character to a combined donor and acceptor character. A charge repartition distributed on both core-SRF and targeted SRE stabilizes the specific complex, allowing the two partners to experience a variety of conformations.",M1
19897570,"Importance of Tyr310 residue in the third repeat of microtubule binding domain for filament formation of tau protein.The inhibition of tau fibrillation is a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. As a series of studies on inhibiting the transition of soluble monomeric tau into mature fibril, the effect of Tyr310 residue in the third repeat (R3) of the microtubule-binding domain (MBD) on the assembly of MBD was investigated using <e>Tyr</e>-substituted MBD mutants by fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Consequently, the importance of the Tyr residue located at position 310, not at other positions, was clearly shown. The conformational comparison of the Tyr310Ala-substituted R3 repeat peptide with the unsubstituted one showed that the Tyr residue contributes to the rigid extended structure of the N-terminal V(306)QIVYK(311) sequence, and its replacement by Ala leads to the deformation of the extended structure, consequently losing its aggregation ability. The present results indicate that a compound that interacts specifically with the Tyr residue or an antibody recognizing the region containing the Tyr residue becomes a candidate for inhibiting tau fibrillation.",M1
19894709,"Structure and dynamics of aromatic residues in spider silk: 2D carbon correlation NMR of dragline fibers.The structure of aromatic residues in spider silk has remained relatively uncharacterized. This is primarily due to the relatively low abundance of aromatic residues in dragline spider silk. NMR characterization has been further hindered by the inability to (13)C-isotopically enrich these amino acids in the silk effectively. In the present contribution, it is shown that feeding spiders an aqueous solution of [U-(13)C/(15)N]-l-phenylalanine (13)C-enriches <e>Tyr</e> to a level of 20-30% in dragline spider silk. This enables the collection of 2D through-bond (13)C double quantum/single quantum (DQ/SQ) correlation spectra with the refocused INADEQUATE solid-state NMR pulse sequence. These 2D spectra provide the complete unambiguous assignment of the Tyr resonances in dragline silks from two spider species: N. clavipes and A. aurantia. Additionally, weak resonances are detected for Phe in A. aurantia dragline silk that is present at levels &lt;1%. The conformation dependence of the C(alpha), C(beta), and carbonyl chemical shifts show that Tyr and Phe present in the GGX and GPGXX motifs in the spider silk proteins MaSp1 and MaSp2 are in disordered helical structures and not incorporated in the beta-sheet domains.",M1
19891954,"A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study of the tyrosine residue, <e>Tyr</e>(D), of Photosystem II.QM/MM calculations have been used to monitor the oxidation of the D2-Tyr160, Tyr(D), residue involved in redox reactions in Photosystem II. The results indicate that in the reduced form the residue is involved in hydrogen bond donation via its phenolic head group to the tau-nitrogen of the neighboring D2-His189 residue. Oxidation to form the radical is accompanied by spontaneous transfer of the phenolic hydrogen to the tau-nitrogen of D2-His189 leading to the formation of a tyrosyl-imidazolium ion complex. Deprotonation of the imidazolium ion leads to the formation of a tyrosyl-imidazole neutral hydrogen-bonded complex. Comparison of calculated and experimental hyperfine coupling tensors and g-tensors suggests that the neutral imidazole complex is formed at physiological temperatures while the imidazolium complex may be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures.",M1
19891780,"Cbl-associated protein is tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Abl and c-Src kinases.BACKGROUND: The c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), also known as ponsin, localizes to focal adhesions and stress fibers and is involved in signaling events. Phosphorylation has been described for the other two members of the sorbin homology family, vinexin and ArgBP2, but no data exist about the putative phosphorylation of CAP. According to previous findings, CAP binds to tyrosine kinase c-Abl. However, it is not known if CAP is a substrate of c-Abl or other tyrosine kinases or if phosphorylation regulates its localization. RESULTS: We here show that CAP is <e>Tyr</e> phosphorylated by and interacts with both c-Abl and c-Src. One major phosphorylation site, Tyr360, and two minor contributors Tyr326 and Tyr632 were identified as Abl phosphorylation sites, whereas Src preferentially phosphorylates Tyr326 and Tyr360. Phosphorylation of CAP was not necessary for its localization to focal adhesions and stress fibers, but Tyr326Phe substitution alters the function of CAP during cell spreading. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of phosphorylation of CAP by any kinase. Our findings suggest that coordinated action of Src and Abl might regulate the function of CAP and reveal a functional role especially for the Src-mediated Tyr phosphorylation of CAP in cell spreading.",M1
19889090,"Dissecting the role of the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS/IRSp53 signalling pathways in vivo.Attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and actin polymerization, the hallmark of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR) infections, are dependent on the effector Tir. Phosphorylation of Tir(EPEC/CR) Y474/1 leads to recruitment of Nck and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and strong actin polymerization in cultured cells. Tir(EPEC/CR) also contains an Asn-Pro-<e>Tyr</e> (NPY(454/1)) motif, which triggers weak actin polymerization. In EHEC the NPY(458) actin polymerization pathway is amplified by TccP/EspF(U), which is recruited to Tir via IRSp53 and/or insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS). Here we used C. rodentium to investigate the different Tir signalling pathways in vivo. Following infection with wild-type C. rodentium IRTKS, but not IRSp53, was recruited to the bacterial attachment sites. Similar results were seen after infection of human ileal explants with EHEC. Mutating Y471 or Y451 in Tir(CR) abolished recruitment of Nck and IRTKS respectively, but did not affect recruitment of N-WASP or A/E lesion formation. This suggests that despite their crucial role in actin polymerization in cultured cells the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways are not essential for N-WASP recruitment or A/E lesion formation in vivo. Importantly, wild-type C. rodentium out-competed the tir tyrosine mutants during mixed infections. These results uncouple the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways from A/E lesion formation in vivo but assign them an important in vivo role.",M1
19888460,"The tyrosine kinase Csk dimerizes through Its SH3 domain.The Src family kinases possess two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation that are critical to the regulation of kinase activity. Autophosphorylation on an activation loop tyrosine residue (<e>Tyr</e> 416 in commonly used chicken c-Src numbering) increases catalytic activity, while phosphorylation of a C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr 527 in c-Src) inhibits activity. The latter modification is achieved by the tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase), but the complete inactivation of the Src family kinases also requires the dephosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine. The SH3 domain of Csk recruits the tyrosine phosphatase PEP, allowing for the coordinated inhibition of Src family kinase activity. We have discovered that Csk forms homodimers through interactions mediated by the SH3 domain in a manner that buries the recognition surface for SH3 ligands. The formation of this dimer would therefore block the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases and may have important implications for the regulation of Src kinase activity.",M1
19883595,"Tyrosine autofluorescence as a measure of bovine insulin fibrillation.The traditional approach to investigating the partial unfolding and fibrillation of insulin, and proteins at large, has involved use of the dyes 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid (ANS) and Thioflavin T (ThT), respectively. We compare the kinetic profiles of ThT, ANS, light scattering, and intrinsic <e>Tyr</e> fluorescence during insulin fibrillation. The data reveal that the sequence of structural changes (dimers --&gt; monomers --&gt; partially unfolded monomers --&gt; oligomeric aggregates --&gt; fibrils) accompanying insulin fibrillation can be detected directly using intrinsic Tyr fluorescence. The results indicate that at least two distinguishable structural intermediates precede fibril development. There is no evidence of tyrosinate or dityrosine during insulin aggregation. Obtaining such critical information from the protein itself is complementary to existing aggregation probes and affords the advantage of directly examining structural changes that occur at the molecular level, providing concrete details of the early events preceding fibrillation.",M1
19846878,"Adenosine blocks IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727 to reduce macrophage activation.Macrophages are activated by IFN-gamma, a proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine that mediates its downstream effects primarily through STAT1. IFN-gamma signaling induces phosphorylation of two STAT1 residues: <e>Tyr</e>(701) (Y701), which facilitates dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding; and Ser(727) (S727), which enables maximal STAT1 transcription activity. Immunosuppressive molecules such as adenosine in the cellular microenvironment can reduce macrophage inflammatory and atherogenic functions through receptor-mediated signaling pathways. We hypothesized that adenosine achieves these protective effects by interrupting IFN-gamma signaling in activated macrophages. This investigation demonstrates that adding adenosine to IFN-gamma-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 and human THP-1 macrophages results in unique modulation of STAT1 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation events. We show that adenosine inhibits IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 S727 phosphorylation by &gt;30% and phosphoserine-mediated transcriptional activity by 58% but has no effect on phosphorylation of Y701 or receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases. Inhibition of the adenosine A(3) receptor with a subtype-specific antagonist (MRS 1191 in RAW 264.7 cells and MRS 1220 in THP-1 cells) reverses this adenosine suppressive effect on STAT1 phosphoserine status by 25-50%. Further, RAW 264.7 A(3) receptor stimulation with Cl-IB-MECA reduces IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 transcriptional activity by 45% and STAT1-dependent gene expression by up to 80%. These data suggest that A(3) receptor signaling is key to adenosine-mediated STAT1 modulation and anti-inflammatory action in IFN-gamma-activated mouse and human macrophages. Because STAT1 plays a key role in IFN-gamma-induced inflammation and foam cell transformation, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying STAT1 deactivation by adenosine may improve preventative and therapeutic approaches to vascular disease.",M1
19834457,"Involvement of NMDAR2A tyrosine phosphorylation in depression-related behaviour.Major depressive and bipolar disorders are serious illnesses that affect millions of people. Growing evidence implicates glutamate signalling in depression, though the molecular mechanism by which glutamate signalling regulates depression-related behaviour remains unknown. In this study, we provide evidence suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, contributes to depression-related behaviour. The NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated, with <e>Tyr</e> 1325 as its one of the major phosphorylation site. We have generated mice expressing mutant NR2A with a Tyr-1325-Phe mutation to prevent the phosphorylation of this site in vivo. The homozygous knock-in mice show antidepressant-like behaviour in the tail suspension test and in the forced swim test. In the striatum of the knock-in mice, DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr 34, which is important for the regulation of depression-related behaviour, is increased. We also show that the Tyr 1325 phosphorylation site is required for Src-induced potentiation of the NMDA receptor channel in the striatum. These data argue that Tyr 1325 phosphorylation regulates NMDA receptor channel properties and the NMDA receptor-mediated downstream signalling to modulate depression-related behaviour.",M1
19833725,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 regulates B cell receptor-mediated activation of NFAT.Adaptor protein c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2, also referred to SH3BP2) regulates immune receptor-mediated signal transduction. In this report we focused on the molecular mechanism of 3BP2 function in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Engagement of BCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Genetic analysis demonstrated that Syk is critical for BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Mutational analysis of 3BP2 revealed that both <e>Tyr</e>(183) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain are necessary for 3BP2-mediated BCR-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Point mutation of Tyr(183) or Arg(486) in the SH2 domain of 3BP2 diminished BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Endogenous 3BP2 forms a complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular signaling molecules. Peptide binding experiments demonstrated that only phosphorylated Tyr(183) in 3BP2 could form a complex with the SH2 domain(s) of phospholipase Cgamma2 and Vav1 from B cell lysates. These interactions were represented by using bacterial glutathione S-transferase-phospholipase Cgamma2 or -Vav1 SH2 domain. Furthermore, pulldown and Far Western experiments showed that the 3BP2-SH2 domain directly binds to B cell linker protein (BLNK) after BCR stimulation. These results demonstrated that 3BP2 induces the protein complex with cellular signaling molecules through phosphorylation of Tyr(183) and SH2 domain leading to the activation of NFAT in B cells.",M1
19827750,"Agonist vs antagonist behavior of delta opioid peptides containing novel phenylalanine analogues in place of <e>Tyr</e>(1).The novel phenylalanine analogues 4'-[N-((4'-phenyl)phenethyl)carboxamido]phenylalanine (Bcp) and 2',6'-dimethyl-4'-[N-((4'-phenyl)phenethyl)carboxamido]phenylalanine (Dbcp) were substituted for Tyr(1) in the delta opioid antagonist TIPP (H-Tyr-Tic-Phe-Phe-OH; Tic = tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid). Unexpectedly, [Bcp(1)]TIPP was a potent, selective delta opioid agonist, whereas [Dbcp(1)]TIPP retained high delta antagonist activity. Receptor docking studies indicated similar binding modes for the two peptides except for the biphenylethyl moiety which occupied distinct receptor subsites. The dipeptide H-Dbcp-Tic-OH was a highly selective delta antagonist with subnanomolar delta receptor affinity.",M1
19826412,"Shc is required for ErbB2-induced inhibition of apoptosis but is dispensable for cell proliferation and disruption of cell polarity.Amplification and overexpression of ErbB2 strongly correlates with aggressive breast cancers. A deeper understanding of pathways downstream of ErbB2 signaling that are required for the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells will identify novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer. Using an inducible activation of ErbB2 autophosphorylation qsite mutants and the MCF-10A three-dimensional (3D) culture system, we investigated pathways used by ErbB2 to transform the epithelia. We report that ErbB2 induces cell proliferation and loss of 3D organization by redundant mechanisms, whereas it disrupts apical basal polarity and inhibits apoptosis using <e>Tyr</e> 1201 and Tyr 1226/7, respectively. Signals downstream of Tyr 1226/7 were also sufficient to confer paclitaxel resistance. The Tyr 1226/7 binds Shc, and the knockdown of Shc blocks the ability of ErbB2 to inhibit apoptosis and mediate paclitaxel resistance. Tyr 1226/7 is known to activate the Ras/Erk pathway; however, paclitaxel resistance did not correlate with the activation of Erk or Akt, suggesting the presence of a novel mechanism. Thus, our results show that targeting pathways used by ErbB2 to inhibit cell death is a better option than targeting cell proliferation pathways. Furthermore, we identify a novel function for Shc as a regulator of apoptosis and drug resistance in human mammary epithelial cells transformed by ErbB2.",M1
19821497,"Sorafenib inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 signaling in cholangiocarcinoma cells by activating the phosphatase shatterproof 2.The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is one of the key signaling cascades in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells, mediating their resistance to apoptosis. Our aim was to ascertain if sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, may also inhibit JAK/STAT signaling and, therefore, be efficacious for CCA. Sorafenib treatment of three human CCA cell lines resulted in <e>Tyr</e>(705) phospho-STAT3 dephosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with the Raf-kinase inhibitor ZM336372, suggesting sorafenib promotes Tyr(705) phospho-STAT3 dephosphorylation by inhibiting Raf-kinase activity. Sorafenib treatment enhanced an activating phosphorylation of the phosphatase SHP2. Consistent with this observation, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of phosphatase shatterproof 2 (SHP2) inhibited sorafenib-induced Tyr(705) phospho-STAT3 dephosphorylation. Sorafenib treatment also decreased the expression of Mcl-1 messenger RNA and protein, a STAT3 transcriptional target, as well as sensitizing CCA cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis. In an orthotopic, syngeneic CCA model in rats, sorafenib displayed significant tumor suppression resulting in a survival benefit for treated animals. In this in vivo model, sorafenib also decreased tumor Tyr(705) STAT3 phosphorylation and increased tumor cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib accelerates STAT3 dephosphorylation by stimulating phosphatase SHP2 activity, sensitizes CCA cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, and is therapeutic in a syngeneic rat, orthotopic CCA model that mimics human disease.",M1
19812385,"Oxidative modification of von Willebrand factor by neutrophil oxidants inhibits its cleavage by ADAMTS13.Elevated plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) and low ADAMTS13 activity have been reported in several inflammatory states, including sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. One hallmark of inflammation is neutrophil activation and production of reactive oxygen species, including superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is produced from hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions through the action of myeloperoxidase. HOCl can oxidize methionine to methionine sulfoxide and tyrosine to chlorotyrosine. This is of interest because the ADAMTS13 cleavage site in VWF, the <e>Tyr</e>(1605)-Met(1606) peptide bond, contains both oxidation-prone residues. We hypothesized that HOCl would oxidize either or both of these residues and possibly inhibit ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage. We therefore treated ADAMTS13 substrates with HOCl and examined their oxidative modification by mass spectrometry. Met(1606) was oxidized to the sulfoxide in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete oxidation at 75muM HOCl, whereas only a miniscule percentage of Tyr(1605) was converted to chlorotyrosine. The oxidized substrates were cleaved much more slowly by ADAMTS13 than the nonoxidized substrates. A similar result was obtained with multimeric VWF. Taken together, these findings indicate that reactive oxygen species released by activated neutrophils have a prothrombotic effect, mediated in part by inhibition of VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13.",M1
19809679,"Modeling of the Zn2+ binding in the 1-16 region of the amyloid beta peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease.Zinc ions are found at mM concentration in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease and the role of zinc in protein oligomerization is the object of intense investigations. As an in vitro model for studying interactions between Zn(2+) and the Abeta peptide, that is the main component of plaques, the N- and C-termini protected Abeta(1-16) fragment has been chosen because reliable spectroscopic studies in water solution are possible due to the low propensity for oligomerization at pH approximately 6.5, and because all the Zn binding sites of Abeta have been identified in the 1-16 region. In this work we present the results of first principle simulations of several initial models of Zn-Abeta(1-16) complexes. The NMR results about the same system, where His 6, 13, 14 and Glu 11 side-chains coordinate the Zn ion, are strongly supported by these models. Coordination of Asp 1 to Zn drives the complex towards the expulsion of one of initially bonded His side-chains. Coordination of <e>Tyr</e> 10 to Zn is possible only when Tyr 10 is deprotonated. The interplay between physico-chemical properties of the Abeta ligand and the Zn coordination is discussed.",M1
19808664,"A double tyrosine motif in the cardiac sodium channel domain III-IV linker couples calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to inactivation gating.Voltage-gated sodium channels maintain the electrical cadence and stability of neurons and muscle cells by selectively controlling the transmembrane passage of their namesake ion. The degree to which these channels contribute to cellular excitability can be managed therapeutically or fine-tuned by endogenous ligands. Intracellular calcium, for instance, modulates sodium channel inactivation, the process by which sodium conductance is negatively regulated. We explored the molecular basis for this effect by investigating the interaction between the ubiquitous calcium binding protein calmodulin (CaM) and the putative sodium channel inactivation gate composed of the cytosolic linker between homologous channel domains III and IV (DIII-IV). Experiments using isothermal titration calorimetry show that CaM binds to a novel double tyrosine motif in the center of the DIII-IV linker in a calcium-dependent manner, N-terminal to a region previously reported to be a CaM binding site. An alanine scan of aromatic residues in recombinant DIII-DIV linker peptides shows that whereas multiple side chains contribute to CaM binding, two tyrosines (<e>Tyr</e>(1494) and Tyr(1495)) play a crucial role in binding the CaM C-lobe. The functional relevance of these observations was then ascertained through electrophysiological measurement of sodium channel inactivation gating in the presence and absence of calcium. Experiments on patch-clamped transfected tsA201 cells show that only the Y1494A mutation of the five sites tested renders sodium channel steady-state inactivation insensitive to cytosolic calcium. The results demonstrate that calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to the sodium channel inactivation gate double tyrosine motif is required for calcium regulation of the cardiac sodium channel.",M1
19798056,"Participation of Tom1L1 in EGF-stimulated endocytosis of EGF receptor.Although many proteins have been shown to participate in ligand-stimulated endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR), the adaptor protein responsible for interaction of activated EGFR with endocytic machinery remains elusive. We show here that EGF stimulates transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Tom1L1 by the Src family kinases, resulting in transient interaction of Tom1L1 with the activated EGFR bridged by Grb2 and Shc. Cytosolic Tom1L1 is recruited onto the plasma membrane and subsequently redistributes into the early endosome. Mutant forms of Tom1L1 defective in <e>Tyr</e>-phosphorylation or interaction with Grb2 are incapable of interaction with EGFR. These mutants behave as dominant-negative mutants to inhibit endocytosis of EGFR. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Tom1L1 inhibits endocytosis of EGFR. The C-terminal tail of Tom1L1 contains a novel clathrin-interacting motif responsible for interaction with the C-terminal region of clathrin heavy chain, which is important for exogenous Tom1L1 to rescue endocytosis of EGFR in Tom1L1 knocked-down cells. These results suggest that EGF triggers a transient Grb2/Shc-mediated association of EGFR with Tyr-phosphorylated Tom1L1 to engage the endocytic machinery for endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex.",M1
19789629,"Reactions of Cre with methylphosphonate DNA: similarities and contrasts with Flp and vaccinia topoisomerase.BACKGROUND: Reactions of vaccinia topoisomerase and the tyrosine site-specific recombinase Flp with methylphosphonate (MeP) substituted DNA substrates, have provided important insights into the electrostatic features of the strand cleavage and strand joining steps catalyzed by them. A conserved arginine residue in the catalytic pentad, Arg-223 in topoisomerase and Arg-308 in Flp, is not essential for stabilizing the MeP transition state. Topoisomerase or its R223A variant promotes cleavage of the MeP bond by the active site nucleophile <e>Tyr</e>-274, followed by the rapid hydrolysis of the MeP-tyrosyl intermediate. Flp(R308A), but not wild type Flp, mediates direct hydrolysis of the activated MeP bond. These findings are consistent with a potential role for phosphate electrostatics and active site electrostatics in protecting DNA relaxation and site-specific recombination, respectively, against abortive hydrolysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have examined the effects of DNA containing MeP substitution in the Flp related Cre recombination system. Neutralizing the negative charge at the scissile position does not render the tyrosyl intermediate formed by Cre susceptible to rapid hydrolysis. Furthermore, combining the active site R292A mutation in Cre (equivalent to the R223A and R308A mutations in topoisomerase and Flp, respectively) with MeP substitution does not lead to direct hydrolysis of the scissile MeP bond in DNA. Whereas Cre follows the topoisomerase paradigm during the strand cleavage step, it follows the Flp paradigm during the strand joining step. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, the Cre, Flp and topoisomerase results highlight the contribution of conserved electrostatic complementarity between substrate and active site towards transition state stabilization during site-specific recombination and DNA relaxation. They have potential implications for how transesterification reactions in nucleic acids are protected against undesirable abortive side reactions. Such protective mechanisms are significant, given the very real threat of hydrolytic genome damage or disruption of RNA processing due to the cellular abundance and nucleophilicity of water.",M1
19783980,"JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3Y41 and excludes HP1alpha from chromatin.Activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by chromosomal translocations or point mutations is a frequent event in haematological malignancies. JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular processes by inducing cytoplasmic signalling cascades. Here we show that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of haematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates <e>Tyr</e> 41 (Y41) on histone H3. Heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), but not HP1beta, specifically binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukaemic cells decreases both the expression of the haematopoietic oncogene lmo2 and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1alpha at the same site. Tauhese results identify a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of H3Y41 and reveal a direct mechanistic link between two genes, jak2 and lmo2, involved in normal haematopoiesis and leukaemia.",M1
19783652,"Crystal structure of a mammalian CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase catalytic domain reveals novel active site residues within a highly conserved nucleotidyltransferase fold.CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. The CCT-catalyzed transfer of a cytidylyl group from CTP to phosphocholine to form CDP-choline is regulated by a membrane lipid-dependent mechanism imparted by its C-terminal membrane binding domain. We present the first analysis of a crystal structure of a eukaryotic CCT. A deletion construct of rat CCTalpha spanning residues 1-236 (CCT236) lacks the regulatory domain and as a result displays constitutive activity. The 2.2-A structure reveals a CCT236 homodimer in complex with the reaction product, CDP-choline. Each chain is composed of a complete catalytic domain with an intimately associated N-terminal extension, which together with the catalytic domain contributes to the dimer interface. Although the CCT236 structure reveals elements involved in binding cytidine that are conserved with other members of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily, it also features nonconserved active site residues, His-168 and <e>Tyr</e>-173, that make key interactions with the beta-phosphate of CDP-choline. Mutagenesis and kinetic analyses confirmed their role in phosphocholine binding and catalysis. These results demonstrate structural and mechanistic differences in a broadly conserved protein fold across the cytidylyltransferase family. Comparison of the CCT236 structure with those of other nucleotidyltransferases provides evidence for substrate-induced active site loop movements and a disorder-to-order transition of a loop element in the catalytic mechanism.",M1
19779650,"Regulation of membrane band 3 <e>Tyr</e>-phosphorylation by proteolysis of p72(Syk) and possible involvement in senescence process.Erythrocyte senescence is characterized by exposure of cell surface epitopes on cell membrane proteins leading to immune mediated removal of red blood cells. One mechanism for antigen formation is tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of the transmembrane protein band 3 by Syk kinase. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that proteolytic activation of Syk kinase by conversion from 72 kDa (p72(Syk)) to the 36 kDa (p36(Syk)) isoform enhances its phosphorylating activity independently of the association of Syk kinase with the cytoskeleton. Tyr-P assay was conducted using quantification of (32)P uptake into the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 after addition of p72(Syk) or p36(Syk). Effect of prephosphorylation of erythrocyte membrane band 3 protein by p36(Syk) on p72(Syk)-mediated phosphorylation and the effect of addition of a protease inhibitor (leupeptin) on p72(Syk)-mediated phosphorylation were studied by autoradiographic visualization of (32)P uptake. Tyr-P by Syk isoforms of membrane skeletal and soluble fractions of band 3 was visualized by immunoblotting. It was found that p36(Syk) had a higher band 3 tyrosine phosphorylating activity compared with p72(Syk). Pre-phosphorylation with p36(Syk) or p72(Syk) increased band 3 phosphorylating activity. Protease inhibition treatment reduced p72(Syk) but not p36(Syk) band 3 tyrosine phosphorylating activity significantly. Both soluble and membrane skeletal fractions of band 3 protein were equally tyrosine phosphorylated by each Syk isoform. In conclusion, we confirmed the hypothesis that proteolytic cleavage of p72(Syk) is an important regulatory step for band 3 Tyr-P and its independence of the association of band 3 with the cytoskeleton.",M1
19778007,"Real time monitoring of sickle cell hemoglobin fiber formation by UV resonance Raman spectroscopy.In sickle cell hemoglobin, individual tetramers associate into long fibers as a consequence of the mutation at the beta6 position. In this study UV resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor the formation of Hb S fibers in real time through aromatic amino acid vibrational modes. The intermolecular contact formed by the mutation site ((1)beta(1)6 Glu--&gt;Val) of one tetramer and the (2)beta(2)85 Phe-(2)beta(2)88 Leu hydrophobic pocket on a different tetramer is observed by monitoring the increase in signal intensity of Phe vibrational modes as a function of time, yielding kinetic progress curves similar to those obtained by turbidity measurements. Comparison of individual spectra collected at early time points (&lt;1000 s) show small Phe intensity changes, which are attributed to weak transient associations of Hb S tetramers during the initial stages of the polymerization process. At later times (1000-2000 s) Phe signal intensity steadily increases because of increasing hydrophobicity of local Phe environment, a consequence of forming more stable (1)beta(1)-(2)beta(2) contacts. <e>Tyr</e> and Trp vibrational modes monitor H-bond strength between critical residues at the alpha(1)beta(2) interface of individual tetramers. Kinetic progress curves generated from these signals exhibit two distinct transitions at 2040 and 7340 s. These transitions, which occur later in time than those detected either by turbidity (1560 s) or by Phe signal intensity (1680 s), are attributed to initial fiber formation and subsequent formation of larger assemblies, such as macrofibers or gels. These results provide molecular insight into the interactions governing Hb S fiber formation.",M1
19762440,"A tyrosine O-prenyltransferase catalyses the first pathway-specific step in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL.A putative prenyltransferase gene sirD has been identified in the gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin sirodesmin PL in Leptosphaeria maculans. The gene product was found to comprise 449 aa, with a molecular mass of 51 kDa. In this study, the coding region of sirD was amplified by PCR from cDNA, cloned into pQE70, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The overproduced protein was purified to apparent homogeneity, and characterized biochemically. The dimeric recombinant SirD was found to catalyse the O-prenylation of L-<e>Tyr</e> in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate; this was demonstrated unequivocally by isolation and structural elucidation of the enzymic product. Therefore, SirD catalyses the first pathway-specific step in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL. K(m) values for L-Tyr and dimethylallyl diphosphate were determined as 0.13 and 0.17 mM, respectively. Interestingly, SirD was found to share significant sequence similarity with indole prenyltransferases, which catalyse prenyl transfer reactions onto different positions of indole rings. In contrast to indole prenyltransferases, which accept indole derivatives, but not Tyr or structures derived thereof, as substrates, SirD also prenylated L-Trp, resulting in the formation of 7-dimethylallyltryptophan. A K(m) value of 0.23 mM was determined for L-Trp. Turnover numbers of 1.0 and 0.06 S(-1) were calculated for L-Tyr and L-Trp, respectively.",M1
19758327,"Tyrosine 9 is the key amino acid in microcin J25 superoxide overproduction.Escherichia coli microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a lasso-peptide antibiotic comprising 21 L-amino acid residues (G(1)-G-A-G-H(5)-V-P-E-Y-F(10)-V-G-I-G-T(15)-P-I-S-F-Y(20)-G). MccJ25 has two independent substrates: RNA-polymerase (RNAP) and the membrane respiratory chain. The latter is mediated by oxygen consumption inhibition together with an increase of superoxide production. In the present paper, the antibiotic MccJ25 was engineered by substituting <e>Tyr</e>(9) or Tyr(20) with phenylalanine. Both mutants were well transported into the cells and remained active on RNAP. Only the Y9F mutant lost the ability to overproduce superoxide and inhibit oxygen consumption. The last results confirm that the Tyr(9), and not Tyr(20), is involved in the MccJ25 action on the respiratory chain target.",M1
19749156,"G protein-coupled receptor 30 expression is up-regulated by EGF and TGF alpha in estrogen receptor alpha-positive cancer cells.In the present study, we evaluated the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)30 expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive endometrial, ovarian, and estrogen-sensitive, as well as tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF alpha transactivate the GPR30 promoter and accordingly up-regulate GPR30 mRNA and protein levels only in endometrial and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. These effects exerted by EGF and TGF alpha were dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and activation and involved phosphorylation of the <e>Tyr</e>(1045) and Tyr(1173) EGFR sites. Using gene-silencing experiments and specific pharmacological inhibitors, we have ascertained that EGF and TGF alpha induce GPR30 expression through the EGFR/ERK transduction pathway, and the recruitment of c-fos to the activator protein-1 site located within GPR30 promoter sequence. Interestingly, we show that functional cross talk of GPR30 with both activated EGFR and ER alpha relies on a physical interaction among these receptors, further extending the potential of estrogen to trigger a complex stimulatory signaling network in hormone-sensitive tumors. Given that EGFR/HER2 overexpression is associated with tamoxifen resistance, our data may suggest that ligand-activated EGFR could contribute to the failure of tamoxifen therapy also by up-regulating GPR30, which in turn could facilitates the action of estrogen. In addition, important for resistance is the ability of tamoxifen to bind to and activate GPR30, the expression of which is up-regulated by EGFR activation. Our results emphasize the need for new endocrine agents able to block widespread actions of estrogen without exerting any stimulatory activity on transduction pathways shared by the steroid and growth factor-signaling networks.",M1
19739125,"Modifying the conserved C-terminal tyrosine of the peptide hormone PYY3-36 to improve Y2 receptor selectivity.The Y2 selective PYY derived peptide PYY3-36 was recently shown to play a role in appetite regulation. Novel PYY3-36 analogs with high selectivity for the Y2 receptor could be potential drug candidates for the treatment of obesity. The C-terminal pentapeptide segment of PYY3-36 is believed to bind to the Y receptors. <e>Tyr</e>-36 is highly conserved across species and only few successful modifications of Tyr-36 have been documented. PYY3-36 analogs were prepared using solid-phase peptide chemistry and tested for binding to the Y1, Y2 and Y4 receptor subtypes by radioligand displacement assay. The Y2 receptor agonists with the best affinity and selectivity were further investigated for activity towards the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes. Unexpectedly, modifications of Tyr-36 were well-tolerated, and the analogs of PYY3-36 in which the Tyr-36 hydroxyl group was substituted with a halogen or an amino group were particularly well tolerated and yielded an improved selectivity and approximately equipotent affinity to the Y2 receptor. These modifications could be used to design new potential drug candidates for the treatment of obesity.",M1
19415427,"Migraine prevalence in eating disorders and pathophysiological correlations.The eating disorders (ED): anorexia nervosa (AN) and Bulimia nervosa (BN) are severe psychiatric and somatic conditions occurring mainly in young woman. Although the etiology is largely unknown, same evidences suggest that biological and psychological factors play a relevant role in the pathogenesis, along with monoamine, indole and same hypothalamic hormonal dysfunctions. Migraine is characterized by similar metabolic and psychological anomalies suggesting that a possible relationship exists between the two pathological conditions. In order to understand the possible relationship between migraine and ED, we have investigated the prevalence of migraine and the other primary headaches in a large group of AN and BN patients. In addition, we have studied the role of tyrosine metabolism in the same group of AN and BN young woman sufferers. In particular, we measured plasma levels of elusive amines: tyramine (<e>Tyr</e>) and octopamine (Oct) and catecholamines: noradrenalin (NE), dopamine (DA). The results of this study show that the prevalence of migraine in the woman affected be EA is very high (&gt;75%). The levels of Tyr and DA were higher and levels of NE were lower in the ED patients with respect to the control subject. These biochemical findings suggest that abnormalities of limbic and hypothalamic circuitries play a role in the pathogenesis of ED. The very high prevalence of migraine in our group of ED sufferers and the biochemical profile of migraine, similar to that ED patients have shown in this study, suggest that migraine may constitute a risk factor for the occurrence of ED in the young females. This hypothesis is supported by the onset of migraine attacks that initiated, in the majority of the patients, before the occurrence of ED symptoms.",M1
19717529,"Protein targets of tyrosine nitration in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) hypocotyls.Tyrosine nitration is recognized as an important post-translational protein modification in animal cells that can be used as an indicator of a nitrosative process. However, in plant systems, there is scant information on proteins that undergo this process. In sunflower hypocotyls, the content of tyrosine nitration (NO(2)-<e>Tyr</e>) and the identification of nitrated proteins were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and proteomic approaches, respectively. In addition, the cell localization of nitrotyrosine proteins and peroxynitrite were analysed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) using antibodies against 3-nitrotyrosine and 3'-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) as the fluorescent probe, in that order. The concentration of Tyr and NO(2)-Tyr in hypocotyls was 0.56 micromol mg(-1) protein and 0.19 pmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. By proteomic analysis, a total of 21 nitrotyrosine-immunopositive proteins were identified. These targets include proteins involved in photosynthesis, and in antioxidant, ATP, carbohydrate, and nitrogen metabolism. Among the proteins identified, S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) was selected as a model to evaluate the effect of nitration on SAHH activity using SIN-1 (a peroxynitrite donor) as the nitrating agent. When the hypocotyl extracts were exposed to 0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 5 mM SIN-1, the SAHH activity was inhibited by some 49%, 89%, and 94%, respectively. In silico analysis of the barley SAHH sequence, characterized Tyr448 as the most likely potential target for nitration. In summary, the present data are the first in plants concerning the content of nitrotyrosine and the identification of candidates of protein nitration. Taken together, the results suggest that Tyr nitration occurs in plant tissues under physiological conditions that could constitute an important process of protein regulation in such a way that, when it is overproduced in adverse circumstances, it can be used as a marker of nitrosative stress.",M1
19717511,"Site-specific carboxypeptidase B1 tyrosine nitration and pathophysiological implications following its physical association with nitric oxide synthase-3 in experimental sepsis.LPS-induced sepsis results in oxidative modification and inactivation of carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1). In this study, immunoprecipitated CPB1 was probed for tyrosine nitration using monoclonal nitrotyrosine-specific Abs in a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis. Tyrosine nitration of CPB1 was significantly reduced in the presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor allopurinol and in NOS-3 knockout (KO) mice. CPB1 tyrosine nitration and loss of activity by the concerted action of NOS-3 and XO were also confirmed in vitro using both the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine and peroxynitrite. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry data indicated five sites of tyrosine nitration in vitro including <e>Tyr</e>(248), the tyrosine at the catalytic site. The site- and protein-specific nitration of CPB1 and the possible high nitration yield to inactivate it were elucidated by confocal microscopy. The studies indicated that CPB1 colocalized with NOS-3 in the cytosol of sinus-lining cells in the red pulp of the spleen. Further analysis of CPB1-immunoprecipitated samples indicated immunoreactivity to a monoclonal NOS-3 Ab, suggesting protein complex formation with CPB1. XO and NOS inhibitors and NOS-3 KO mice injected with LPS had decreased levels of C5a in spleens of septic mice, indicating peroxynitrite as a possible cause for CPB1 functional alteration. Thus, CPB1 colocalization, coupling, and proximity to NOS-3 in the sinus-lining cells of spleen red pulp could explain the site-specific tyrosine nitration and inactivation of CPB1. These results open up new avenues for the investigation of several enzymes involved in inflammation and their site-specific oxidative modifications by protein-protein interactions as well as their role in sepsis.",M1
19711041,"A protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, inhibits angiotensin II-Induced beta-arrestin cleavage.Beta-arrestins turn off G protein-mediated signals and initiate distinct G protein-independent signaling pathways. We previously demonstrated that angiotensin AT(1) receptor-bound beta-arrestin 1 is cleaved after Phe(388) upon angiotensin II stimulation. The mechanism and signaling pathway of angiotensin II-induced beta-arrestin cleavage remain largely unknown. Here, we show that protein <e>Tyr</e> phosphatase activity is involved in the regulation of beta-arrestin 1 cleavage. Tagging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) either to the N-terminus or C-terminus of beta-arrestin 1 induced conformational changes and the cleavage of beta-arrestin 1 without angiotensin AT(1) receptor activation. Orthovanadate and molybdate, inhibitors of protein Tyr phosphatase, attenuated the cleavage of C-terminal GFP-tagged beta-arrestin 1 in vitro. The inhibitory effects of okadaic acid and pyrophosphate, which are inhibitors of protein Ser/Thr phosphatase, were less than those of protein Tyr phosphatase inhibitors. Cell-permeable pervanadate inhibited angiotensin II-induced cleavage of beta-arrestin 1 in COS-1 cells. Our findings suggest that Tyr phosphorylation signaling is involved in the regulation of angiotensin II-induced beta-arrestin cleavage.",M1
19704161,"Inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase by tyrosine nitration.Inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has beneficial effects on vascular inflammation and hypertension indicating that the enzyme may be a promising target for drug development. As the enzymatic core of the hydrolase domain of the human sEH contains two tyrosine residues (<e>Tyr</e>(383) and Tyr(466)) that are theoretically crucial for enzymatic activity, we addressed the hypothesis that the activity of the sEH may be affected by nitrosative stress. Epoxide hydrolase activity was detected in human and murine endothelial cells as well in HEK293 cells and could be inhibited by either authentic peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) or the ONOO(-) generator 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1). Protection of the enzymatic core with 1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea in vitro decreased sensitivity to SIN-1. Both ONOO(-) and SIN-1 elicited the tyrosine nitration of the sEH protein and mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments revealed nitration on several tyrosine residues including Tyr(383) and Tyr(466). Mutation of the latter residues to phenylalanine was sufficient to abrogate epoxide hydrolase activity. In vivo, streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in the tyrosine nitration of the sEH in murine lungs and a significant decrease in its activity. Taken together, these data indicate that the activity of the sEH can be regulated by the tyrosine nitration of the protein. Moreover, nitrosative stress would be expected to potentiate the physiological actions of arachidonic acid epoxides by preventing their metabolism to the corresponding diols.",M1
19702336,"Phosphorylated proteins of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome: implications in protein synthesis.Mitochondria, the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, have their own translation machinery that is solely responsible for synthesis of 13 mitochondrially encoded protein subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Phosphorylation is a well-known post-translational modification in regulation of many processes in mammalian mitochondria including oxidative phosphorylation. However, there is still very limited knowledge on phosphorylation of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and their role(s) in ribosome function. In this study, we have identified the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are phosphorylated at serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. Twenty-four phosphorylated proteins were visualized by phosphorylation-specific techniques including in vitro radiolabeling, residue specific antibodies for phosphorylated residues, or ProQ phospho dye and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Translation assays with isolated ribosomes that were phosphorylated in vitro by kinases PKA, PKCdelta, or Abl <e>Tyr</e> showed up to 30% inhibition due to phosphorylation. Findings from this study should serve as the framework for future studies addressing the regulation mechanisms of mitochondrial translation machinery by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications.",M1
19701784,"Differences in coordination states of substituted tyrosine residues and quaternary structures among hemoglobin M probed by resonance Raman spectroscopy.Among the four types of hemoglobin (Hb) M with a substitution of a tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) for either the proximal (F8) or distal (E7) histidine in the alpha or beta subunits, only Hb M Saskatoon (betaE7Tyr) assumes a hexacoordinate structure and its abnormal subunits can be reduced readily by methemoglobin (metHb) reductase. This is distinct from the other three M Hbs. To gain new insight into the cause of the difference, we examined the ionization states of E7 and F8 Tyrs by UV resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy and Fe-O(Tyr) bonding by visible RR spectroscopy. Hb M Iwate (alphaF8Tyr), Hb M Boston (alphaE7Tyr), and Hb M Hyde Park (betaF8Tyr) exhibited two extra UV RR bands at 1,603 cm(-1) (Y8a') and 1,167 cm(-1) (Y9a') arising from deprotonated (ionized) Tyr, but Hb M Saskatoon displayed the UV RR bands of protonated (unionized) Tyr at 1,620 and 1,175 cm(-1) in addition to those of deprotonated Tyr. Evidence for the bonding of both ionization states of Tyr to the heme in Hb M Saskatoon was provided by visible RR spectroscopy. These results indicate that betaE7Tyr of Hb M Saskatoon is in equilibrium between protonated and deprotonated forms, which is responsible for facile reducibility. Comparison of the UV RR spectral features of metHb M with that of metHb A has revealed that metHb M Saskatoon and metHb M Hyde Park are in the R (relaxed) structure, similar to that of metHb A, whereas metHb M Iwate, metHb M Boston and metHb M Milwaukee are in the T (tense) quaternary structure.",M1
19697948,"Preferentially increased nitration of alpha-synuclein at tyrosine-39 in a cellular oxidative model of Parkinson's disease.Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, proteinacious inclusions which are a major hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Lewy bodies contain high levels of nitrated tyrosine residues as determined by antibodies specific for 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and via mass spectrometry (MS). We have developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry method to sensitively quantitate the 3NT levels of specific alpha-synuclein tyrosine residues. We found a 9-fold increase (relative to controls) in levels of 3NT at <e>Tyr</e>-39 of alpha-synuclein in an inducible transgenic cellular model of Parkinson's disease in which monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is overexpressed and which emulates several features of PD. Increased nitration of Tyr-39 on endogenous alpha-synuclein via elevations in MAO-B levels could be abrogated by the addition of deprenyl, a specific MAO-B inhibitor. The increased levels of 3NT was selective for Tyr-39 as no significant increases in 3NT levels were detected at other tyrosine residues present in the protein (Tyr-125, Tyr-133, and Tyr-136). This is the first report of increased 3NT levels of a specific tyrosine in a PD model and the first use of MRM mass spectrometry to quantify changes in 3NT modifications at specific sites within a target protein.",M1
19697909,"Structural coupling of a tyrosine side chain with the non-heme iron center in photosystem II as revealed by light-induced Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy.The non-heme iron is located between the quinone electron acceptors, QA and QB, in photosystem II (PSII), and together with its bicarbonate ligand, it regulates the electron and proton transfer reactions of quinone acceptors. In this study, we have investigated the structural coupling of a nearby <e>Tyr</e> residue with the non-heme iron center using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Light-induced Fe2+/Fe3+ FTIR difference spectra of PSII core complexes from unlabeled and [4-13C]Tyr-labeled Thermosynechococcus elongatus revealed that the CO stretching (nuCO) bands of a Tyr side chain are located at 1253 and 1241 cm(-1) in the Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, respectively. Upon deuteration, both nuCO bands were upshifted by 11-12 cm(-1). Taking into account the criteria for determining the hydrogen bond structure of a Tyr side chain from infrared bands reported previously [Takahashi, R., and Noguchi, T. (2007) J. Phys. Chem. B 111, 13833-13844] and the results of DFT calculations of model complexes of p-cresol hydrogen-bonded with bicarbonate, we interpreted the observed nuCO bands and their deuteration effects as indicating that one Tyr side chain with a hydrogen bond donor-acceptor form is strongly coupled to the non-heme iron. From the X-ray structures of PSII core complexes, it is proposed that either D1-Y246 or D2-Y244 provides a hydrogen bond to the oxygen of the bicarbonate ligand but the other Tyr does not directly interact with bicarbonate. The Tyr residue coupled to the non-heme iron may play a key role in the regulatory function of the iron-bicarbonate center by stabilizing the bicarbonate ligand and forming a rigid hydrogen bond network around the non-heme ion.",M1
19664587,"Enzymatic characterization and mutational studies of TruD--the fifth family of pseudouridine synthases.Pseudouridine (Psi) is formed through isomerization of uridine (U) catalyzed by a class of enzymes called pseudouridine synthases (PsiS). TruD is the fifth family of PsiS. Studies of the first four families (TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluA) of PsiS reveal a conserved Asp and <e>Tyr</e> are critical for catalysis. However, in TruD family, the tyrosine is not conserved. In this study, we measured the enzymatic parameters for TruD in Escherichia coli, and carried out enzymatic assays for a series of single, double, and triple TruD mutants. Our studies indicate that a Glu, strictly conserved in only TruD family is likely to be the general base in TruD. We also proposed a possible distinct mechanism of TruD-catalyzed Psi formation compared to the first four families.",M1
19662334,"Application of SAIL phenylalanine and tyrosine with alternative isotope-labeling patterns for protein structure determination.The extensive collection of NOE constraint data involving the aromatic ring signals is essential for accurate protein structure determination, although it is often hampered in practice by the pervasive signal overlapping and tight spin couplings for aromatic rings. We have prepared various types of stereo-array isotope labeled phenylalanines (epsilon- and zeta-SAIL Phe) and tyrosine (epsilon-SAIL <e>Tyr</e>) to overcome these problems (Torizawa et al. 2005), and proven that these SAIL amino acids provide dramatic spectral simplification and sensitivity enhancement for the aromatic ring NMR signals. In addition to these SAIL aromatic amino acids, we recently synthesized delta-SAIL Phe and delta-SAIL Tyr, which allow us to observe and assign delta-(13)C/(1)H signals very efficiently. Each of the various types of SAIL Phe and SAIL Tyr yields well-resolved resonances for the delta-, epsilon- or zeta-(13)C/(1)H signals, respectively, which can readily be assigned by simple and robust pulse sequences. Since the delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-proton signals of Phe/Tyr residues give rise to complementary NOE constraints, the concomitant use of various types of SAIL-Phe and SAIL-Tyr would generate more accurate protein structures, as compared to those obtained by using conventional uniformly (13)C, (15)N-double labeled proteins. We illustrated this with the case of an 18.2 kDa protein, Escherichia coli peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase b (EPPIb), and concluded that the combined use of zeta-SAIL Phe and epsilon-SAIL Tyr would be practically the best choice for protein structural determinations.",M1
19655253,"Conformational similarity in the activation of caspase-3 and -7 revealed by the unliganded and inhibited structures of caspase-7.Caspase-mediated apoptosis has important roles in normal cell differentiation and aging and in many diseases including cancer, neuromuscular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, modulation of caspase activity and conformational states is of therapeutic importance. We report crystal structures of a new unliganded conformation of caspase-7 and the inhibited caspase-7 with the tetrapeptide Ac-YVAD-Cho. Different conformational states and mechanisms for substrate recognition have been proposed based on unliganded structures of the redundant apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and -7. The current study shows that the executioner caspase-3 and -7 have similar conformations for the unliganded active site as well as the inhibitor-bound active site. The new unliganded caspase-7 structure exhibits the tyrosine flipping mechanism in which the Tyr230 has rotated to block entry to the S2 binding site similar to the active site conformation of unliganded caspase-3. The inhibited structure of caspase-7/YVAD shows that the P4 <e>Tyr</e> binds the S4 region specific to polar residues at the expense of a main chain hydrogen bond between the P4 amide and carbonyl oxygen of caspase-7 Gln 276, which is similar to the caspase-3 complex. This new knowledge of the structures and conformational states of unliganded and inhibited caspases will be important for the design of drugs to modulate caspase activity and apoptosis.",M1
19655092,"Approaches for the measurement of solvent exposure in proteins by 19F NMR.Fluorine NMR is a useful tool to probe protein folding, conformation and local topology owing to the sensitivity of the chemical shift to the local electrostatic environment.

We critically compare approaches to assess topology and solvent exposure via solvent isotope shifts, (19)F spin-lattice relaxation rates, (1)H-(19)F nuclear Overhauser effects, and paramagnetic shifts and relaxation rates from dissolved oxygen. Both the solvent isotope shifts and paramagnetic shifts from dissolved oxygen sensitively reflect solvent exposed surface areas.",M1
19639172,"Tyrosine-phosphorylation of the 12th armadillo-repeat of beta-catenin is associated with cadherin dysfunction in human cancer.Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, an intracytoplasmic cadherin-binding protein, causes disruption of the cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system in cancer cells. We identified that the c-erbB-2 protein activated by TGFalpha was capable of binding to the 12th armadillo repeat (arm12) of beta-catenin with increased phosphorylation-state level. We produced a monoclonal antibody, 4G7, which recognizes a phosphorylated-tyrosine residue (<e>Tyr</e>-654) located at arm12 of beta-catenin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the arm12 was detected after stimulation with TGFalpha in TMK-1. Immunoprecipitation analyses using 4G7, anti-beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, the c-erbB-2 gene product and phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of the arm12 was closely correlated with dissociation between E-cadherin/beta-catenin and alpha-catenin or the c-erbB-2 gene product, but not with dissociation between beta-catenin and E-cadherin. Immunocytochemical staining of TMK-1 cells using the 4G7 antibody revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the arm12 was localized at cell-cell contact sites of cancer cells transiently and only after TGFalpha treatment. Immunohistochemical localization of the 4G7 antibody was observed in cancer cells at the invasive front where they detached from cancer nests. These findings indicated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of arm12 is a key marker of cadherin dysfunction and the 4G7 antibody may be useful in screening for a beta-catenin phosphorylation ligand or tyrosine kinases.",M1
19631231,"Nanoimages show disruption of tubulin polymerization by chlorpyrifos oxon: implications for neurotoxicity.Organophosphorus agents cause cognitive deficits and depression in some people. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which organophosphorus agents cause these disorders is by modification of proteins in the brain. One such protein could be tubulin. Tubulin polymerizes to make the microtubules that transport cell components to nerve axons. The goal of the present work was to measure the effect of the organophosphorus agent chlorpyrifos oxon on tubulin polymerization. An additional goal was to identify the amino acids covalently modified by chlorpyrifos oxon in microtubule polymers and to compare them to the amino acids modified in unpolymerized tubulin dimers. Purified bovine tubulin (0.1 mM) was treated with 0.005-0.1 mM chlorpyrifos oxon for 30 min at room temperature and then polymerized by addition of 1 mM GTP to generate microtubules. Microtubules were visualized by atomic force microscopy. Chlorpyrifos oxon-modified residues were identified by tandem ion trap electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. Nanoimaging showed that low concentrations (0.005 and 0.01 mM) of chlorpyrifos oxon yielded short, thin microtubules. A concentration of 0.025 mM stimulated polymerization, while high concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 mM) caused aggregation. Of the 17 tyrosines covalently modified by chlorpyrifos oxon in unpolymerized tubulin dimers, only 2 tyrosines were labeled in polymerized microtubules. The two labeled tyrosines in polymerized tubulin were <e>Tyr</e> 103 in EDAANNYR of alpha tubulin, and Tyr 281 in GSQQYR of beta tubulin. In conclusion, chlorpyrifos oxon binding to tubulin disrupts tubulin polymerization. These results may lead to an understanding of the neurotoxicity of organophosphorus agents.",M1
19626632,"Detection of cervical metastases with (11)C-tyrosine PET in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or oropharynx: A comparison with (18)F-FDG PET.BACKGROUND: A disadvantage of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in head and neck cancer is that (18)F-FDG uptake is not specific to malignant tissue. To provide an alternative, radiolabeled amino acids such as L-1-[(11)C]-tyrosine ((11)C-<e>TYR</e>), were introduced because these are less avidly metabolized by inflammatory cells. METHODS: In this prospective study, we compared both (11)C-TYR PET and (18)F-FDG PET performance in detecting cervical metastases in 27 patients with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of oral cavity or oropharynx. RESULTS: (11)C-TYR PET sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting nodal metastases were 33%, 100%, and 81%, respectively. With respect to (18)F-FDG PET, these figures were 67%, 97%, and 89%, respectively. Neck metastases not detected by (11)C-TYR PET were camouflaged by high tracer uptake by salivary glands. CONCLUSIONS: Because of bilateral accumulation of (11)C-TYR in salivary glands, (11)C-TYR PET is not suitable to replace (18)F-FDG PET in staging SCC of oral cavity and oropharynx.",M1
19625508,"An integrin-contactin complex regulates CNS myelination by differential Fyn phosphorylation.The understanding of how adhesion molecules mediate the axon-glial interactions in the CNS that ensure target-dependent survival of oligodendrocytes and initiate myelination remains incomplete. Here, we investigate how signals from adhesion molecules can be integrated to regulate these initial steps of myelination. We first demonstrate that the Ig superfamily molecule contactin is associated in oligodendrocytes with integrins, extracellular matrix receptors that regulate target-dependent survival by amplification of growth factor signaling. This amplification is inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of contactin in oligodendrocytes. In contrast, the presence of L1-Fc, the extracellular portion of a contactin ligand expressed on axons, enhanced survival and additionally promoted myelination in cocultures of neurons and oligodendrocytes. We further demonstrate that the signals from contactin and integrin are integrated by differential phosphorylation of the Src family kinase Fyn. Integrin induced dephosphorylation of the inhibitory <e>Tyr</e>-531, whereas contactin increased phosphorylation of both Tyr-531 and the activating Tyr-420. The combined effect is an enhanced activity of Fyn and also a dynamic regulation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of Fyn, as required for normal cell adhesion and spreading. We conclude, therefore, that a novel integrin/contactin complex coordinates signals from extracellular matrix and the axonal surface to regulate both oligodendrocyte survival and myelination by controlling Fyn activity.",M1
19621048,"[(18)F-labeled tyrosine derivatives: synthesis and experimental studies on accumulation in tumors and abscesses]Tyrosine derivatives labeled with a short-living fluorine 18 isotope (T(1/2) 110 min), namely 2-[(18)F]fluoro-L-tyrosine (FTYR) and O-(2'-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET), promising radiopharmaceutical products (RPP) for positron emission tomography (PET), were obtained by asymmetric synthesis. Accumulation of FTYR and FET in the rat tumor  35 rat glioma  and in abscesses induced in Vistar mouse muscles was studied and compared with that of a well-known glycolysis radiotracer 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). It was shown that the relative accumulation indices of amino acid RPP were considerably lower than those of FDG. At the same time, tumor/muscle ratios were high enough (2.9 for FET and 3.9 for FTYR 120 min after injection) for reliable tumor visualization. The data obtained indicated a possibility in principle to use FTYR and FET for differentiated PET diagnostics of brain tumors and inflammation lesions. Of the tyrosine derivatives studied, FET seems to be the most promising agent due to a simple and easily automated method of preparation based on direct nucleophilic substitution of the leaving tosyloxy group of an enantiomerically pure Ni-(S)-BPB-(S)-<e>Tyr</e>(CH2CH2OTs) precursor by an activated [(18)F]fluoride.",M1
19604476,"Amidation of bioactive peptides: the structure of the lyase domain of the amidating enzyme.Many neuropeptides and peptide hormones require amidation of their carboxy terminal for full biological activity. The enzyme peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.2.5) catalyzes the second and last step of this reaction, N-dealkylation of the peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine to generate the alpha-amidated peptide and glyoxylate. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the PAL catalytic core (PALcc) alone and in complex with the nonpeptidic substrate alpha-hydroxyhippuric acid. The structures show that PAL folds as a six-bladed beta-propeller. The active site is formed by a Zn(II) ion coordinated by three histidine residues; the substrate binds to this site with its alpha-hydroxyl group coordinated to the Zn(II) ion. The structures also reveal a tyrosine residue (<e>Tyr</e>(654)) at the active site as the catalytic base for hydroxyl deprotonation, an unusual role for tyrosine. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on this structural data and validated by biochemical analysis of site-directed PALcc mutants.",M1
19602568,"Immunological mimicry of PrPC-PrPSc interactions: antibody-induced PrP misfolding.Prion diseases are associated with the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) to an abnormal protease-resistant conformational isoform (PrP(Sc)) by template-directed conversion. The interaction between PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) is mediated by specific sites which have been mapped to six putative 'binding and conversion domains' (PrP-BCD) through peptide and antibody competition studies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the bityrosine motif <e>Tyr</e>-Tyr-Arg (YYR) specifically recognize PrP(Sc) and other misfolded PrP species. Here, we report that select bead-bound PrP-BCD mAbs induce exposure of bityrosine epitopes on mouse brain PrP. By competition immunoprecipitation, we show that PrP-BCD mAb-induced bityrosine exposure occurs at alpha-helices 1 and 3. However, PrP-BCD mAb-induced PrP(C) misfolding is not accompanied by beta-sheet dissociation, a key event in PrP(C) conversion to PrP(Sc), and is not associated with acquisition of protease resistance, or the capacity to recruit additional molecules of PrP. Our data suggest that mAb mimics of the physical interaction of PrP(C) with PrP(Sc) can induce unfolding of specific PrP domains, but that subsequent processes (including the energetically unfavorable beta-sheet dissociation) effect isoform conversion in prion disease.",M1
19595710,"Disease-dependent reciprocal phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of c-Met/HGF receptor contributes disease retardation of a transgenic mouse model of ALS.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motoneurons. We have demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) attenuates loss of both spinal and brainstem motoneurons of ALS model mice expressing mutated human SOD1(G93A) (G93A). This study was designed to assess disease-dependent regulatory mechanisms of c-Met/HGF receptor (c-Met) activation in the facial motoneurons of G93A mice. Using double transgenic mice expressing HGF and mutated SOD1(G93A) (G93A/HGF), we showed that phosphorylation of c-Met tyrosine residues at positions 1230, 1234 and 1235 (phospho-<e>Tyr</e>), and thereby its activation, was slightly evident in G93A and highly obvious in G93A/HGF mice (but absent in WT and HGF-Tg mice). Phosphorylation of the c-Met serine residue at position 985 (phospho-Ser), a residue involved in the negative regulation of its activation, was evident in WT and HGF-Tg mice. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is capable of dephosphorylating c-Met phospho-serine, is upregulated in the facial motoneurons of G93A and G93A/HGF mice compared with WT and HGF-Tg mice. Thus, c-Met activation is reciprocally regulated by phosphorylation between c-Met serine and tyrosine residues through PP2A induction in the presence or absence of mutant SOD1 expression, and HGF functions more efficiently in ALS and ALS-related diseases.",M1
19590958,"Mechanism of increased tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>(99)) phosphorylation of calmodulin during hypoxia in the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets: the role of nNOS-derived nitric oxide.The present study aims to investigate the mechanism of calmodulin modification during hypoxia and tests the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced increase in Tyr(99) phosphorylation of calmodulin in the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets is mediated by NO derived from nNOS. Fifteen piglets were divided into normoxic (Nx, n = 5), hypoxic (Hx, F(i)O(2) of 0.07 for 1 h, n = 5) and hypoxic-pretreated with nNOSi (Hx-nNOSi, n = 5) groups. nNOS inhibitor I (selectivity &gt;2,500 vs. eNOS and &gt;500 vs. iNOS) was administered (0.4 mg/kg, I.V.) 30 min prior to hypoxia. Cortical membranes were isolated and tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr(99) and total) of calmodulin determined by Western blot using anti-phospho-(pTyr(99))-calmodulin and anti-pTyr antibodies. Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, analyzed by densitometry and expressed as absorbance. The pTyr(99) calmodulin (ODxmm(2)) was 78.55 +/- 10.76 in Nx, 165.05 +/- 12.26 in Hx (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Nx) and 96.97 +/- 13.18 in Hx-nNOSi (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Hx, P = NS vs. Nx). Expression of total tyrosine phosphorylated calmodulin was 69.24 +/- 13.69 in Nx, 156.17 +/- 16.34 in Hx (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Nx) and 74.18 +/- 3.9 in Hx-nNOSi (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Hx, P = NS vs. Nx). The data show that administration of nNOS inhibitor prevented the hypoxia-induced increased Tyr(99) phosphorylation of calmodulin. Total tyrosine phosphorylation of calmodulin was similar to Tyr(99) phosphorylation. We conclude that the mechanism of hypoxia-induced modification (Tyr(99) phosphorylation) of calmodulin is mediated by NO derived from nNOS. We speculate that Tyr(99) phosphorylated calmodulin, as compared to non-phosphorylated, binds with a higher affinity at the calmodulin binding site of nNOS leading to increased activation of nNOS and increased generation of NO.",M1
19589834,"Genetic and biochemical identification of the chorismate mutase from Corynebacterium glutamicum.Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyses the rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate and is also the first and the key enzyme that diverges the shikimate pathway to either tryptophan (Trp) or phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>). Corynebacterium glutamicum is one of the most important amino acid producers for the fermentation industry and has been widely investigated. However, the gene(s) encoding CM has not been experimentally identified in C. glutamicum. In this study, the ncgl0819 gene, which was annotated as 'conserved hypothetical protein' in the C. glutamicum genome, was genetically characterized to be essential for growth in minimal medium, and a mutant deleted of ncgl0819 was a Phe and Tyr auxotroph. Genetic cloning and expression of ncgl0819 in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of a new protein (NCgl0819) having CM activity. It was concluded that ncgl0819 encoded the CM of C. glutamicum (CM0819). CM0819 was demonstrated to be a homodimer and is a new member of the monofunctional CMs of the AroQ structural class. The CM0819 activity was not affected by Phe, Tyr or Trp. Two 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthases (DS0950 and DS2098, formerly NCgl0950 and NCgl2098) had been previously identified from C. glutamicum. CM0819 significantly stimulated DAHP synthase (DS2098) activity. Physical interaction between CM0819 and DS2098 was observed. When CM0819 was present, DS2098 activity was subject to allosteric inhibition by chorismate and prephenate. Conserved hypothetical proteins homologous to CM0819 were identified in all known Corynebacterium genomes, suggesting a universal occurrence of CM0819-like CMs in the genus Corynebacterium.",M1
19588122,"Plasma tryptophan and tyrosine levels are independent risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients.AIM: The pathophysiology of delirium remains elusive though neurotransmitters and their precursor large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) may play a role. This pilot study investigated whether alterations of tryptophan (Trp), phenylalanine (Phe), and tyrosine (<e>Tyr</e>) plasma levels were associated with a higher risk of transitioning to delirium in critically ill patients. METHODS: Plasma LNAA concentrations were determined on days 1 and 3 in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients from the MENDS randomized controlled trial (dexmedetomidine vs. lorazepam sedation). Three independent variables were calculated by dividing plasma concentrations of Trp, Phe, and Tyr by the sum of all other LNAA concentrations. Delirium was assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). Markov regression models were used to analyze independent associations between plasma LNAA ratios and transition to delirium after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The 97 patients included in the analysis had a high severity of illness (median APACHE II, 28; IQR, 24-32). After adjusting for confounders, only high or very low tryptophan/LNAA ratios (p = 0.0003), and tyrosine/LNAA ratios (p = 0.02) were associated with increased risk of transitioning to delirium, while phenylalanine levels were not (p = 0.27). Older age, higher APACHE II scores and increasing fentanyl exposure were also associated with higher probabilities of transitioning to delirium. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, plasma tryptophan/LNAA and tyrosine/LNAA ratios were associated with transition to delirium in MV patients, suggesting that alterations of amino acids may be important in the pathogenesis of ICU delirium. Future studies evaluating the role of amino acid precursors of neurotransmitters are warranted in critically ill patients.",M1
19587234,"Structure of human Rad51 protein filament from molecular modeling and site-specific linear dichroism spectroscopy.To get mechanistic insight into the DNA strand-exchange reaction of homologous recombination, we solved a filament structure of a human Rad51 protein, combining molecular modeling with experimental data. We build our structure on reported structures for central and N-terminal parts of pure (uncomplexed) Rad51 protein by aid of linear dichroism spectroscopy, providing angular orientations of substituted tyrosine residues of Rad51-dsDNA filaments in solution. The structure, validated by comparison with an electron microscopy density map and results from mutation analysis, is proposed to represent an active solution structure of the nucleo-protein complex. An inhomogeneously stretched double-stranded DNA fitted into the filament emphasizes the strategic positioning of 2 putative DNA-binding loops in a way that allows us speculate about their possibly distinct roles in nucleo-protein filament assembly and DNA strand-exchange reaction. The model suggests that the extension of a single-stranded DNA molecule upon binding of Rad51 is ensured by intercalation of <e>Tyr</e>-232 of the L1 loop, which might act as a docking tool, aligning protein monomers along the DNA strand upon filament assembly. Arg-235, also sitting on L1, is in the right position to make electrostatic contact with the phosphate backbone of the other DNA strand. The L2 loop position and its more ordered compact conformation makes us propose that this loop has another role, as a binding site for an incoming double-stranded DNA. Our filament structure and spectroscopic approach open the possibility of analyzing details along the multistep path of the strand-exchange reaction.",M1
19583775,"Tyrosine nitration in the human leucocyte antigen-G-binding domain of the Ig-like transcript 2 protein.Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) is a suppressive receptor that participates in the control of the autoimmune reactivity. This action is usually carried out in a proinflammatory microenvironment where there is a high production of free radicals and NO. However, little is known regarding whether these conditions modify the protein or affect its suppressive functions. The present study aimed to investigate the suppressive response of the ILT2 receptor under oxidative stress. To address this topic, we treated the ILT2-expressing natural killer cell line, NKL, with the NO donor N-(4-[1-(3-aminopropyl)-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino]butyl)propane-1,3-diamine (DETA-NO). We observed that DETA-NO caused ILT2 protein nitration. MS analysis of the chimeric recombinant human ILT2-Fc protein after treatment with the peroxynitrite donor 3-(morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride) (SIN-1) showed the nitration of Tyr35, Tyr76 and Tyr99, which are involved in human leucocyte antigen-G binding. This modification is selective because other <e>Tyr</e> residues were not modified by SIN-1. Recombinant human ILT2-Fc treated with SIN-1 bound a significantly higher quantity of human leucocyte antigen-G than untreated recombinant human ILT2-Fc. DETA-NO did not modify ILT2 mRNA expression or protein expression at the cell surface. Preincubation of NKL cells with DETA-NO decreased the cytotoxic lysis of K562-human leucocyte antigen-G1 cells compared to untreated NKL cells (P &lt; 0.05) but increased cytotoxicity against K562-pcDNA cells (P &lt; 0.05). Intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation produced after human leucocyte antigen-G binding was not affected by DETA-NO cell pretreatment. These results support the hypothesis that the ILT2human leucocyte antigen-G interaction should have a central role in tolerance under oxidative stress conditions when other tolerogenic mechanisms are inhibited.",M1
19578373,"Histone levels are regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitylation-dependent proteolysis.Histone levels are tightly regulated to prevent harmful effects such as genomic instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents due to the accumulation of these highly basic proteins when DNA replication slows down or stops. Although chromosomal histones are stable, excess (non-chromatin bound) histones are rapidly degraded in a Rad53 (radiation sensitive 53) kinase-dependent manner in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we demonstrate that excess histones associate with Rad53 in vivo and seem to undergo modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation, before their proteolysis by the proteasome. We have identified the <e>Tyr</e> 99 residue of histone H3 as being critical for the efficient ubiquitylation and degradation of this histone. We have also identified the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) Ubc4 and Ubc5, as well as the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Tom1 (temperature dependent organization in mitotic nucleus 1), as enzymes involved in the ubiquitylation of excess histones. Regulated histone proteolysis has major implications for the maintenance of epigenetic marks on chromatin, genomic stability and the packaging of sperm DNA.",M1
19576946,"Dietary catechol causes increased oxidative DNA damage in the livers of mice treated with acetaminophen.We have shown that direct reaction of catechol with nitric oxide (NO) results in generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RNS) through semiquinone radical formation, leading to oxidative DNA damage in rat forestomach. In the present study, we investigated whether dietary catechol systemically exerts the same effects under NO-rich circumstances, when given before and during induction of inflammatory lesions. Male ICR mice were treated with or without 0.8% catechol in the diet for 2 weeks followed by acetaminophen (APAP) administration at a dose of 300mg/kg by single i.p. injection. Along with several indicators of APAP-induced hepatitis, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels and immunohistochemistry for 3-nitrotyrosine (NO(2)<e>Tyr</e>) in the livers were examined at 1.5, 4 and 24h after APAP injection. 8-OHdG was significantly increased at 24h in the co-treatment group, but not with either catechol or APAP alone. Elevation of serum ALT and AST activities, decrease of reduced glutathione levels and histopathological liver changes were observed to the same extents in both APAP-treated groups. In view of the finding of positive hepatocytes for NO(2)Tyr prior to generation of 8-OHdG, the process of oxidative DNA damage might involve RNS formation. Precise quantitative analysis of NO(2)Tyr by means of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in an additional study with the same experimental protocol confirmed increase of RNS due to the reaction of catechol with NO produced after APAP-induced hepatitis. The overall data imply that antioxidants with a catechol structure can cause oxidative DNA damage under inflammatory conditions.",M1
19570985,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 tyrosine 1175 signaling controls VEGF-induced von Willebrand factor release from endothelial cells via phospholipase C-gamma 1- and protein kinase A-dependent pathways.There is increasing evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to inflammation independent of its angiogenic functions. Targeting some of the components in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) effectively inhibits VEGF-induced inflammation, but little is known about how VEGF regulates WPB exocytosis. In this study, we showed that VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGFR1, is responsible for VEGF-induced release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a major marker of WPBs. This is in good contrast to VEGF-stimulated interleukin-6 release from endothelium, which is selectively mediated through VEGFR1. We further demonstrated that VEGFR2-initiated phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCgamma1)/calcium signaling is important but insufficient for full vWF release, suggesting the possible participation of another effector pathway. We found that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is required for full vWF release. Importantly, a single mutation of <e>Tyr</e>(1175) in the C terminus of VEGFR2, a tyrosine residue crucial for embryonic vasculogenesis, abolished vWF release, concomitant with defective activations of both PLCgamma1 and PKA. These data suggest that Tyr(1175) mediates both PLCgamma1-dependent and PKA-dependent signaling pathways. Taken together, our results not only reveal a novel Tyr(1175)-mediated signaling pathway but also highlight a potentially new therapeutic target for the management of vascular inflammation.",M1
19564401,"Motor-dependent microtubule disassembly driven by tubulin tyrosination.In cells, stable microtubules (MTs) are covalently modified by a carboxypeptidase, which removes the C-terminal <e>Tyr</e> residue of alpha-tubulin. The significance of this selective detyrosination of MTs is not understood. In this study, we report that tubulin detyrosination in fibroblasts inhibits MT disassembly. This inhibition is relieved by overexpression of the depolymerizing motor mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK). Conversely, suppression of MCAK expression prevents disassembly of normal tyrosinated MTs in fibroblasts. Detyrosination of MTs suppresses the activity of MCAK in vitro, apparently as the result of a decreased affinity of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-inorganic phosphate- and ADP-bound forms of MCAK for the MT lattice. Detyrosination also impairs MT disassembly in neurons and inhibits the activity of the neuronal depolymerizing motor KIF2A in vitro. These results indicate that MT depolymerizing motors are directly inhibited by the detyrosination of tubulin, resulting in the stabilization of cellular MTs. Detyrosination of transiently stabilized MTs may give rise to persistent subpopulations of disassembly-resistant polymers to sustain subcellular cytoskeletal differentiation.",M1
20460655,"Developmental phenotypic-genotypic associations of tyrosinase and melanocortin 1 receptor genes with changing profiles in chicken plumage pigmentation.The tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) genes have been accepted as major genes involved in the plumage pigmentation of chickens. The co-segregation of plumage coloration and sequence polymorphism in TYR and MC1R genes were investigated using an intercross between black and white plumage color types of the Dongxiang blue-shelled chicken. Profiles of plumage color changing and genes expression levels of TYR and MC1R were observed from hatch to 112 d of age using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Intercrossed offspring were classified by phenotypes of plumage colors. The phenotypes of black and amber chicks with genotypes of E_C_ exhibited a black feather pattern, whereas white, gray, and buff chicks with genotypes of E_cc and eecc belonged to the white feather pattern. Although TYR in cooperation with MC1R determined the coloration feather patterns, the different phenotypes did not correspond completely with the genotypes. During the period studied, plumage phenotype changed dramatically, and the buff and gray down were gradually replaced by whiteness feathers. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR studies showed that 1) expression levels of TYR declined dramatically with age, and expression at hatch was highest (P&lt;0.01) during the ages studied; 2) expression level of MC1R was higher at 28 d than at younger and older ages; and 3) expression of TYR in chickens carrying E/E and E/e alleles on MC1R loci were higher than those carrying e/e alleles from hatch to 28 d.",M2
20447099,"Tyrosinase gene (<e>TYR</e>) mutations in Chinese patients with oculocutaneous albinism type 1.BACKGROUND: To identify the sequence variants of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene in Chinese families with oculocutaneous albinism. METHODS: Three families with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 and 95 unrelated healthy Chinese individuals with normal pigmentation were screened for mutations in the TYR gene by direct sequencing. Computational algorithms were used to characterize the biological significance of the mutants. RESULTS: Four previously reported mutations (R299C, R299H, W400L and frame-shift c.930insC) and one novel mutation (F214del) were identified, and probands had homozygous or compound heterozygous TYR mutant alleles. None of the mutants were identified among the 95 normal control subjects. Computational analysis predicted that the R299C mutant inactivates the tyrosinase enzyme by misfolding of protein tertiary structure and/or retention of the misfolded tyrosinase within the endoplasmic reticulum, and F214del causes dysfunction of tyrosine enzyme by affecting the copper binding sites and altering substrate orientation and electronic transfers during catalytic reactions for melanosynthesis. CONCLUSION: We have identified five different TYR mutations, including one novel mutation, which caused oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in Chinese. Further analysis of the patients will be useful to determine the effects of these mutations on the tyrosinase activities.",M2
20410501,"Variant of <e>TYR</e> and autoimmunity susceptibility loci in generalized vitiligo.BACKGROUND: Generalized vitiligo is an autoimmune disease characterized by melanocyte loss, which results in patchy depigmentation of skin and hair, and is associated with an elevated risk of other autoimmune diseases. METHODS: To identify generalized vitiligo susceptibility loci, we conducted a genomewide association study. We genotyped 579,146 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1514 patients with generalized vitiligo who were of European-derived white (CEU) ancestry and compared the genotypes with publicly available control genotypes from 2813 CEU persons. We then tested 50 SNPs in two replication sets, one comprising 677 independent CEU patients and 1106 CEU controls and the other comprising 183 CEU simplex trios with generalized vitiligo and 332 CEU multiplex families. RESULTS: We detected significant associations between generalized vitiligo and SNPs at several loci previously associated with other autoimmune diseases. These included genes encoding major-histocompatibility-complex class I molecules (P=9.05x10(-23)) and class II molecules (P=4.50x10(-34)), PTPN22 (P=1.31x10(-7)), LPP (P=1.01x10(-11)), IL2RA (P=2.78x10(-9)), UBASH3A (P=1.26x10(-9)), and C1QTNF6 (P=2.21x10(-16)). We also detected associations between generalized vitiligo and SNPs in two additional immune-related loci, RERE (P=7.07x10(-15)) and GZMB (P=3.44x10(-8)), and in a locus containing TYR (P=1.60x10(-18)), encoding tyrosinase. CONCLUSIONS: We observed associations between generalized vitiligo and markers implicating multiple genes, some associated with other autoimmune diseases and one (TYR) that may mediate target-cell specificity and indicate a mutually exclusive relationship between susceptibility to vitiligo and susceptibility to melanoma.",M2
19865097,"A comprehensive analysis reveals mutational spectra and common alleles in Chinese patients with oculocutaneous albinism.Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous recessive disorder with hypopigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes. At least 16 genes have been identified as causative genes for human OCA. No comprehensive analysis has been conducted to study the spectral distribution of OCA in Chinese patients. We screened 127 unrelated and unselected Chinese OCA patients for mutations in the <e>TYR</e>, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, and HPS1 genes. We found that the spectrum of mutational genes and alleles of OCA is population specific. OCA1 is the most common (70.1% of cases) form of Chinese OCA, whereas OCA2, OCA4, and HPS1 account for 10.2%, 12.6%, and 1.6%, respectively. No apparent pathological mutation of TYRP1 has been found. Thirty-eight previously unreported mutational alleles were identified from these OCA patients and were not found in 100 nonalbinism subjects. Of the TYR mutational alleles, 81.1% were clustered on exons 1 and 2. Ten common alleles account for 74.6% of the mutational TYR alleles in Chinese OCA1 patients. The p.D160H allele accounts for 55.6% of the mutational SLC45A2 alleles in Chinese OCA4 patients. These results provide useful information for the establishment of an optimized strategy of gene diagnosis and genetic counseling of Chinese OCA patients.",M2
19843244,"Melanin precursors prevent premature age-related and noise-induced hearing loss in albino mice.Strial melanocytes are required for normal development and correct functioning of the cochlea. Hearing deficits have been reported in albino individuals from different species, although melanin appears to be not essential for normal auditory function. We have analyzed the auditory brainstem responses (ABR) of two transgenic mice: YRT2, carrying the entire mouse tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) gene expression-domain and undistinguishable from wild-type pigmented animals; and TyrTH, non-pigmented but ectopically expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) in melanocytes, which generate the precursor metabolite, L-DOPA, but not melanin. We show that young albino mice present a higher prevalence of profound sensorineural deafness and a poorer recovery of auditory thresholds after noise-exposure than transgenic mice. Hearing loss was associated with absence of cochlear melanin or its precursor metabolites and latencies of the central auditory pathway were unaltered. In summary, albino mice show impaired hearing responses during ageing and after noise damage when compared to YRT2 and TyrTH transgenic mice, which do not show the albino-associated ABR alterations. These results demonstrate that melanin precursors, such as L-DOPA, have a protective role in the mammalian cochlea in age-related and noise-induced hearing loss.",M2
19833500,"Near-infrared luminescence quenching method for the detection of phenolic compounds using N-acetyl-L-cysteine-protected gold nanoparticles-tyrosinase hybrid material.A rapid and simple near-infrared (NIR) luminescence quenching method for the detection of phenolic compounds based on combining the unique property of N-acetyl-L-cysteine-protected gold nanoparticles (NAC-AuNPs) and tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) enzymatic reactions is described. This method relies on the luminescence quenching of NAC-AuNPs-tyrosinase (NAC-AuNPs-Tyr) hybrid material by phenolic compounds. The quinone intermediates produced from enzymatic catalytic oxidation of phenolic compounds were believed to play a major role in the luminescence quenching. Dynamic quenching mechanism was confirmed by using time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. Optimization of the experimental parameters including the concentration of NAC-AuNPs-Tyr (20 microg/mL), excitation wavelength (450nm), pH (6.0), and temperature (20 degrees C) has been determined. A linear range 0.5 microM to 1.0 mM and a detection limit 0.1 microM of catechol were obtained under optimal conditions. The sensitivity of different phenolic compounds was compared and follows the trend: catechol&gt;p-cresol&gt;phenol. The proposed NIR luminescence quenching method exhibits high sensitivity, good repeatability, and long-term stability, demonstrating potential for further development to NIR luminescence phenol biosensors.",M2
19816942,"Long term presence of a single predominant tyrosinase-specific T-cell clone associated with disease control in a patient with metastatic melanoma.In an earlier study, we described a patient who developed an anti-tyrosinase T-cell response leading to long-term tumor control. Here we analyzed this response with regard to T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta family usage and clonality in order to further elucidate the nature of the T cell response in this patient. For identification of expanded specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones, tetramer enrichment of tyrosinase reactive T-cells was followed by comparative quantitative reverse transcribed PCR (qRT PCR) quantification of all TCR Vbeta-families and sequencing of family Vbeta4 elevated in the enriched fraction. The predominant specific clone was quantified by clonotypic qRT PCR in multiple samples from blood, bone marrow, and tumor tissue. FACS analyses with staining of <e>TYR</e>.A2 and TCR Vbeta4 were performed. Epitope specific enrichment revealed an isolated increase of Vbeta-family 4. FACS analysis showed a shift of specific CTLs to Vbeta-family 4 during tumor regression with a maximum of 80% of all TYR.A2 specific cells belonging to this family. Sequencing revealed a single predominant clone against polyclonal background coding for identical CDR3 loops. The predominant clone was highly expressed in bone marrow and tumor tissue, and was detectable in blood over a period of ten years. Considering the results of previous studies showing a specific effector phenotype in blood and a specific memory compartment in bone marrow of this patient, this data implicate the predominant clone featured all attributes of a sufficient CTL response including homing capacity and memory formation resulting in long term clonal persistence and tumor control.",M2
19809274,"Melanotic Xp11 translocation renal cancer: a case with PSF-TFE3 gene fusion and up-regulation of melanogenetic transcripts.Melanotic Xp11 translocation renal cancer is a recently recognized aggressive epithelioid neoplasm with features overlapping between PEComa, carcinoma, and melanoma. We describe morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of a melanotic Xp11 translocation renal cancer occurring in an 18-year-old girl and perform molecular genetic studies to analyze its genetic alterations and related melanogenetic activities. The tumor was composed of solid nests of epithelioid cells bearing abundant clear to finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and separated by delicate vascular septa. Finely granular and nonrefractile brown melanin pigments, highlighted by Fontana-Masson stain, were scattered through the tumor. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor was diffusely and strongly labeled by TFE3 and focally stained by HMB45 in a patchy pattern. In contrast, all other applied immunomarkers, including cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, CD10, S-100, smooth muscle actin, desmin, c-kit, CD68, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, were nonreactive to the tumor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and validating sequencing demonstrated PSF-TFE3 gene fusion, a novel exon composition juxtaposing PSF exon 9 to TFE3 exon 5. Up-regulations of melanogenesis-associated regulators, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>), and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), were identified in the tumor by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The morphologic and immunohistochemical discrepancies between this intriguing melanotic tumor and other documented renal cell carcinomas bearing identical PSF-TFE3 gene fusion may suggest melanotic Xp11 translocation renal cancer is a distinct entity among the MiT/TFE family neoplasms.",M2
19759547,"Impact of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 on pigmentation.We obtained metastasized melanoma tissue from a primary acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) patient and established a melanoma cell line named primary culture of melanoma cell derived from lymph node (PML)-1. PML-1 cells had a light brown color and decreased the expression of melanogenesis markers, including tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>), microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, and tyrosinase-related protein-1. To identify genes differentially regulated in PML-1 melanoma cells, we performed DNA microarray and two-dimensional matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analyses. Among the candidate genes identified, we chose NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) for further study. Reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analyses showed that NQO1 was markedly decreased in PML-1 cells and in several amelanotic melanoma cell lines. To investigate whether NQO1 affects the melanogenesis, we treated the cultured normal human melanocytes (NHMC) and zebrafish with NQO1 inhibitors, ES936 and dicoumarol. Interestingly, melanogenesis was significantly decreased by the addition of NQO1 inhibitors in both NHMC and zebrafish models. In contrast, overexpression of NQO1 using a recombinant adenovirus clearly induced melanogenesis, concomitantly with an increase of TYR protein level.

In this system, constitutive expression of SCF by epidermal keratinocytes results in retention of melanocytes in the interfollicular basal layer and pigmentation of the epidermis itself. Here, we extend this animal model by developing a compound mutant transgenic amelanotic animal defective at both the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) and tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) loci. In the presence of K14-Scf, tyrosinase-mutant animals (previously thought incapable of synthesizing melanin) exhibited progressive robust epidermal pigmentation with age in the ears and tails. Furthermore, K14-SCF Tyr(c2j/c2j) animals demonstrated tyrosinase expression and enzymatic activity, suggesting that the c2j Tyr defect can be rescued in part by SCF in the ears and tail. Lastly, UV sensitivity of K14-Scf congenic animals depended mainly on the amount of eumelanin present in the skin. These findings suggest that c-kit signaling can overcome the c2j Tyr mutation in the ears and tails of aging animals and that UV resistance depends on accumulation of epidermal eumelanin.",M2
19626598,"Prenatal molecular diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in a large cohort of Israeli families.OBJECTIVES: To present our accumulated data on prenatal molecular diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in a large cohort of Israeli albino families. METHODS: Albinism consists of variable phenotypes, but only families with predicted severely handicapped albino offspring, who declared their wish to terminate a pregnancy of such a fetus, are eligible for prenatal testing. Prenatal testing is not offered otherwise. Following detailed genetic investigation and counseling, molecular prenatal testing was performed using the combination of mutation screening, direct sequencing, and haplotype analysis. RESULTS: A total of 55 prenatal tests were performed in 37 families; in 26 families the propositus was the child, and in 11, a parent or a close relative. In 32 families tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) mutations were diagnosed. In 5 families a P gene mutation was detected. Twelve albino fetuses were diagnosed. Following further genetic counseling, all couples elected to terminate the pregnancy. Three additional pregnancies were terminated for other reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Families with increased risk for an albino child with severe visual handicap, seek premarital and prenatal genetic counseling and testing, for the prevention of affected offspring. Our combined methods of molecular genetic testing enable a nationwide approach for prevention of albinism. The same paradigm can be applied to other populations affected with albinism.",M2
19615522,"Carbon felt-based biocatalytic enzymatic flow-through detectors: chemical modification of tyrosinase onto amino-functionalized carbon felt using various coupling reagents.Tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) was covalently immobilized onto amino-functionalized carbon felt (CF) surface via eight different coupling reagents. Prior to the TYR-immobilization, primary amino group was introduced to the CF surface by the treatment with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The APTES modification of the CF surface was confirmed by XPS and SEM measurements. The terminal amino groups on the CF surface were cross-linked with protein lysine group (or cysteine group) using various coupling reagents. The resulting TYR-immobilized CF (TYR-CF) was utilized as a working electrode unit of a biocatalytic enzymatic flow-through detector. Catechol and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) were used as model analytes for the evaluation of catecholase activity and phenolase activity, respectively, and flow injection peaks based on the electro-reduction of the enzymatically produced o-quinone species were monitored at -0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Among eight coupling reagents, glutaraldehyde (GA) exhibited the best results on the sensitivity, the operational stability and the storage stability. The detection limits of catechol and 4-CP obtained by the GA-coupling method were found to be 6.0 x 10(-9)M and 1.5 x 10(-8)M, respectively with the sample through-put of 36 samples/h. No serious degradation of the peak current was observed over 30 consecutive samples injections on the GA-coupling method, while gradual decrease in the peak currents was observed on other seven coupling reagents. The GA-coupling method showed the best results on the storage stability, and 85% of original activity for catechol oxidation remained after 25 days storage.",M2
19437131,"Flesh color association with polymorphism of the tyrosinase gene in different Chinese chicken breeds.In order to study genetic variation of tyrosinase gene in four different flesh color chicken breeds selected from special districts including Guyuan, Wenchang, Tibetan and Hisex chicken, five loci of the <e>TYR</e> gene exon-1 and one locus of 5' flanking region were analyzed in PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. The results indicated that there were polymorphisms only at TYR1 and TYR3 locus. At TYR1 locus located in exon-1, there were three genotypes (TT, CC, TC), respectively, in three Chinese chicken breeds, and Genotype CC had not been detected in Hisex chicken. At TYR3 locus located in 5' flanking region, there were three genotypes (GG, AA and GA) in Chinese local chicken breeds and genotype AA had not been detected in Hisex chicken breed. It was concluded that there were many variations of TYR gene in Chinese local chicken breeds. DNA sequencing of PCR products for different genotypes showed that there were two mutation sites, respectively, C to T at TYR1 locus and G to A at TYR3 locus. Mutation at TYR1 locus did not cause any amino acid variation. The chi-square analysis revealed that there were significant statistical differences generally between flesh color and the two loci among four chicken populations (P &lt; 0.01). Our results suggested that the flesh color was related to genotype of TYR gene in Chinese chicken breeds. This study provided original information for elucidating the possible roles of exon-1 of TYR gene and 5' flanking region in chickens with different flesh color chicken.",M2
19436266,"AAV-mediated tyrosinase gene transfer restores melanogenesis and retinal function in a model of oculo-cutaneous albinism type I (OCA1).Oculo-cutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) is characterized by congenital hypopigmentation and is due to mutations in the TYROSINASE gene (<e>TYR</e>). In this study, we have characterized the morpho-functional consequences of the lack of tyrosinase activity in the spontaneous null mouse model of OCA1 (Tyr(c-2j)). Here, we show that adult Tyr(c-2j) mice have several retinal functional anomalies associated with photoreceptor loss. To test whether these anomalies are reversible upon TYR complementation, we performed intraocular administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector, encoding the human TYR gene, in adult Tyr(c-2j) mice. This resulted in melanosome biogenesis and ex novo synthesis of melanin in both neuroectodermally derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in neural crest-derived choroid and iris melanocytes. Ocular melanin accumulation prevented progressive photoreceptor degeneration and resulted in restoration of retinal function. Our results reveal novel properties of pigment cells and show that the developmental anomalies of albino mice are associated with defects occurring in postnatal life, adding novel insights on OCA1 disease pathogenesis. In addition, we provide proof-of-principle of an effective gene-based strategy relevant for future application in albino patients.",M2
19346471,"Geometric and electronic structure differences between the type 3 copper sites of the multicopper oxidases and hemocyanin/tyrosinase.The coupled binuclear  type 3  Cu sites are found in hemocyanin (Hc), tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>), and the multicopper oxidases (MCOs), such as laccase (Lc), and play vital roles in O(2) respiration. Although all type 3 Cu sites share the same ground state features, those of Hc/Tyr have very different ligand-binding properties relative to those of the MCOs. In particular, the type 3 Cu site in the MCOs (Lc(T3)) is a part of the trinuclear Cu cluster, and if the third (i.e., type 2) Cu is removed, the Lc(T3) site does not react with O(2). Density functional theory calculations indicate that O(2) binding in Hc is approximately 9 kcal mol(-1) more favorable than for Lc(T3). The difference is mostly found in the total energy difference of the deoxy states (approximately 7 kcal mol(-1)), where the stabilization of deoxy Lc(T3) derives from its long equilibrium Cu-Cu distance of approximately 5.5-6.5 A, relative to approximately 4.2 A in deoxy Hc/Tyr. The O(2) binding in Hc is driven by the electrostatic destabilization of the deoxy Hc site, in which the two Cu(I) centers are kept close together by the protein for facile 2-electron reduction of O(2). Alternatively, the lack of O(2) reactivity in Lc(T3) reflects the flexibility of the active site, capable of minimizing the electrostatic repulsion of the 2 Cu(I)s. Thus, the O(2) reactivity of the MCOs is intrinsic to the trinuclear Cu cluster, leading to different O(2) intermediates as required by its function of irreversible reduction of O(2) to H(2)O.",M2
19344689,"The basidiomycetous mushroom Lentinula edodes white collar-2 homolog PHRB,  a partner of putative blue-light photoreceptor PHRA, binds to a specific site in  the promoter region of the L. edodes tyrosinase gene.We isolated a cDNA homolog of Neurospora crassa wc-2 from the basidiomycetous mushroom Lentinula edodes and termed it phrB cDNA. The deduced PHRB (313 amino acid residues) contained a PAS domain and a zinc-finger motif. Random binding-site selection analysis of the PHRB produced in Escherichia coli revealed that it bound to a 7-bp sequence with the consensus sequence 5'GATA/TTG/T/AC3'. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay showed that it also bound to the consensus sequence 5'GATATTC3' in the promoter region of the L. edodes tyrosinase gene (Le.<e>tyr</e>). In vitro GST-pulldown immunoblot analysis disclosed that PHRB interacts with a putative blue-light photoreceptor of L. edodes (PHRA), the homolog of N. crassa WC-1, through the PAS B- and/or PAS C domain of PHRA. The expression of phrB and Le.tyr genes in pre-primordial mycelia of L. edodes is induced by light exposure, suggesting that PHRB can regulate the expression of the Le.tyr gene in a light-dependent manner.",M2
19342661,"N-glycosylation enhances presentation of a MHC class I-restricted epitope from tyrosinase.We recently demonstrated that the mechanism of processing of an HLA-A*0201-restricted peptide epitope, <e>Tyr</e>(369)(D), derived from the membrane protein tyrosinase, involves retrotranslocation of glycosylated molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, removal of an N-linked carbohydrate from Asn(371) by peptide N-glycanase, proteolysis by the proteasome and other proteases, and retransport of the resulting peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for association with HLA-A*0201. Carbohydrate removal results in deamidation of Asn(371) to aspartic acid. The asparagine-containing homolog of this peptide, Tyr(369)(N), is not presented by tyrosinase-expressing cells, and this has been presumed to be due to quantitative glycosylation of Asn(371). Although examining cytosolic intermediates that accumulated in human melanoma cells treated with proteasome inhibitors, we were surprised to find both molecules that had been deglycosylated by peptide N-glycanase and a large number of molecules that had not been previously glycosylated. The failure of Tyr(369)(N) to be processed and presented from these latter molecules may be partially due to a process of deamidation independent of glycosylation. However, we also established that proteasomes degrade tyrosinase molecules that are still glycosylated, giving rise to a set of discrete intermediates that are not observed when unglycosylated molecules are degraded. We propose that Tyr(369)(N) fails to be presented because unglycosylated tyrosinase is degraded rapidly and relatively nonselectively. In contrast, glycosylation alters the selectivity of tyrosinase processing by the proteasome, enhancing the production or survival of Tyr(369)(D).",M2
19308642,"Molecular characterization of the Himalayan mink.A rare color variant of the American mink (Neovison vison), discovered on a ranch in Nova Scotia and referred to as the  marbled  variety, carries a distinctive pigment distribution pattern resembling that found in some other species, e.g., the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse. We tested the hypothesis that the color pattern in question-light-colored body with dark-colored points (ears, face, tail, and feet)-is due to a mutation in the melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) that results in temperature-sensitive pigment production. Our study shows that marbled mink carry a mutation in exon 4 of the TYR gene (c.1835C &gt; G) which results in an amino acid substitution (p.H420Q). The location of this substitution corresponds to the amino acid position that is also mutated in the TYR protein of the Himalayan mouse. Thus, the marbled variant is more aptly referred to as the Himalayan mink.",M2
19168892,"Multiple genes on chromosome 7 regulate dopaminergic amacrine cell number in the mouse retina.PURPOSE: The size of neuronal populations is modulated by gene variants that influence cell production and survival, in turn influencing neuronal connectivity, function, and disease risk. The size of the dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cell population is a highly heritable trait exhibiting sixfold variation among inbred strains of mice and is used here to identify genes that modulate the number of DA cells. METHODS: The entire population was counted in retinal wholemounts from 37 genetically defined lines of mice, including six standard inbred strains, 25 recombinant inbred strains (AXB/BXA), reciprocal F1 hybrids, a chromosome (Chr) 7 consomic line, and three additional genetically modified lines. RESULTS: Much of this variation was mapped to a broad locus on Chr 7 (Dopaminergic amacrine cell number control, Chr 7 [Dacnc7]). The Dacnc7 locus is flanked by two candidate genes known to modulate the number of other types of retinal neuron-the proapoptotic gene, Bax, and tyrosinase. The <e>Tyr</e> mutation was shown to modulate DA cell number modestly, though in the direction opposite that predicted. In contrast, Bax deficiency increased the population fourfold. Bax expression was significantly greater in the A/J than in the C57BL/6J strain, an effect that may be attributed to an SNP in a p53 consensus binding site known to modulate transcription. Finally, we note a strong candidate situated at the peak of the Dacnc7 locus, Lrrk1, a Parkinson's disease gene exhibiting missense mutations segregating within the AXB/BXA cross. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple polymorphic genes on Chr 7 modulate the size of the population of DA cells.",M2
19141317,"Absence of strial melanin coincides with age-associated marginal cell loss and endocochlear potential decline.Cochlear stria vascularis contains melanin-producing intermediate cells that play a critical role in the production of the endocochlear potential (EP) and in maintaining the high levels of K(+) that normally exist in scala media. The melanin produced by intermediate cells can be exported to the intrastrial space, where it may be taken up by strial marginal cells and basal cells. Because melanin can act as an antioxidant and metal chelator, evidence for its role in protecting the stria and organ of Corti against noise, ototoxins, and aging has long been sought. While some evidence supports a protective role of melanin against noise and ototoxins, no evidence yet presented has demonstrated a clear role for melanin in maintaining the EP during aging. We tested this by comparing basal turn EPs and a host of cochlear cellular metrics in aging C57BL/6 (B6) mice and C57BL/6-<e>Tyr</e>(c-2J) mice. The latter mice carry a naturally occurring inactivating mutation of the tyrosinase locus, and produce no strial melanin. Because these two strains are coisogenic, and because pigmented B6 mice show essentially no age-related EP decline, they provide an ideal test of importance of melanin in the aging stria. Pigmented and albino B6 mice showed identical rates of hearing loss and sensory cell loss. However, after two years of age, basal turn EPs significantly diverged, with 42% of albinos showing EPs below 100 mV versus only 18% of pigmented mice. The clearest anatomical correlate of this EP difference was significantly reduced strial thickness in the albinos that was highly correlated with loss of marginal cells. Combined with findings in human temporal bones, plus recent work in BALB/c mice and gerbils, the present findings point to a common etiology in strial presbycusis whereby EP reduction is principally linked to marginal cell loss or dysfunction. For any individual, genetic background, environmental influences, and stochastic events may work together to determine whether marginal cell density or function falls below some critical level, and thus whether EP decline occurs.",M2

In this study, we analyzed two genes (SjTYR1 and SjTYR2), derived from Schistosoma japonicum genome databases, which encode proteins with significant homologies to mammalian TYR. They exhibited the typical TYR topology, including two copper-binding domains and a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that two SjTYR genes were mainly expressed in the female adult worm. A complementary DNA coding the putative common copper center domain of each SjTYR was cloned and inserted into a pET-28a-c(+) prokaryotic expression vector. After purification, the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were used to produce their specific antibodies. The native active SjTYRs enzyme appeared to function as a homodimer, the subunits of which were linked to each other via covalent disulfide bonds. Both female and male worms possessed monophenol oxidase and diphenol oxidase activities of TYR. The relative enzymatic activities were 0.165 min(-1) mg(-1) and 0.0805 min(-1) mg(-1), which were inhibited by a copper-chelating agent (allyl thiourea) and correlated with disruption of female egg production.

18822100,"Albinism in the American mink (Neovison vison) is associated with a tyrosinase nonsense mutation.Albino phenotypes are documented in various species including the American mink. In other species the albino phenotypes are associated with tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) gene mutations; therefore TYR was considered the candidate gene for albinism in mink. Four microsatellite markers were chosen in the predicted region of the TYR gene. Genotypes at the markers Mvi6025 and Mvi6034 were found to be associated with the albino phenotype within an extended half-sib family. A BAC clone containing Mvi6034 was mapped to chromosome 7q1.1-q1.3 by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Subsequent analysis of genomic TYR sequences from wild-type and albino mink samples identified a nonsense mutation in exon 1, which converts a TGT codon encoding cysteine to a TGA stop codon (c.138T&gt;A, p.C46X; EU627590). The mutation truncates more than 90% of the normal gene product including the putative catalytic domains.

18791269,"Tyrosinase overexpression promotes ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation by quercetin and sensitizes melanoma cells to dacarbazine.Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been used for the treatment of melanoma for decades. However, monotherapy with this chemotherapeutic agent results only in moderate response rates. To improve tumor response to DTIC current clinical trials in melanoma focus on combining a novel targeted agent with chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that tyrosinase which is commonly overexpressed in melanoma activates the bioflavonoid quercetin (Qct) and promotes an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage response. This response sensitizes melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase to DTIC. In DB-1 melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>(+) cells), the threshold for phosphorylation of ATM and p53 at serine 15 was observed at a low dose of Qct (25 microM) when compared to the mock transfected pcDNA3 cells, which required a higher dose (75 microM). Both pcDNA3 and Tyr(+) DB-1 cells demonstrated similar increases in phosphorylation of p53 at other serine sites, but in the Tyr(+) cells, DNApk expression was found to be reduced compared to control cells, indicating a shift towards an ATM-mediated response. The DB-1 control cells were resistant to DTIC, but were sensitized to apoptosis with high dose Qct, while Tyr(+) cells were sensitized to DTIC with low or high dose Qct. Qct also sensitized SK Mel 5 (p53 wildtype) and 28 (p53 mutant) cells to DTIC. However, when SK Mel 5 cells were transiently transfected with tyrosinase and treated with Qct plus DTIC, SK Mel 5 cells demonstrated a more than additive induction of apoptosis. Therefore, this study demonstrates that tyrosinase overexpression promotes an ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation by Qct treatment and sensitizes melanoma cells to dacarbazine. In conclusion, these results suggest that Qct or Qct analogues may significantly improve DTIC response rates in tumors that express tyrosinase.",M2

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) were applied to detect the mutations in all exons of TYR gene and P gene. Then DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease analysis were used to confirm the mutations detected by DHPLC. Novel mutations were screened in 100 unrelated persons with normal phenotypes to exclude the possibility of polymorphism. RESULTS: Two mutations were detected in the P gene of the three patients and none in TYR gene. Heterozygous mutation of T450M in exon 13 of the P gene was detected in patient 1. Patient 2 had a heterozygous mutation of T450M in exon 13 and a heterozygous mutation of G775R in exon 23 of the P gene. Patient 3 had a heterozygous mutation of G775R as well. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the P gene exon 13 showed that the Oli I site had partly disappeared resulting from the heterozygous mutation T450M in patient 1 and patient 2, but not in 100 unrelated individuals.

18326704,"A comprehensive genetic study of autosomal recessive ocular albinism in Caucasian patients.PURPOSE: Autosomal recessive ocular albinism (AROA) is a group of genetic disorders in which reduced pigmentation of the eye is associated with decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, and photophobia, although pigmentation of skin and hair is relatively normal. Previous studies have shown that AROA in some cases constitutes a clinically mild presentation of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), due to mutations in either the <e>TYR</e> (OCA1) or OCA2 (P) genes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relative prevalence of different genetic forms of AROA, and to characterize a sample repertoire of gene mutations in a large series of Caucasian patients with AROA. METHODS: Thirty-six unrelated Caucasian patients carrying the clinical diagnosis of AROA were studied by DNA sequence analysis of the four classic OCA genes: TYR, OCA2 (P), TYRP1, and SLC45A2 (MATP), as appropriate. In all patients with no apparent pathologic mutations in these genes, DNA sequence analysis was performed of a candidate OCA gene, SILV, and the two genes most often involved in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, HPS1 and HPS4, the most frequent syndromic form of OCA. RESULTS: TYR gene mutations were identified in 20 (56%) patients, OCA2 mutations in 3 (8%), mutations in both TYR and OCA2 in 2 (6%), and possible TYRP1 mutations in 2 (6%). In at least nine patients, no mutations were found in any of the genes studied. Almost all patients with OCA1-related AROA were compound heterozygous for severe OCA1 mutant alleles and the common R402Q variant. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with AROA represent phenotypically mild variants of OCA, well over half of which is OCA1.",M2

18083586,"Optic nerve axon number in mouse is regulated by PAX2.BACKGROUND: Papillorenal syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease caused by mutations in the PAX2 transcription factor gene. Patients often exhibit congenital excavation of the optic nerve and a spectrum of congenital kidney abnormalities. Using a novel mouse model of this syndrome (C57BL/6J PAX2(A220G/+)), we investigated the effect of PAX2 haploinsufficiency on optic nerve axon number. Because PAX2 expression and retinal pigment epithelium pigmentation have a mutually exclusive relationship during development and because tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) has been shown to modify the penetrance of other ocular development genes, we also investigated whether tyrosinase modified the mutant PAX2 phenotype. METHODS: C57BL/6J PAX2(A220G/+)Tyr(+/+) mice were crossed with mice of the same genetic background (C57BL/6J) that are homozygous for an effective null allele of tyrosinase (Tyr(c-2J/c-2J)) over two generations to create mice with four distinct genotypes: PAX2(A220G/+) Tyr(+/c-2J), PAX2(A220G/+) Tyr(c-2J/c-2J), PAX2(+/+) Tyr(c-2J/+), and PAX2(+/+)Tyr(c-2J/c-2J). Mouse optic nerves were examined clinically and histologically. Axon number was assessed in a masked fashion in optic nerves from mice of all four genotypes and compared with parental strains. RESULTS: Mice heterozygous for a PAX2 mutation show reduced optic nerve axon number compared with age-matched controls. Tyrosinase does not appear to modify this phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PAX2 is important in determining axon number in mouse optic nerve. The developmental effects of tyrosinase and PAX2 mutation appear to act via different pathways.",M2
18079680,"Expression of melanin-related genes in cultured adult human retinal pigment epithelium and uveal melanoma cells.PURPOSE: Controversy exists over melanogenesis of adult human RPE cells in vitro. This study investigated melanin content and production and expression of tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>), tyrosinase-related-protein-1 (TRP1), tyrosinase-related-protein-2 (TRP2), and P gene in cultured human RPE cells and uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: RPE cells were isolated and cultured from three adult donor eyes. A continuous human uveal melanoma cell line was established from primary choroidal melanoma. Melanin content and production were measured, and the expression of TYR, TRP1, TRP2, and P gene at the mRNA and protein levels were detected by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Melanin content per cell of cultured RPE decreased rapidly and in proportion to cell division. No melanin production could be demonstrated in any passages. In cultured RPE cells, mRNA expression of TYR, TRP1, TRP2, and P-gene and protein expression of TYR, TRP1, and TRP2 could not be detected. In uveal melanoma cells, melanin content per cell remained stable, and melanin production could be detected in each passage. Expression of mRNA of TYR, TRP1, TRP2, and P-gene and protein of TYR, TRP1, and TRP2 could be detected in melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human RPE cells under standard culture circumstances do not produce melanin and do not express the four key genes required in melanin biosynthesis pathway. In contrast, human uveal melanoma cells produce melanin and express all of these melanogenic genes in vitro.",M2
18042623,"Direct interaction of tyrosinase with Tyrp1 to form heterodimeric complexes in vivo.Mutations of the critical and rate-limiting melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) result in hypopigmentation of the hair, skin and eyes. Two other related enzymes, Tyrp1 and Dct, catalyze distinct post-Tyr reactions in melanin biosynthesis. Tyr, Tyrp1 and Dct have been proposed to interact with and stabilize each other in multi-enzyme complexes, and in vitro, Tyr activity is more stable in the presence of Tyrp1 and/or Dct. We recently reported that Tyr is degraded more quickly in mutant Tyrp1 mouse melanocytes than in wild-type Tyrp1 melanocytes, and that decreased stability of Tyr can be partly rescued by infection with wild-type Tyrp1. Although interactions between Tyr and Tyrp1 have been demonstrated in vitro, there is no direct evidence for Tyr interaction with Tyrp1 in vivo. In this study, we use in vivo chemical crosslinking to stabilize the association of Tyr with other cellular proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that Tyrp1, but not Dct, associates with Tyr in murine melanocytes in vivo, and more specifically, in melanosomes. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis detected heterodimeric species of Tyr and Tyrp1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Tyrp1 interacts directly with Tyr in vivo, which may regulate the stability and trafficking of melanogenic enzymes and thus pigment synthesis.",M2

METHODS: The epitope areas 240 - 255, 289 - 294, 295 - 300, 435 - 447, and 461 - 479 of human TYR were synthesized and connected to the vector pGEM-T. The target gene was cloned to the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-2, which was then transferred to Escherichia coli BL21 host cells. Isopropy-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was used to induce the protein expression that was examined with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Indirect ELISA was conducted to detect the antigenicity of the peptide in 100 blood specimens of active vitiligo patients and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: The recombinant expression vector was constructed successfully. The SDS-PAGE and Western blotting results showed expression of the recombinant protein in E. coli. The amount of the recombinant protein reached about 70% of the total mass of bacterial protein with PAGE analysis system. With the glutathione S-transferase (GST) purification kit, the purity of recombinant protein reached over 90%. Indirect ELISA showed that reaction with the target protein was negative in all the 30 healthy controls and was positive in 64 of the 100 active vitiligo patients. CONCLUSION: The epitope peptide of human TRY is expressed successfully, and it has antigenicity in the serum of vitiligo patients.",M2
18001220,"Quercetin selectively inhibits bioreduction and enhances apoptosis in melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase.Tyrosinase is expressed in melanoma cells and catalyzes the formation of 3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone (quercetin) into reactive quinone species and subsequent glutathionyl adducts. Therefore, we examined the effect of quercetin metabolism on the glutathione (GSH) bioreduction pathway and cell viability in DB-1 melanoma cells that express varying levels of tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>+). In a cell-free system, GSH was significantly decreased by quercetin, which coincided with the formation of glutathionyl adducts. In Tyr+ clones, quercetin decreased bioreduction capacity and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a greater degree compared to control cells. The antioxidant/electrophile response element-induced enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:quinone oxidoreductase 1 were expressed at high levels in Tyr+ cells and contributed to pro-oxidant quercetin metabolism. The basal level of ROS and apoptosis was higher in Tyr+ cells and were selectively increased after exposure to quercetin. The increase in apoptosis following quercetin exposure was p53/Bax mediated and correlated with a decrease in GST-driven bioreduction capacity and an increase in ROS. In conclusion, quercetin can selectively sensitize Tyr+ expressing melanoma cells to apoptosis and may serve as an adjuvant to chemotherapy by enhancing cell death and interfering with GST-mediated drug resistance.",M2
17987514,"Two cases of uveal amelanotic melanoma in transgenic <e>Tyr</e>-HRAS+ Ink4a/Arf heterozygous mice.Uveal melanoma (UM) is uncommon among wild type mice. Efforts to develop transgenic mice to study this disease have resulted in pigmented tumors derived from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or mixed tumors of RPE and UM complicating the study of UM specifically. Reported here are two early stage intraocular amelanotic melanomas discovered in 2 Tyr-HRAS+ Ink4a/Arf heterozygous (1 normal CKDN2A allele) transgenic FVB/n mice. These tumors were morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to spontaneous UM recently reported in the Ink4a/Arf homozygous (CKDN2A knockout) parent strain. The tumors originated in the posterior uveal tract. The neoplasms were comprised of bundles of spindle-shaped melanocytes admixed with some epithelioid cells. Tumors were immunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase, S-100, pan-ras, but negative for cytokeratin and Melan-A. The development of early lenticular opacity and bilateral cataracts is a consistent phenotype of transgenic mice in which the retinoblastoma signaling pathway has been disrupted. Lenticular opacity and cataracts are rarely observed clinically in Tyr-HRAS+ Ink4a/Arf heterozygotes, rendering this strain suitable for ophthalmoscopy. Consequently, Tyr-HRAS+ Ink4a/Arf heterozygotes provide practical advantages, compared to the cataract-prone CKDN2A knockout strains, for real-time ophthalomoscopic detection and monitoring of UM while developing chemotherapeutic regimens and other research to understand the biology of UM.",M2

We carried out a genome-wide association scan for variants associated with hair and eye pigmentation, skin sensitivity to sun and freckling among 2,986 Icelanders. We then tested the most closely associated SNPs from six regions--four not previously implicated in the normal variation of human pigmentation--and replicated their association in a second sample of 2,718 Icelanders and a sample of 1,214 Dutch. The SNPs from all six regions met the criteria for genome-wide significance. A variant in SLC24A4 is associated with eye and hair color, a variant near KITLG is associated with hair color, two coding variants in <e>TYR</e> are associated with eye color and freckles, and a variant on 6p25.3 is associated with freckles.

17766092,"Anemonin is a natural bioactive compound that can regulate tyrosinase-related proteins and mRNA in human melanocytes.BACKGROUND: Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color. Melanin synthesis occurs with the participation of the tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) family of proteins including TYR, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2(TRP2/DCT). OBJECTIVE: The effect of a newly isolated natural compound that inhibits hyperpigmentation on the regulation of the TYR family of proteins was examined. METHODS: The natural compound, anemonin, was isolated from Clematis crassifolia Benth and was used to inhibit cellular TYR activity; it was found to have a low cytotoxicity (cell viability &gt; 80%) in human melanocytes. RESULTS: In human melanocytes, anemonin showed both time- and dose-dependent inhibition (IC(50) 43.5 microM) of TYR. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining revealed that expression of TYR, TRP1, and TRP2 was decreased in anemonin-treated melanocytes. Additionally, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that expression of mRNAs for MITF, TYR, TYRP1, and TYRP2 was also suppressed by anemonin. CONCLUSION: The natural compound, anemonin, an active compound of C. crassifolia, inhibits pigmentation synthesis in human melanocytes. Anemonin inhibits melanin synthesis by inhibiting the transcription of the genes encoding MITF, TYR, TRP1, and TRP2. This natural compound may be a candidate for cosmetic use.",M2

DNA vaccines encoding xenogeneic differentiation antigens, such as tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>), mediate tumor protection and regression in implantable mouse models, and dogs with spontaneous melanoma. We conducted a trial of mouse and human TYR DNA vaccines in stage III/IV melanoma patients. Eighteen human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201(+) melanoma patients were randomized as follows: one group received three mouse TYR DNA injections followed by three human TYR DNA injections; the other group received the same vaccines in opposite sequence. The study was conducted at three dose levels: 100, 500, and 1,500 microg DNA/injection, administered intramuscularly (IM) every 3 weeks. Most toxicities were grade 1 injection site reactions. Seven patients developed CD8(+) T-cell responses, defined by a &gt;3 SD increase in baseline reactivity to TYR peptide in tetramer or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays. There was found to be no relationship between dose, assigned schedule, and T-cell response. At a median of 42 months follow-up, median survival has not been reached. Mouse and human TYR DNA vaccines were found safe and induced CD8(+) T-cell responses in 7 of 18 patients.

17687388,"Involvement of dynein and spectrin with early melanosome transport and melanosomal protein trafficking.Melanosomes are unique membrane-bound organelles specialized for the synthesis and distribution of melanin. Mechanisms involved in the trafficking of proteins to melanosomes and in the transport of mature pigmented melanosomes to the dendrites of melanocytic cells are being characterized, but details about those processes during early stages of melanosome maturation are not well understood. Early melanosomes must remain in the perinuclear area until critical components are assembled. In this study, we characterized the processing of two distinct melanosomal proteins, tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) and Pmel17, to elucidate protein processing in early or late steps of the secretory pathway, respectively, and to determine mechanisms underlying the subcellular localization and transport of early melanosomes. We used immunological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to demonstrate that the movement of early melanosomes in the perinuclear area depends primarily on microtubules but not on actin filaments. In contrast, the trafficking of TYR and Pmel17 depends on cytoplasmic dynein and its interaction with the spectrin/ankyrin system, which is involved with the sorting of cargo from the plasma membrane. These results provide important clues toward understanding the processes involved with early events in melanosome formation and transport.",M2

Mutations of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene account for albinism in domestic cats, rabbits, cattle, mice and rats. In this study, we demonstrate that a TYR mutation accounts for albinism in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo). The coding sequence of the five exons of TYR was determined in genomic DNA from wild-type pigmented 'sable' coloured and albino ferrets. It was not possible to amplify TYR exon 4 in albino ferrets originating from different breeds.

17631099,"Amperometric biosensing of carbamate and organophosphate pesticides utilizing screen-printed tyrosinase-modified electrodes.A tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) screen-printed biosensor based on the electroreduction of enzymatically generated quinoid products was electrochemically characterized and optimized for determination of carbamates and organophosphorus pesticides. A composite electrode prepared by screen-printing a cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) modified cellulose-graphite composite on a polycarbonate support was employed as electrochemical transducer. The Tyr biosensor was prepared by immobilization of enzyme on the composite electrode surface by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin. Parameters affecting the biosensor response such as response time, enzyme loading, concentration and pH of the buffer solution were optimized utilizing catechol as substrate. The maximum response for o-quinone enzymatically generated was obtained after 2 min of reaction. A good reproducibility and high operational stability were found for Tyr biosensor (60 units) at 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.50. Under these conditions, the useful lifetime of biosensor was 10 days. After 15 days, the biosensor could be used with 20% of the initial value. Inhibition studies on the o-quinone steady-state current (at -0.20 V versus Ag/AgCl) were performed to investigate the inhibition kinetics of the pesticides in the enzymatic activity of mushroom tyrosinase. The results shown that the methyl parathion and carbofuran can lead to competitive inhibition process of the enzyme, while diazinon and carbaryl act as mixed inhibitors. Linear relationships were found for methyl parathion (6-100 ppb), diazinon (19-50 ppb), carbofuran (5-90 ppb) and carbaryl (10-50 ppb). Analysis of natural river water samples spiked with 30 ppb of each pesticide showed recoveries between 92.50% and 98.50% and relative standard deviations of 2%.",M2

17602567,"Elucidating the mechanism of laccase and tyrosinase in wheat bread making.Cross-linking enzymes generate covalent bonds in and between food biopolymers. These enzymes are interesting tools for tailoring dough and bread structures, as the characteristics of the biopolymers significantly determine the viscoelastic and fracture properties of dough and bread. In this study, the influence of oxidative cross-linking enzymes, tyrosinase from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei and laccase from the white rot fungus Trametes hirsuta, on dough and bread were examined. Oxidation of low molecular weight phenolic model compounds of flour, cross-linking of gluten proteins, dough rheology, and bread making were characterized during or after the enzymatic treatments. In the dough and bread experiments, laccase and tyrosinase were also studied in combination with xylanase. Of the model compounds tyrosine, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and Gly-Leu-<e>Tyr</e> tripeptide, tyrosinase oxidized all except ferulic acid. Laccase was able to oxidize each of the studied compounds. The phenolic acids were notably better substrates for laccase than l-tyrosine. When the ability of the enzymes to cross-link isolated gliadin and glutenin proteins was studied by the SDS-PAGE analysis, tyrosinase was found to cross-link the gliadin proteins effectively, whereas polymerization of the gliadins by laccase was observed only when a high enzyme dosage and prolonged incubation were used. Examination of large deformation rheology of dough showed that both laccase and tyrosinase made doughs harder and less extensible, and the effects increased as a function of the enzyme dosage. In bread making, interestingly, the pore size of the breads baked with tyrosinase turned out to be remarkably larger and more irregular when compared to that of the other breads. Nevertheless, both of the oxidative enzymes were found to soften the bread crumb and increase the volume of breads, and the best results were achieved in combination with xylanase.",M2

17456442,"Regulation of phenoloxidase activity by high- and low-molecular-weight inhibitors from the larval hemolymph of Manduca sexta.Insect phenoloxidases (POs) generate quinones and other reactive intermediates to immobilize and kill invading pathogens and parasites. Due to the presumed cytotoxicity of these compounds, PO activity and its proteolytic activation have to be regulated as a local, transient reaction against nonself in order to minimize damage to the host tissues and cells. We identified a Manduca sexta cDNA encoding a polypeptide sequence with its carboxyl-terminal 33 residues similar to the housefly phenoloxidase inhibitor (POI). The recombinant POI, secreted into the Escherichia coli periplasmic space along with its fusion partner DsbC, was released by osmotic shock and isolated by nickel affinity chromatography. Following enterokinase digestion and protein separation, the POI was purified to near homogeneity in a soluble form which inhibited M. sexta PO at a high concentration. We then produced the inhibitor using a modified baculovirus-insect cell system and isolated the glycoprotein from the conditioned medium. Deglycosylation coupled with inhibition assay revealed that O-glycosylation only moderately increased its inhibitory activity. While this led us to speculate the role of <e>Tyr</e>(64) hydroxylation, we were unable to modify the recombinant protein with tyrosine hydroxylase or purify M. sexta POI (Tyr(64)dopa) from the larval plasma. Instead, we isolated a low-M(r), heat-stable compound which strongly inhibited PO. The wavelength of maximum absorbance is 257 nm for the inhibitor. These data suggest that the down-regulation of PO activity in M. sexta is achieved by two mechanisms at least.",M2
17370310,"Interpreting missense variants: comparing computational methods in human disease genes CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MECP2, and tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>).The human genome contains frequent single-basepair variants that may or may not cause genetic disease. To characterize benign vs. pathogenic missense variants, numerous computational algorithms have been developed based on comparative sequence and/or protein structure analysis. We compared computational methods that use evolutionary conservation alone, amino acid (AA) change alone, and a combination of conservation and AA change in predicting the consequences of 254 missense variants in the CDKN2A (n = 92), MLH1 (n = 28), MSH2 (n = 14), MECP2 (n = 30), and tyrosinase (TYR) (n = 90) genes. Variants were validated as either neutral or deleterious by curated locus-specific mutation databases and published functional data. All methods that use evolutionary sequence analysis have comparable overall prediction accuracy (72.9-82.0%). Mutations at codons where the AA is absolutely conserved over a sufficient evolutionary distance (about one-third of variants) had a 91.6 to 96.8% likelihood of being deleterious. Three algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen, and A-GVGD) that differentiate one variant from another at a given codon did not significantly improve predictive value over conservation score alone using the BLOSUM62 matrix. However, when all four methods were in agreement (62.7% of variants), predictive value improved to 88.1%. These results confirm a high predictive value for methods that use evolutionary sequence conservation, with or without considering protein structural change, to predict the clinical consequences of missense variants. The methods can be generalized across genes that cause different types of genetic disease. The results support the clinical use of computational methods as one tool to help interpret missense variants in genes associated with human genetic disease.",M2
17355913,"Tyrosinase and ocular diseases: some novel thoughts on the molecular basis of oculocutaneous albinism type 1.Tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) is a multifunctional copper-containing glycoenzyme (approximately 80 kDa), which plays a key role in the rate-limiting steps of the melanin biosynthetic pathway. This membrane-bound protein, possibly evolved by the fusion of two different copper-binding proteins, is mainly expressed in epidermal, ocular and follicular melanocytes. In the melanocytes, TYR functions as an integrated unit with other TYR-related proteins (TYRP1, TYRP2), lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptors; thus forming a melanogenic complex. Mutations in the TYR gene (TYR, 11q14-21, MIM 606933) cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1, MIM 203100), a developmental disorder having an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. In addition, TYR can act as a modifier locus for primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and it also contributes significantly in the eye developmental process. Expression of TYR during neuroblast division helps in later pathfinding by retinal ganglion cells from retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. However, mutation screening of TYR is complicated by the presence of a pseudogene-TYR like segment (TYRL, 11p11.2, MIM 191270), sharing approximately 98% sequence identity with the 3' region of TYR. Thus, in absence of a full-proof strategy, any nucleotide variants identified in the 3' region of TYR could actually be present in TYRL. Interestingly, despite extensive search, the second TYR mutation in 15% of the OCA1 cases remains unidentified. Several possible locations of these  uncharacterized mutations  (UCMs) have been speculated so far. Based on the structure of TYR gene, its sequence context and some experimental evidences, we propose two additional possibilities, which on further investigations might shed light on the molecular basis of UCMs in TYR of OCA1 patients; (i) partial deletion of the exons 4 and 5 region of TYR that is homologous with TYRL and (ii) variations in the polymorphic GA complex repeat located between distal and proximal elements of the human TYR promoter that can modulate the expression of the gene leading to disease pathogenesis.",M2

METHODS: 87 VKH patients and 122 healthy controls were genotyped using seven microsatellite markers on the candidate loci. We analyzed microsatellite (MS) polymorphisms at regions within tyrosinase gene family loci. In addition, the haplotype frequencies were also estimated and statistical analysis was performed. HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. RESULTS: No significant evidence for an association was found. HLA-DRB1*0405 showed a highly significant association with VKH disease compared with the healthy controls (Pc=0.000000079), as expected. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that there is no genetic susceptibility or increased risk attributed to the tyrosinase gene family.

METHODS: Total RNA extracted from PB was quantified and subjected to RT-PCR under ultra-sensitive and reduced-sensitivity PCR conditions using SSRT-II. Positive TYR mRNA detection in 78 melanoma patients and 40 healthy volunteers was correlated with clinical stage, Breslow's evaluation of tumor thickness, Clark's assessment of tumor invasion, the location of the primary tumor site, and tumor histology. The assay sensitivity was evaluated by spiking PB with the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28. RESULTS: Using ultra-sensitive PCR conditions, eight out of 40 RNA (20%) samples from healthy volunteers and 50 out of 78 RNA (64.1%) samples from melanoma patients tested positive. Using reduced-sensitivity PCR conditions, we found only two positives in 40 RNA samples from healthy subjects and 20 positives in 78 RNA samples (25.6%) from melanoma patients. Only positive PCR samples for the reduced-sensitivity PCR assay correlated significantly with stage IV (metastatic) disease (p=0.0395). There was no significant correlation between positive TYR mRNA samples for either PCR condition (ultra-sensitive and reduced-sensitivity) with Breslow's classification of tumor thickness, Clark's assessment of tumor invasion, location of the primary tumor site, and type of tumor histology.

Nevertheless, FVB/N mice are commonly used for the generation of transgenic animals because of their large, strong pronuclei and high breeding performance. However, due to visual impairment of the FVB/N animals, the resulting transgenic animals cannot be used in tests that depend on vision, including tests of cognitive behavior. Therefore, we have bred a sighted version of the FVB/N strain by an outcross between FVB/N and 129P2/OlaHsd, followed by repeated backcrosses to FVB/N mice while selecting against albinism and homozygosity of the retinal degeneration mutation. After 11 generations of backcrossing, sighted animals were intercrossed to generate the congenic FVB.129P2-Pde6b(+) Tyr(c-ch)/Ant strain, which is pigmented (Tyr(c-ch)/(c-ch)) and devoid of the genetic predisposition to retinal degeneration.

The chelating properties of the original and oxidized lignins were compared by monitoring the amount of Cu2+ bound to lignin by gel permeation chromatography. The Acetosolv lignin oxidized with TYR was 16.8% and with LAC 21% higher than that of the original lignin. For ethanol/water lignin oxidized with TYR was 17.2% and with LAC 18% higher than that of the original lignin.",M2
16907708,"OCA1 in different ethnic groups of india is primarily due to founder mutations in the tyrosinase gene.Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an abnormally low amount of melanin in the eyes, skin and hair, and associated with common developmental abnormalities of the eye. Defects in the tyrosinase gene (<e>TYR</e>) cause a common type of OCA, known as oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). The molecular basis of OCA has been studied extensively in different population groups, but very little information is available on Indian patients. Our investigation covering thirteen ethnic groups of India, some representing &gt;20 million people, revealed that among 25 OCA families 12 were affected with OCA1, and that these cases were primarily due to founder mutations in TYR. We detected nine mutations and eight SNPs in TYR, of which six mutations (five point mutations &amp; one gross deletion) were novel. In contrast to most reports describing compound heterozygotes, the presence of homozygotes in 10 out of the 12 pedigrees underscores the lack of intermixing between these ethnic groups in India. Haplotype analysis suggested a few founder chromosomes causing the disease in the majority of the patients. Direct detection of the mutations prevalent in specific ethnic groups could be used for carrier detection and genetic counselling.",M2
16879986,"Increased level of p27 subunit of proteasomes and its co-localization with tyrosinase in amelanotic melanoma cells indicate its direct role in the regulation of melanin biosynthesis.Proteasomes have been shown to be involved in the regulation of melanin biosynthesis in melanoma cells. Here we report on the correlation between proteasome subunits and Tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) activity in different cell phenotypes, and thereby regulation of melanin biosynthesis in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. Our results indicated that the quantity of proteasome subunit p27 is higher and that of the enzyme Tyr and its activity are lower in amelanotic melanoma cells, while the reverse is true in melanotic melanoma cells. Proteasome subunit p27, compared to another subunit p31, shows increased co-localization with Tyr and Tyrosinase related protein 1 (Trp1) in amelanotic cells to a greater extent than that in melanotic cells. On exposure to cycloheximide, increased Tyr degradation was seen in amelanotic cells, as indicated by increased co-localization of p27 and Tyr. Further, exposure of amelanotic melanoma cells with proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 resulted in an increased Tyr activity, increased levels of Tyr and Trp1, leading to increased melanin synthesis. These results therefore suggest that proteasomes, particularly p27 subunit, are directly involved in the regulation of melanin biosynthesis in mouse melanoma cells.",M2
16827751,"Isolation of the Atlantic salmon tyrosinase gene family reveals heterogenous transcripts in a leukocyte cell line.In ectothermic vertebrates, visceral organs harbor melanin-containing cells. Their ability as pigment producers is nevertheless disputed. To address expression of the key genes for melanogenesis in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a tyrosinase-positive leukocyte cell line (SHK-1) and skin were used to obtain full-length tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>), tyrosinase-like protein-1 (Tyrp1), and dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) mRNA transcripts. In the SHK-1 cells, two different Tyrp1 transcripts were identified, one lacking exon 1. However, only the full-length version of Tyrp1 was identified in the skin. Sequencing of Tyrp1 genomic region revealed that the two Tyrp1 transcripts might originate from two different loci, possibly a result of pseudo-tetraploidity of the Atlantic salmon genome. Expression of Tyr, Tyrp1 and Dct was investigated by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase cain reaction showing highest expression in the SHK-1 cell line and skin, intermediate in pronephros, and negligible or absent in liver and muscle. Histological approaches were used to demonstrate melanin and revealed presence of melanized cells in skin, kidney and liver, and absence of such cells in muscle. In addition to verify melanin synthesis abilities of visceral-located cells, our results indicate loci-specific transcription differences between populations of melanin-producing cells in Atlantic salmon.",M2
16781122,"Differential regulation of melanosomal proteins after hinokitiol treatment.BACKGROUND: Melanogenesis is regulated by a series of enzymes under the control of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine melanosome-associated protein levels in Mel-Ab cells after hinokitiol treatment. METHODS: We measured melanin contents and analyzed melanosome-associated protein levels using Western blot and RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Hinokitiol markedly inhibited melanin synthesis and also reduced the protein levels of tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP-1), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TYRP-2) and MITF in Mel-Ab cells. In addition, hinokitiol significantly increased the phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that TYR and MITF mRNA levels were significantly decreased but that levels of TYRP-1 and TYRP-2 mRNA were unaffected by hinokitiol treatment. These results suggest that hinokitiol-induced ERK phosphorylation reduces MITF and TYR transcription, and mediates the action of hinokitiol on melanogenesis. Interestingly, the mRNAs of TYRP-1 and TYRP-2 were unaffected, although the protein levels of TYRP-1 and TYRP-2 were down-regulated. Thus, the effects of hinokitiol on the transcription of TYR may differ from its effects on TYRP-1 and TYRP-2. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we suggest that TYRP-1 and TYRP-2 may be regulated by post-translational degradation after hinokitiol treatment.",M2

METHODS: To define the fetus genotypes and gene mutation sites, the PCR and sequencing techniques were applied to amplify and analyze the regions of exon, exon-intron and promoter of TYR gene in probands and their parents of 2 families. RESULTS: The patient or proband of family 1 showed as a compound heterozygote with mutants R278X and 929insC. However, the fetus did not get any one of the two mutations, and so was with a normal genotype and phenotype. The parents of proband in family 2 were heterozygous with IVS4+ 3A&gt;T or G253E respectively, but their fetus was heterozygous only with IVS4+3A&gt;T but without G253E, and so was a carrier as his father.

16676322,"Characterization of melanocyte-specific inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mice.Conditional Cre-mediated recombination has emerged as a robust method of introducing somatic genetic alterations in an organ-specific manner in the mouse. Here, we generated and characterized mice harboring a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)-inducible Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion transgene under the control of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter, designated <e>Tyr</e>::CreER(T2). Cre-mediated recombination was induced in melanocytes in a spatially and temporally controlled manner upon administration of OHT and was documented in embryonic melanoblasts, follicular bulb melanocytes, dermal dendritic melanocytes, epidermal melanocytes of tail skin, and in putative melanocyte stem cells located within the follicular bulge. Functional evidence suggestive of recombination in follicular melanocyte stem cells included the presence of Cre-mediated recombination in follicular bulb melanocytes 1 year after topical OHT administration, by which time several hair cycles have elapsed and the melanocytes residing in this location have undergone multiple rounds of apoptosis and replenishment. These Tyr:: CreER(T2) transgenic mice represent a useful resource for the evaluation of melanocyte developmental genetics, the characterization of melanocyte stem cell function and dynamics, and the construction of refined mouse models of malignant melanoma.",M2
16573534,"Albinism in the domestic cat (Felis catus) is associated with a tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) mutation.Albino phenotypes are documented in a variety of species including the domestic cat. As albino phenotypes in other species are associated with tyrosinase (TYR) mutations, TYR was proposed as a candidate gene for albinism in cats. An Oriental and Colourpoint Shorthair cat pedigree segregating for albinism was analysed for association with TYR by linkage and sequence analyses. Microsatellite FCA931, which is closely linked to TYR and TYR sequence variants were tested for segregation with the albinism phenotype. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from wild-type and albino cats identified a cytosine deletion in TYR at position 975 in exon 2, which causes a frame shift resulting in a premature stop codon nine residues downstream from the mutation. The deletion mutation in TYR and an allele of FCA931 segregated concordantly with the albino phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that the TYR gene corresponds to the colour locus in cats and its alleles, from dominant to recessive, are as follows: C (full colour) &gt; c(b) (burmese) &gt; or = c(s) (siamese) &gt; c (albino).",M2
16570240,"Rapid genetic analysis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1) using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) system.OBJECTIVES: To present the prenatal genetic diagnoses and counseling for two cases of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type I family by detection of mutations in the OCA1 gene by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) system and a review of the literature. METHODS: All DNA samples were extracted from peripheral whole blood and amniocentesis-derived cells. Mutation analysis was performed for all five coding exons of the <e>TYR</e> gene, which were amplified by PCR. DHPLC was used for heteroduplex detection and sequence analysis was performed to demonstrate the mutation loci. RESULTS: Case 1: After sampling of blood from the family members and performing amniocentesis of the fetus, it was demonstrated that the affected boy and the female fetus were shown to be compound heterozygotes for mutations in the TYR gene. In addition, it was shown that the parents were carriers of the two mutations. However, the couple chose to keep the baby. Case 2: Mutation analysis of the DNA of the siblings revealed two heterozygous mutations in the TYR gene. Her husband is free of the disease. According to the principles of autosomal recessive inheritance, the incidence of affected offspring is very low. CONCLUSIONS: Herein we introduce a novel application for molecular diagnostic of DHPLC coupled with direct sequencing, which can provide an effective and exact diagnosis in patients with albinism. Clinicians should be cognizant of the risk of OCA inheritance by the offspring through careful identification of genetic mutations and the inheritance mode, both important to ensure comprehensive genetic counseling.",M2
16569498,"Development of a high analytical performance-tyrosinase biosensor based on a composite graphite-Teflon electrode modified with gold nanoparticles.The design of a new tyrosinase biosensor with improved stability and sensitivity is reported. The biosensor design is based on the construction of a graphite-Teflon composite electrode matrix in which the enzyme and colloidal gold nanoparticles are incorporated by simple physical inclusion. Experimental variables such as the colloidal gold loading into the composite matrix, the enzyme loading and the potential applied to the bioelectrode were optimized. The <e>Tyr</e>-Au(coll)-graphite-Teflon biosensor exhibited suitable amperometric responses at -0.10 V for the different phenolic compounds tested (catechol; phenol; 3,4-dimethylphenol; 4-chloro-3-methylphenol; 4-chlorophenol; 4-chloro-2-methylphenol; 3-methylphenol and 4-methylphenol). The limits of detection obtained were 3 nM for catechol, 3.3 microM for 4-chloro-2-methylphenol, and approximately 20 nM for the rest of phenolic compounds. The presence of colloidal gold into the composite matrix gives rise to enhanced kinetics of both the enzyme reaction and the electrochemical reduction of the corresponding o-quinones at the electrode surface, thus allowing the achievement of a high sensitivity. The biosensor exhibited an excellent renewability by simple polishing, with a lifetime of at least 39 days without apparent loss of the immobilized enzyme activity. The usefulness of the biosensor for the analysis of real samples was evaluated by performing the estimation of the content of phenolic compounds in water samples of different characteristics.",M2
16565383,"Of mice and men: tyrosinase modification of congenital glaucoma in mice but not in humans.PURPOSE: Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an autosomal recessive ocular trait caused by mutations in the gene for cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1). Although PCG is often considered to be fully penetrant, the disease shows 50% penetrance in some Saudi Arabian families. The familial segregation of the nonpenetrance suggests a genetic modifier. Recently, tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) deficiency was found to worsen the drainage structure/ocular dysgenesis phenotype of Cyp1b1-/- mice, suggesting that Tyr is a modifier of the phenotype. In the current study, tyrosinase (TYR) was investigated in human PCG. METHODS: A genome-wide screen, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in the TYR chromosomal region 11q13-q21, and sequencing of the TYR gene was performed with individuals from Saudi Arabian families with multiple, clinically confirmed, molecularly proven, nonpenetrant members. RESULTS: The study outcome did not support TYR as a modifier of the PCG phenotype in this population. The sequencing data showed no TYR mutations in the nonpenetrant family members and no difference in polymorphism frequencies between nonpenetrant or fully penetrant families. CONCLUSIONS: TYR is not a modifier of the CYP1B1-associated PCG phenotype in the Saudi Arabian population.",M2

The black bone sheep and the native sheep in Lanping and Luomuni sheep were chosen as materials for the measurement of TYR activity of blood and melanin content of tissues and organs. Moreover, we compared characteristic structure of melanin of black bone sheep with silky fowls. The results showed as follows: TYR activity was significantly different between black and non-black bone sheep (P&lt;0.05); the total character of infrared spectrum (IR) of melanin of black bone sheep resembled silky fowls; and melanin was eumelanin. We firstly cloned exon1 667bp sequence of TYR gene and determined TYR gene polymorphism of black and non-black bone sheep by PCR-RFLP. Compared with sequence of TYR gene of non-black bone sheep, there were two nucleotide mutation sites in exon1 of black bone sheep, located in No.64 and No.154 amino acid codons, respectively; but they were synonymics mutation. We designed restriction site in codon 64 and check up TYR gene polymorphism. The result showed the mutation site together with the close linked gene influenced melanin trait deposition. It suggests there should be functional mutation related with melanin trait. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between TYR gene polymorphism and coat color of sheep (P&lt;0.01), indicating TYR could influence synthesis of coat color of sheep.",M2
16457736,"Complete association between a retroviral insertion in the tyrosinase gene and the recessive white mutation in chickens.BACKGROUND: In chickens, three mutant alleles have been reported at the C locus, including the albino mutation, and the recessive white mutation, which is characterized by white plumage and pigmented eyes. The albino mutation was found to be a 6 bp deletion in the tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) gene. The present work describes an approach to identify the structural rearrangement in the TYR gene associated with the recessive white mutation. RESULTS: Molecular analysis of the chicken TYR gene has revealed a major structural difference (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, RFLP) in the genomic DNA of the recessive white chicken. A major size difference of 7.7 kb was found in intron 4 of the TYR gene by long-range PCR. Molecular cloning and sequencing results showed the insertion of a complete avian retroviral sequence of the Avian Leukosis Virus (ALV) family. Several aberrant transcripts of the tyrosinase gene were found in 10 week old recessive white chickens but not in the homozygous wild type colored chicken. We established a rapid genotyping diagnostic test based on the discovery of this retroviral insertion. It shows that all homozygous carriers of this insertion had a white plumage in various chicken strains. Furthermore, it was possible to distinguish heterozygous carriers from homozygous normal chickens in a segregating line. CONCLUSION: In this study, we conclude that the insertion of a complete avian retroviral sequence in intron 4 of the tyrosinase gene is diagnostic of the recessive white mutation in chickens. This insertion causes aberrant transcripts lacking exon 5, and we propose that this insertion is the causal mutation for the recessive white allele in the chicken.",M2
16419042,"Spatiotemporal gene control by the Cre-ERT2 system in melanocytes.The organ-specific and temporal control of gene activation/inactivation is a key issue in the understanding of protein function during normal and pathological development and during oncogenesis.

Cre-ERT2 production was detected in tissues containing melanocytes. After tamoxifen induction at various times during embryogenesis and adulthood in a Cre-responsive reporter mouse strain, genetic recombination was detected in the melanoblasts and melanocytes of the skin. Thus, the Tyr::Cre-ERT2 transgenic mice provides a valuable tool for following this cell lineage and for investigating gene function in melanocyte development and transformation.",M2

HPS is very common in Puerto Rico (PR), particularly in the northwest part of the island, with a frequency of approximately 1:1,800. Two HPS genes and mutations have been identified in PR, a 16-base pair (bp) duplication in HPS1 and a 3,904-bp deletion in HPS3. In Puerto Ricans with more typical OCA, the most common mutation of the tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) (human tyrosinase (OCA1) gene) gene was G47D. We describe screening 229 Puerto Rican OCA patients for these mutations, and for mutations in the OCA2 gene. We found the HPS1 mutation in 42.8% of cases, the HPS3 deletion in 17%, the TYR G47D mutation in 3.0%, and a 2.4-kb deletion of the OCA2 gene in 1.3%. Among Puerto Rican newborns, the frequency of the HPS1 mutation is highest in northwest PR (1:21; 4.8%) and lower in central PR (1:64; 1.6%). The HPS3 gene deletion is most frequent in central PR (1:32; 3.1%). Our findings provide insights into the genetics of albinism and HPS in PR, and provide the basis for genetic screening for these disorders in this minority population.",M2
16303920,"The ocular albinism type 1 (OA1) gene controls melanosome maturation and size.PURPOSE: The authors took advantage of the Oa1 mutant mouse in combination with other albinism mouse models (i.e., Tyrosinase and membrane-associated transporter protein [Matp]) to study the function of Oa1, the gene mutated in ocular albinism type 1, in the RPE during development and after birth. METHODS: Enzyme activity and protein localization were analyzed by immunohistochemistry of tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) in Oa1-null mice. Ultrastructural analysis and morphometry were performed by electron microscopy, of the RPE in Oa1-knockout mouse and double-mutant mice of Oa1 with either Tyr or Matp. RESULTS: Differently from other albinism models, Tyr activity was not impaired in Oa1-/- eyes. Hypopigmentation of the RPE in Oa1-/- mice is due to a reduced number of melanosomes. Analysis of Oa1-/-;Tyr(c-2J)/Tyr(c-2J) and Oa1-/-;Matp(uw)/Matp(uw) double-knockout mice, which display a block at stages II and III of melanosome maturation, respectively, revealed that Oa1 controls the rate of melanosome biogenesis at early stages of the organellogenesis, whereas the control on the organelle size is exerted at the final stage of melanosome development (stage IV). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that Oa1 is involved in the regulation of melanosome maturation at two steps. Acting at early maturation stages, Oa1 controls the abundance of melanosomes in RPE cells. At later stages, Oa1 has a function in the maintenance of a correct melanosomal size. This study helps to define ocular albinism type 1 as a defect in melanosome organellogenesis and not in melanin production.",M2

16272129,"Catalytic properties of an organic solvent-resistant tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. REN-21 and its high-level production in E. coli.An organic solvent-resistant tyrosinase (OSRT) from Streptomyces sp. REN-21 is a unique enzyme showing high activity in the presence of organic solvents. The OSRT-catalyzed oxidation of monophenols such as tyrosine-containing peptides and proteins was examined. The catalytic properties of OSRT were compared with those of mushroom tyrosinase. OSRT was shown to oxidize Gly-l-<e>Tyr</e> most effectively among four peptide substrates tested. On the other hand, mushroom tyrosinase showed the highest activity toward l-Tyr-Gly under the condition of 1 mM substrate. OSRT oxidized several proteins, including casein and hemoglobin, with relatively higher activity compared with mushroom tyrosinase under the condition of 1% (w/v) substrate. Thus, it was clarified that the catalytic properties of OSRT toward tyrosine-containing peptides and proteins are different from those of mushroom tyrosinase under these conditions. The OSRT-encoding gene operon was cloned, and found to consist of two genes, designated ORF-OSRT and ORF-393. The former encodes apo-OSRT, and the latter encodes the putative activator protein of apo-OSRT. A binuclear copper-binding site (type-3 copper site) characteristic of tyrosinases is contained in the deduced amino acid sequence for apo-OSRT. A high-level production system for the OSRT was constructed using pET20b(+) and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Approximately 54 mg of active OSRT was synthesized in a 1-liter broth culture by this system. The properties of the recombinant OSRT were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. In conclusion, we succeeded in constructing a high-level production system for OSRT.",M2

16197942,"EMX homeobox genes regulate microphthalmia and alter melanocyte biology.Melanocytes are specialized cells that produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair and retina color. They derive during embryogenesis from the precursor cells melanoblasts, which are neural crest cells committed to the pigment cell lineage. The differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes involves the expression of melanocyte-specific genes, particularly those responsible for melanin production, such as <e>Tyr</e>, Tyrp-1 and Dct, the expression of which depends on the melanocyte-specific transcription factor microphthalmia (Mitf). We have developed and executed a functional screen on melanocytes, with the aim of identifying genes involved in pigment cell biology. We have found Emx1 and Emx2, two highly related homeobox genes that when overexpressed in melanocytes can downregulate Mitf, Tyrp1, Dct and Tyr. Constitutive expression of Emx alters pigment cell morphology and growth properties: it confers TPA independence but not the ability to grow in soft agar. Spatial and temporal expression of Emx and Mitf during embryonic development suggests that Emx could be one factor that regulates correct expression of Mitf by inhibiting its activation in neuroepithelial derivatives other than melanocytes.",M2
16162178,"Reversion mutation of ib oculocutaneous albinism to wild-type pigmentation in medaka fish.We have previously identified three naturally occurring mutations in the medaka fish tyrosinase gene caused by transposable element insertions. <e>Tyr</e>-i(b) is one of these, containing the Tol2 element in the promoter region. Its homozygous carriers exhibit a weak oculocutaneous albino phenotype. We report here spontaneous reversion of the albino phenotype to the wild-type pigmentation, associated with excision of the Tol2 element. The newly arising mutant gene is inherited in the Mendelian fashion. Thus, oculocutaneous albinism is not strictly irreversible, at least in this organism and the results also indicate that the insertion of the Tol2 element is the main, and possibly the only, cause of the i(b) albinism. Importantly our data also suggest that medaka fish possess an active transposase.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary stage I-II cutaneous melanoma underwent radioguided sentinel lymphadenectomy. Their SLNs were assessed for tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) and melanoma antigens recognized by T-cells (MART-1) mRNA expression using RT-PCR, in parallel with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Tyr and MART-1 expression in the SLNs were correlated with PATH assay results, standard prognostic factors, time to progression and overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 124 patients (18.5%) had positive SLNs by both PATH and RT-PCR (PATH+/PCR+). Sixteen patients (13%) were negative by PATH and positive by RT-PCR (PATH-/PCR+). Eighty-five patients (68.5%) had SLNs that were negative by both PATH and RT-PCR (PATH-/PCR-). At a median follow-up of 30 months, recurrence rates among the three cohorts were statistically different (PATH+/PCR+, 60%; PATH-/PCR+, 31%; PATH-/PCR-, 9.4%). Seven of 23 (30%) and two of 16 (12.5%) patients died in the PATH+/PCR+ and PATH-/PCR+ SLN groups, respectively, whereas no patient died in the PATH-/PCR- SLN group.

METHODS: Ocular lesions developed in 20 (15.7%) of 127 male albino Tyr-RAS+ Ink4a/Arf-/- transgenic FVB/N mice within 6 months, and were evaluated histologically and ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Uveal melanomas were locally invasive but confined to the eye, with no evidence of metastasis. Tumor cells exhibited epithelioid and spindle-shaped morphological features and closely resembled the human counterpart. Melan-A, S100 and neuron-specific enolase expression were detected immunohistochemically. Melanosomal structures were detected using electron microscopy. The retinal pigment epithelium was intact above small melanomas, and electron microscopy of the tumors failed to show the presence of basement membrane formation or desmosomes. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous uveal malignant melanomas occurring in male Tyr-RAS+ Ink4a/Arf-/- transgenic mice arise within the choroid or ciliary body and share histopathological features characteristic of human uveal melanoma. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Uveal melanoma research has benefited from xenograft models, but engineered mouse models of spontaneous uveal amelanotic melanoma will undoubtedly further our understanding of the genetic underpinning for this disease.",M2
16056219,"Higher prevalence of OCA1 in an ethnic group of eastern India is due to a founder mutation in the tyrosinase gene.PURPOSE: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by deficient synthesis of melanin pigment and associated with common developmental abnormalities of the eye. It is one of the major causes of childhood blindness in India. The disease is common among an ethnic group (Tili) of Eastern India, which represents about 12.56% of the Bankura district population (approximately 0.4 million) of West Bengal. The purpose of the study was to investigate the molecular lesions causing OCA within this ethnic group for the unequivocal diagnosis of the carriers and attempt to decipher the cause for the high prevalence of OCA. METHODS: Fourteen OCA-affected Tili families consisting a total of 161 individuals, including 26 patients, were recruited for the study. A lack of tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) activity among all the patients was ascertained by the tyrosinase hair bulb assay. Mutation screening in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) was done by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was carried out to determine the frequency of the pathogenic changes among the normal individuals. Haplotype analysis was performed at the TYR locus using a set of informative microsatellite and SNP markers. RESULTS: All the patients were homozygous for a null mutation (c.832C&gt;T, Arg278stop) in TYR exon 2, which might cause a complete loss of enzyme activity. The mutation occurred in the same haplotype background. The frequency of the disease in this ethnic group was estimated to be significantly higher than the world average. CONCLUSIONS: OCA1 in the Tili population is due to the occurrence of a founder mutation in the TYR as indicated by haplotype analysis. Higher prevalence of the mutation in the population group is due to marriage within the same community. The diagnostic RFLP assay can be utilized for genetic counseling and thereby will help to reduce the disease load on the population.",M2

15899789,"Metastasizing melanoma formation caused by expression of activated N-RasQ61K on an INK4a-deficient background.In human cutaneous malignant melanoma, a predominance of activated mutations in the N-ras gene has been documented. To obtain a mouse model most closely mimicking the human disease, a transgenic mouse line was generated by targeting expression of dominant-active human N-ras (N-RasQ61K) to the melanocyte lineage by tyrosinase regulatory sequences (<e>Tyr</e>::N-RasQ61K). Transgenic mice show hyperpigmented skin and develop cutaneous metastasizing melanoma. Consistent with the tumor suppressor function of the INK4a locus that encodes p16INK4A and p19(ARF), &gt;90% of Tyr::N-RasQ61K INK4a-/- transgenic mice develop melanoma at 6 months. Primary melanoma tumors are melanotic, multifocal, microinvade the epidermis or epithelium of hair follicles, and disseminate as metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver. Primary melanoma can be transplanted s.c. in nude mice, and if injected i.v. into NOD/SCID mice colonize the lung. In addition, primary melanomas and metastases contain cells expressing the stem cell marker nestin suggesting a hierarchical structure of the tumors comprised of primitive nestin-expressing precursors and differentiated cells. In conclusion, a novel mouse model with melanotic and metastasizing melanoma was obtained by recapitulating genetic lesions frequently found in human melanoma.",M2
15895460,"Determination of variants in the 3'-region of the tyrosinase gene requires locus specific amplification.Mutations in the Tyrosinase gene (<e>TYR</e>, 11q14-q21) cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). The 3'-region of the TYR shows 98.55% sequence identity with a pseudogene, known as Tyrosinase-Like Gene (TYRL, 11p11.2-cen). A large number of publicly available nucleotide variants of TYR in this region are same as the bases present in the identical locations in the pseudogene. PCR amplification of these regions using primers with sequences common to both loci may result in coamplification of TYR and TYRL, and may lead to misinterpretation of the results. We have resolved this potential problem using locus-specific amplification conditions that could be used to identify unequivocally mutations and SNPs in exon 4 and exon 5 of TYR and proximal flanking sequences.",M2
15826307,"A strategy to study tyrosinase transgenes in mouse melanocytes.BACKGROUND: A number of transgenic mice carrying different deletions in the Locus Control Region (LCR) of the mouse tyrosinase (<e>Tyr</e>) gene have been developed and analysed in our laboratory. We require melanocytes from these mice, to further study, at the cellular level, the effect of these deletions on the expression of the Tyr transgene, without potential interference with or from the endogenous Tyr alleles. It has been previously reported that it is possible to obtain and immortalize melanocyte cell cultures from postnatal mouse skin. RESULTS: Here, we describe the efforts towards obtaining melanocyte cultures from our Tyr transgenic mice. We have bred our Tyr transgenic mice into Tyr c-32DSD mutant background, lacking the endogenous Tyr locus. In these conditions, we failed to obtain immortalized melanocytes. We decided to include the inactivation of the Ink4a-Arf locus to promote melanocyte immortalisation. For this purpose, we report the segregation of the Ink4a-Arf null allele from the brown (Tyrp1b) mutation in mice. Finally, we found that Ink4a-Arf +/- and Ink4a-Arf -/- melanocytes had undistinguishable tyrosine hydroxylase activities, although the latter showed reduced cellular pigmentation content. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous presence of precise genomic deletions that include the tyrosinase locus, such as the Tyr c-32DSD allele, the Tyr transgene itself and the inactivated Ink4a-Arf locus in Tyrp1B genetic background appear as the crucial combination to perform forthcoming experiments. We cannot exclude that Ink4a-Arf mutations could affect the melanin biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, subsequent experiments with melanocytes will have to be performed in a normalized genetic background regarding the Ink4a-Arf locus.",M2
15825154,"Mechanistic studies on the tyrosinase-catalyzed formation of the anachelin chromophore.The complex secondary metabolite anachelin, isolated from the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica, is believed to act as siderophore, facilitating iron uptake. Its structure is characterized by a fascinating blend of polyketide, peptide, and alkaloid fragments. In particular, the tetrahydroquinolinium-derived chromophore is unique among natural products, and its biosynthesis is unknown. We propose a hypothesis for the biogenesis of the anachelin chromophore starting from a C-terminally bound L-<e>Tyr</e> residue. It is proposed that this amino acid is reductively aminated, methylated, and hydroxylated. Oxidation of this catechol diamine substrate by a tyrosinase would lead to an o-quinone, which would react by intramolecular aza-annulation and tautomerization to give the anachelin chromophore. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, a model substrate related to the proposed biogenetic precursor was prepared. It was shown that the enzyme tyrosinase is able to transform this substrate into an anachelin chromophore derivative, which corroborates the biogenetic hypothesis. In order to gain further insight into the mechanism of this transformation, we performed spectrophotometric reaction monitoring, allowing the formation of the expected product to be observed. In addition, a rise in absorption at around 250 nm might be due to the presence of a spiro five-membered ring intermediate resulting from an alternative 1,4-addition to the o-quinone. Lastly, we were able to show that the action of tyrosinase on this substrate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics (k(cat)=123 s(-1) and K(m)=8.66 mM). Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency is decreased only by a factor of 30 relative to the natural substrate L-DOPA.",M2
15771720,"Tyrosinase mutations associated with Siamese and Burmese patterns in the domestic cat (Felis catus).The Siamese cat has a highly recognized coat colour phenotype that expresses pigment at the extremities of the body, such as the ears, tail and paws. This temperature-sensitive colouration causes a 'mask' on the face and the phenotype is commonly referred to as 'pointed'. Burmese is an allelic variant that is less temperature-sensitive, producing more pigment throughout the torso than Siamese. Tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>) mutations have been suspected to cause these phenotypes because mutations in TYR are associated with similar phenotypes in other species. Linkage and synteny mapping in the cat has indirectly supported TYR as the causative gene for these feline phenotypes. TYR mutations associated with Siamese and Burmese phenotypes are described herein. Over 200 cats were analysed, representing 12 breeds as well as randomly bred cats. The SNP associated with the Siamese phenotype is an exon 2 G &gt; A transition changing glycine to arginine (G302R). The SNP associated with the Burmese phenotype is an exon 1 G &gt; T transversion changing glycine to tryptophan (G227W). The G302R mutation segregated concordantly within a pedigree of Himalayan (pointed) Persians. All cats that had 'pointed' or the Burmese coat colour phenotype were homozygous for the corresponding mutations, respectively, suggesting that these phenotypes are a result of the identified mutations or unidentified mutations that are in linkage disequilibrium. Because the same mutations were identified in different breeds with similar phenotypes, the mutations are likely to be identical by descent rather than multiple mutation events occurring at the same site.",M2
15760344,"A Tyrosinase missense mutation causes albinism in the Wistar rat.Tyrosinase serves as a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin. In humans mutations in the <e>TYR</e> gene are associated with type 1 oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1) that leads to reduced or absent pigmentation of skin, hair and eye. Various mutations causing OCA in man, mouse, rabbit and cattle have been identified throughout the Tyrosinase gene including nonsense, missense, frameshift and splice site alterations. Here we report a missense substitution at codon R299H in exon 2 of the Tyr gene in the albino Wistar rat. As this very exchange has already been described in OCA patients, our findings reinforce the significance of this region for normal catalytic activity of tyrosinase protein.",M2
15858157,"Tyrosinase and tyrosinase related protein 1 alleles specify domestic cat coat color phenotypes of the albino and brown loci.The genes encoding enzymes of the tyrosinase family are strong candidates for coat color variation in mammals. To investigate their influence in domestic cat coat color, we determined the complete nucleotide coding sequence of the domestic cat genes tyrosinase (<e>TYR</e>)--a plausible candidate gene for the albino (C) locus, and tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1)--a candidate gene for the brown (B) locus. Sequence variants between individuals exhibiting variation in pigmentation were submitted to association studies. In TYR, two nonsynonymous substitutions encoding TYR-G301R and TYR-G227W were associated with the siamese and burmese phenotypes of the albino locus, respectively. TYRP1 was mapped on chromosome D4 within 5 cM of a highly polymorphic microsatellite, previously found to be fixed in a cat breed selected for the chocolate (b) allele of the B locus, which reinforced TYRP1 as a candidate gene for the B locus in the domestic cat. Two DNA polymorphisms, one leading to a TYRP1-A3G substitution in the signal peptide and another to an in-frame insertion TYRP1-421ins17/18 caused by a donor splice site mutation in intron 6, were associated with the chocolate (b) allele. A premature UAG stop codon at position 100 of TYRP1 was associated with a second allele of the B locus, cinnamon (b(l)). The results provide very strong evidence that the specific nucleotide variants of feline TYR (chromosome D1) are causative of the siamese (c(s)) and burmese (c(b)) alleles of the albino locus, as well as nucleotide variants of TYRP1 (chromosome D4) as specifying the chocolate (b) and cinnamon (b(l)) alleles of the B locus.",M2
