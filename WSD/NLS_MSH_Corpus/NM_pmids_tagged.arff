19605955,"Influence of cyclophosphamide and its metabolic products on the activity of peritoneal macrophages in mice.2,4,6-Trinitrophenyl (TNP) hapten-labeled peritoneal macrophages (Mf) given intravenously (iv) to recipients are poor inducers of contact sensitivity (CS) reactions unless Mf donors are pretreated with low doses of cyclophosphamide (CY). In vivo CY is converted into active alkylating metabolites, phosphoramide mustard (PM) and acrolein (ACR). Our experiments aimed to test how in vitro treatment of non-immunogenic Mf with different concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-7) M) of CY metabolites will influence their immunogenicity and other biological functions. Instead of chemically unstable PM, we used structurally and functionally similar nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). Our experiments show that treatment of Mf with ACR or NM stimulates the in vitro production of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-12 and down-regulates anti-inflammatory IL-10 and TGF-beta cytokines. In vivo non-immunogenic TNP-Mf become capable of inducing CS reactions in two situations: first, after treatment with NM or ACR and second, when cell recipients are received iv before Mf transfer of monoclonal antibodies against IL-10 and/or TGF-beta (500 mug per animal). Treatment with NM, but not with ACR, was also an efficient stimulus for production by Mf of significantly increased levels of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). In summary, our experiments show that CY metabolites can significantly increase the specific immune response as well as nonspecific innate reaction (ROIs production) and support the notion that CY and its metabolites can be a promising accessory tool when upregulation of the immune response is desired.",M1
18269793,"Development of a liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring procedure for concurrent verification of exposure to different forms of mustard agents.A novel liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) procedure has been developed for retrospective diagnosis of exposure to different forms of mustard agents. This concise method is able to validate prior exposure to nitrogen mustards (HN-1, HN-2, and HN-3) or sulfur mustard (HD) in a single run, which significantly reduces analysis time compared to separate runs to screen for different mustards' biomarkers based on tandem mass spectrometry. Belonging to one of the more toxic classes of chemical warfare agents, these potent vesicants bind covalently to the cysteine-34 residue of human serum albumin. This results in the formation of stable adducts whose identities were confirmed by a de novo sequencing bioinformatics software package. Our developed technique tracks these albumin-derived adduct biomarkers in blood samples which persist in vitro following exposure, enabling a detection limit of 200 <e>nM</e> of HN-1, 100 nM of HN-2, 200 nM of HN-3, or 50 nM of HD in human blood. The CWA-adducts formed in blood samples can be conveniently and sensitively analyzed by this MRM technique to allow rapid and reliable screening.",M1
17196628,"Lung toxicity of nitrogen mustard may be mediated by nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in rats.Nitric oxide (NO) has previously been shown to be responsible for nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>)-induced tissue toxicity. Excessive amounts of NO are known to be able to produce peroxynitrite, an important reactive nitrogen compound, by reacting with superoxide. Previous studies reported that NO synthase inhibitors are able to prevent NM toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether peroxynitrite is also responsible for NM-induced lung tissue damage in rats. Wistar rats were divided into four groups. NM was injected intratracheally and was treated with the selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG) (intraperitoneal) or the peroxynitrite scavenger ebselen (intragastric). Control animals were exposed to saline only. NM injection caused both oxidative and nitrosative stress, reflected by dramatically increased levels of the lipid peroxidation end product malondialdehyde (MDA), iNOS activation and urine nitrite-nitrate (NOx) values. Histopathological evaluation demonstrated lung damage with NM exposure. AG blocked iNOS activation and decreased urine NOx levels, and resulted in less histopathological changes in the lung. Although the histopathological outcome was found to be similar to AG, ebselen did not change urinary NOx or lung iNOS levels. Furthermore, ebselen was more able than AG to protect against MDA accumulation. In conclusion, the ability of ebselen to prevent against lung damage without blocking NO synthesis suggests that peroxynitrites may have an important role in the pathogenesis of NM toxicity in addition to NO.",M1
16997491,"Molecular mechanism of nitrogen mustard induced leukocyte(s) chemotaxis.Nitrogen mustard(s) (<e>NM</e>) are the primary chemotherapeutic agents (Chlorambucil, BSO) that are used in treating the B-cell chronic lymphocyte leukemia (B-CLL). It is known that NM imparts oxidative stress by inducing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in B-lymphocytes of B-CLL. It is likely that these nitrogen mustards can cause the oxidative stress in the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of B-CLL patients. It is possible that chronic exposure of PBL to NM would induce drug resistance in B-CLL patients. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which NM affect the PBL are not known at present. Here, an effort is made to present plausible mechanisms by which chronic NM exposure could lead to increased PBL chemotaxis and vascular tissue damage in B-CLL patients The clinical implication of this phenomenon is most likely the unwanted organ dysfunction in B-CLL patients. Identification of viable therapeutic targets to attenuate the PBL activation during the NM therapy would be beneficial for the clinical remission of B-CLL.",M1
16172698,"Design and synthesis of a DNA-crosslinking azinomycin analogue.The azinomycins are potent antitumour antibiotics that are able to crosslink DNA, but are relatively unstable and unlikely to progress as therapeutic candidates. A prototype analogue 4 with more clinical potential has been designed and synthesised and incorporates the epoxide function of the azinomycins and a nitrogen mustard. Two further analogues 5 and 6 that can alkylate DNA but cannot crosslink the duplex have also been synthesised. Compound 4 crosslinks DNA efficiently at <e>nM</e> concentrations. Compounds 4-6 were submitted to the NCI 60 cell line screen and have similar antitumour activity, although 4 is slightly less active than the non-crosslinking compounds. These observations will be important in the design of further azinomycin analogues with antitumour activity.",M1
15851563,"Treatment of ocular tissues exposed to nitrogen mustard: beneficial effect of zinc desferrioxamine combined with steroids.PURPOSE: Exposure of the ocular surface to mustard gas chemical warfare leads to a destructive inflammatory reaction. Both steroids and a novel metalocomplex free radical scavenger, zinc desferrioxamine (Zn/DFO), have been shown to be effective separately in reducing ocular damage. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the effectiveness of both medications applied simultaneously is superior to the effectiveness of either one applied alone. METHODS: One eye in each of 52 rabbits was exposed to 2% nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). Topical treatment with eye drops of a metal complex-zinc desferrioxamine (Zn/DFO)-combined with dexamethasone phosphate (0.1%), was compared with the administration of saline or treatment with Zn/DFO or dexamethasone alone. Eight eyes (four animals) that were not exposed to NM served as the control. Examiners masked to the treatment groups assessed the extent of ocular injury and the response to treatment using clinical, histologic, and biochemical criteria. RESULTS: Treatment with the combination of Zn/DFO and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than was dexamethasone or Zn/DFO alone in reducing NM injury to ocular anterior segment structures. In combination-treated eyes, corneal re-epithelization was faster, corneal neovascularization was less severe, and intraocular pressure was not as severely elevated as in the saline or the Zn/DFO- or dexamethasone-alone groups. In addition, systemic antioxidant status was better conserved in the combination-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the combination of topically applied Zn/DFO and dexamethasone, by virtue of their additive inhibitory effects on free radical formation and inflammation, should be considered as a basis for the treatment of ocular mustard gas injuries.",M1
15257621,"Adenine-containing DNA-DNA cross-links of antitumor nitrogen mustards.Nitrogen mustards (<e>NMs</e>) are useful chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and ovarian carcinoma. The antitumor activity of NMs has been attributed to their ability to cross-link the twin strands of DNA. The resulting bifunctional lesions, if not repaired, can inhibit DNA replication and transcription, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the inhibition of tumor growth. The predominant bifunctional DNA lesions of NM have been reported to involve the distal guanine bases in the opposite strands of 5'-GNC sequences. In the present work, the formation of guanine-adenine and adenine-adenine adducts of N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine (mechlorethamine) in double-stranded DNA is demonstrated. Guanine-adenine cross-links of mechlorethamine were identified as N-(2-[N3-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine (N3A-N7G-EMA), N-(2-[N1-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine, and N-(2-[N(6)-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine. All three adducts were produced interstrand, while N3A-N7G-EMA was the dominant intrastrand G-A cross-link. The prevalent adenine-adenine mechlorethamine lesions have the structure of N,N-bis(2-[N3-adenyl]ethyl)methylamine (bis-N3A-EMA). DNA-derived lesions have the same HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns as the authentic standards prepared independently. bis-N3A-EMA lesions were produced in a concentration-dependent manner in calf thymus DNA treated with increasing amounts of mechlorethamine. Furthermore, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was used to demonstrate the formation of analogous N3-N3 adenine lesions in DNA treated with aromatic nitrogen mustards, N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)-p-aminophenylbutyric acid and L-phenylalanine mustard. The presence of cross-linked adenine-adenine lesions may explain the enhanced cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of NMs in cells deficient in N3-alkyladenine glycosylase.",M1
12824239,"Injury induced by chemical warfare agents: characterization and treatment of ocular tissues exposed to nitrogen mustard.PURPOSE: Mustard agents are highly toxic and abundant warfare chemicals, primarily affecting ocular tissues, with no specific treatment antidote. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of novel metallocomplexes, known to inhibit the formation of highly reactive free radicals, to reduce ocular injury induced by nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). METHODS: One eye in each of 72 rabbits was exposed to 1% to 2% NM. Topical treatment with eye drops of a metallocomplex--either zinc- or gallium-desferrioxamine (Zn/DFO and Ga/DFO)--was compared with treatment with saline, zinc (chloride), or DFO alone. Examiners masked to the treatment groups assessed the extent of ocular injury and the response to treatment using clinical, histologic, and biochemical criteria. RESULTS: Exposure to NM followed by administration of carrier alone (saline) caused severe and long-lasting injury to ocular anterior segment structures. Treatment with either Zn/DFO or Ga/DFO yielded marked protection (52%-64%), including faster healing of corneal epithelial erosions, less scarring and neovascularization, decreased inflammation in the anterior chamber, better maintenance of intraocular pressure, and less severe changes in the iris and lens. These were also associated with better preservation of systemic antioxidant status. Zinc or DFO alone afforded lower levels of protection. No toxic effects of these complexes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that Zn/DFO or Ga/DFO, by virtue of their enhanced ability to infiltrate cells and inhibit transition metal-dependent formation of free radicals through the combined push-pull mechanism, be considered as a basis for treatment of mustard injuries.",M1
11251184,"Chlorophyllin protects cells from the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of quinacrine mustard but not of nitrogen mustard.Chlorophyllin (CHL), the sodium and copper salt of chlorophyll, is capable of inhibiting the mutagenic activity of many chemical compounds. Several mechanisms have been advanced to explain the antimutagenic activity of CHL, including its antioxidant properties and its ability to form complexes with mutagens. The present study was designed to reveal whether the heterocyclic aromatic nature of a potential mutagen is essential to its sensitivity to CHL. Toward this end, the inhibitory effect of CHL on two compounds of similar chemical reactivity (mustards), that either embodied an aromatic structure (quinacrine mustard; QM) or did not (nitrogen mustard; <e>NM</e>), were compared. Human leukemic HL-60 and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were treated with QM or NM in the absence or presence of various concentrations of CHL. Both QM and NM when administered for 1-2 h at micromolar concentrations exerted similar effects; both arrested cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle, induced apoptosis and reduced the clonogenicity of MCF-7 cells. The simultaneous addition of 0.22 M CHL to cultures receiving QM virtually abolished the QM-induced inhibition of cell growth and clonogenicity. In contrast, CHL had no effect on reducing the cytostatic or cytotoxic activity of NM. CHL alone, at a concentration of 0.22 M, had minimal effect on growth of HL-60 cells slightly perturbing their progression through G2. The results are consistent with the model that explains the inhibition of the activity of mutagens or antitumor drugs with aromatic structures by CHL as mediated by its ability to sequester these molecules within heterologous mutagen:CHL complexes that are maintained by stacking interactions. Therefore, excess of chlorophyll in the diet, by sequestering aromatic mutagens (or antitumor drugs with a heterocyclic structure, if taken orally), may inhibit their accessibility to cells, thereby reducing their activity.",M1
11124644,"Comparison of the effectiveness of some pleural sclerosing agents used for control of effusions in malignant pleural mesothelioma: a review of 117 cases.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Management of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has been an important clinical issue regardless of the treatment modality employed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of oxytetracycline (OT), Corynebacterium parvum (CP), and nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) in the management of pleural effusion associated with MPM. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients who had stage-2 MPM or over according to the Butchart staging system and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion took part in the study. The patients received either OT (35 mg/kg), CP (7 mg), or NM (0.4 mg/kg) through a chest tube for pleurodesis. The association between several clinical parameters and patient survival was also investigated. RESULTS: OT was applied to 59, CP to 29 and NM to 29 cases. A statistical analysis of the results obtained by these agents have demonstrated that OT (30 days, 81%; 90 days, 76.2%) and CP (30 days, 86.2%; 90 days, 79.3%) led to a significantly higher rate of successful pleurodesis as compared to NM (30 days, 48.2%; 90 days, 41.3%; p &lt;0.05). Although the procedure was generally well tolerated by the patients, the NM-treated group experienced significantly more nausea-vomiting (46.1%) and hypotension (35.8%) compared to patients who received OT (nausea-vomiting and hypotension 4.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and CP (nausea-vomiting and hypotension 5.1%; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we found that thrombocytosis, chest pain and weight loss were significantly associated with poor prognosis, whereas epithelial type had a positive effect on survival. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OT and CP may be used as effective sclerosing agents for pleurodesis in the control of pleural effusions associated with MPM, without major side effects.",M1
10517497,"Ex vivo pharmacological purging of leukapheresis collections with nitrogen mustard: amifostine pretreatment improves both early and late peripheral blood progenitor cell recovery.Ex vivo pharmacological purging of bone marrow has been used to eliminate clonogenic tumor cells contaminating the autograft and potentially responsible of relapse. A considerable improvement of pharmacological purging would be achieved only if normal marrow progenitor cells could be selectively protected by the cytotoxicity of these agents. Amifostine (WR-2721; Ethyol), a phosphorylated aminothiol compound, has been shown to have this property both in vivo and in vitro. We describe here, an experimental model for ex vivo purging of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collections based on the combination of 3 mg/ml of amifostine and the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard. Amifostine pretreatment resulted in a statistically significant protection of normal late and early progenitor cells. Under the same experimental conditions, we observed a 4-6 log reduction of contaminating leukemic cells (i.e., K-562 and CEM) and in contrast to the protection of normal peripheral blood progenitor cells, preincubation of contaminating K-562 or CEM with amifostine did not significantly alter the LD95 nitrogen mustard concentration. Moreover, when we tested fresh human leukemia progenitor cells, amifostine pretreatment sensitized the leukemic cells to the cytotoxic effects of <e>NM</e>.",M1
10084254,"Autologous transplantation of chemotherapy-purged PBSC collections from high-risk leukemia patients: a pilot study.We have recently demonstrated that the combination of the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) and etoposide (VP-16) is capable of eliminating, ex vivo, leukemic cells contaminating PBSC collections and this is associated with a significant recovery of primitive and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells. Based on these data a pilot study on autologous transplantation of NM/VP-16 purged PBSC for high-risk leukemic patients was recently initiated. Twelve patients (seven females and five males) with a median age of 46 years (range 18-57) have been treated. Two patients had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) resistant to conventional induction treatment, four patients had secondary AML in I complete remission (CR), one patient was in II CR after failing a previous autologous BM transplantation, while two additional AML individuals were in I CR achieved after three or more cycles of induction treatment. Two patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in I CR and one patient with mantle cell lymphoma and leukemic dissemination were also included. Eight patients showed karyotypic abnormalities associated with a poor clinical outcome. The mobilizing regimens included cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone with (n = 6) or without fludarabine (n = 3) followed by subcutaneous administration of G-CSF (5 microg/kg/day until the completion of PBSC collection) and G-CSF alone (n = 3) (15 microg/kg/day). A median of two aphereses (range 1-3) allowed the collection of 7.2 x 10(8) TNC/kg (range 3.4-11.5), 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 2.1-15.3) and 9.2 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (0.3-236). PBSC were treated with a constant dose of 20 microg of VP-16/ml and a median individual-adjusted dose (survival &lt; or = 5% of steady-state BM CFU-GM) of NM of 0.7 microg/ml (range 0.25-1.25). Eleven patients were reinfused after busulfan (16 mg/kg) and Cy (120 mg/kg) conditioning with a median residual dose of 0.3 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (0-11.5). The median time to neutrophil engraftment (&gt;0.5 x 10(9)/l) for evaluable patients was 25 days (range 12-59); the median time to platelet transfusion independence (&gt;20 and &gt;50 x 10(9)/l) was 40 days (18-95) and 69 days (29-235), respectively. Hospital discharge occurred at a median of 25 days (18-58) after stem cell reinfusion. Four individuals are alive in CR (n = 3) or with residual nodal disease (n = 1 lymphoma patient) with a follow-up of 32, 26, 3 and 14 months, respectively. Seven patients died due to disease progression or relapse (n = 5) or extrahematological transplant toxicity (n = 2). Our data suggest that pharmacological purging of leukapheresis collections of leukemic patients at high-risk of relapse is feasible and ex vivo treated cells reconstitute autologous hematopoiesis.",M1
9625245,"Early nonsurgical removal of chemically injured tissue enhances wound healing in partial thickness burns.Chemical burns are slow healing injuries and their depth is difficult to assess. Tissue destruction continues as long as active material is present in the wound site. The routine therapy for treatment of full thickness chemical burns is early excision; it shortens hospitalization and reduces morbidity. However, presently there is no specific treatment for chemical burns of partial thickness. This study examined several treatment modalities for partial thickness chemical burns: surgical excision; laser ablation and chemical debridement with Debridase or trypsin-linked to gauze. Chemical burns were inflicted with nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e> -- a nitrogen analog to sulfur mustard -- mustard gas) in an experimental guinea pig model. Debridase was most effective and reduced significantly lesion area of burns after 'humid' exposure to 2 mg NM. The healing action of Debridase was also evident in the significantly higher histopathological score of biopsies from local tissue obtained on day 5. Laser ablation was most effective and accelerated healing of burn lesions after 'dry' exposure to 5 mg NM. The histopathology score of the laser treated burns was higher on day 4 compared to untreated controls. It is concluded that for partial thickness chemical burns early nonsurgical removal of the damaged tissues accelerates wound healing.",M1
9459175,"Relationship between nitrogen mustard drug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X and p53.Several genes have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis including bcl-2, bax, bcl-X and p53. These genes may be important in the development of nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) drug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Using Western blot analysis, we examined the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X and p53 protein expression and determined whether the levels of these proteins correlated with in vitro drug resistance in CLL patients' lymphocyte samples. Our investigations suggest that in CLL, NM drug resistance develops without any detectable alteration of Bcl-2, Bax or Bcl-X. In addition, we determined the presence of p53 mutations in 14 samples in order to assess if there is an association between in vitro drug resistance and the presence of p53 mutations. Using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis, we observed a p53 mutation in two out of seven resistant samples. The mutation occurring in both cases was a G:C --&gt; A:T transition at codon 273 (exon 8). One of these cases was de novo resistant to the nitrogen mustards. Only one of six samples with acquired resistance to the nitrogen mustards had a p53 mutation suggesting that p53 mutations are not a prominent feature of acquired NM resistance in CLL.",M1
9357970,"Pharmacological purging of minimal residual disease from peripheral blood stem cell collections of acute myeloblastic leukemia patients: preclinical studies.In this paper we describe an experimental model for ex vivo purging of contaminating tumor cells from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections obtained from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). We studied the combination of the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>; concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 microg/mL) and etoposide (VP-16; constant dose of 20 microg/mL), and the conventional cyclophosphamide (Cy)-derivative mafosfamide (concentrations: 20-175 microg/mL). The aims of our study were: 1) To compare the toxicity of the purging protocols on bone marrow (BM) and circulating trilineage precursors collected from normal donors after priming with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or after complete remission (CR) consolidation chemotherapy and G-CSF (leukemic patients); 2) to demonstrate the survival of very primitive hematopoietic progenitors (LTC-IC) in the peripheral blood (PB) and the BM after pharmacological treatment; and 3) to evaluate the antineoplastic efficacy of purging protocols on PBSC collections using 3 well-established leukemic cell lines. Our results demonstrated that the toxicity on BM and PB progenitor cells could be correlated with the complete killing of committed granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) and erythroid precursors (BFU-Es), a condition reached at the concentration of 1.5 microg/mL of NM (in addition to 20 microg/mL of VP-16) and 175 microg/mL of mafosfamide. Notably, early and late megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-MKs and BFU-MKs, respectively) showed higher sensitivity to NM/VP-16, but not to mafosfamide, than did CFU-GMs and BFU-Es. The dose of NM capable of inhibiting 95% of CFU-MKs and BFU-MKs (ID95) was 0.75 microg/mL. After incubation with the same dose of NM, the recovery of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es was 20 +/- 8% SD and 25 +/- 10% SD, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Long-term liquid cultures showed the recovery of primitive hematopoietic cells after incubation with the highest concentrations of NM/VP-16 and mafosfamide, with no significant differences between PB and BM samples. Under the same experimental conditions, we observed a more than 5-log reduction of contaminating leukemic cell lines (i.e., K-562, KG-1, and HL-60). In conclusion, we demonstrated that NM/VP-16 and mafosfamide purging agents are capable of killing leukemic cell lines that contaminate leukapheresis products from patients with AML, whereas an acceptable proportion of primitive LTC-IC is spared. Moreover, despite the different kinetic and functional profile of mobilized and steady-state BM progenitors, we did not observe any difference in toxicity of antineoplastic agents on hematopoietic cells at different levels of differentiation. These data suggest that pharmacological strategies developed for eliminating minimal residual disease (MRD) from BM autografts can be effectively and safely applied to circulating stem cell harvests.",M1
8980671,"Mechlorethamine-induced enhancement of radiation sensitivity of guanine.This study describes and characterizes the interactions of nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine (HN2) with guanine and the radiation sensitivity of guanine in the presence of HN2. Briefly, in an equimolar solution (0.5 mmol dm-3) the pH-dependence (pH 3.0-12.0) and time-dependence (0-36 h) of alkylation of guanine at room temperature were determined using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) column. Based on the hplc peak areas of the product and intact guanine, the optimal pH for alkylation was determined to be 8.0. Similarly, the optimal time required for alkylation was 10 h. Two products, i.e. alkylated guanines, were detected (10:1, peak areas measured at 260 <e>nm</e>) and purified. Structural studies of the products were performed by direct insertion probe-electron impact mass spectrometry. These products were identified as N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-[2-(7-guanyl)ethyl]-methylamine (product 2). At optimal conditions, samples of either guanine or an equimolar solution of guanine and HN2 were 60Co irradiated (gamma-ray) at 25 Gy min-1 at doses up to 400 Gy. Both sets of samples were analysed by hplc. In each case, the sole radiation product observed and characterized was 8-hydroxy-guanine. Dose-yield plots were linear and showed that HN2 enhanced the radiation sensitivity of guanine. This increase in radiation sensitivity is attributed to the differences in electrophilic properties between nitrogen mustard and guanine.",M1
8886850,"The in vivo and in vitro effects of an alkylating agent, mechlorethamine, on IL-6 production in mice and the role of macrophages.Alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide (CY) and the related compound mechlorethamine (<e>NM</e>), significantly increase in vivo the blood level of IL-6 but not of IL-1. Since in vitro CY is inactive we have used in our experiments NM, a compound structurally and functionally related to phosphoramide mustard, the natural biologically active metabolite of CY. Thioglycollate or oil-induced peritonal macrophages (Mf) of four different mouse strains treated with NM produce significantly more IL-6 than the non-treated cells. In contrast, under these conditions, the production of IL-1, TNF alpha and NO/NO2 radicals is not affected. The NM-induced elevated production of IL-6 by Mf could not be further increased by the treatment of cells with LPS, which may suggest that both agonists stimulate the same signalling pathway. The antineoplastic activity of the alkylating agents like CY or NM is usually attributed to the interstrand cross-linking of the DNA of the dividing cells. Our experiments can be tentatively interpreted as the induced overplus of IL-6 can also contribute to the stimulation of the cytotoxic NK-cells.",M1
8860835,"Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of rat glutathione S-transferase Yc confers in vitro resistance to alkylating agents in human leukemia cells and in clonogenic mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells.Recently, we have reported that N2Yc, a Moloney-based retrovirus vector expressing the Yc isoform of rat glutathione S-transferase (GST-Yc), conferred resistance to alkylating agents in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In this report, we address the feasibility of using rat GST-Yc somatic gene transfer to confer chemoprotection to the hematopoietic system. Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 cells were efficiently transduced with the N2Yc retrovirus vector and showed a significant increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration of chlorambucil (3.2- to 3.3-fold), mechlorethamine (4.7- to 5.3-fold), and melphalan (2.1- to 2.2-fold). In addition, primary murine clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with the N2Yc vector were significantly more resistant to alkylating agents in vitro than cells transduced with the antisense N2revYc vector. The survival of Yc-transduced hematopoietic colonies at 400 <e>nM</e> mechlorethamine and 4 mu M chlorambucil was 39.4% and 42.6%, respectively, compared to 27.2% and 30.4% for N2revYc-transduced cells. Future experiments will determine the level of chemoprotection achievable in vivo, following transplantation of N2Yc-transduced hematopoietic cells in mice.",M1
8591650,"Innovative treatment approaches for rheumatoid arthritis. Cyclosporin, leflunomide and nitrogen mustard.Cyclosporin A (CSA) Cyclosporin inhibits IL-2 release and T-cell activation and, secondarily, affects B-cell function. It also inhibits bone resorption, at least in vitro. This drug's bio-availability averages 25-35% but is highly variable. Food and grapefruit juice enhance bio-availability and newer formulations may make its absorption more reliable. It is highly concentrated in fatty tissues and red blood cells but does not cross the blood-brain barrier. CSA is metabolized to numerous metabolites by the liver and its elimination half-life is 6-12 hours in the absence of severe liver disease. Biliary excretion accounts for 94% of CSAs elimination. Because it is highly metabolized, its metabolism can be inhibited by other drugs (e.g. ketoconazole and erythromycin) or its metabolism can be induced (e.g. anticonvulsants). Cyclosporin is more effective than placebo for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and as effective as other antirheumatics. There is potential for the use of CSAs in DMARD combinations. The principal toxicities of cyclosporin are gastro-intestinal and renal, with the latter being of more concern. Leflunomide (LF). Leflunomide may be a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, although tyrosine kinase inhibitor may also be part of its mechanism of action. Its active metabolite is excreted renally to a large degree, with a prolonged elimination half-life of about 11 days. Since LF is activated by liver metabolism, renal failure may have less effect on kinetics than severe liver disease. Early data on efficacy indicate efficacy at 10-25 mg/day, although more well-controlled data is necessary. Toxicity relates to the skin, liver and GI tract, although some degree of weight loss was also found. Nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). Nitrogen mustard is an alkylating agent whose pharmacokinetics are poorly understood. Small, open studies in RA indicate that NM has a potential for relatively rapid response (1-2 weeks) but, clearly, much work remains to be done. As an alkylating agent, GI and hematological toxicities are of greatest concern.",M1
7567463,"Nitrogen mustard inhibits transcription and translation in a cell free system.Nitrogen mustard and its derivatives such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and melphalan are widely used anti-cancer agents, despite their non-specific reaction mechanism. In this study, the effect of alkylation by nitrogen mustard of DNA and RNA (coding for a single protein) was investigated using both a translation system and a coupled transcription/translation system. When alkylated DNA was used as the template for coupled transcription and translation, a single translation product corresponding to the 62 kDa luciferase protein was synthesised. Production of the translated product encoded by this template was inhibited by mustard concentrations as low as 10 <e>nM</e>, and 50% inhibition occurred with 30 nM mustard. A primer extension assay employed to verify alkylation sites on the DNA revealed that all guanine residues on the DNA template are susceptible to alkylation by nitrogen mustard. Similarly, when alkylated RNA was used as the template for protein synthesis, the amount of the 62 kDa luciferase protein decreased with increasing mustard concentration and a range of truncated polypeptides was synthesised. Under these conditions 50% inhibition of translation occurred with approximately 300 nM mustard (i.e. approximately 10 times that required for similar inhibition using an alkylated DNA template). Furthermore, a gel mobility shift assay revealed that mustard alkylation of the RNA template results in the formation of a more stable retarded RNA complex. The functional activity of the luciferase protein decreased with alkylation of both the DNA and RNA templates, with a half-life of loss of activity of 1.1 h for DNA exposed to 50 nM mustard, and 0.5 h for RNA exposed to 50 microM mustard. The data presented support the notion that DNA is a critical molecule in the mode of action of mustards.",M1
8353843,"Repair of ribosomal RNA genes in hamster cells after UV irradiation, or treatment with cisplatin or alkylating agents.We have measured the DNA damage formation and repair in the ribosomal and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes after treatment of hamster cells with different types of DNA damaging agents. In mammalian cells, the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I, whereas the DHFR is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, whereas the DHFR is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Cells were treated with agents that induce different types of lesions, and that are known to be repaired via different pathways. We used UV (254 <e>nm</e>) irradiation, treatment with cisplatin and treatment with the alkylating agents nitrogen mustard (HN2) and methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). UV induced pyrimidine dimers were detected with the enzyme T4 endonuclease V, which creates nicks at the dimer sites; the breaks are then resolved and identified by denaturing electrophoresis and Southern blot. Intrastrand adducts formed by the alkylating agents HN2 and MMS were quantitated by generating strand breaks at abasic sites after neutral depurination. Interstrand crosslinks (ICL) formed by HN2 and cisplatin were detected by a denaturation-reannealing reaction before neutral agarose gel-electrophoresis. We find that the repair of the pyrimidine dimers is significantly less efficient in the RNA polymerase I transcribed rDNA genes than in RNA polymerase II transcribed DHFR gene at 8 and 24 h after irradiation. ICL and intrastrand adducts induced by HN2 are also removed more slowly from the rDNA than from the DHFR gene. In contrast, MMS induced intrastrand adducts and cisplatin induced ICL are repaired equally efficiently in the RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II transcribed genes. We conclude that for some types of DNA damage, there is less repair in the ribosomal genes than in the DHFR; but for other DNA lesions there is no difference. The difference in repair efficiency between the rDNA and the DHFR genes may reflect the different RNA polymerase involved in their transcription. It may, however, alternatively, reflect the different nuclear localization of these genes.",M1
1869244,"In vitro synergistic activity of PDN-IFN alpha and <e>NM</e> + IFN alpha combinations on fresh bone-marrow samples from multiple myeloma patients.The differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay was used to evaluate the in vitro sensitivity of tumour and normal bone-marrow cells from 21 multiple myeloma (MM) patients to antitumour agents methylprednisolone (PDN), nitrogen mustard (NM) and recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha) tested singly and in the combinations PDN + IFN alpha and NM + IFN alpha. Both the PDN-IFN alpha and NM-IFN alpha associations were more efficacious than any agents used singly in reducing the percentage of myeloma cell survival. However, whereas NM, alone and in combination with IFN alpha, provoked a severe reduction in normal bone-marrow population, PDN and PDN + IFN alpha induced an increase percentage survival of normal bone-marrow cells. These findings indicate that, at least in vitro, the PDN-IFN alpha combination exerts a great antitumor effect which is not associated with a relevant cytotoxic activity on normal myeloid cells.",M1
2101870,"Diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia by flow cytometry.FA is a progressive bone marrow aplasia genetically transmitted by a recessive autosomal gene or genes. In our laboratory, cytogenetic diagnosis is based on evaluation of the chromosomal breakage of mitotic cell derived from patient blood-cell cultures and sensitized by nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). We have observed, in parallel with this test, fluctuations of the cell cycle of PHA- stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from FA patients as compared with controls. FA cells treated with NM show a dramatic and significant increase in G2/M phase after 72 hr in vitro culture, compared with untreated or control cells (normal controls and non-FA patients). This test is rapid and simple, as it consists in staining cells with a DNA dye (propidium iodide), followed by a flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle phases. Our results in twelve patients are correlated with the cytogenetic results.",M1
3393627,"Quantitative aspects of the interactive killing effects between X rays and other mutagens in microorganisms.Recently we presented a mathematical description of the synergistic interaction which occurs when Escherichia coli B/r is exposed to both X rays and 254 <e>nm</e> ultraviolet light (D. D. Ager and R. H. Haynes, Radiat. Res. 110, 129-141 (1987]. Here we extend this approach to other bacteria and describe a graphical technique which can be used to determine the nature and relative importance of second and third degree terms in the function h(x, y), which describes the dose dependence of such effects. In most cases, interaction functions appear to be dominated, in the biologically interesting dose range, by a second degree term in the product, xy, of the doses of the two agents. We find that the magnitudes of these interactions vary among the organisms examined and can be surprisingly large. Finally, we show that the simple xy dependence observed for most interactions does not carry any unambiguous implications with respect to previous speculations on the mechanisms of these effects.",M1
3164443,"Inactivation by nitrogen mustard of plasmids introduced into normal and Fanconi's anaemia cells.An SV40-transformed Fanconi's anaemia (FA) cell line, GM6914, exhibits approximately 2.4-fold increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) when compared with the normal line, MRC5-V1. Host cell reactivation of NM-treated plasmid has been investigated using transient expression vectors which contain the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. In both cell types there is a similar, dose-dependent reduction in CAT expression which correlates with an increase in NM-induced DNA-interstrand crosslinking. The data are consistent with two possible mechanisms for inactivation of the plasmid. Either a single crosslink anywhere within the plasmid is sufficient to prevent transcription of the cat gene. Alternatively, inactivation may result from some other more prevalent NM-induced lesions within the cat coding sequence.",M1
3351379,"Hyperoxic lung injury in mice: effect of neutrophil depletion and food deprivation.Conflicting data exist on the role of neutrophils (PMNs) in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung damage. We examined the contribution of PMNs and the contribution of food deprivation, a frequent complication of the methods used to produced neutropenia, to the lung damage that results when mice are exposed to high concentrations of oxygen. Mice were exposed to either 100% oxygen or air for up to 4 days. Neutropenia was induced by a single tail vein injection of nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) given 1 day before the oxygen exposure. Food deprivation, which induced the same weight loss as that found in NM-treated mice, was achieved by withholding food (fasted) during the oxygen exposure. We examined mortality; weight loss; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL fluid) protein concentration, cell count, and differential count; the number of PMNs in blood; and lung histologic conditions by light and electron microscopy. NM-treated mice lost approximately 25% of their body weight when exposed to either air or oxygen. They also had more severe lung damage than the saline-treated mice during hyperoxic exposure, despite a marked reduction in the number of PMNs in blood, BAL fluid, and lung tissue. Although a correlation was found between the number of blood PMNs and the BAL protein concentration in the nonneutropenic mice (r = 0.69; P less than 0.001), no correlation was seen in the neutropenic mice (r = 0.26). Fasted, oxygen-exposed mice had the same weight loss as the NM mice, but they had more severe lung damage at an earlier time (day 3 vs. day 4) and greater mortality than the saline-treated and the NM-treated mice. These results indicate that PMNs are not required for either the development or progression of hyperoxic lung damage in mice; fasting increases susceptibility to the lung damage; and differences in nutritional status may explain, in part, the controversial role of PMNs in oxygen-induced lung damage.",M1
3796674,"The induction of aneuploidy by nitrogen mustard in a human lymphoblastoid cell line.We report that the presence of an extra Y chromosome can be used as a marker for the induction of aneuploidy (mitotic non-disjunction) in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. This endpoint is easily visualized in metaphase chromosome preparations after staining with quinacrine mustard. The induction of cells with two Y chromosomes by nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>) was examined. Exposure to 150 ng/ml nitrogen mustard induced a 6-fold increase in aneuploid frequency relative to untreated control levels; maximal induction of aneuploidy was observed 2 days after treatment. Lower concentrations of nitrogen mustard (36 and 75 ng/ml) induced smaller increases in aneuploid frequency, with maximal induction observed 1 day after treatment. This system has the potential to be used as an assay for the induction of aneuploidy in cultured human cells.",M1
3762577,"Effects of UV-irradiation on the SCE frequency in human lymphocyte cultures.UV-irradiation (254 <e>nm</e>) was found to induce a smaller increase of SCE in human lymphocytes than in human fibroblasts and CHO cells. The UV-induced SCE frequency in human lymphocytes was not influenced by the duration between irradiation and the subsequent S-phase. UV-irradiated lymphocytes showed a slightly more than additive response to the SCE-inducing effect of HN2 and acetaldehyde in comparison with non-irradiated cells. The UV-induced SCE frequency was similar in lymphocyte cultures containing 20 and 100 microM of BrdUrd. The results suggest that human lymphocytes are relatively insensitive to the SCE-inducing effect of UV-irradiation, and that SCE-inducing damage caused by UV is not removed during the G1 phase in these cells.",M1
2938589,"A comparative analysis of drug-induced DNA effects in a nitrogen mustard resistant cell line expressing sensitivity to nitrosoureas.In the Walker 256 rat mammary carcinoma cell line, WR, resistance to nitrogen mustards (<e>NM</e>) is accompanied by collateral sensitivity to chloroethylnitrosoureas (CENUs). DNA-interstrand cross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction were assayed in WR and the parent cell line (WS) after treatment with nitrogen mustard (HN2), phosphoramide mustard (PM), chlorozotocin (CLZ) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU). Treatment of cells with HN2 caused extensive levels of cross-links, approximately 50% of which were DNA-interstrand, equal in both WR and WS, whereas PM caused no detectable cross-links in either cell line. CLZ induced low levels of DNA-interstrand cross-links, similar in WR and WS, but no DNA-interstrand cross-links could be detected in either cell line after treatment with CCNU. Both CLZ and CCNU induced low levels of DNA-protein cross-links in both cell lines, though higher in WR than WS. There was no difference in the rate of removal of HN2-induced DNA-interstrand or DNA-protein cross-links or total CLZ-induced cross-links by the two cell lines, suggesting that differential repair was not relevant to the expression of resistance. Both HN2 and PM caused more SCEs in WS than in WR, whereas CLZ and CCNU induced more SCEs in WR. Thus, NM-induced SCEs were related to cell killing but not cross-linking, whilst CENU-induced SCEs were related to cell killing and DNA-protein but not DNA-interstrand cross-links. Furthermore, the collateral sensitivity of WR cells to CENUs was not due to the differential induction of DNA-interstrand cross-links or repair of total cross-links, or repair of total cross-links, although higher levels of DNA-protein cross-links occurred in WR, and these may be either a cause or a consequence of increased susceptibility of these cells to CENUs. Presumably NMs and CENUs have several distinct and separate macromolecular targets which result in differential cell killing. It is concluded that a range of lesions occurred after treatment of WR and WS cells with either NMs or CENUs and that, in these cell lines, there is no simple correlation between drug-induced cross-linking, SCE induction and cytotoxicity.",M1
3997369,"Nitrogen mustard therapy in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood.The effects of intravenous Nitrogen Mustard (<e>NM</e>), given with a total cumulative dose of 0.8 mg/kg BW, were studied in 60 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). Thirty patients were frequent relapser with corticosteroid dependence. In this group the actuarial remission rate was 43, 30 and 15% after 1, 2 and 3 years respectively. The relapse rate per year was decreased from 2.76 +/- 1.56 to 0.88 +/- 0.79 after NM. Ten of the 17 patients showing a partial response to steroids went into complete remission after NM but 6 of them relapsed. Of the 13 patients who did not respond to steroids only 3 went into remission for a short time. Vomiting and leukopenia were noted in one third of cases. The data indicate that NM may improve the course of corticosteroid dependent INS, being less effective in partial responders and probably without effect in non responders.",M1
2581430,"[Effect of anticancer agents on rat prostate. Evaluation of organ weight, histological finding and 5 alpha-reductase activities]To evaluate the effect of anticancer chemotherapeutic antigens on rat prostate, ten kinds of anticancer agents corresponding to the dose generally used for humans were intraperitoneally injected to 63-day-old Wistar rats. The anticancer agents were administered as follows: Cyclophosphamide (CPM) was used at the dose of 8 mg/kg for 7 days. Methotrexate (MTX), actinomycin-D (ACD) and cis-platinum (CDDP), 163 micrograms/kg, 8 micrograms/kg and 833 micrograms/kg for 5 days, respectively. Nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>), bleomycin (BLM), peplomycin (PLM), adriamycin (ADM), vincristine (VCR), and vinblastine (VBL), 500 micrograms/kg, 250 micrograms/kg, 170 micrograms/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 33 micrograms/kg and 83 micrograms/kg, twice in a week, respectively. The rats were killed on the fifth day after completion of the schedule. Then, the weight of the body, the prostate, the epididymis and the adrenal gland were measured. In addition, 5 alpha-reductase activities and histological findings in the prostate were examined. For determination of 5 alpha-reductase activities, cell-free homogenate obtained from the rat ventral prostate was incubated with C14-testosterone at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes in an atmosphere of 95% of O2 and 5% of CO2. Subsequently, the metabolites from testosterone were separated and purified with thin layer chromatography using the solvent system with benzene acetone, 4:1 (v/v). 5 alpha-Reductase activity was determined with the sum of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstanediol converted from testosterone and indicated as pmol product/mg protein. The 5 alpha-reductase activity was employed as a biological marker for the degree of androgenic dependency in the prostate. The results were summarized as follows. CDDP significantly reduced the weight of the body (p less than 0.001, n = 7), but not the activity of 5 alpha-reductase. NM and VBL had a specific action to reduce the weight of the prostate (p less than 0.01, n = 8) without causing loss of body weight. NM and VBL showed no influence on 5 alpha-reductase activities. The activity of 5 alpha-reductase was markedly damaged by BLM (p less than 0.05, n = 6) and PLM (p less than 0.05, n = 5). However no significant reduction was recognized in the weight of the body and the prostate. CPM, MTX, ACD, ADM and VCR were ineffectual on the body and the prostate weight and 5 alpha-reductase activities. In the histological examination, atrophy and degeneration of the glandular epithelium were revealed in the prostate treated with NM, VBL and CDDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1
6091632,"Sensitivity of mitomycin C and nitrogen mustard crosslinks to extreme alkaline conditions.DNA-DNA crosslinks in cells treated with mitomycin C, nitrogen mustard, or decarbamoyl mitomycin C were measured in alkaline isopycnic gradients as a function of pH. Crosslinks from cells treated with mitomycin C and nitrogen mustard, which react with DNA purines, could be detected at pH 12.5 but not at pH 14. No crosslinks from cells treated with decarbamoyl mitomycin C were detected at either pH. Previous studies with cells exposed to psoralen derivatives plus 360 <e>nm</e> light, which produce DNA-DNA crosslinks with pyrimidines, demonstrated stable crosslinks at pH 14. These studies indicate that DNA-DNA crosslinks involving DNA purines are much less stable at high pH than those involving pyrimidines, and that methods involving exposure to extreme alkaline conditions may give inaccurate information for some agents.",M1
6835230,"Loss of repairability of DNA interstrand crosslinks in Fanconi's anemia cells with culture age.Some published reports have suggested a possible repair deficiency for DNA interstrand crosslinks in cells derived from patients with Fanconi's anemia (F.A.), that others, using different F.A. cell lines, were unable to confirm. A reinvestigation of the cell lines used in the original report might resolve this controversy. The purpose of this study, then, was to compare 2 F.A. fibroblast cell lines, FA9 and FA18 (previously reported to be repair-deficient), with a normal human line, Detroit 550, in their ability to repair nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>)- and mitomycin C (MMC)-induced crosslinks. The alkaline elution technique was used in the analysis of repairability. Prelabeled cells in quiescent phase were treated with NM or MMC for 1 h and crosslinks were assayed immediately after treatment and at 24 h after drug removal. Early passage F.A. cells repaired crosslinks to the same extent as normal, early passage cells. However, with increasing passage number, the F.A. cells demonstrated a corresponding decrease in their ability to repair NM-induced crosslinks. In contrast, the normal cells did not show any age-related decrease in their ability to repair NM-induced crosslinks. Approximately equivalent repair rates were observed in quiescent 550 and F.A. fibroblasts after MMC treatment. Exponential and quiescent Detroit 550 cell populations showed no difference in the repair rate of MMC-induced crosslinks. These results indicate that F.A. cells can repair crosslinks early in cell culture but this ability is nearly eliminated with increasing passage.",M1
6826323,"Species variations in the pathophysiologic responses of vertebrate eyes to a chemical irritant, nitrogen mustard.Much of our knowledge of the ocular responses to irritants is derived from studies on the effects of mustards applied topically to the rabbit eye. The present study shows, however, that vertebrate eyes display profound species variations in the initial (first 6 hours) response to nitrogen mustard (<e>NM</e>). Rabbits and guinea pigs showed two episodes, ducks and cats one, and owl monkeys no episode of increased intraocular pressure. Development of anterior chamber flare and cellular invasion was seen in all species except ducks and owl monkeys. Pupillary constriction of differing time-course and magnitude was observed in all species except guinea pigs and ducks. At least one indomethacin-sensitive component of the NM-induced inflammatory response was demonstrated in each subprimate species, the nature of which depended upon the predominant ocular effect of prostaglandins in each. The present work suggests that while rabbits and guinea pigs may be of particular value for the study of some aspects of the ocular response to irritation and trauma, these species may be unsuitable for studying ocular inflammation and therapeutics as applicable to man.",M1

521460,"Stem cell growth and differentiation in Hydra attenuata. I. Regulation of the self-renewal probability in multiclone aggregates.Interstitial stem cells in Hydra are rapidly proliferating multipotent stem cells which continuously give rise to precursors for nerve and nematocyte differentiation. Growth of the stem cell population is controlled by the cell cycle time of the stem cells and the self-renewal probability, Ps (the fraction of stem cells in each generation which divide to yield more stem cells). In normal Hydra the stem cell generation time is 24 h and Ps = 0.6; under these conditions the stem cell population doubles in 3.5 days. In the present experiments we have systematically investigated the dependence of Ps on stem cell density. We culture stem cells in a feeder layer system consisting of aggregates of nitrogen-mustard (<e>NM</e>)-inactivated Hydra cells. In this system stem cell density can be varied over a wide range by changing the number of clone-forming units (CFU) added to the aggregates. We have measured the growth rate of the stem cell population and the cell cycle of stem cells in NM aggregates after 4--7 days of culture. From these data we calculate the value of Ps. The results indicate that the growth rate decreases 4-fold as the number of CFU seeded per aggregate increases from 10 to 400. Under these same conditions the cell cycle remains constant. The values of Ps calculated from these results indicate the Ps decreases from 0.75 in aggregates seeded with 10--30 CFU to 0.55 in aggregates seeded with 200--400 CFU. These results support a model in which Ps is controlled by negative feedback from neighbouring stem cells. In addition, our experiments indicate that Ps decreases during the growth of stem cell clones. When only a few stem cells are seeded in aggregates, they give rise to isolated clones distributed throughout the aggregate. Ps decreases markedly within such clones as they grow in size presumably due to increasing stem cell content of the clones. Since Ps in such isolated clones declines with growth, we infer that the local stem cell concentration is what controls Ps and that the spatial range of the negative feedback signal is short compared to the dimensions of NM aggregates.",M1

Trapping was conducted using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light-traps baited with dry ice, and gravid traps baited with a hay infusion. In addition, sentinel chickens were housed at four of the trapping locations to monitor WNV epizootic transmission. In total, 5,576 pools consisting of 115,797 female mosquitoes were tested for WNV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, of which 152 from 13 mosquito species representing six genera were positive. Culex tarsalis Coquillett, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Culex erythrothorax Dyar, Aedes vexans (Meigan), and Psorophora columbiae (Dyar &amp; Knab) accounted for 86% of all detections.

19214998,"The relationship between European genetic admixture and body composition among Hispanics and Native Americans.Previous studies have shown a relationship between health-related phenotypes and the degree of African, European, or Native American genetic admixture, indicating that there may be a genetic component to these phenotypes. However, these relationships may be driven to a large extent by the environmental differences that co-vary with admixture differences between and within groups. In this study, we examine the relationship between genetic admixture and two phenotypic measurements that are potentially related to health: body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (PBF). In addition to admixture proportions, we attempt to assess the influence of some environmental covariates by examining how the phenotypes vary with self-reported household income, education of parents, and physical activity level. Genetic, anthropometric, and environmental data were collected from 170 self-reported Hispanic and Native American university students in Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>. We examine the relationships between genetic admixture, phenotype, and environment in both the full sample, as well as in Hispanics and Native Americans separately.

19198754,"Characterization of a new curtovirus, pepper yellow dwarf virus, from chile pepper and distribution in weed hosts in New Mexico.Over 4,950 asymptomatic weed samples from more than 20 weed species that are host plants for curtoviruses were collected from ten chile pepper fields in southern New Mexico (<e>NM</e>) during 2003, 2004 and 2005 to identify whether they were infected with curtoviruses and to determine which curtoviruses were distributed in the weed population. Polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to detect a portion of the coat protein (cp) gene were used to detect curtoviruses, and infected plants were further tested for specific curtoviruses using primers designed to detect to a portion of the replication-associated protein (rep) gene. Amplification of the cp gene was successful from 3.7, 1.17, and 1.9% of the weed samples in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Seventy-three amplicons from those samples were sequenced and compared to well-characterized curtoviruses. Analysis of the rep nucleotide sequences showed that approximately 32.9% of the weed isolates tested were closely related to beet mild curly top virus (BMCTV). Approximately 12.4% were closely related to beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV). The rest of the weed isolates (54.7%), which shared a very high level of nucleotide sequence identity to each other, represent a new curtovirus species. Using eight primers designed for PCR, complete genomes of three curtoviruses isolated from chile pepper samples representing the three groups of curtoviruses in southern New Mexico were sequenced. Comparisons of whole sequences of the genomes revealed that the DG2SW171601 isolate (2,929 nucleotides) was nearly identical to BMCTV-W4 (approximately 98% nucleotide sequence identity). The LRME27601 isolate (2,927 nucleotides) was most closely related to BSCTV (approximately 92% nucleotide sequence identity). The LJN17601 isolate (2,959 nucleotides) shared only from 49.9 to 88.8% nucleotide sequence identity with other well-characterized curtoviruses. Based on the accepted cut-off of 89%, we propose that the LJN17601 isolate is a member of a new curtovirus species. Chile peppers infected with this virus in the field express chlorotic stunting symptoms, so we propose the name pepper yellow dwarf virus (PeYDV). This new curtovirus species may be the result of mutations in the genome and recombination between BMCTV-W4 and BSCTV.",M2
18589950,"Rapid dissolution of soluble uranyl phases in arid, mine-impacted catchments near Church Rock, <e>NM</e>.We tested the hypothesis that runoff of uranium-bearing particles from mining waste disposal areas was a significant mechanism for redistribution of uranium in the northeastern part of the Upper Puerco River watershed (New Mexico). However, our results were not consistent with this hypothesis. Analysis of &gt; 100 sediment and suspended sediment samples collected adjacent to and downstream from uranium source areas indicated that uranium levels in the majority of the samples were not elevated above background. Samples collected within 50 m of a known waste disposal site were subjected to detailed geochemical characterization. Uranium in these samples was found to be highly soluble; treatment with synthetic pore water for 24 h caused dissolution of 10--50% of total uranium in the samples. Equilibrium uranium concentrations in pore water were &gt; 4.0 mg/L and were sustained in repeated wetting events, effectively depleting soluble uranium from the solid phase. The dissolution rate of uranium appeared to be controlled by solid-phase diffusion of uranium from within uranium-bearing mineral particles. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy indicated the presence of a soluble uranyl silicate, and possibly a uranyl phosphate. These phases were exhausted in transported sediment suggesting that uranium was readily mobilized from sediments in the Upper Puerco watershed and transported in the dissolved load. These results could have significance for uranium risk assessment as well as mining waste management and cleanup efforts.",M2
18484627,"Manufactured populations: what do contemporary reference skeletal collections represent? A comparative study using the Maxwell Museum documented collection.The extent to which archaeological or cemetery skeletal collections accurately represent the population from which they were drawn cannot be known. The creation of documented or forensic skeletal collections, derived from donation or autopsy, was intended to overcome many of the problems inherent in archaeological populations, yet it is misleading to assume such collections represent a specific or defined population. This study compares the documented skeletal collection curated at the Maxwell Museum to annual demographic information from three relevant populations: (i) the living population of New Mexico (<e>NM</e>), (ii) the deceased of NM, and (iii) the subset of decedents who undergo a medicolegal death investigation or autopsy. Results indicate that the Maxwell Documented collection differs significantly from all three populations in every variable examined: age, sex, ethnicity/race, cause, and manner of death. Collection development that relies on body donation or retention of unclaimed bodies under coroner/medical examiner statutes results in a biased sample, with significant overrepresentation of males, Whites, the elderly, those who die unnatural deaths and individuals with antemortem traumatic injury or surgical intervention. Equally problematic is the perception that the collection has documented race or ethnicity, when in fact only 17% was self-reported, while the affinity of the remaining individuals was determined by pathologists or other observers. Caution is warranted in how this and similar collections are used and interpreted by researchers. Although documented reference collections are useful in developing methods of estimating age or sex, they are not a proxy for modern or racially/ethnically defined populations.",M2
18460379,"Optimization of aeromedical base locations in New Mexico using a model that considers crash nodes and paths.In a recent paper, Tokar Erdemir et al. (2008) introduce models for service systems with service requests originating from both nodes and paths. We demonstrate how to apply and extend their approach to an aeromedical base location application, with specific focus on the state of New Mexico (<e>NM</e>). The current aeromedical base locations of NM are selected without considering motor vehicle crash paths. Crash paths are the roads on which crashes occur, where each road segment has a weight signifying relative crash occurrence. We analyze the loss in accident coverage and location error for current aeromedical base locations. We also provide insights on the relevance of considering crash paths when selecting aeromedical base locations. Additionally, we look briefly at some of the tradeoff issues in locating additional trauma centers vs. additional aeromedical bases in the current aeromedical system of NM. Not surprisingly, tradeoff analysis shows that by locating additional aeromedical bases, we always attain the required coverage level with a lower cost than with locating additional trauma centers.",M2
18366344,"Discovery of abundant cellulose microfibers encased in 250 Ma Permian halite: a macromolecular target in the search for life on other planets.In this study, we utilized transmission electron microscopy to examine the contents of fluid inclusions in halite (NaCl) and solid halite crystals collected 650 m below the surface from the Late Permian Salado Formation in southeastern New Mexico (USA). The halite has been isolated from contaminating groundwater since deposition approximately 250 Ma ago. We show that abundant cellulose microfibers are present in the halite and appear remarkably intact. The cellulose is in the form of 5 <e>nm</e> microfibers as well as composite ropes and mats, and was identified by resistance to 0.5 N NaOH treatment and susceptibility to cellulase enzyme treatment. These cellulose microfibers represent the oldest native biological macromolecules to have been directly isolated, examined biochemically, and visualized (without growth or replication) to date. This discovery points to cellulose as an ideal macromolecular target in the search for life on other planets in our Solar System.",M2
18318331,"Patient perspectives on disparities in healthcare from African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American samples including a secondary analysis of the Institute of Medicine focus group data.The existence of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare in the United States is well recognized. However, often overlooked in the planning and design of initiatives to address those disparities are the patient perspectives regarding the issues of racial and ethnic disparities that directly affect them. The objective of this study was to identify the patient priorities and to provide recommendations for action to improve minority health-care quality. A secondary objective was the qualitative analysis of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) focus group data. Six focus groups were conducted with nine participants in each. These included an African-American focus group in Washington, D.C., an African-American focus group in Los Angeles, an Asian focus group in Los Angeles, an Hispanic focus group in Washington, D.C., an Hispanic focus group in Los Angeles, and a Native American focus group in Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>. The barriers and priorities for action included difficulty in making informed choices when identifying and selecting providers, poor service delivery from medical office staff, the inefficiency of medical visits, provider communication and cultural competence barriers, and stressful treatment settings. Patient recommendations targeted provision of tools to empower patients throughout the process of care, provider and staff training in communication and cultural competence, alternate models of service delivery, and accessible mechanisms for evaluation and oversight. This study concluded that patient-identified priorities and recommendations warranted modification of current explanatory models for minority health-care quality and the provision of greater clarity regarding directions for policy and behavioral initiatives and criteria for performance evaluation be advanced.",M2
17967068,"Assessment of exposure risk of polychlorinated biphenyls to interior least terns (Sterna antillarum).Risk of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and effects were assessed for a colony of federally endangered interior least terns (Sterna antillarum) nesting on the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge (<e>NM</e>, USA). The colony feeds from an area on the Refuge (Hunter Marsh/Oxbow Complex) wherein fish with elevated concentrations of total PCBs have been documented. Concentrations of total PCBs in whole fish averaged 0.94 mg/kg with a maximum concentration of 2.77 mg/kg, wet weight. Estimated daily PCB intake rates by adult birds throughout their 180-d breeding season ranged from &lt;0.01 mg/kg/d to 0.98 mg/ kg/d, yielding hazard quotients that ranged from 0.01 to 21.68.

16930830,"TIPS (trigger an IIF paradigm shift).CHALLENGE: New Mexico Corporate Services (NMCS) recordable injuries have been averaging 2-4 per year for the last 5 years with no statistical improvement. However, we believe all <e>NM</e> employees must go home incident and injury free every day and just as healthy as they came to work. In addition, we have received feedback from several sources, that indicates some employees are reluctant to report injuries. These indicators showed us that continuing our current strategies, making incremental improvement and changes, would not give us the improvement desired. We needed a paradigm shift to get everyone completely engaged in the IIF (Incident &amp; Injury Free) culture, in order to achieve true IIF results. METHODS/STRATEGIES: We formed a small (3-person) taskforce consisting of safety representatives from EHS, Site Services and CS Operations. We reviewed 5 years worth of data to determine what was injuring our people. We also decided to review all injuries, not simply those classified as recordable by OSHA standards. First we identified the types of injury information needed to get a true picture of our safety issues. We analyzed IRB (Incident Review Board) data showing us the following factors and whether any of them contributed to the injury: - Date - Incident Description - Severity - Root Cause - Type of Injury - Season - Work Group/Shift - Area - Improper evaluation of hazard - Inadequate work procedures - Incorrect Mental Model - Inadequate PPE Requirement - Failure to Follow or Unaware of PPE Requirement - Shortcut or Schedule Pressure - Last or First Day of Shift or Adjacent to Holiday - OT - Aggravate Existing Condition - Inadequate Training or Passdown - Experience in Task - Corrective Action Taken - Overall Quality of Response. Once this information was collected for all injuries in an Excel file, we graphed it several ways to help reveal trends: Shift 7 had double the injuries of shift 5. Night shift injuries were relatively high but lower than Shift 7. Shift 5 had no severe (recordable) injuries. Biggest total injury type was ergonomic. Biggest recordable injury type (58%) was cuts/lacerations. Chemical exposure and inhalations resulted in no recordables. Biggest root cause category was behavioral. Biggest behavioral root cause was  Failure to Evaluate Hazards . Biggest administrative controls root cause was  Inadequate Procedures . Biggest engineering controls root cause was  Unrecognized Workplace Hazard . Majority of injuries occurred in Spring/Summer which accounted for 86% of recordables. Response was inadequate or poor for 25% of injuries. Number of injuries by workgroup were about equal. Work area injuries were mostly in the CUB and Subfab but CUB injuries favored cuts/lacerations while Subfab favored ergonomic injuries. These learnings and gaps were used to develop our New Mexico Site Safety Action Plan for 2005. It has also been used by individual managers and supervisors in their day-to-day business meetings, activities, and communications, for a more focused IIF message and effort. RESULTS: [graph: see text]. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Challenges are different amongst shifts. Shift culture may be stronger than workgroup culture. Work areas pose different challenges that all should be aware of and prepared for. We should prepare ourselves for challenges posed by the Spring and Summer seasons as well. We should be aware of and prepare for the different challenges and cultures characteristic of each shift. Supervisors need to spend more time in the field with their people to help them address safety issues and help make IIF a more consistent component of daily workgroup culture. Each site should analyze their data and look for their unique safety challenges. This will allow customized, focused action plans that meet the unique needs of each site.",M2
16599160,"Bionomics and distribution of species of Hystrichopsylla in Arizona and New Mexico, with a description of Hystrichopsylla dippiei obliqua, n. ssp. (Siphonaptera: Hystrichopsyllidae).More than 450 specimens of Hystrichopsylla were collected from nests and hosts of species of Microtus, Neotoma, Tamiasciurus, and Peromyscus in Arizona and New Mexico from 1981-2004. A new subspecies, Hystrichopsylla dippiei obliqua, is described and a map illustrating the distribution of the three taxa (Hystrichopsylla dippiei truncata Holland, H. d. obliqua, and H. occidentalis sylvaticus Campos and Stark) occurring in Arizona and New Mexico is provided. Hystrichopsylla. o. sylvaticus is reported in New Mexico for the first time and H. d. truncata is a new record in Rio Aribba County, <e>NM</e>. Relationships of Mexican species are also discussed. These large fleas are seldom collected from the fur of their mammalian hosts (usually singly) but are prevalent in moist nests. The maximum number of the new subspecies collected from a single nest was 54. Dry nests, particularly those that are not subterranean or otherwise protected from desiccation, do not support development of Hystrichopsylla fleas. Minimum elevation at which H. dippiei ssp. is found in Arizona and New Mexico appears to be about 2,100 m.",M2
16570594,"Perchlorate in pleistocene and holocene groundwater in north-central New Mexico.Groundwater from remote parts of the Middle Rio Grande Basin in north-central New Mexico has perchlorate (ClO4-) concentrations of 0.12-1.8 micro/L. Because the water samples are mostly preanthropogenic in age (0-28000 years) and there are no industrial sources in the study area, a natural source of the ClO4- is likely. Most of the samples have Br-, Cl-, and SO4(2-) concentrations that are similar to those of modern bulk atmospheric deposition with evapotranspiration (ET) factors of about 7-40. Most of the ET values for Pleistocene recharge were nearly twice that for Holocene recharge. The N03-/Cl- and CIO-/Cl-ratios are more variable than those of Br-/Cl- or S04(2-)/Cl-. Samples thought to have recharged under the most arid conditions in the Holocene have relatively high N03-/Cl- ratios and low delta 15N values (+1 per mil (% per thousand)) similar to those of modern bulk atmospheric N deposition. The delta 18O values of the N03- (-4 to 0% per thousand) indicate that atmospheric N03- was not transmitted directly to the groundwater but may have been cycled in the soils before infiltrating. Samples with nearly atmospheric N03-/CI- ratios have relatively high Cl04- concentrations (1.0-1.8 ug/L) with a nearly constant Cl04-/CI- mole ratio of (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4), which would be consistent with an average Cl04-concentration of 0.093 0.005 ,ug/L in bulk atmospheric deposition during the late Holocene in north-central <e>NM</e>. Samples thought to have recharged under wetter conditions have higher delta 15N values (+3 to +8 % per thousando), lower NO3-/Cl- ratios, and lower ClO4-/Cl- ratios than the ones most likely to preserve an atmospheric signal. Processes in the soils that may have depleted atmospherically derived NO3-also may have depleted ClO4- to varying degrees prior to recharge. If these interpretations are correct, then ClO4- concentrations of atmospheric origin as high as 4 microg/L are possible in preanthropogenic groundwater in parts of the Southwest where ET approaches a factor of 40. Higher Cl04- concentrations in uncontaminated groundwater could occur in recharge beneath arid areas where ET is greater than 40, where long-term accumulations of atmospheric salts are leached suddenly from dry soils, or where other (nonatmospheric) natural sources of ClO4- exist.",M2
16555135,"Temporal and spatial variation in alkaloid levels in Achnatherum robustum, a native grass infected with the endophyte Neotyphodium.The native North American perennial grass Achnatherum robustum (Vasey) Barkworth [= Stipa robusta (Vasey) Scribn.] or sleepygrass is toxic and narcotic to livestock. The causative agents are alkaloidal mycotoxins produced from infections by a systemic and asexual Neotyphodium endophyte. Recent studies suggest that toxicity is limited across the range of sleepygrass in the Southwest USA. We sampled 17 populations of sleepygrass with varying distance from one focal population known for its high toxicity levels near Cloudcroft, <e>NM</e>, USA. For some, we sampled individual plants twice within the same growing season and over successive years (2001-2004). We also determined infection levels in each population. In general, all populations were highly infected, but infection levels were more variable near the focal population. Only infected plants within populations near the Cloudcroft area produced alkaloids. The ergot alkaloid, ergonovine, comprised the bulk of the alkaloids, with lesser amounts of lysergic and isolysergic acid amides and ergonovinine alkaloids. Levels of all alkaloids were positively correlated among individual plants within and between growing seasons. Infected plants that produced no alkaloids in 1 yr did not produce any alkaloids within the same growing season or in other years. Levels of alkaloids in sleepygrass populations declined with distance from the Cloudcroft population, although infection levels increased. Infected plants in populations in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado produced no alkaloids at all despite 100% infectivity. Our results suggest that only specific Neotyphodium haplotypes or specific Neotyphodium-grass combinations produce ergot alkaloids in sleepygrass. The Neotyphodium haplotype or host-endophyte combination that produces toxic levels of alkaloids appears restricted to one locality across the range of sleepygrass. Because of the wide variation in alkaloid levels among populations, interactions between the endophyte and host, and consequences for herbivores, competitors, and pathogens and other components of the community, are likely to vary widely across the geographic range of this native grass.",M2
16518736,"Web-based primary care referral program associated with reduced emergency department utilization.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uninsured patients without a primary care home tend to use the emergency department (ED) for primary care. We examined whether an enhanced scheduling system for follow-up care from the University of New Mexico Hospital Emergency Department (UNMH-ED) that assigns patients to a family medicine home can decrease ED utilization. METHODS: The Community Access Program for Central New Mexico (CAP-<e>NM</e>) is a consortium of primary care safety net provider organizations. CAP-NM developed a HIPAA-compliant (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), Web-based information system used by the UNMH-ED to refer uninsured, unassigned patients to family medicine practices ( homes ) within the consortium. The Web site referral system operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; printed maps to clinic sites; and listed services offered. Analysis of quality assurance data compared (1) ED utilization outcomes of eligible patients referred by the CAP-NM Web site to a family medicine home to (2) outcomes of controls discharged from the ED in the usual manner. RESULTS: The 756 patients referred to family medicine homes through the CAP-NM Web site demonstrated a significant 31% reduction in subsequent ED visits compared to controls. This reduction was most evident among those who had infrequent ED use before institution of the program. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an enhanced referral system to family medicine homes from the ED is associated with decreased subsequent ED utilization by uninsured patients.",M2
16342253,"Changing patterns of gallbladder carcinoma in New Mexico.BACKGROUND: American Indians in the U.S. have a high incidence of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Furthermore, American Indians in New Mexico (<e>NM</e>) have the highest incidence rate of GBC in the U.S. The epidemiology of GBC in NM has not been studied in the past 3 decades. METHODS: By using the NM Tumor Registry (NMTR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, age-specific incidence rates, average annual age-adjusted incidence rates, and incidence rate time trends of GBC were compared among the three major ethnic groups in NM: American Indians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites, for the period 1973-2001. RESULTS: A sharp increase in GBC incidence occurred with advanced age and started earlier in American Indians (at age 55) than Hispanics (at age 60) than non-Hispanic whites (at age 65). GBC occurred more frequently in females than in males in all ethnic groups. In females, the incidence of GBC was the highest in American Indians (14.5 per 100,000) followed by Hispanics (6.8 per 100,000) and non-Hispanic whites (1.4 per 100,000). Similarly in males, American Indians had the highest incidence rate of GBC (7.8 per 100,000), followed by Hispanics (2.0 per 100,000), and non-Hispanic whites (1.0 per 100,000). The time trend analysis revealed that there has been a disproportionate decline in the incidence of GBC in the three ethnic groups, with the greatest drop in American Indians and Hispanics followed by non-Hispanic whites. Despite the decline, American Indians continued to have the highest incidence rate of GBC in NM. CONCLUSION: The incidence of GBC has declined disproportionately in the three major ethnic groups, with the greatest decrease in American Indians and Hispanics followed by non-Hispanic whites.",M2
16313947,"Occurrence of antibiotics in hospital, residential, and dairy effluent, municipal wastewater, and the Rio Grande in New Mexico.This study had three objectives: 1) determine occurrence of antibiotics in effluent from hospitals, residential facilities, and dairies, and in municipal wastewater 2) determine antibiotic removal at a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>, and 3) determine concentrations of antibiotics in the Rio Grande, which receives wastewater from the Albuquerque WWTP. Twenty-three samples of wastewater and 3 samples of Rio Grande water were analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotics. Fifty-eight percent of samples had at least one antibiotic present while 25% had three or more. Hospital effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lincomycin, and penicillin G, with 4 of 5 hospital samples having at least one antibiotic detected and 3 having four or more. At the residential sampling sites, ofloxacin was found in effluent from assisted living and retirement facilities, while the student dormitory had no detects. Only lincomycin was detected in dairy effluent (in 2 of 8 samples, at 700 and 6600 ng/L). Municipal wastewater had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, with 4 of 6 samples having at least one antibiotic present and 3 having 3 or more. The relatively high concentrations (up to 35,500 ng/L) of ofloxacin found in hospital and residential effluent may be of concern due to potential genotoxic effects and development of antibiotic resistance. At the Albuquerque WWTP, both raw wastewater and treated effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and ofloxacin, at concentrations ranging from 110 to 470 ng/L. However, concentrations in treated effluent were reduced by 20% to 77%. No antibiotics were detected in the Rio Grande upstream of the Albuquerque WWTP discharge, and only one antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, was detected in the Rio Grande (300 ng/L) below the WWTP.",M2
16300222,"Particle size and composition related to adverse health effects in aged, sensitive rats.Small increases in concentrations of ambient particulate matter (PM*) have been linked to adverse health effects, especially in older people and people with preexisting respiratory disease. Some epidemiologic studies have shown the association to be stronger with PM less than 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) than with PM less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10). Some scientists and regulators suggest that 2.5 microm might be an arbitrary cutoff and that the effects might be more pronounced for PM less than 0.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine PM). Our first aim was to determine the relation between size of respirable particles and particle toxicity, as well as the health effects of short-term increases (spikes) in particle concentration against backgrounds of relatively low or high baseline exposures. Our second aim was to determine the effect of spikes in concentration of fine particles (0.7 microm in mass median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD]) and ultrafine particles (35 <e>nm</e> in count median diameter [CMD]) of disparate composition: vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and carbon black. The relative toxicity of these particles was determined in aged rats with mild pulmonary inflammation induced by instilled endotoxin. Our third aim was to determine the influence of age (aged vs young adult) on particle-induced toxicity in these rats.",M2
16227080,"Environmental contaminants and biomarker responses in fish from the Rio Grande and its U.S. tributaries: spatial and temporal trends.We collected, examined, and analyzed 368 fish of seven species from 10 sites on rivers of the Rio Grande Basin (RGB) during late 1997 and early 1998 to document temporal and geographic trends in the concentrations of accumulative contaminants and to assess contaminant effects on the fish. Sites were located on the mainstem of the Rio Grande and on the Arroyo Colorado and Pecos River in Texas (TX), New Mexico (<e>NM</e>), and Colorado. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were the targeted species. Fish were examined in the field for internal and external visible gross lesions, selected organs were weighed to compute ponderal and organosomatic indices, and samples of tissues and fluids were obtained and preserved for analysis of fish health and reproductive biomarkers. Whole fish from each station were composited by species and gender and analyzed for organochlorine chemical residues and elemental contaminants using instrumental methods, and for 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin-like activity (TCDD-EQ) using the H4IIE rat hepatoma cell bioassay. Overall, fish from lower RGB stations contained greater concentrations of organochlorine pesticide residues and appeared to be less healthy than those from sites in the central and upper parts of the basin, as indicated by a general gradient of residue concentrations and biomarker responses. A minimal number of altered biomarkers and few or no elevated contaminant concentrations were noted in fish from the upper RGB. The exception was elevated concentrations [up to 0.46 microg/g wet-weight (ww)] of total mercury (Hg) in predatory species from the Rio Grande at Elephant Butte Reservoir, NM, a condition documented in previous studies. Arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) concentrations were greatest in fish from sites in the central RGB; Se concentrations in fish from the Pecos River at Red Bluff Lake, TX and from the Rio Grande at Langtry, TX and Amistad International Reservoir, TX exceeded published fish and wildlife toxicity thresholds. In the lower RGB, residues of p,p'-DDT metabolites (&lt;or=1.69 microg/g ww), chlordane-related compounds (&lt;or=0.21 microg/g ww), dieldrin (&lt;or=0.0.05 microg/g ww), and toxaphene (&lt;or=2.4 microg/g ww) were detected in fish from most sites; maximum concentrations were in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) from the Arroyo Colorado at Harlingen, TX. Concentrations of one or more residues exceeded toxicity thresholds for fish and wildlife in fish from this site and from the Rio Grande at Mission, TX and Brownsville, TX; however, concentrations were lower than those reported by previous studies. In addition, the proportional concentrations of p,p'-DDT at all sites were low, indicating weathered DDT rather than the influx of new material. Concentrations of total PCBs (&lt;0.05 microg/g ww) and TCDD-EQ (&lt;or=6 pg/g ww) were comparatively low in all samples. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in some fish was elevated relative to reference rates at most sites, but was generally lower than previously reported activity in fish from heavily contaminated locations. The comparatively low PCB and TCDD-EQ concentrations together with elevated EROD activity may reflect exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Reproductive biomarkers were consistent with chronic contaminant exposure at lower RGB sites; comparatively large percentages of intersex male largemouth bass, relatively low gonadosomatic indices, and elevated plasma vitellogenin concentrations in male fish were noted at three of the four stations. Large percentages of atretic eggs were also observed in the ovaries of female common carp from the Rio Grande at Brownsville, TX. Although many of the conditions noted may have other causes in addition to contaminant exposure, the biomarker results for the lower RGB sites are consistent with subtle responses of fish to contaminants, an interpretation supported by the chemical data of this and other investigations.",M2
15919543,"Nutrient and organic carbon trends and patterns in the upper Rio Grande, 1975-1999.Nutrient patterns and trends were analyzed using USGS water quality data collected from 1975 to 1999 along the uppermost 600 km of the Rio Grande in Colorado and New Mexico. Data on discharge, pH, organic carbon (total), N-NH(4+)+organic N (total), NH4+ (dissolved), N-NO(2-)+N-NO3- (dissolved), phosphorus (total), and P-orthophosphate (dissolved) came from six USGS stations--Lobatos, Taos Junction, Otowi, San Felipe, Isleta and Bernardo--ranging from the Colorado-New Mexico border to about 80 km below Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>. Kendall's S and Seasonal Kendall's S' were used to measure trend, and ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to analyze spatial differences between stations. Temporal trend analyses show widespread decreases in N and P concentrations at most stations, likely due to improvements in sewage treatment and dilution from increasing discharge. N-NO(2-)+N-NO3- (dissolved) and total nitrate load increases at Isleta and Bernardo, likely due to improved nitrification in sewage treatment and to increasing human population. Spatial analyses show large increases for most parameters at Isleta. All parameters show decreases again at Bernardo, about 50 km downstream from Isleta, except for N-NO(2-)+N-NO3- (dissolved), which continues to increase. Urbanization in the Albuquerque area significantly impacts downstream river nutrient levels.",M2
15828677,"PM source identification at Sunland Park, New Mexico, using a simple heuristic meteorological and chemical analysis.The causes for evening low-wind PM10 and PM2.5 peaks at Sunland Park, <e>NM</e>, were investigated by using wind sector analysis and by assessing relationships between PM loadings and meteorological parameters through canonical ordination analysis. Both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations during the evening hours accounted for approximately 50% of their respective 24-hr averages, and the PM10 was mainly composed of coarse material (PM10-2.5 amounted to 77% of PM10). A wind sector analysis based on data from three surface meteorological monitoring stations in the region narrowed the potential source region for PM10 and PM2.5 to an area within a few kilometers south of Sunland Park. Canonical ordination analysis confirmed that the peak frequently occurred under stable conditions with weak southerly winds. Chemical analyses of PM showed that elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC, respectively) dominate PM2.5 and inorganic elements dominate PM10-2.5. The combined data for EC/OC, geologic elements, and various trace elements indicate that under low wind and stable conditions, traffic-related PM emissions (motor vehicle exhausts and re-suspended road dust) from the south of the site are the most likely sources for the evening PM10 and PM2.5 peaks.",M2
15823335,"Characterization of a military training site containing 232Thorium.Understanding contaminant distribution is critical to selection and implementation of effective and affordable containment and remediation efforts. This article describes the characterization of soil containing thorium at a training site on Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>. The site has been used by the Defense Nuclear Weapons School since the early 1960's to train personnel in emergency response to nuclear weapons accidents and for characterization and containment of radioactive contamination. The purpose of work reported herein is to describe the primary location and migration pattern of 232Thorium (232Th) and 232Th progeny (decay products) at the site. Soil containing thorium oxide (ThO2) was applied to the site for approximately 30 years (early 1960-1990) and was used to simulate a plutonium release from a nuclear weapons accident. Data presented indicate that surface 232Th and 232Th progeny at approximately 5 times background levels are approaching test site boundaries. However, the data also indicate that vertical migration has not exceeded 0.9 m because of the insoluble nature of ThO2. The major mechanisms of 232Th mobility appear to be surface migration mediated by precipitation runoff and wind-blown soil.",M2
15573041,"Previous emergency department use among homicide victims and offenders: a case-control study.STUDY OBJECTIVE: We differentiate risk factors for future homicide victimization and offending, and we measure emergency department (ED) use among homicide victims, offenders, and controls. METHODS: The design was a matched case-control study conducted in Bernalillo County, <e>NM</e>, and its university-affiliated health sciences center and hospital. All Bernalillo County homicide victims (N=124) and offenders (N=138) identified between January 1996 and December 2001 who were linked to university physician billing records and who had health care use during the 3 years before the homicide incident were included as cases. Randomly selected age-matched (+/-1 year) and sex-matched subjects with health care use within 3 years of their matched pair's homicide were included as controls. Main outcome measures were the number and type of ED visits by cases and controls. RESULTS: Among the 124 victims and 138 offenders who used health care, most were men (80%) and averaged 27.7 years of age. Victims and offenders had similar health care use and were grouped for final analyses. Cases (victims and offenders) were more likely to have had an ED visit within 3 years of the homicide (85%) compared with controls (59%) (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0 to 6.2). Within previous ED visits, assault (OR 4.5; 95% CI 2.9 to 7.0), firearm injury (OR 13.6; 95% CI 4.9 to 37.7), and substance abuse (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.2 to 6.0) were associated with future homicide. ED visits clustered closer to the homicide incident for cases (median days before the homicide -402 days; 95% CI -434 to -364) compared with controls (median -487 days; 95% CI -498 to -474). CONCLUSION: Patients with ED visits for assault, firearm injuries, and substance abuse are at increased risk for homicide and often have an escalating number of visits leading up to the homicide event. ED-based identification and referral programs similar to those used for intimate partner violence or other preventive strategies should be considered for this high-risk population.",M2

The study question was,  Did patient medical needs differ after these hurricanes?  METHODS: DESIGN: Retrospective cohort review. SUBJECTS: All patients evaluated by NM-1 DMAT following Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. OBSERVATIONS: Age, past medical history, chief complaint, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, treatments, triage level, and disposition. Age was analyzed using Student's t-test, other data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 1,056 patients were evaluated. Age distributions did not differ between events. More patients had co-morbidities after Hurricane Andrew. The only difference in chief complaint was that more patients complained of  cold  symptoms following Hurricane Iniki. The only differences in diagnoses were for upper respiratory infections, which were diagnosed more often after Hurricane Iniki. There were no differences in the administration of tetanus toxoid, antibiotics, or analgesics. Patients evaluated after Hurricane Andrew had more diagnostic tests performed and a higher illness/injury acuity. The proportion of the total number of patients conveyed to a hospital did not differ. CONCLUSION: Patient needs were similar after Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki and may be applicable for predicting the needs of patients for future hurricanes.",M2

15078234,"New Mexico's 1998 drive-up liquor window closure. Study I: effect on alcohol-involved crashes.AIMS: To determine the spatial relationship between drive-up liquor window locations and alcohol-related traffic crashes for 2 years before and after New Mexico banned drive-through alcohol sales. DESIGN: Current liquor licenses, crash data, roadway information and US Census data were used in this analysis. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analyses were applied to the entire state, and to Albuquerque only. FINDINGS: Of all <e>NM</e> liquor licenses, 189 (9%) included drive-up sales, which co-occurred with on- or off-premise licenses (94%). The rate of non-pedestrian alcohol-related crashes relative to non-pedestrian total crashes showed an increasing trend prior to closure and a decreasing trend after the closure. Cross-sectional analyses in Albuquerque revealed that the percentage of alcohol-involved crashes was not related to densities of on- or off-premise outlets per kilometer of roadway, or to percentage of drive-up outlets. Statewide, the percentage of drive-up outlets was not significantly related to the percentage of alcohol-related crashes within census tracts but was associated positively with the percentage of alcohol-related crashes in surrounding census tracts. There was no statistically significant relationship between number of drive-ups and percentage of alcohol-related crashes in either longitudinal model. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the declining rate of alcohol-related crashes following closure of drive-up liquor windows, both in Albuquerque and statewide, regression models using spatial data do not demonstrate definitively an association between the decline and the closure of the drive-up liquor windows.",M2

Our hypothesis was that flood and hurricane victims have different medical conditions and needs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patient records for NM-1DMAT deployments to Hurricane Andrew in Florida (August 1992) and the Houston, TX flood caused by Tropical Storm Allison (June 2001). We compared age, gender, chief complaint, medical history, diagnosis, diagnostic testing, treatment rendered, triage category, and patient disposition. RESULTS: We found several differences between the patients presenting after Hurricane Andrew and those presenting after Tropical Storm Allison. The chief complaint, diagnosis, presence of medical history, diagnostic testing, treatment rendered, triage category, and disposition all differed between the 2 disasters. The mean ages in both groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The needs of the patients differed in several areas between Hurricane Andrew and the Houston flood. This information should be tested in a future hurricane or flood and taken into account when planning for deployments.",M2

ANIMALS: 200 calves. PROCEDURE: Calves from Arkansas (AR calves; n = 100; mean body weight, 205 kg) were purchased from an order buyer barn. Calves from New Mexico (<e>NM</e> calves; n = 100; mean body weight, 188 kg) were obtained from a single ranch. Calves were transported to a feedyard, where half of each group was exposed intranasally with LktA-deficient MH at the time of arrival. Calves were observed daily for respiratory tract disease (RTD), and nasal swab specimens were collected periodically to determine nasopharyngeal colonization status with MH. Serum samples were assayed for antibodies to MH. RESULTS: 15 AR calves had nasopharyngeal colonization by wild-type MH at the order buyer barn, whereas none of the NM calves had nasopharyngeal colonization. Intranasal exposure to LktA-deficient MH elicited an increase in serum antibody titers against MH in NM calves, but titers were less in NM calves treated for RTD. Exposure of NM calves to LktA-deficient MH offered protection from nasopharyngeal colonization by wild-type MH. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Exposure of calves to LktA-deficient MH elicited an increase in serum antibody titers against MH and decreased colonization of the nasopharynx by wild-type MH. Earlier exposure would likely allow an immune response to develop before transportation and offer protection from nasopharyngeal colonization and pneumonia caused by wild-type MH.",M2
12754659,"Characterization of microbial activities and U reduction in a shallow aquifer contaminated by uranium mill tailings.A characterization of the Shiprock, <e>NM</e>, uranium mill tailing site focused on the geochemical and microbiological factors governing in-situ uranium-redox reactions. Groundwater and aqueous extracts of sediment samples contained a wide concentration range of sulfate, nitrate, and U(VI) with median values of 21.2 mM, 16.1 micro M, and 2.7 micro M, respectively. Iron(III) was not detected in groundwater, but a median value of 0.3 mM in sediment extracts was measured. Bacterial diversity down gradient from the disposal pile reflected the predominant geochemistry with relatively high numbers of sulfate- and nitrate-reducing microorganisms, and smaller numbers of acetogenic, methanogenic, nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing, Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. In aquifer slurry incubations, nitrate reduction was always preferred and had a negative impact on sulfate-, Fe(III)-, and U-reduction rates. We also found that sulfate-reduction rates decreased sharply in the presence of clay, while Fe(III)-reduction increased with no clear impact on U reduction. In the absence of clay, iron and sulfate reduction correlated with concentrations of Fe(III) and sulfate, respectively. Rates of U(VI) loss did not correlate with the concentration of any electron acceptor. With the exception of Fe(III), electron donor amendment was largely unsuccessful in stimulating electron acceptor loss over a 2-week incubation period, suggesting that endogenous forms of organic matter were sufficient to support microbial activity. Our findings suggest that efforts to accelerate biological U reduction should initially focus on stimulating nitrate removal.",M2

12653023,"Consistency among methods of assessing concerns about the Los Alamos National Laboratory.In making environmental remediation and restoration decisions, risk assessors and managers need to take into account the environmental concerns of people living around an industrial facility, as well as those residing in the general region. Yet such information is usually anecdotal rather than quantitative, and rarely compares perceptions among different alternatives methods. The concerns of individuals living in Santa Fe, <e>NM</e>, near the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) were characterized. On an open-ended question, the public's greatest concerns were for contamination (35%), ecological health (16%) and human health (14%). When asked to rate their level of concern from a list of possible concerns, people rated accidents/spills and storage of additional nuclear material the highest, and changes in property values the lowest. Unexpectedly, ethnicity, education, and income did not explain variations in ratings for most concerns about LANL. There was generally agreement between the concerns expressed on the ratings and on the open-ended question, although on the latter individuals expressed concern for larger issues, rather than specific issues. Preferences for future land use reflected their concerns for maintaining a safety buffer of an ecosystem around the site.",M2
12477131,"Is alcohol intake associated with breast cancer in Hispanic women? The New Mexico Women's Health Study.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown an increased breast cancer risk associated with modest or high alcohol intake, however, few of these studies have included Hispanic women. The alcohol/breast cancer association was investigated in a New Mexico (<e>NM</e>) statewide bi-ethnic study. DESIGN: A population-based, case-control study. METHODS: Incident breast cancer cases (N = 712), aged 30-74 years, were ascertained by the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR). Controls (N = 844) were identified by random digit dialing and were frequency-matched for ethnicity, age-group, and health planning district. Data were collected via in-person interview, which included questions regarding recent and past alcohol intake and breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: The highest level of recent alcohol intake, compared to no intake, was associated with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal Hispanic women (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0 95%, confidence interval [CI] 0.8-5.1, 42+ grams/ week) and postmenopausal non-Hispanic White women (OR = 2.2, 95% Cl 1.0-5.0, 148+ grams/week), although estimates were unstable and statistically non-significant. Lower recent alcohol intake (&lt; 148 grams/week) was associated with reduced risk for non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 0.49, 95% Cl 0.35-0.69). This pattern was independent of hormone-receptor status and was present for both premenopausal (OR = 0.29, 95% Cl 0.15-0.56) and postmenopausal women (OR = 0.56, 95% Cl 0.35-0.90). Results for past alcohol intake and breast cancer association did not demonstrate any trends and were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol intake does not appear to have a consistent or significant association with breast cancer in Hispanic women.",M2

12371498,"Effects of depleted uranium on the health and survival of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Hyalella azteca.Depleted uranium (DU) has been used as a substitute for the fissionable enriched uranium component of atomic weapons tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, <e>NM</e>, USA) since the early 1950s, resulting in considerable concentrations of DU in the soils within the test sites. Although the movement of DU into major aquatic systems has been shown to be minimal, there are many small-order ephemeral streams and areas of standing water in canyons throughout LANL that may be affected by inputs of DU via runoff, erosion, and leaching. Ninety-six-hour acute and 7-d chronic toxicity assays were conducted to measure the toxicity of DU on survival and reproduction of Ceriodaphnia dubia. A 14-d water-only assay was conducted to measure survival and growth of Hyalella azteca. The estimated median lethal concentration (LC50) to produce 50% mortality of the test population for the 96-h Ceriodaphnia dubia assay was 10.50 mg/L. Reproductive effects occurred at a lowest-observable-effect concentration &gt; or = 3.91 mg/L with a no-observable-effect concentration of 1.97 mg/L. The estimated 14-d LC50 for the Hyalella azteca assay was 1.52 mg/L. No significant relationship was detected between growth and DU concentrations. Concentrations at which toxicity effects were observed in this study for both invertebrates exceeded concentrations of total uranium observed in runoff from LANL lands. Thus, it is likely that current runoff levels of uranium do not pose a threat to these types of aquatic invertebrates.",M2

Sand flies were captured only in up-draft suction/light traps. This record is of interest for the following reasons: (1) sand flies have not been reported from the Rio Grande River Valley of New Mexico, (2) sand flies are biological vectors of VS viruses in other areas, (3) the mid-Rio Grande River Valley has been a focus of VS virus activity in domestic livestock during recent outbreaks, and (4) the source of vesicular stomatitis viruses that infect livestock in the western United States is unknown, but may involve introductions of virus from Mexico or an endemic cycle maintained by vector insects.",M2

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Elderly Hispanic individuals (n = 414) and non-Hispanic white individuals (n = 469) aged &gt; or =65 years, randomly selected from the Medicare rolls of Bernalillo County (Albuquerque), <e>NM</e>, were recruited for an interview/examination that included an evaluation of glucose tolerance. Information on nine tests of cognitive function and two measures of depression allowed comparisons between diabetic status and these functions. Comparisons also were made between glycosolated hemoglobin concentrations and these cognitive tests in the 188 participants with diabetes. RESULTS: None of the mean scores on the tests of cognitive function was significantly lower in the participants with diabetes compared with those participants with normal glucose tolerance after adjustments for ethnicity, sex, age, level of education, and presence of depression, with or without elimination of those with dementia (Mini-Mental State Exam &lt;18). Interestingly, participants with impaired glucose tolerance tended to score higher than those with normal glucose tolerance. No significant associations were found between glycosolated hemoglobin concentrations and cognitive test scores in participants with diabetes.

11285934,"Modeling solute diffusion in the presence of pore-scale heterogeneity: method development and an application to the Culebra dolomite member of the Rustler Formation, New Mexico, USA.Previous studies have revealed the presence of pore-scale variability in diffusivity in the Culebra (dolomite) member of the Rustler Formation, <e>NM</e>. In this study, eight laboratory-scale diffusion experiments on five Culebra samples were analyzed using a methodology for modeling solute diffusion through porous media in the presence of multiple matrix diffusivities, Dp. A lognormal distribution of Dp is assumed within each of the lab samples. The estimated standard deviation (sigma d) of ln(Dp) within each sample ranges from 0 to 1, with most values lying between 0.5 and 1. The variability over all samples leads to a combined sigma d in the range of 1.0-1.2, which is consistent with the distribution of independently determined formation factor measurements for similar Culebra samples. A comparison of our estimation results to other rock properties suggests that, at the lab-scale, the geometric mean of Dp increases with bulk porosity and the quantity of macroscopic features such as vugs and fractures. However, sigma d appears to be determined by variability within such macroscopic features and/or by micropore-scale heterogeneity. In addition, comparison of these experiments to those at larger spatial scales suggests that increasing sample volume results in an increase in sigma d.",M2
11071320,"Recreation and risk around Los Alamos: are Hispanics more at risk?The Department of Energy (DOE) and other federal facilities are involved in massive remediation and restoration efforts on lands that may eventually be turned over for recreation or other uses by the public. In addition, other sites are expected to continue their ongoing missions, but recreation may be sanctioned, or not discouraged, on their remediated lands. Understanding the amount and types of recreation of regional residents who might use such lands, as well as their willingness to use these lands, is critical to determining both cleanup and restoration standards, and potential future risk. In this article the recreational rates, current recreational use, and willingness to recreate on Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are examined for 356 people interviewed at a well-attended gun show in Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>. There were few significant ethnic differences in recreational rates, although Hispanics had higher fishing rates and lower bird-watching rates than whites. Women hunted less, and photographed more, than men. Younger people fished and hunted more, and bird-watched less, than older people. There were no differences in recreational rates as a function of income or education. These data can be used for understanding potential exposure of people in the vicinity of Los Alamos.",M2

Pinon pine is used for firewood, fence posts, and building materials and is a source of nuts for food--the seeds are consumed by a wide variety of animals and are also gathered by people in the area and eaten raw or roasted. This study investigated the (1) concentration of 3H, 137Cs, 90Sr, totU, 238Pu, 239,240Pu, and 241Am in soils (0- to 12-in. [31 cm] depth underneath the tree), pinon pine shoots (PPS), and pinon pine nuts (PPN) collected from LANL lands and regional background (BG) locations, (2) committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) from the ingestion of nuts, and (3) soil to PPS to PPN concentration ratios (CRs). Most radionuclides, with the exception of 3H in soils, were not significantly higher (p &lt; 0.10) in soils, PPS, and PPN collected from LANL as compared to BG locations, and concentrations of most radionuclides in PPN fromLANL have decreased over time. The maximum net CEDE (the CEDE plus two sigma minus BG) at the most conservative ingestion rate (10 lb [4.5 kg]) was 0.0018 mrem (0.018 microSv); this is far below the International Commission on Radiological Protection (all pathway) permissible dose limit of 100 mrem (1000 microSv).

Enrichment cultures originally inoculated with ground sandstone material obtained from a Cretaceous formation in central New Mexico were grown with hydrogen in a mineral medium supplemented with 0.02% yeast extract. Sulfate reduction and acetogenesis occurred in these cultures, and the two most abundant organisms carrying out the reactions were isolated. Based on 16S rRNA analysis data and on substrate utilization patterns, these organisms were named Desulfomicrobium hypogeium sp. nov. and Acetobacterium psammolithicum sp. nov. The steady-state H2 concentrations measured in sandstone-sediment slurries (threshold concentration, 5 <e>nM</e>), in pure cultures of sulfate reducers (threshold concentration, 2 nM), and in pure cultures of acetogens (threshold concentrations 195 to 414 nM) suggest that sulfate reduction is the dominant terminal electron-accepting process in the ecosystem examined.

9805519,"Drive-up liquor windows and convicted drunk drivers: a comparative analysis of place of purchase.This study examined alcohol purchase locations of convicted drunk drivers to determine the characteristics and arrest circumstances of offenders who bought alcohol at a drive-up liquor window compared with those who obtained alcohol elsewhere. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between purchase location and the characteristics of 2,544 drunk drivers convicted in Santa Fe, <e>NM</e>, from 1986 to 1995. Analyses were performed to determine whether the place of purchase was related to arrest circumstances. The results revealed that drive-up windows were the preferred place of purchase of package liquor by offenders who bought the alcohol that they drank prior to arrest. The odds of being Hispanic (p &lt; 0.0001), a high-risk problem drinker (p &lt; 0.01), and drinking in the vehicle prior to arrest (p &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher for drive-up window users than for offenders who purchased package liquor elsewhere. Based on these analyses, this study concludes that a statistically significant relationship exists between the use of drive-up windows and certain high-risk drinking behaviors. This increased use among vulnerable populations suggests that drive-up windows may facilitate alcohol misuse in these populations and thereby contribute to drunk driving.",M2

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Elderly Hispanics (n = 414) and non-Hispanic whites (n = 469), randomly selected from the Medicare rolls of Bernalillo County (Albuquerque, <e>NM</e>; age &gt; or = 65 years), underwent a home interview followed by an interview/examination by a nurse-practitioner, nurse, and nutritionist that included an evaluation of glucose tolerance. Prevalences of total and central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and microalbuminuria also were determined. History of myocardial infarction, recent angina, and/or coronary bypass graft, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were used to document CHD. RESULTS: Elderly Hispanics had twice the prevalence of type 2 diabetes compared with non-Hispanic whites, but the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance was not increased in Hispanics. Mean serum fasting and 2-h post-glucola insulin concentrations, fasting insulin resistance indexes, and HbA1c were higher in Hispanics. Hispanics were shorter, weighed less, and had more total body and central obesity. The higher prevalences of dyslipidemia in Hispanics could be explained by a higher prevalence of diabetes. The prevalences of hypertension and CHD were not different for the two ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly Hispanics had twice the prevalence of diabetes and higher prevalences of cardiovascular risk factors associated with IRS.

More than 90% of the children were found to have Der p 2-specific IgG antibodies, although the levels of both IgG PAN and IgG 1-4 Ab were substantially higher in the high exposure group (P = 0.001). In addition, there was considerable overlap between these two groups in all Ab measurements. The presence of IgG anti-Der p 2 Ab in the Los Alamos children was unexpected and suggests continuing Ag exposure, although the source of such exposure is not apparent. There is no correlation between RAST (+) and RAST (-) subjects with respect to the level of IgG Ab measured by ELISA. These results suggest that the IgG Ab response to house dust mite has been underestimated in the RAST negative population. Two twin pairs were included in this study and the divergent and varied Ab responses in these individuals indicate that factors in addition to environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility require further investigation and provide evidence for the complexity of the pathogenesis of the allergic response.",M2

Part IV: Effects of housing and meteorologic factors on indoor nitrogen dioxide concentrations.In a prospective study of infants' exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2)* and respiratory illness, NO2 concentrations were measured in more than 1,400 homes in Albequerque, <e>NM</e>, From January 1988 through June 1991 (Health Effects Institute Research Report Number 58, Parts I, II and III). This report characterizes the variability in indoor NO2 concentrations across seasons and years, and identifies factors associated with variation in concentrations between homes and across seasons. In regression analyses of winter data, NO2 levels in the infants' bedrooms were predominately determined by the presence of gas cooking ranges with continuously burning pilot lights, the presence of wall or floor furnaces, the use of the stove for space heating, and the square footage of the living space. These findings are consistent with previously published analysis of data from homes in other U.S. cities. Relatively small differences in seasonal NO2 levels were observed across years. The correlation coefficient (r) of bedroom NO2 levels obtained in the same homes was 0.66 over two winters and 0.48 over two summers. For homes that had gas cooking ranges with continuously burning pilot lights, the NO2 bedroom concentrations differed, on average, less than 5 parts per billion (ppb) across winters. These differences were hypothesized to be caused by differences in the use of indoor NO2 sources, ventilation, and ambient (outdoor) NO2 levels. We were, however, unable to demonstrate an association between year-to-year differences in seasonal indoor NO2 concentrations and reported use of cooking range, furnace, or heater, or ambient NO2 levels, or temperature.",M2

At the control site, the proportion of children who received DTP 1 by 3 months of age, but not DTP 3 by 12 months of age, increased from 39% to 51%. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices in a public health clinic was associated with important increases in vaccination coverage levels and a reduction in the proportion of children who dropped out of vaccination services.",M2
8757012,"Incidence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage among Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in New Mexico.OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) among Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites living in Bernalillo County, <e>NM</e>. BACKGROUND: There are differences in cerebrovascular disease incidence between racial and ethnic groups. Knowing these differences is likely to optimize stroke prevention and evaluation. METHODS: Medical records review of all possible cases of ICH occurring between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 1993 among residents of Bernalillo County, NM, in all local hospitals. Hospital records were identified by ICD-9-CM codes. Also, State Medical Examiner records review for additional ICH cases occurring during the same time interval. The 1990 U.S. census provided the population base. RESULTS: There were 47 spontaneous ICHs among 267,965 non-Hispanic whites and 39 spontaneous ICHs among 178,310 Hispanics. Incidence of ICH rises exponentially with age in both groups. The age- and sex-adjusted total annual incidence of ICH per 100,000 people is 16.6 among non-Hispanic whites and 34.9 among Hispanics (relative risk for Hispanics 2.10, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 3.26, p = 0.001). The age-adjusted incidence rates among men and women are not significantly different in either ethnic group. CONCLUSION: The incidence of spontaneous ICH among Hispanic residents of Bernalillo County, NM, is approximately twice that among non-Hispanic whites. The reasons for this difference require further investigation.",M2

Courier Sonia Madrid was splashed with blood and became alarmed because she had paper cuts on her hands. Repeated blood tests for HIV and hepatitis B were negative. A Bernallilo County judge initially dismissed Madrid's lawsuit when the hospital revealed that there was no HIV present in the splashed liquid. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals ruled to allow Madrid a jury trial because New Mexico law no longer requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant's actions created actual danger or physical impact. The panel determined that Madrid's allegations stated a cause for negligent infliction of emotional distress.",M2

The decision was overturned by the New Mexico Supreme Court, allowing the group home to operate in a residential neighborhood. Neighbors sued shortly after the Community of Damien of Molokai opened the group home. The suit asked the court to enforce the developer's covenant that prohibited homes from being used for any purpose other than single-family dwellings. The Supreme Court wrote that the covenants were not so restrictive as to preclude unrelated individuals from occupying a house in the subdivision. Federal and state policies support integrating small group homes for disabled people into residential settings. The Court also found that the covenants violated the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability, including HIV status.",M2
8873955,"Access of Native Americans to renal transplantation in Arizona and New Mexico.Lower rates of transplantation among minority groups are a nationally recognized phenomenon. Native Americans (NA) nationally have nearly four times the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as compared with white (W) Americans and are significantly overrepresented in the Network 15 ESRD population. To understand more about NA and W transplant rates, we looked at all reported Arizona (AZ) and New Mexico (<e>NM</e>) resident cases from the Network No. 15 data base. Age of onset, sex, primary diagnosis, payment source, transplant donor source, and other factors were examined. NA experienced a slightly earlier onset of ESRD than W, and diabetes mellitus was the primary ESRD diagnosis for 63-73% of NA and for 34-39% of W. Because age distribution and frequency of diabetes mellitus of the NA ESRD population differ from those of W in the Network, age-specific and diagnosis-specific transplant rates were examined. Age-adjusted transplant rates per 100 ESRD patients for AZ were 16.4 (NA) and 21.0 (W) and for NM 14.2 (NA) and 22.4 (W). Diagnosis-specific age-adjusted transplant rates for patients with the primary diagnoses of diabetes mellitus and glomerulonephritis, the two most common causes of ESRD among NA, showed a large difference between W and NA rates. Age-adjusted rates for diabetes were: AZ 8.4% (NA) and 14.5% (W); NM 9.8% (NA) and 15.9% (W). Age-adjusted rates for patients with glomerulonephritis were: AZ 23.7% (NA) and 28.0% (W); NM 22.3% (NA) and 33.0% (W). In all comparisons and in both the W and NA ESRD populations, women were transplanted at lower rates than men. NA experienced a greater delay from onset of treated ESRD to transplant than W. Payment source and transplant donor source did not appear to be significantly different between NA and W. The lower transplant rates in NA versus W in Network No. 15 cannot be explained by age- or diagnosis-specific factors.",M2
7735590,"Association of asthma with serum IgE and skin test reactivity to allergens among children living at high altitude. Tickling the dragon's breath.Asthma in children and young adults is strongly associated with immediate hypersensitivity to indoor allergens, notably those derived from the house dust mite. In addition, outdoor air pollution is considered to aggravate existing asthma. We investigated the prevalence of asthma and the pattern of allergen sensitization in a mite-free environment with low levels of outdoor air pollution. A total of 567 children aged between 12 and 14 attending Los Alamos Middle School, <e>NM</e> (altitude 7,200 feet) were screened using a respiratory questionnaire; 120 children (53 control children) underwent allergen skin testing and serum IgE measurement, and their bronchial reactivity to histamine was measured. Dust was collected from 111 homes and the level of indoor mite and cat allergen measured. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was high (13%), and from the detailed testing it was estimated that 6.3% of the children had asthma (defined as symptomatic bronchial reactivity). Children with asthma had elevated IgE, 367 (179 to 755) versus 38 (23 to 61), and predominant sensitization to cat, 68 versus 20% (p &lt; 0.001). A high number of households (77%) had a pet cat or dog. The concentration of mite allergen was very low (mean 0.18 micrograms Der p milligrams sieved house dust), whereas that of cat allergen was high in homes with a cat (80.8 micrograms Fel d milligrams) but also in homes with no cat (3.2 micrograms Fel d milligrams). The results show that in a mite-free environment with low levels of outdoor air pollution, asthma was still a major cause of morbidity among schoolchildren.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

They, like other Native Americans, appear to be in an  epidemiologic transition  and are accordingly experiencing increased rates of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all pregnancies in 1991 at the Crownpoint Indian Health Service Facility in Crownpoint, <e>NM</e>, was conducted to determine the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in this Navajo population. RESULTS: Seventy-five (12.6%) of 594 pregnancies were associated with a hypertensive disorder. There were 18 individuals who developed gestational hypertension and 10 individuals with chronic hypertension that persisted during pregnancy. There were 46 women (7.7%) who developed preeclampsia and one woman (0.3%) who developed eclampsia. Eight women (1.4%) with chronic hypertension developed superimposed preeclampsia during pregnancy. Thus, 12.3% of these pregnancies in Navajo women were associated with the development of, or worsening, hypertension, and there was a prevalence of preeclampsia of 9.1%. CONCLUSION: The Navajos exhibit a high prevalence of pregnancy-related hypertension and preeclampsia.",M2

More than 320 kinds of defective congenital conditions were abstracted from hospital records. Using a nested case-control design, families of 266 pairs of index and control births were interviewed. The only statistically significant association between uranium operations and unfavorable birth outcome was identified with the mother living near tailings or mine dumps. Among the fathers who worked in the mines, those of the index cases had histories of more years of work exposure but not necessarily greater gonadal dosage of radiation. Also, birth defects increased significantly when either parent worked in the Shiprock electronics assembly plant. Overall, the associations between adverse pregnancy outcome and exposure to radiation were weak and must be interpreted with caution with respect to implying a biogenetic basis.",M2

DESIGN: Cross-sectional review of hospital clinic charts for five cohorts. SETTING: General pediatric outpatient clinic at the Mescalero Indian Health Service Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-nine patients aged 1 through 5 years in 1968, 1973, 1978, 1983, or 1988 for whom weight and height were recorded during a well-child visit that occurred in the respective year. SELECTION PROCEDURES: Approximately half the charts were screened for eligibility through systematic sampling for all years except 1988; for 1988 all available charts were screened for eligibility for the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We found trends of decreasing prevalence of both underweight (defined as weight-for-height below the fifth percentile) and short stature (defined as height-for-age below the fifth percentile) based on the Centers for Disease Control/World Health Organization growth reference. We found no secular trends in obesity (weight-for-height above the 95th percentile), although the prevalences throughout the 21-year period were as much as two to four times higher than expected when compared with the Centers for Disease Control/World Health Organization reference. There has been an upward shift in both weight-for-height and height-for-age distributions since 1968, indicating that Mescalero children today are, on average, heavier and taller. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight and short stature decreased among Mescalero preschool children from 1968 through 1988, suggesting nutritional improvements. However, given the current high prevalence of obesity, it is recommended that surveillance of nutritional status be continued and appropriate interventions be developed to treat and prevent obesity in this population.",M2

Nineteen patients had bubonic plague and eight had septicemic plague. Three patients with septicemic plague and three with bubonic plague died. The patients presented with five different clinical pictures. Ten patients presented with classic signs of plague, five with the appearance of an upper respiratory tract infection, five with a nonspecific febrile syndrome, four with the appearance of a gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection, and three with the appearance of meningitis. Blood cultures were positive in 24 of 25 cases, and bubo aspirate cultures were positive in 10 of 13 cases. All six patients who died were under 30 years old, and all the deaths were related to a failure to treat initially with an antibiotic appropriate for plague. Plague is a treatable disease, but clinicians must have a high index of suspicion and give appropriate antibiotics at the earliest possible time to patients whose presentation suggests plague.",M2
2031500,"Community-based exercise and weight control: diabetes risk reduction and glycemic control in Zuni Indians.Cardiovascular disease is a significant health problem for the Zuni Indians of southwest New Mexico, in part because of high rates of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The Zuni Diabetes Project was initiated in July 1983 to reduce rates of obesity and provide primary and secondary prevention of NIDDM. Two studies of the project's activities have been carried out to date. After 2 y of follow-up, diabetic participants in an exercise program compared with diabetic nonparticipants experienced weight loss, a drop in fasting blood glucose values, and reductions in the use of hypoglycemic medications. In a weight-loss competition, 45% (122/271) of the enrollees finished and lost greater than or equal to 2.3 kg. The results of these two studies demonstrate that 1) participation in a community-based exercise program can produce significant weight loss and improvement in glycemic control in Zuni Indians with NIDDM and 2) weight-loss competitions appear to be an important public health model for health-behavior change in communities similar to that of Zuni, <e>NM</e>.",M2

Data derived from the analysis of the composition of these fine particles served as input to a multi-linear regression (MLR) model used to calculate the relative contribution of wood burning and motor vehicle sources to mutagenic activity observed in the extractable organic matter. At both sites the mutagenic potency of EOM was found to be greater (3-5 times) for mobile sources when compared to wood smoke extractable organics. Carbon-14 measurements which give a direct determination of the amount of EOM that originated from wood burning were in close agreement with the source apportionment results derived from the MLR model.",M2

2355118,"Water-borne fluoride and cortical bone mass: a comparison of two communities.This study investigated the relationship between cortical bone mass in an older female population and their ingestion of fluoride from community water supplies. The study was conducted among lifelong female residents in Lordsburg (3.5 ppm fluoride) and Deming (0.7 ppm fluoride), <e>NM</e>. A total of 151 postmenopausal women ranging in age from 39 to 87 years took part; 69 were residents of the optimal-fluoride community, while the remaining 82 were residents of the high-fluoride community. Although bivariate analyses showed no difference in cortical bone mass between women in the two communities, with multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of bone mass (p less than 0.05) were weight, years since menopause, current estrogen supplementation, diabetes, and fluoride exposure status. Based on a model containing all of these variables, women living in the high-fluoride community had a bone mass ranging from 0.004 to 0.039 g/cm2 less than that of similar women living in the optimum-fluoride community. These results suggest that lifelong ingestion of water containing 3.5 ppm fluoride, compared with water containing 0.7 ppm fluoride, does not increase cortical bone mass in women of similar age, weight, and menopausal status. Under the conditions of this study, cortical bone mass might be reduced in a high-fluoride area.",M2

Already, proteins have been discovered that facilitate multiple transport steps, and studies of the identities and modes of action of additional transport components, such as those that specify the targets of transport vesicles, will soon follow. Even after we understand how transport vesicles form, find their targets, and then fuse, other fundamental questions will still remain. How are proteins sorted into distinct transport vesicles? How is the directionality of protein transport achieved? How do organelles maintain their identities in the face of large volumes of membrane traffic? Finally, how is membrane traffic regulated? Answers to each of these fundamental questions are likely to be available in the not-too-distant future.",M2

The equipment made 33,458 telephone calls and 2,703 households responded to the eight items included in the poll. The results included a minimum of 810 poisoning incidents in these households in the previous year, giving an annual incidence of poisoning in this population of 108 per 1,000. This rate is considerably higher than previous estimates. Other results included a trend toward delaying poisoning therapy until symptoms developed or taking the poisoned patient directly to an emergency department. If these results are confirmed by conventional polling, poisoning is a major public health problem. Furthermore, confirmation would establish automated telephone polling as a valuable tool for rapidly and inexpensively surveying large populations.",M2
3083473,"Model system of ongoing care for native Americans--a 5-year followup.In 1979, continuing care from a personal physician was identified as a priority at the Indian Health Service site in Zuni, <e>NM</e>, a rural hospital and ambulatory care center serving 7,000 Zuni people. To encourage such care, a system was established that assigned each patient to a regular physician and organized physicians into teams. Three teams, each consisting of three clinicians and other support personnel, served specific geographic regions of the village. Five years later, the ongoing care provided for active randomly selected prenatal, diabetic, and general clinic patients was evaluated. The physician staff of the site had gone through a complete turnover during the previous five years. Based on a chart review for the year prior to patient identification, patients saw their regular physician from 48 to 61 percent of the time in all their visits, and their regular physician or his or her team colleague from 71 to 82 percent of the time in all their visits. Ongoing care from a personal physician or close colleague can be achieved in the Indian Health Service. Organization of physicians into teams appeared to be the critical element in promoting ongoing care at this site where physician turnover is high. Team physicians seldom all leave at once, and ongoing care as a priority is passed on by the attitude of other team physicians, by transfer of specific patients, and by patient expectation. Given the established benefits, ongoing care from a personal provider should be encouraged in the Indian Health Service as in other primary care settings.",M2

The 107 deaths due to all malignant neoplasms were also significantly fewer than the 167 expected from these diseases. Expected deaths were derived from age and calendar-specific death rates for U.S. white males. Deaths reported for benign and unspecified neoplasms numbered eight versus an expected two, a significant elevation. These tumors, all intracranial, are the subject of a case-control study to be reported later.
