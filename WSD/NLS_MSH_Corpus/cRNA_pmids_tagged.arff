19700278,"What is an anesthesiology resident worth?STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost of replacing an anesthesiology resident with a certified registered nurse anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) for equal operating room (OR) work. DESIGN: Retrospective financial analysis. SETTING: Academic anesthesiology department. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical anesthesia (CA)-1 through CA-3 residents. MEASUREMENTS: Cost of replacing anesthesiology residents with CRNAs for equal OR work was determined. MAIN RESULTS: The cost of replacing one anesthesiology resident with a CRNA for the same number of OR hours ranged from $9,940.32 to $43,300 per month ($106,241.68 to $432,937.50 per yr). Numbers varied depending on the CRNA pay scale and whether the calculations were based on the number of OR hours worked at our residency program or OR hours worked in a maximum duty hour model. CONCLUSIONS: A CRNA is paid substantially more per OR hour worked, at all pay levels, than an anesthesiology resident.",M1
19645166,"Betty Lank: a kind and gentle anesthetist devoted to children.Many noted clinicians and educators led the development of nurse anesthesia as a profession during the first half of the 20th century. Betty E. Lank, <e>CRNA</e>, a nurse anesthetist at Children's Hospital Boston, Massachusetts, for 34 years, devoted her professional life to the delivery and advancement of pediatric anesthesia. She is credited with many contributions including the first use of cyclopropane for infant anesthesia, developing pediatric-sized anesthesia masks and ventilation bags, and instituting standards for specialized postanesthesia recovery areas. Lank recorded her anesthesia experiences in various nursing publications and shared her knowledge with colleagues at professional meetings. Her accomplishments make her a notable figure in the early history of pediatric anesthesia, and her dedication helped forge the foundation for anesthesia at Children's Hospital Boston.",M1
19450789,"Demographic profiles of certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and nurse practitioners: reflections on implications for uniform education and regulation.TOPIC: There is wide variability in regulatory authority, basic education requirements, and titling for nurses in advanced practice roles, that is, certified nurse-midwives (CNMs), certified registered nurse anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>), and nurse practitioners (NPs). There is current advocacy for a common identity for advanced practice nurses (APNs), including uniform entry into practice requirements (the doctor of nursing practice [DNP]). METHODS: Membership survey data were extracted to generate a contemporary profile of characteristics of these categories of practitioners. RESULTS: The APN groups are similar in age (M = 47-48 years) and race (predominantly Caucasian), with the largest proportions of all groups clustering in the age range of 51-54 years. There are more men in the CRNA group (45%). CNMs have the highest proportion of doctoral degrees (4.7%). CRNAs command the highest annual average salary ($140,000). CONCLUSIONS: Membership survey data can monitor progress toward implementation of proposed educational and regulatory changes. The effect of these proposals on the availability of an experienced APN mentor workforce for DPN students and the availability of an APN workforce for clients remains largely unknown. Standardized indicators of performance and client outcomes may enhance current data collection of membership demographics and enable precise evaluation of outcomes and impact of APN care.",M1
19388507,"New estimates for <e>CRNA</e> vacancies.A national survey to estimate vacancy rates of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) in hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers was conducted in 2007. Poisson regression methods were used to improve the precision of the estimates. A significant increase in the estimated vacancy rate was reported for hospitals relative to an earlier study from 2002, although it is important to note that there were some methodological differences between the 2 surveys explaining part of the increase. Results from this study found the vacancy rate was higher in rural hospitals than in nonrural hospitals, and it was lower in ambulatory surgical centers. A number of simulations were run to predict the effects of relevant changes in the market for surgeries and number of CRNAs, which were compared to the predictions from the previous survey. The remarkable factor since the last survey was the unusually large rate of new CRNAs entering the market, yet the vacancy rates remain relatively high.",M1
19263828,"Perceived deprivation in active duty military nurse anesthetists.There is a shortage of military Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>). Relative deprivation is a perception of unfairness due to discrepancies between what one has and what one could or should have that is dependent on feelings (subjective data) and facts (objective data). Feelings of relative deprivation could contribute to the military CRNA shortage. The purposes of this study were to measure relative deprivation in active-duty military CRNAs and explore variables that correlate with relative deprivation. The descriptive, correlational study was conducted using a self-administered survey sent to 435 active-duty Army, Navy, and Air Force CRNAs. Surveys were distributed to subjects by mail and could be answered by mail or by secured website. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Analysis of the data revealed a calculated response rate of 57.7%. There was no significant correlation (P &lt; .05) between years as a CRNA, military pay, promotion opportunity, or scope of practice/autonomy and relative deprivation. Correlations of the psychological factors  wanting  and  deserving  with relative deprivation were significant (P &lt; .001). Further research is indicated to identify definitive factors that can be modified to improve feelings of deprivation as they relate to retention and recruitment of military CRNAs.",M1
18777812,"Attrition in nurse anesthesia educational programs as reported by program directors: the class of 2005.The attrition rate in nurse anesthesia educational programs is of interest to educators and the <e>CRNA</e> profession as an important outcome of the educational process. This study reports the beliefs of program directors about the rate of and reasons for attrition in the cohort graduating in 2005. A survey tool was distributed online to all 101 nurse anesthesia educational program directors. Eight programs were excluded because they had no graduates in 2005. Of the remaining 93 programs, 62 (67%) responded. Of 1,499 students enrolled with a projected graduation in 2005, 135 (9%) did not complete the program. The most common reason for attrition was withdrawal (n = 48), followed by academic dismissal (n = 41), and clinical dismissal (n = 21). The attrition rate for individual programs was 7% +/- 9.1 % (mean +/- 1 SD), ranging from 0% to 41.3%. The median value for program attrition rate was 5.41%. The rate for individual programs was not related to the size of the program or to the length of experience of the program director. Attrition rate was higher in programs of longer duration (r = .27). It was concluded that the attrition rate is low and comparable to that previously reported.",M1

The purpose of this study was to explore and evaluate a method for examining the effect of computer-assisted decision making (CADM) using a handheld device on the accuracy (ie, correct diagnosis and treatment) and speed of problem solving by Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) during simulated critical patient-care events. A randomized crossover design with matched-pair sampling was used. In a high-fidelity human simulation environment, 4 CRNAs participated in 2 plausible critical anesthesia case scenarios. CRNA performance with and without CADM technology, environmental authenticity, and reliability and validity of data collection tools and simulated case scenarios were evaluated. Time to correct diagnosis and treatment varied by scenario, taking less time with CADM for one but more with CADM for the other, likely due to differences in pace, intensity, and conduct of the 2 scenarios. We believe this study supports further exploration and application of CADM in complex patient scenarios involving anesthesia practitioners. Affirmation of environmental authenticity also validates the high-fidelity human simulation environment as an appropriate setting to conduct research in this area.",M1
18323316,"Asystole during laryngoscopy of a patient with pleural and pericardial effusions: a case report.A 53-year-old woman presented to the operating room for surgical correction of pericardial and pleural effusions. Her history included stage IV breast cancer, well-controlled hypertension, and diverticulitis. Although her baseline blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations were normal, she was short of breath with diminished breath sounds on the left side of the lungs and required oxygen, 2 L/min via nasal cannula. The nurse anesthesia student, under the direction of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) and anesthesiologist, induced general anesthesia with etomidate, fentanyl, lidocaine, and succinylcholine. During placement of a double-lumen endotracheal tube, the patient became asystolic. The nurse anesthesia student immediately withdrew the laryngoscope, and the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm. A second attempt at laryngoscopy produced asystole as well. Again, the laryngoscope was withdrawn, and the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm. After resuming ventilation with 100% oxygen and administering atropine, 0.4 mg, the next intubation was successful, producing no untoward effects. Reintubation at the end of the case with a single lumen endotracheal tube was uneventful. The patient was transported to the intensive care unit and mechanically ventilated overnight. The next morning, she was extubated with no further anesthetic complications.",M1
17377097,"Five-year follow-up on the work force and finances of United States anesthesiology training programs: 2000 to 2005.BACKGROUND: In the middle 1990s, there was a decrease in anesthesiology residency class sizes, which contributed to a nationwide shortage of anesthesiologists, resulting in a competitive market with increased salary demands. In 1999, a nationwide survey of the financial status of United States anesthesiology training programs was conducted. Follow-up surveys have been conducted each year thereafter. We present the results of the sixth survey in this series. METHODS: Surveys were distributed by e-mail to the anesthesiology department chairs of the United States Training Programs. Responses were also received by e-mail. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one departments were surveyed with a response rate of 60%. The 87% of departments seeking at least one additional faculty had an average of 2.8 faculty open positions (5.5% open positions overall which is down from 9.7% in 2000). Of the 96% of departments that employ certified registered nurse anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>) 89% were seeking additional CRNAs, averaging 3.6 open positions. The average department received $4.9 million (or $116,000/faculty) in institutional support. When the portion of this support allocated for CRNA salaries was removed, the average department received $4.1 million (or $95,000/faculty) in institutional support. This is a 16% increase over the previous year. Faculty academic time averaged 17% (where 20% is 1 d/wk). Departments billed an average of 11,320 anesthesia units/faculty/yr. Although the average anesthesia unit value collected was $31, departments required approximately $40/U to meet expenses. Medicaid payments averaged $15, ranging from $5 to $30/U. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the continuing need for institutional support to keep anesthesiology training departments financially stable.",M1
17304782,"The Washington State Nurse Anesthetist Workforce: a case study.The purposes of this study were to describe the Washington State Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) workforce and analyze selected dimensions of their clinical practice. We developed the 31-item CRNA Practice Questionnaire. After receiving institutional review board approval, the questionnaire was mailed in 2003 to CRNAs licensed in Washington with an address in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for all variables and was performed by University of Washington Center for Health Workforce Studies staff. Results indicate that the typical Washington State CRNA is 50.7 years old, white, and equally likely to be a man or woman. More than half of the Washington State CRNAs are master's educated and have an average of 19 years of CRNA experience. Most work at least 40 hours a week, take call, and earn more than 100,000 dollars per year. Almost all have hospital privileges, but only 30% believe they are equal colleagues with physicians. A chi2 analysis comparing urban and rural respondents yielded few differences except that rural CRNAs reported seeking significantly less consultation and were more likely to take call. Workforce data may assist CRNAs when negotiating with employers and institutions and in resolving interprofessional conflicts and can have implications for scope of practice, policy, and legislative issues.",M1

The purpose of the investigation was to use an AF CRNA-specific modification of the Readiness Estimate and Deployability Index Revised for AF Nurses to assess readiness for deployment. Dimensions included clinical competency, operational competency, soldier/survival skills, personal/psychosocial/physical readiness, leadership and administrative support, and group integration/identification. Readiness skills verification for AF CRNAs was used to develop clinical competency questions. Validity was assessed by two experts, and internal consistency reliability was evaluated by using Cronbach's alpha. Available stateside AF CRNAs (n=105) were surveyed, with a 60% response rate. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample, providing a mean score for each variable. Using a 5-point scale, participants rated themselves with an overall readiness score of 4.09, which suggests that AF CRNAs perceive themselves as ready to deploy.",M1
17179869,"Anesthesia staffing and anesthetic complications during cesarean delivery: a retrospective analysis.BACKGROUND: Obstetrical anesthesia services may be provided by Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>), anesthesiologists, or a combination of the two providers. Research is needed to assist hospitals and anesthesia groups in making cost-effective staffing choices. OBJECTIVES: To identify differences in the rates of anesthetic complications in hospitals whose obstetrical anesthesia is provided solely by CRNAs compared to hospitals with only anesthesiologists. METHODS: Washington State hospital discharge data were obtained from 1993 to 2004 for all cesarean sections, and were merged with a survey of hospital obstetrical anesthesia staffing. Anesthetic complications were identified via International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. Resulting rates were risk-adjusted using regression analysis. RESULTS: Hospitals with CRNA-only staffing had a lower rate of anesthetic complications than those with anesthesiologist staffing (0.58% vs. 0.76%, p=.0006). However, after regression analysis, this difference was not significant (odds ratio for CRNA vs. anesthesiologist complications: 1.046 to 1, 95% confidence interval 0.649-1.658, p=.85). DISCUSSION: There is no difference in rates of complications between the two types of staffing models. As a result, hospitals and anesthesiology groups may safely examine other variables, such as provider availability and costs, when staffing for obstetrical anesthesia. Further study is needed to validate the use of ICD-9-CM codes for anesthesia complications as an indicator of quality.",M1
17048553,"Quality Review in Anesthesia: then, now, and the future.The Quality Review in Anesthesia (QRIA) newsletter is a significant, evolving resource to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) in clinical practice. Since its inception in 1997, the newsletter has been modified to meet the changing needs of anesthesia practice. The goal of the newsletter is improvement in patient care and risk avoidance by keeping CRNAs abreast of the latest changes in risk management, quality assurance, and malpractice concerns. By incorporating reports of patient safety adverse events, it is anticipated CRNAs will better understand the need for compliance and adherence to the standards of care. A chronological history of the development of the QRIA newsletter is provided. The methodology of how an article is conceived, reviewed, and published is presented so the CRNA can appreciate the mechanisms involved in putting together each publication. The QRIA newsletter now has a chronological and alphabetical index on the AANA website. This electronic format allows the CRNA to access articles that might be of special interest to a certain aspects of practice. Each issue of QRIA is planned carefully to meet the needs of the CRNA and is offered as a valuable membership service.",M1

This descriptive study used a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey of Army Nurse Corps officers and Department of the Army civilian registered nurses (N = 5,293). The CRNA subset (n = 97) was obtained from questionnaires that indicated a primary practice setting as anesthesia. The most frequently occurring ethical issue identified was conflict in the nurse-physician relationship, whereas the most disturbing issue was working with incompetent/impaired colleagues. Unresolved ethical conflicts can negatively influence the nurses' morale, leading to avoidance of the issue and contributing to burnout. Identifying the ethical issues and disturbance level experienced by CRNAs should contribute to the development of an ethics education program that addresses issues encountered in CRNA practice.",M1
16918120,"Supply, demand, and equilibrium in the market for <e>CRNAs</e>.This study determined the current trends in supply, demand, and equilibrium (ie, the level of employment where supply equals demand) in the market for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). It also forecasts future needs for CRNAs given different possible scenarios. The impact of the current availability of CRNAs, projected retirements, and changes in the demand for surgeries are considered in relation to CRNAs needed for the future. The study used data from many sources to estimate models associated with the supply and demand for CRNAs and the relationship to relevant community and policy characteristics such as per capita income of the community and managed care. These models were used to forecast changes in surgeries and in the supply of CRNAs in the future. The supply of CRNAs has increased in recent years, stimulated by shortages of CRNAs and subsequent increases in the number of CRNAs trained. However, the increases have not offset the number of retiring CRNAs to maintain a constant age in the CRNA population. The average age will continue to increase for CRNAs in the near future despite increases in CRNAs trained. The supply of CRNAs in relation to surgeries will increase in the near future.",M1

On superficial view, it appears that a CRNA who is medically directed would be under a number of controls that would force the CRNA to be in an employee status. However, on analysis, it seems that for tax purposes a CRNA can be medically directed while also being an independent contractor. But when looking closer at all of the controversy in the legal system and the protections available to an employee that are not available to an independent contractor, a CRNA may find the employee status a better option.",M1
16428553,"Trends in the financial status of United States anesthesiology training programs: 2000 to 2004.The decrease in resident applicants for United States (U.S.) anesthesiology training programs in the mid-1990s has resulted in a national anesthesiologist shortage. This shortage has been associated with increased salaries for anesthesiologists in academic institutions. Salary increases have placed the financial condition of academic training departments in jeopardy, requiring increasing support from their institutions. In the year 2000, a nationwide survey of the financial status of the U.S. anesthesiology training programs was conducted. Follow-up surveys have been conducted each year thereafter. We present the results of the fifth such survey. One-hundred-twenty-eight departments were surveyed, with a response rate of 73%. The average department employs 45 faculty and 81% of those departments have an average of 3.3 open positions. Of the 91% of departments who employ Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>) (an average of 25 CRNAs/department), 73% have an average of 4.2 open CRNA positions. The average department received 3,787,835 dollars (or 97,621 dollars/faculty) in institutional support, which is an increase over the 2003 amount of 85,607 dollars/faculty. In 36.6% of the departments a portion of these support dollars (1,888,111 dollars) was provided to support CRNA salaries. Therefore, the support to departments for faculty averaged 81,696 dollars/faculty, after the CRNA dollars were removed. Faculty academic time averaged 16% (where 20% is 1 day/wk) and departments billed an average of 11,954 anesthesia units/faculty/yr. These results demonstrate a continued shortage of anesthesiology faculty and continued institutional support to keep these training programs financially viable.",M1
16355946,"A study of occupational stress, scope of practice, and collaboration in nurse anesthetists practicing in anesthesia care team settings.This study examined occupational stress in Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (<e>CRNAs</e>) practicing with anesthesiologists in anesthesia care team (ACT) settings. The focus was to examine the relationships among CRNA scope of practice (SOP) in ACTs, collaboration, and role-related occupational stress. A survey questionnaire was mailed to CRNAs from the 6 New England states, with a return rate of 30.87% (n = 347). Data analysis included practice characteristics and demographics of the sample, and the research questions were examined applying correlational analysis, t test, and analysis of variance addressing relationships among the study measures. Data analyses revealed that limited, restricted CRNA practice scope was particularly evident in respondents employed by anesthesiology groups, compared with hospital-employed CRNAs. Few CRNA respondents perceived their practice as collaborative, and many used compromise as a conflict-resolution style. Respondents with a broader SOP reported higher collaboration than those with restrictions. Respondents reporting a broader SOP also experienced increased job stress in relation to role overload but used coping resources effectively. Implications for future studies include exploring strategies that achieve consensus between CRNAs and anesthesiologists in ACTs, emphasizing clearly defined roles and optimizing productivity.",M1

A multiple-choice descriptive survey was mailed to a random sample of CRNAs from the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). Although response was low (19%, N = 191), respondent demographics corresponded to AANA 2002 CRNA membership. The mean knowledge score of adverse interactions was 21%; 17% of CRNAs indicated confidence in their familiarity with herbal supplement-anesthesia interactions. Of the participants, 23% correctly identified the ASA recommendation to discontinue herbal supplements 2 weeks before surgery. CRNAs agreed that herbal supplement use should be assessed preoperatively (92%), they are medically active (88%), and they can have an impact on surgical outcomes (87%). Nearly 4 in 10 respondents used herbal supplements themselves, but only 5% recommend supplement use to patients. Most CRNAs (93%) wanted more educational opportunities on anesthesia and herbal supplements. The low knowledge scores and lack of confidence in familiarity with herbal supplement-anesthesia interactions highlight the need for further CRNA education. Nurse anesthesia educational curricula and continuing education programs should be reviewed and updated to ensure adequate instruction on herbal supplements.",M1

This study was designed to address the issue of CRNA involvement in airway management and trauma stabilization in rural hospitals through a descriptive, quantitative, nonexperimental design study. A random sample of 382 CRNAs who practice in rural hospitals were invited to answer questions using a practice pattern questionnaire about these experiences developed for this study. Data were analyzed descriptively. The 13-item Airway Management and Trauma Stabilization Practice Pattern Questionnaire performed reliably (alpha = .8320). Results revealed the majority of CRNAs working in rural and semirural settings manage airways and stabilize the condition of trauma patients.

15448534,"Influence of the type of anesthesia provider on costs of labor analgesia to the Texas Medicaid program.BACKGROUND: The Texas Medicaid Program (Medicaid) defines billable time for labor analgesia as face-to-face time; therefore, anesthesia providers determine billed time. The authors' goal was to determine the influence of anesthesia providers on labor analgesia costs billed to Medicaid. METHODS: Under the Freedom of Information Act, Medicaid provided data on claims paid for 6 months in 2001 for labor analgesia administered during the course of a vaginal delivery. Claims were either time based (codes 00946 or 00955) or a flat fee (codes 26311 or 26319). Using modifiers, the authors grouped time-based claims as either anesthesiologist group or certified registered nurse anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) group. The cost to Medicaid was based on the 2001 fee schedule. The conversion factor was 18.21 USD per American Society of Anesthesiologists unit. The flat-fee reimbursement was 152.50 USD. CRNA services were paid at 85% of the fee schedule. Average time per time claim, percent of providers with more than 4 h of billed time, and cost per claim were determined for each group. Providers with more than 120 claims (&gt; 20 claims/month) were considered high-volume. RESULTS: The database included 21,378 claims (anesthesiologist group: 12,698 claims from 219 providers; CRNA group: 8,680 claims from 117 providers). For time-based claims, the average time per case was significantly higher in the CRNA group (146 min) than in the anesthesiologist group (105 min). The CRNA group cost to Medicaid (225.11 USD) was 19% more per claim than the anesthesiologist group (189.26 USD). The difference in cost per claim was greater among high-volume providers--213.10 USD for the CRNA group versus 168.76 USD for the anesthesiologist group. If a flat-fee program were instituted using the average cost per claim for all groups (203.81 USD), the Texas Medicaid program would save more than 500,000 USD annually. CONCLUSIONS: The costs of labor analgesia billed to Texas Medicaid were 19% to 26% less per patient when provided by anesthesiologists than by CRNAs, despite lower per-unit reimbursement of CRNAs.",M1

DATA SOURCES: An exploratory descriptive study based on findings from four focus groups of faculty from four different universities and a written survey mailed to program or admissions directors of a random sample of 50% of the 295 credentialed NP or CRNA programs in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Themes from the focus groups revealed 20 personal characteristics, 14 professional characteristics, and 9 clinical skills, all of which were used to create a survey instrument. A 33% response rate was achieved (n = 48). Personal characteristics were considered most important, professional characteristics and clinical skills moderately important, and kinds of clinical experience of lesser importance. Length of desired experience ranged from 0 to 5 years, most often 2 years.

12707147,"A demographic, service, and financial survey of anesthesia training programs in the United States.In February 2000, a demographic, service, and finance survey was sent to the directors of anesthesiology training programs in the United States under the auspices of the Society of Academic Anesthesia Chairs/Association of Academic Program Directors. In August of 2000, 2001, and 2002, shorter follow-up surveys were sent to the same program directors requesting the numbers of vacancies in faculty positions and certified registered nurse anesthetists (<e>CRNA</e>) positions. The August 2001 survey also inquired if departments had positive or negative financial margins for the fiscal year ending June 2001. The August 2002 survey included the questions of the 2001 survey and additionally asked if the departments had had an increase or decrease in institutional support and the amount of that current support. The survey results revealed that the average program had 36 anesthetizing locations and 36 faculty. Those faculty spent 69% of their time providing clinical service. Approximately one-half of the departments paid for some of their residents, whereas the other 50% paid for none. Eighty-five percent of the departments employed CRNAs who were funded by the hospital in one third of the departments. In 2000, departments received $34,319/yr in support per faculty full-time equivalent (FTE) from their institutions and had a mean revenue of $407,000/yr/faculty FTE. In 2002, the department's institutional support per FTE increased to $59,680 (a 74% increase since 2000). The departments in academic medical centers paid 20% in overhead expenses, whereas departments in nonacademic medical centers paid 10%. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the percentage of departments with positive margins was 53%, 53%, and 65%, respectively, whereas the departments with a negative margin decreased from 44% in the year 2000 to 38% in 2001 and 33% in 2002. For the departments with a positive margin, the amount of margin per FTE over this 3-yr period was approximately $50,000, $15,000, and $30,000, respectively. Although the percentage of departments with a negative margin has been decreasing, the negative margin per FTE seems to be increasing from approximately $24,000 to $43,000. The number of departments with open faculty positions has decreased from 91.5% in the year 2000 to 83.5% in 2001 and 78.4% in 2002; in these departments, the number of open faculty positions has also decreased from 3.8 in 2000 to 3.9 in 2001 to 3.4 in 2002. The number of open CRNA positions seems to have been relatively constant with approximately two thirds of the departments requiring an average of approximately four CRNAs each. Overall, academic anesthesiology departments fiscal security seems to have eroded with an increased dependence on institutional support. Departments pay larger overhead rates relative to private practice, and there seems to be a continued, but possibly decreasing, shortage of faculty. IMPLICATIONS: A survey was conducted of anesthesia training program directors that demonstrated that their departments' financial conditions have been eroding over the years 2000 to 2002. During this same period of time, departments were receiving an increase in institutional support from $34,319/full-time equivalent (FTE) faculty in the year 2000 to $59,680/FTE in the year 2002. Although there seems to be an approximate 10% shortage in academic faculty, the number of departments with open positions has progressively decreased from 91% to 73% over the past 3 yr. On average, the financial condition of the training departments has deteriorated over the past 3 yr despite a significant increase in institutional support to enable departments to recruit and retain faculty in an era of an apparent national shortage of anesthesiologists.",M1

Research with closed malpractice claims demonstrates that American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II patients undergoing elective procedures are most likely to experience damaging events intraoperatively with resultant postoperative adverse outcomes. The process of care, including clinical decision making, contributes to adverse outcomes. Clinical decision making can be difficult to assess and measure. In this study, the cognitive psychology framework of information-processing theory and literature pertaining to the use of heuristics, or rules of thumb, and clinical biases, were used to analyze cases from the AANA Foundation closed malpractice claims database. This database contains more than 300 files involving St Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company-covered <e>CRNAs</e> from across the United States. These files were analyzed by 10 CRNA investigators on the AANA Closed Claims research team.

However, to date there are no existing data indicating whether practicing CRNAs are conducting research or to what extent. The purpose of this study was to determine whether research is conducted by Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and what factors influence whether CRNAs engage in research. A quantitative descriptive design was used. Random sampling from the total AANA membership roster was done. A questionnaire developed by the researchers and evaluated by content experts was used to obtain data after the questionnaire was validated with a pilot study. Of 370 questionnaires mailed, 173 (46.8%) were returned. Results revealed a small percentage of CRNAs are involved in the research process at some level.

Patient outcomes involving respiratory incidents were more likely to result in death or permanent injury compared with nonrespiratory incidents (P &lt; .01). Reviewers found that respiratory claims were more likely to have involved inappropriate anesthesia management (P &lt; .01), more likely to have involved a lack of vigilance (P &lt; .01), and more likely to have been judged by the reviewer as preventable (P &lt; .01). A higher percentage of respiratory incidents occurred in emergency cases (75% vs 34%, P &lt; .01) and in cases involving general anesthesia (44% vs 17%, P &lt; .01).

Electronic media are competing with print media, and there are advantages and disadvantages to both. This is not only within the realm of news, sports, and entertainment, but professional information as well. Debates will abound as to how best, and in what medium, research should be made available to professions and the public. Unfortunately, the revelations in the past few years of the poor state of published research in our print journals, despite peer review, makes it more difficult to advocate them in a climate where the shift may well be toward electronic journals. Although many print journals have also gone online, they usually limit the viewership to abstracts or a few articles. Some of thejournals that have been created as online journals and have their articles peer reviewed have not been in existence long enough to examine the extent to which the peer-review system is any better than for print journals. It is exceedingly important that research and its conclusions that make its way into either print or online journals are reliable and valid before we apply them to our practice. Relying on individual readers to make that determination is problematic, because most readers are not that astute in sophisticated research methods and statistics.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the need for further education and discussion in this area. Of the 228 (45.6%) respondents, more than half had DNR policies at their facility, while the remainder reported no policy or were unsure whether a policy existed. Of those having policies, 67.2% indicated a policy of routine DNR suspension, approximately 20% had a policy of reevaluation, and the remainder were unsure of the type of policy. However, when asked what type of policy respondents thought was most appropriate, 54.2% favored a policy of reviewing the DNR order, with 95% advocating patient involvement in the reevaluation. Moreover, almost 90% of responding CRNAs indicated they would discuss DNR status with the patient before surgery. When a patient with a DNR order subsequently had an intraoperative cardiac event, 13% initiated resuscitation. Responding to a hypothetical question involving a patient with a DNR order, 42% to 48% of respondents indicated they would initiate resuscitative measures in such a situation depending on the cause of arrest.",M1

9726194,"Awareness during general anesthesia: new technology for an old problem.The possibility of awareness during general anesthesia causes apprehension for the patient and the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>). The goals of general anesthesia are to prevent the sensation of pain and produce a state of sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness so the patient will not remember the surgical procedure. An inadequate level of anesthesia can result in patient awareness during surgery. The current practice of anesthesia relies on indirect hemodynamic measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate to monitor the sedative hypnotic state of the patient's brain during general anesthesia. Hemodynamic responses are not reliable for predicting awareness just as blood pressure and heart rate are not indicative of consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms are known to be affected by anesthetics. Characteristic EEG waveforms are a direct indication of the patient's level of consciousness. Unprocessed and computer-processed EEG recordings have been used in an attempt to monitor the patient's level of consciousness during general anesthesia. A raw or unprocessed EEG recording to monitor the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is problematic. The EEG signal is complex, affected by artifact, and it requires a dedicated interpreter. Conventional processed EEG monitoring systems are problematic because of the complexity of the equipment and technical difficulty of reading the EEG recording.

9233095,"Frustrated wants and entitlements: fundamental components of <e>CRNA</e> job satisfaction.A comparative study was conducted examining CRNA feelings of deprivation or resentment as they relate to their job satisfaction. Deprivation is described in Faye Crosby's Theory of Relative Deprivation (1976), which posits that six psychological preconditions (wanting, comparison other, deserving, past expectations, future expectations, and lack of self-blame) have an impact on individual perceptions and can influence job satisfaction. Relative deprivation is defined as a sense of grievance or feeling of resentment that one has been unjustly deprived of some desired thing. It is also sometimes referred to as the discrepancy between one's legitimate expectations and one's actual situation. The three hypotheses examined compare the influence of the six Crosby preconditions of relative deprivation and the three background variables of gender, education, and individual job autonomy on CRNA-felt deprivation. Results from three-way analysis of variance indicated that of the three background variables, only degree of autonomy was found to be significant in explaining felt deprivation. That is, irrespective of gender or educational level, CRNAs reporting higher degrees of job autonomy had lower feelings of deprivation or resentment about their jobs than did individuals reporting limited job autonomy. Degree of autonomy, thus being the key background determinant of CRNA-felt deprivation (F = 14.609, P &lt; .01). Further analysis employing multiple regression revealed that when both the background and the Crosby psychological variables were examined together, the explained variance in deprivation was dramatically increased by the psychological variables far in excess of the background variables. The two psychological variables of wanting and deserving were found as most significant in explaining CRNA felt deprivation. Results indicate the importance of CRNA frustrated wants (wanting) and CRNA perceived entitlements (deserving) as key factors contributing to CRNA job satisfaction above and beyond the three background variables studied.",M1
9155308,"Religious restrictions and the trauma patient.This article discusses some of the dilemmas the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) faces when the patient refuses potential life-saving blood products or a blood transfusion. Even if the CRNA disagrees with the patient's decision, the patient's right to refuse is taken very seriously in the legal arena. Without a court order, the patient cannot be forced to receive blood or blood products. It would be easier if there were clear guidelines; unfortunately, these do not exist. In the past, courts were more likely to agree with the anesthesia provider and order the transfusion, even if the patient were competent. Today, courts are less likely to do so in these cases. However, there are circumstances in which obtaining a court order for the transfusion is more predictable, such as if the patient is a child in a true emergency situation, or if the patient is pregnant and the fetus is viable.",M1
9204787,"Anesthesia providers, patient outcomes, and costs: a critique.The June 1996 article in Anesthesia and Analgesia by Abenstein and Warner entitled  Anesthesia Providers, Patient Outcomes, and Costs  presents important information about anesthesia services, but it contains a number of errors and questionable interpretations that could lead to inappropriate programs and policies. Among the most important points of fact we clarify in our paper are: 1. Three organizations that accredit, certify, and govern nurse anesthetists are organized in similar fashion to three comparable bodies governing anesthesiologists. There is no justification for the implication that the AANA somehow controls the accreditation and certification of <e>CRNAs</e>. 2. The conclusion that anesthesiologistled care teams are the preferred model for all anesthesia services and settings because of improved patient outcomes is overly simplistic and is not borne out in the literature. 3. The attribution of reduced mortality from anesthesia over the past 40 years to the increase in numbers of anesthesiologists is not justified. Many other factors, including new anesthetic agents and improved patient monitoring, also are important. 4. The use of a hypothetical example related to Medicare reimbursement in New York to justify the implication that CRNA-delivered services are more costly than anesthesiologist-delivered services is misleading and not borne out in the literature. We hope that planners and policy makers will read the article by Abenstein and Warner with extreme caution.

This study was proposed to determine whether with education and practice, anesthesia providers and assistants could be taught a recommended cricoid pressure and retain this skill. Cricoid force was measured using a life-size laryngotracheal model on a calibrated infant scale. Fifty-three participants were divided into six groups: MD faculty; CA-1, 2, and 3 Residents; certified registered nurse anesthetists (<e>CRNA</e>); and Others. Each was asked to apply pressure to the blinded model to simulate application of the Sellick's maneuver to an  awake  and  unconscious  patient on four occasions: before instruction of the recommended pressures (Preinstruction), after being informed of the recommended magnitudes of 20 N/awake and 30-40 N/anesthetized (Postinstruction), after a period of unblinded practice (Postpractice), and 3 mo or longer after practice (Follow-up). Initial attempts revealed inadequate force by all participants,  awake  and  anesthetized .

DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, incidence study. SETTING: Operating rooms of three tertiary care hospitals with major academic anesthesiology departments. SUBJECTS: Anesthesia faculty [MD and certified registered nurse-anesthetist (<e>CRNA</e>) staff] and anesthesia trainees (anesthesiology residents and student nurse-anesthetists). INTERVENTIONS: observe and record the placement (stethoscope device appropriately positioned) and utilization (stethoscope in place and connected to the ear piece of the anesthesia provider) of the esophageal or precordial stethoscope during general, regional, and monitored anesthesia care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During 520 anesthetics, an esophageal stethoscope was inserted in 68% of subjects, a precordial stethoscope was positioned in 16%, and an anesthetic stethoscope was absent in 16% of cases. Utilization (stethoscope connected to earpiece) ranged from a low of 11% of cases to a high of 45%, depending on the institution. Overall, providers were listening via an anesthetic stethoscope in only 28% of anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest infrequent utilization of esophageal and precordial stethoscopes in anesthesia training institutions.

Maintenance of orotracheal tube intra-cuff pressure (IcP) in a range preventing aspiration and avoiding tracheal ischemia is one way to enhance patient safety. Currently, no standardized method of cuff inflation and IcP maintenance is used in anesthesia practice. In addition, nitrous oxide (N2O) has the ability to diffuse into and inflate a cuff. Rate of N2O induced cuff inflation in vivo, has not been clearly delineated in the current literature. This study measured IcP initially, and over time during an anesthetic including 50% to 70% N2O. The sample consisted of 44 adult subjects intubated orally. Cuff inflation technique was identified and initial IcPs were recorded. IcP was then adjusted to 19 mm Hg and was continuously monitored until increasing to 25 mm Hg. A variety of cuff inflation methods were observed none of which consistently achieved an initial IcP within the target range of 19 to 25 mm Hg. IcP rose from 19 to 25 mm Hg in all cases during N2O administration. Elapsed time for the IcP increase ranged from 2 to 52 minutes (mean = 12.34, median = 8 minutes). During anesthesia with 50% to 70% N2O, IcP will increase from initial safe levels to ischemia producing levels. Devices and approaches designed to limit N2O induced IcP increase have been described, however only direct IcP monitoring has been shown to assure safe initial and ongoing IcP.",M1

In addition, the study determined differences in these attitudes, based on employment and whether they resided in a metropolitan or rural setting. Places of residence and employment in Nebraska were grouped according to population. Metropolitan areas consisted of Omaha/Douglas County and Lincoln whose populations were greater than 200,000. Moderately sized communities, where rural referral centers are located, were grouped together, and by default other communities were considered to be smaller rural communities. With a 76% response rate (n = 168), the survey demonstrated no significant difference among the four regional CRNA groups with regard to overall job satisfaction. There were however, areas of significant difference among the CRNA groups with regard to the components of job satisfaction; this was most apparent between the rural referral center and the Lincoln CRNA groups. The rural referral center CRNA group rated the following significantly higher from the Lincoln CRNA group: 1. Autonomy. 2. Experiencing positive CRNA/surgeon relationships. 3. The opportunity to improve professional skills. 4. The opportunity to meet professional goals. 5. The ability to practice anesthesia as trained. Conversely, the Lincoln CRNA group rated having  sufficient time away from work  higher than all other CRNA groups.

7725864,"Ethical dilemmas and decisions concerning the do-not-resuscitate patient undergoing anesthesia.The growing geriatric population in this country makes it increasingly difficult to deal with the number of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. In part, this is due to an increase in the number of elderly undergoing anesthesia and surgery. It can also be attributed to a rise in complex legal, ethical, and moral issues these orders pose for the healthcare professional caring for the DNR patients, including anesthetists. The term  DNR  is confusing to many, including healthcare professionals. As patients progress through the perioperative period, this confusion is compounded by the fact that administration of anesthesia encompasses interventions that include intubation, ventilation, and fluid replacement. These interventions may be regarded as resuscitative efforts outside the operating room. The anesthetist must identify and sort through a maze of conflicting courses of action, which must match the patient's desires and personal rights.

A convenience sample (N = 29) of CRNAs practicing in a university teaching hospital completed the surveys developed by the investigator. Survey items related to CRNA experience with management of patients using PCA preoperatively, PCA modes of opioid delivery, and use of adjuvant medication for chronic and cancer pain patients. Results of the study indicated that 79% of CRNAs reported experience in administration of anesthesia to one or more patients who used PCA preoperatively. However, only 32% of CRNAs surveyed reported knowledge of the modes of opioid delivery available. Results also indicated that 48% of CRNAs were not familiar with adjuvant medications (ie, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, steroids, and anticonvulsants), which are often prescribed in combination with opioids in chronic pain management. The respondents reported use of a variety of methods in handling opioid and infusion devices for patients using PCA preoperatively. Fifty-two percent of CRNAs disconnected the infusion and discarded the opioid preoperatively. Fourteen percent reported leaving the PCA device connected to the patient for use perioperatively or for continued pain management postoperatively.

RNA samples from disc tissue and PBMCs were obtained from patients with degenerative discs and from subjects in a control group. RNA samples were reverse-transcribed into Cy5-labeled <e>cRNA</e>, combined with a Cy3-labeled reference and hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. Microarrays were scanned by Gene-Pix 4000B and data were analyzed using GenePixPro 3.0 software. The microarray data were validated in the same RNA samples by qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes. For the disc tissue, the mRNA expressions of 522 genes changed obviously in the degeneration group, accounting for approximately 2.64% of all analyzed transcripts. These included transcription-related, ion channel and transport protein, receptor, protein synthesis and modifying, growth factor, etc. For PBMCs, the expressions of 62 genes changed obviously in the patients in the degeneration group. These changes included ion channel, transport protein, transcription-related, DNA synthesis and repair, metalloprotease, immune globulin-related, growth factor-related, extracellular matrix-related, adhesion molecule, etc. Analyzed on the association of the differential expression of genes between disc tissue and PBMCs, some genes were not compatible.

In Experiment 1, reconstructed oocytes were injected with sperm extract for 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 sec using a FemtoJet injection device, then treated with ionomycin. The blastocyst rate (9.8%) for 0.1-sec injection was significantly higher than that for 0.2 sec (0%) or 0.8 sec (1.4%). In Experiment 2, injection of murine PLCzeta cRNA before or after ionomycin treatment did not increase blastocyst development (0 and 4.5%) over a control treatment (injection of sperm extract after ionomycin exposure; 5.6%). Transfer of 10 blastocysts produced in Experiments 1 and 2 resulted in five pregnancies, all lost before 70 days of gestation. In Experiment 3, cells from a second biopsy sample from the same horse produced significantly more blastocysts than did the original sample (4/44 vs. 0/58; p &lt; 0.05).

19480702,"Discovery and mapping of single feature polymorphisms in wheat using Affymetrix arrays.BACKGROUND: Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple food crop worldwide. The wheat genome has not yet been sequenced due to its huge genome size (approximately 17,000 Mb) and high levels of repetitive sequences; the whole genome sequence may not be expected in the near future. Available linkage maps have low marker density due to limitation in available markers; therefore new technologies that detect genome-wide polymorphisms are still needed to discover a large number of new markers for construction of high-resolution maps. A high-resolution map is a critical tool for gene isolation, molecular breeding and genomic research. Single feature polymorphism (SFP) is a new microarray-based type of marker that is detected by hybridization of DNA or <e>cRNA</e> to oligonucleotide probes. This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of using the Affymetrix GeneChip to discover and map SFPs in the large hexaploid wheat genome. RESULTS: Six wheat varieties of diverse origins (Ning 7840, Clark, Jagger, Encruzilhada, Chinese Spring, and Opata 85) were analyzed for significant probe by variety interactions and 396 probe sets with SFPs were identified. A subset of 164 unigenes was sequenced and 54% showed polymorphism within probes. Microarray analysis of 71 recombinant inbred lines from the cross Ning 7840/Clark identified 955 SFPs and 877 of them were mapped together with 269 simple sequence repeat markers. The SFPs were randomly distributed within a chromosome but were unevenly distributed among different genomes. The B genome had the most SFPs, and the D genome had the least. Map positions of a selected set of SFPs were validated by mapping single nucleotide polymorphism using SNaPshot and comparing with expressed sequence tags mapping data. CONCLUSION: The Affymetrix array is a cost-effective platform for SFP discovery and SFP mapping in wheat. The new high-density map constructed in this study will be a useful tool for genetic and genomic research in wheat.",M2
19428522,"Signal intensities of radiolabeled <e>cRNA</e> probes used alone or in combination with non-isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry.This study addressed the question of whether radioactive hybridization signal intensities are reduced in combined isotopic and non-isotopic double in situ hybridization (DISH) compared with those in single in situ hybridization (ISH). Non-isotopic digoxigenin (Dig)-labeled hybrids were detected using an alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzymatic reaction which results in nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)-salt precipitation that could shield S35-radiation from penetrating to the surface. Sections were plastic coated of with 2% parlodion to prevent a chemical reaction between AP and developer during processing of the photosensitive emulsion, which could further reduce radioactive hybridization signal detection by autoradiography. We used DISH with a hybridization cocktail of radioactive S35- and Dig-labeled GAD67 cRNA probes. In order to avoid competition for the same complementary sequence, the probes were directed towards different sequences of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) mRNA, resulting in co-detection of isotopic and non-isotopic hybrids in close to 100% of GAD67 positive cells. Quantitation of autoradiograms showed that there was no reduction of autoradiographic signal intensity from S35-labeled hybrids in the presence of Dig-labeled hybrids. Plastic coating of single or dual hybridized sections did not reduce the radioactive signal intensity. When mRNAs for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits were detected with subunit specific S35-labeled cRNA probes in GAD67 hippocampal interneurons the total numbers of nAChR subunit expressing cells remained the same in single or double hybridized sections even for low abundant mRNAs. Together, these results indicate that combined radioactive and non-radioactive DISH does not interfere with the detection of the radiation signal from the S35-labeled hybrids, and neither specificity nor sensitivity is compromised.",M2

19074500,"Activation of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos by PLCZ <e>cRNA</e> injection.The production of cloned animals by the transfer of a differentiated somatic cell into an enucleated oocyte circumvents fertilization. During fertilization, the sperm delivers a sperm-specific phospholipase C (PLCZ) that is responsible for triggering Ca(2)(+) oscillations and oocyte activation. During bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), oocyte activation is artificially achieved by combined chemical treatments that induce a monotonic rise in intracellular Ca(2)(+) and inhibit either phosphorylation or protein synthesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of bovine nuclear transfer embryos by PLCZ improves nuclear reprogramming. Injection of PLCZ cRNA into bovine SCNT units induced Ca(2)(+) oscillations similar to those observed after fertilization and supported high rates of blastocyst development similar to that seen in embryos produced by IVF. Furthermore, gene expression analysis at the eight-cell and blastocyst stages revealed a similar expression pattern for a number of genes in both groups of embryos. Lastly, levels of trimethylated lysine 27 at histone H3 in blastocysts were higher in bovine nuclear transfer embryos activated using cycloheximide and 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) than in those activated using PLCZ or derived from IVF. These results demonstrate that exogenous PLCZ can be used to activate bovine SCNT-derived embryos and support the hypothesis that a fertilization-like activation response can enhance some aspects of nuclear reprogramming.",M2

Significant correlations (R2, 0.9893 and 0.975; P &lt; 0.001) were observed among virgin arrays and stripped arrays hybridized with the same sample. Additionally, statistical class comparison analysis globally indicated that there were essentially no differences detected following three hybridizations. Dye-swapped microarrays produced similar results. However, arrays stripped with RNase H exhibited decreased efficiency of hybridization signal with increasing use. In the present study, the oligonucleotide microarrays can be used three times.",M2
18998089,"Xenopus oocytes as a heterologous expression system for studying ion channels with the patch-clamp technique.Oocytes from the Xenopus laevis represent one of the most widely used expression systems for functional characterization of ion channels. Their large size facilitates both injection of heterologous <e>cRNA</e> and subsequent electrophysiological recordings of ion channel currents. Furthermore, Xenopus oocytes translate cRNA very efficiently, resulting in the generation of a large number of ion channels in the plasma membrane. In this chapter, we outline methods for oocyte preparation and maintenance and describe procedures for patch-clamping of oocytes, with a special focus on the macropatch technique. We discuss some common problems associated with patch-clamping of oocytes and their use as an expression system for ion channels.",M2
18760308,"A simple, sensitive, specific detection of mixed infection of multiple plant viruses using macroarray and microtube hybridization.A simple, sensitive and specific method using a cDNA macroarray to detect multiple viruses was devised. The method is used in plants such as potato and lily, which need a reliable routine diagnosis for mixed infection. The biotinylated <e>cRNA</e> targets were prepared using an in vitro transcription-based system that was designed especially to eliminate nonspecific hybridizations. The macroarray hybridization was carried out using a convenient, cost-effective  microtube hybridization  (MTH) system. By this method, lily viruses including Cucumber mosaic virus, Lily symptomless virus, Lily mottle virus, and Plantago asiatica mosaic virus were detected successfully from leaves or roots of lily bulbs.",M2
18760305,"Quantitative PCR measurements of the effects of introducing inosines into primers provides guidelines for improved degenerate primer design.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect groups of viruses with the use of group-specific degenerate primers. Inosine residues are sometimes used in the primers to match variable positions within the complementary target sequences, but there is little data on their effects on cDNA synthesis and amplification. A quantitative reverse-transcription PCR was used to measure the rate of amplification with primers containing inosine residues substituted at different positions and in increasing numbers. Experiments were conducted using standard quantities of cloned DNA copied from Potato virus Y genomic RNA and RNA (<e>cRNA</e>) transcribed from the cloned DNA. Single inosine residues had no affect on the amplification rate in the forward primer, except at one position close to the 3' terminus. Conversely, single inosine residues significantly reduced the amplification rate when placed at three out of four positions in the reverse primer. Four or five inosine substitutions could be tolerated with some decline in rates, but amplification often failed from cRNA templates with primers containing larger numbers of inosines. Greater declines in the rate of amplification were observed with RNA templates, suggesting that reverse transcription suffers more than PCR amplification when inosine is included in the reverse primer.",M2
18600225,"An optimized procedure for whole-mount in situ hybridization on mouse embryos and embryoid bodies.Determining the precise expression pattern of a gene of interest at various stages of development is essential to understanding its biological function in embryology. This protocol describes a sensitive method for whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) to mouse embryos, using <e>cRNA</e> probes. Adaptations are provided that allow the protocol to be applied to embryonic stages ranging from blastocysts to postimplantation stage embryos, and to embryoid bodies.

The actual WISH procedure can be completed in another 3 d.",M2
18532901,"Improved high-throughput ultrafiltration process enables <e>cRNA</e> purification for gene expression profiling.Ultrafiltration of nucleic acids has been used for a wide variety of applications, including sequence reaction purification and amplicon cleanup prior to spotting onto microarrays. Here we describe a novel process, using ultrafiltration, that purifies cRNA products for sensitive downstream applications. Initial attempts at this high-throughput purification for cRNA resulted in low sensitivity when compared against an industry standard (silica-based bind, wash, and elute purification). We modified the ultrafiltration process to include a proteinase K preincubation and a phosphate buffer wash that, when combined, increased sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio in microarray applications. The protocol that we have developed eliminates the use of chaotropic salts (such as guanidinium thiocyanate) that are typically used in silica binding purification methods. The data demonstrate good performance for sensitive RNA applications using well-defined metrics, and thus the technique might be useful for a broader range of nucleic acid purifications.",M2
18480985,"Electromagnetic field change the expression of osteogenesis genes in murine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.In order to identify the differentially expressing gene of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) stimulated by electromagnetic field (EMF) with osteogenesis microarray analysis, the bone marrow MSCs of SD rats were isolated and cultured in vitro. The third-passage cells were stimulated by EMFs and total RNA was extracted, purified and then used for the synthesis of cDNA and <e>cRNA</e>. The cRNA of stimulated group and the control group was hybridized with the rat oligo osteogenesis microarray respectively. The hybridization signals were acquired by using X-ray film after chemiluminescent detection and the data obtained were analyzed by employing the web-based completely integrated GEArray Expression Analysis Suite. RT-PCR was used to identify the target genes: Bmp1, Bmp7, Egf and Egfr. The results showed that 19 differentially expressing genes were found between the stimulated group and the control group. There were 6 up-regulated genes and 13 down-regulated genes in the stimulated group. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the expressions of Bmp1, Bmp7 mRNA of the stimulated group were up-regulated (P&lt;0.05) and those of Egf, Egfr were down-regulated (P&lt;0.05). It was suggested that the gene expression profiles of osteogenesis of the bone marrow MSCs were changed after EMF treatment. It is concluded that the genes are involved in skeletal development, bone mineral metabolism, cell growth and differentiation, cell adhesion etc.",M2

Over the past 5 yr, studies of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (or neutrophil) (PMN) gene expression on a global scale have provided new insight into the molecular processes that promote resolution of infections in humans. Herein, we present methods to analyze gene expression in human neutrophils using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays, which include isolation of high-quality RNA, generation and labeling of <e>cRNA</e>, and GeneChip hybridization and scanning.

18452992,"VIP reverses the expression profiling of TLR4-stimulated signaling pathway in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts.Since recent evidences point out the potential involvement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the therapeutic effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), the purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of VIP as a negative regulator of TLR-signaling. To this aim, we analyzed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA), the expression profile of TLR-pathway related molecules, as well as the alterations induced by LPS stimulation in RA-FLS and the effect of VIP treatment. Cultured FLS were obtained from patients with RA or OA. RA-FLS were next stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in presence or absence of VIP. The gene expression profiling of molecules involved in LPS-mediated TLR4-signaling was studied by <e>cRNA</e> microarray analysis. Twenty three molecules involved in TLR signaling resulted over-expressed at mRNA level in basal RA-FLS compared to OA-FLS. Moreover, in RA-FLS, 23 of the analyzed genes were found to be up-regulated by LPS stimulation whereas 30 were not affected. VIP down-regulated the LPS-induced RNA expression of molecules involved in TLR signaling pathway. Up-regulation of RNA expression of CD14, MD2, TRAM, TRIF, IRAK4, TAB2, TRAF6 and TBK1 was corroborated by RT-PCR as well as the VIP regulatory effect. Increased protein levels of TRAF6, TBK1 and pIRAK1 after exposure to LPS, and the inhibitory effect of VIP, were described by Western blotting. As functional consequences, it was observed the VIP-induced impaired production of IL-6 and RANTES/CCL5 after LPS stimulation. In conclusion, VIP acts as a negative modulator of the TLR4-signaling by overturning the production of several checkpoints molecules of the cascade and thus, widening its potential therapeutic effects.",M2
18289551,"Microarray gene profiling of laser-captured cells: a new tool to study atherosclerosis in mice.Genetically modified mice susceptible to atherosclerosis are widely used in atherosclerosis research. Although the atherosclerotic lesions in these animals show similarities to those in humans, comprehensive expression profile analysis of these lesions is limited by their very small size. In this communication, we have developed an approach to analyze global gene expression in mouse lesions by a combination of (a) laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate RNA from specific lesions, and (b) an efficient RNA amplification method that reliably yields sufficient quantities of high quality <e>cRNA</e> for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), as well as for microarray analysis. The RNA passed multiple quality controls and the expression profile observed in lesional cells compared with the whole artery encompasses genes that are characteristic of a macrophage/foam cell population. We believe that this method represents a useful new tool for the unbiased analysis of global gene expression of specific sub-regions in atherosclerotic lesions in different rodent models.",M2
18284699,"Parthenogenetic activation of bovine oocytes using bovine and murine phospholipase C zeta.BACKGROUND: During natural fertilization, sperm fusion with the oocyte induces long lasting intracellular calcium oscillations which in turn are responsible for oocyte activation. PLCZ1 has been identified as the factor that the sperm delivers into the egg to induce such a response. We tested the hypothesis that PLCZ1 <e>cRNA</e> injection can be used to activate bovine oocytes. RESULTS: Mouse and bovine PLCZ1 cRNAs were injected into matured bovine oocytes at different concentrations. Within the concentrations tested, mouse PLCZ1 injection activated bovine oocytes at a maximum rate when the pipette concentration of cRNA ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/muL, while bovine PLCZ1 was optimal at 0.1 mug/muL. At their most effective concentrations, PLCZ1 induced parthenogenetic development at rates similar to those observed using other activation stimuli such as Ionomycin/CHX and Ionomycin/DMAP. Injection of mouse and bovine PLCZ1 cRNA induced dose-dependent sperm-like calcium oscillations whose frequency increased over time. Injection of bovine and mouse PLCZ1 cRNA also induced IP3R-1 degradation, although bovine PLCZ1 cRNA evoked greater receptor degradation than its mouse counterpart. CONCLUSION: Injection of PLCZ1 cRNA efficiently activated bovine oocytes by inducing a sperm-like calcium oscillatory pattern. Importantly, the high rate of aneuploidy encountered in parthenogenetic embryos activated by certain chemical means was not observed in PLCZ1 activated embryos.",M2
18231654,"Redox state of plastoquinone pool regulates expression of Arabidopsis thaliana genes in response to elevated irradiance.DNA microarray technology was applied to gain insight into the role of the redox state of PQ pool as a retrograde factor mediating differential expression of Arabidopsis nuclear genes during the acclimation to changing irradiance. DNA microarray chips containing probes corresponding to 24,000 Arabidopsis nuclear genes were screened with <e>cRNA</e> samples prepared from leaves of plants exposed for 5 h to low irradiance (control) vs. medium, high and excessive irradiances (MI, HI and EI, respectively). Six hundred and sixty three genes were differentially expressed as a result of an exposure to at least one elevated irradiance. Among 663 differentially expressed genes a total of 50 were reverted by DCMU--24 ones modulated at medium irradiance, 32 ones modulated at high irradiance and a single one modulated at excessive irradiance. We postulate that their expression is regulated by redox state of plastoquinone (PQ) pool. Thus the PQ-mediated redox regulation of expression of Arabidopsis nuclear genes is probably limited to the irradiance window representing non-stressing conditions. We found that the promoter regions of the PQ-regulated genes contained conserved elements, suggesting transcriptional control by a shared set of trans-acting factors which participate in signal transduction from the redox state of the PQ pool.",M2
18220233,"ArrayPlex SA: a turn-key automated gene expression target preparation system.Automated target preparation for gene expression analysis eliminates the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual process, which is error prone and diverts scientists from value added activities. Target preparation methods were developed, on the fully integrated ArrayPlex SA system, based on the field proven Biomek FX, which streamlined the target preparation procedure allowing up to 96 samples to be processed in less than 36 h. The process is comprised of three functional methods, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription, and fragmentation, providing the users with the ability to consolidate runs for optimal use of instrument time and minimize reagent cost. Starting with sets of eight tRNA samples, the cDNA synthesis method synthesizes the first and second strand DNA followed by a cDNA clean-up step using an ultrafiltration plate. The in vitro transcription method then amplifies and biotin-labels the cDNA to <e>cRNA</e> in 6 h at 37 degrees C, and purifies the product using a solid support extraction plate. Finally, the fragmentation method quantifies the cRNA, adjusts the concentration to the recommended 0.625 microg/mL and fragments the cRNA prior to an off-line hybridization. Universal human reference RNA with concentration ranging from 1 to 7.5 microg were prepared on the ArrayPlex SA, compared against a manual method and scanned using Affymetrix human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array GeneChip cartridges. Nested analysis of variance was then performed to identify sources of variability between the automated and manual methods.",M2
17905403,"Differential role of the influenza A virus polymerase PA subunit for vRNA and <e>cRNA</e> promoter binding.The RNA polymerase of influenza A virus is a heterotrimeric complex of PB1, PB2 and PA subunits that is required for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Here, we demonstrate a differential requirement of the PA subunit for binding to the vRNA and cRNA promoters--specifically, PA is more important for binding to the cRNA than the vRNA promoter. Furthermore, five point mutations were identified in the L163-I178 region of PA, which resulted in an inhibition of polymerase activity when provided with a cRNA compared to vRNA promoter. Cross-linking studies suggested that this inhibition was due to a reduction in promoter binding of the mutant polymerases to the cRNA promoter. We conclude that the L163-I178 region of PA is directly or indirectly involved in cRNA promoter binding and suggest a novel function for PA in modulating promoter binding.",M2
17851698,"Expression and cellular pattern of relaxin mRNA in porcine corpora lutea during pregnancy.We developed an in situ hybridization method for detecting relaxin mRNA in the porcine corpus luteum (CL) by employing a non-radioactive probe and microwave fixation. We subsequently examined the expression and cellular patterns of relaxin mRNA in the CL during pregnancy and then evaluated whether relaxin mRNA was a factor limiting hormone production by the CL. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes complementary to porcine relaxin mRNA were produced by in vitro transcription. The specificity was validated by showing, by Northern analysis, that the anti-sense probe hybridized to a 1.0-kb relaxin transcript in the CL. Microwave fixation (2-min irradiation in a conventional microwave oven) combined with DIG-labeled <e>cRNA</e> probes allowed precise and reliable analysis of relaxin mRNA, with superior retention of the mRNA and a higher resolving power. Application of this method to the porcine CL during pregnancy demonstrated that the relaxin mRNA level per cell and the percentage of mRNA-expressing cells increased as gestation progressed, with a marked decline near term. Northern analysis revealed the cellular pattern of relaxin mRNA localization, showing that the increase of relaxin mRNA with advancing pregnancy was attributable to an increase of both the cellular mRNA level and the percentage of mRNA-expressing cells. The present findings, taken together with known relaxin levels in the CL, reveal that changes of relaxin mRNA are correlated with changes of the hormone in the CL during pregnancy, suggesting that the relaxin level is determined by the amount of mRNA available for translation.",M2
17767423,"Reagent preparation and storage for amplification of microarray hybridization targets with a fully automated system.The advent of automated systems for gene expression profiling has accentuated the need for the development of convenient and cost-effective methods for reagent preparation. We have developed a method for the preparation and storage of pre-aliquoted cocktail plates that contain all reagents required for amplification of nucleic acid by reverse transcription and in vitro transcription reactions. Plates can be stored at -80 degrees C for at least 1 month and kept in a hotel at 4 degrees C for at least 24 h prior to use. Microarray data quality generated from these pre-aliquoted reagent plates is not statistically different between <e>cRNA</e> amplified with stored cocktails and cRNA amplified with freshly prepared cocktails. Deployment of pre-aliquoted, stored cocktail plates in a fully automated system not only increases the throughput of amplifying cRNA targets from thousands of RNA samples, but could also considerably reduce reagent costs and potentially improve process robustness.",M2
17582227,"Hairpin DNAzymes: a new tool for efficient cellular gene silencing.BACKGROUND: RNA-based gene silencing is potentially a powerful therapeutic strategy. Catalytic 10-23 DNAzymes bind to target RNA by complimentary sequence arms on a Watson-Crick basis and thus can be targeted to effectively cleave specific mRNA species. However, for in vivo applications it is necessary to stabilise DNAzymes against nucleolytic attack. Chemical modifications can be introduced into the binding arms to increase stability but these may alter catalytic activity and in some cases increase cell toxicity. METHODS: We designed novel 10-23 DNAzyme structures that incorporate stem-loop hairpins at either end on the DNAzyme binding arms. The catalytic activity of hairpin DNAzymes (hpDNAzyme) were tested in vitro against 32P-labelled <e>cRNA</e> encoding the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) alpha-subunit. Resistance of hpDNAzymes to nucleolytic degradation was tested by incubation of the hpDNAzymes with Bal-31, DNase1 or HeLa cell extract. Gene silencing by hpDNAzymes was assessed by measuring reduced fluorescence from DsRed2 and EGFP reporters in cell culture systems, and reduced 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding in cells transfected with cDNA encoding the AChR. RESULTS: We show that hpDNAzymes show remarkable resistance to nucleolytic degradation, and demonstrate that in cell culture systems the hpDNAzymes are far more effective than standard 10-23 DNAzymes in down-regulating protein expression from target mRNA species. CONCLUSION: hpDNAzymes provide new molecular tools that, without chemical modification, give highly efficient gene silencing in cells, and may have potential therapeutic applications.",M2
17567688,"Differential polymerase activity in avian and mammalian cells determines host range of influenza virus.As recently shown, mutations in the polymerase genes causing increased polymerase activity in mammalian cells are responsible for the adaptation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus SC35 (H7N7) to mice (G. Gabriel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:18590-18595, 2005). We have now compared mRNA, <e>cRNA</e>, and viral RNA levels of SC35 and its mouse-adapted variant SC35M in avian and mammalian cells. The increase in levels of transcription and replication of SC35M in mammalian cells was linked to a decrease in avian cells. Thus, the efficiency of the viral polymerase is a determinant of both host specificity and pathogenicity.",M2
17558444,"Microarray analysis of the developing rat mandible.To analyze the molecular events that occur in the developing mandible, we examined the expression of 8803 genes from samples taken at different time points during rat postnatal mandible development.

Fragmented cRNA was hybridized to RG-U34A GeneChip arrays. Among the 8803 genes tested, 4344 were detectable. We identified 148 genes with significantly increased expression, and 19 genes with significantly decreased expression. A comprehensive analysis appears to be an effective method of studying the complex process of development.",M2
17511875,"Comparison of target labeling methods for use with Affymetrix GeneChips.BACKGROUND: Several different commercial one-cycle labeling kits are available for preparation of the target for use with the Affymetrix GeneChip platform. However, there have been no evaluations of these different kits to determine if comparable results were generated. We report on the <e>cRNA</e> target synthesis, labeling efficiency and hybridization results using the One-Cycle Target Labeling Assay (Affymetrix), the BioArray RNA Amplification and Labeling System (Enzo Life Sciences), and the Superscript RNA Amplification System (Invitrogen Life Technologies). RESULTS: The only notable difference between kits was in the yield of cRNA target synthesized during in vitro transcription, where the BioArray assay had to be repeated several times in order to have sufficient target. However, each kit resulted in comparable signal and detection calls when hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip. CONCLUSION: These 3 one-cycle labeling kits produce comparable hybridization results. This provides users with several kit options and flexibility when using the Affymetrix system.",M2
17471153,"Molecular detection of SS18-SSX fusion gene transcripts by <e>cRNA</e> in situ hybridization in synovial sarcoma using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens.SS18-SSX fusion genes resulting from a chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) are a genetic hallmark of synovial sarcoma. Although such cytogenetic or molecular aberrations have mostly been detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of SS18-SSX has been poorly investigated at a cellular or tissue level. In this study, biotinylated tyramide (BT)-based in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to detect SS18-SSX transcripts using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 15 synovial sarcomas. Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes flanking the fusion points of SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2 were generated by in vitro transcription, and hybridized signals were detected by a streptavidin-biotin complex method after chemical enhancement with BT. The localizations of signals were compared with the immunohistochemical expressions of epithelial or neuroectodermal markers and those of cell adhesion including cytokeratins (CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, CK7), epithelial membrane antigen, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu), CD56, and claudin-1. The ISH signals of the SS18-SSX transcripts were identified in 13 synovial sarcomas, and their fusion types correlated with those determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In biphasic tumors, the ISH signals tended to localize to epithelial areas, whereas spindle-cell areas or monophasic fibrous tumors showed a less intense or focal expression pattern. Notably, the expression patterns of AE1/AE3, CK7, and c-erbB-2 often colocalized with the ISH signals (7 of 11 cases positive for each marker). Our results suggest that BT-based ISH can be used as a molecular technique for the detection of SS18-SSX using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.",M2
17415608,"Methionine aminopeptidase II: A molecular chaperone for sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase.The monoclonal antibody to the beta-subunit of H(+)/K(+)-ATPase (mAbHKbeta) cross-reacts with a protein that acts as a molecular chaperone for the structural maturation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase. We partially purified a mAbHKbeta-reactive 65-kDa protein from Xenopus ovary. After in-gel digestion and peptide sequencing, the 65-kDa protein was identified as methionine aminopeptidase II (MetAP2). The effects of MetAP2 on SR Ca(2+)-ATPase expression were examined by injecting the <e>cRNA</e> for MetAP2 into Xenopus oocytes. Immunoprecipitation and pulse-chase experiments showed that MetAP2 was transiently associated with the nascent SR Ca(2+)-ATPase. Synthesis of functional SR Ca(2+)-ATPase was facilitated by MetAP2 and prevented by injecting an antibody specific for MetAP2. These results suggest that MetAP2 acts as a molecular chaperone for SR Ca(2+)-ATPase synthesis.",M2
17372366,"Detection of <e>cRNA</e> hybridized on a DNA chip using a tetrakis-acridinyl peptide cassette, consisting of TAP and partially self-complementary oligonucleotide, d[A18(TA)51].A tetrakis-acridinyl peptide (TAP) cassette, consisting of a double-stranded region of alternating AT sequence bound to TAP and a single stranded overhanging sequence of continuous dA, was prepared by mixing TAP with d[A18(TA)51]. A TAP cassette could be applied to the fluorometric detection of hybridized DNA on the DNA chip, which was prepared by stamping a 45-meric DNA probe onto a gold-coated plastic chip using a high-precision spotter developed at RIKEN. Spots on the DNA chip were imaged by a CCD camera after hybridization with 65-meric target single-stranded DNAs carrying a continuous dA20 sequence (dA tail) on the DNA chip after treatment with a TAP cassette. Their fluorescence intensity on the DNA chip showed a good linear correlation with the concentration of the target DNAs in the range from 10 pM to 1 nM. Fluorescence of their spots derived from the TAP cassette remaining on the surface of the DNA chip through the dA tail of the hybridized target DNA. Furthermore, the TAP cassette could be successfully applied to the quantitative detection of complementary RNAs (cRNAs) prepared from rat brain with reverse transcription and in vitro transcription.",M2
17325454,"Exogenous expression of rat aquaporin-3 enhances permeability to water and cryoprotectants of immature oocytes in the zebrafish (Danio rerio).Movement of water and cryoprotectants through the plasma membrane needs to be accelerated for successful cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes/embryos, which are much larger than their mammalian counterparts. Aquaporin-3 is a water/solute channel that can transport not only water but also various cryoprotectants. In this study, we attempted to increase the permeability of immature zebrafish oocytes at stage III to water and cryoprotectants by exogenous expression of rat aquaporin-3. Immature zebrafish oocytes were injected with rat aquaporin-3 <e>cRNA</e> and cultured for 5-12 h. Permeability to water and cryoprotectants was then determined based on changes in the volumes of the oocytes in a hypertonic sucrose solution and various cryoprotectant solutions at 25 C. The permeability to water of the aquaporin-3 cRNA-injected oocytes was three times higher than that of intact and water-injected oocytes. The permeability of the aquaporin-3 cRNA-injected oocytes to ethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, and DMSO was also 2-4 times higher than that of intact oocytes. Thus, the permeability of immature zebrafish oocytes to water and cryoprotectants was enhanced by exogenous expression of aquaporin-3. Cryopreservation of teleost oocytes may be realized through a further increase in permeability.",M2
17285305,"Evaluation of amplified <e>cRNA</e> targets for oligonucleotide microarrays.Due to their hybridization specificity and capacity for systematic gene discovery, oligonucleotide-based microarray platforms offer numerous advantages over the cDNA microarrays currently widely used for comprehensive analysis of gene expression. Although fluorescently labeled amplified cRNA generated by T7 transcription is generally used in oligonucleotide microarrays, the feasibility of this combination (and that of cDNA microarrays) is yet to be studied systematically. In this paper, we performed a comparative study using a direct labeling method and T7 amplification to evaluate amplified cRNA targets for oligonucleotide microarrays. The efficiency of incorporation of Cy3- and Cy5-CTP into the target preparations, the reproducibility and the number of genes detected were investigated for each labeling approach and compared. The 12 genes that showed different expression profiles in the two labeling methods were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. In the 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray, amplified cRNA targets prepared by the T7 amplification method showed higher reproducibility and reliability than targets prepared by the direct labeling method in a comparative analysis of gene expression. This result also suggests the importance of fragmenting cRNA down to lengths of 50-200 bases before the hybridization process.",M2
17201770,"Functional characterization of Musca glutamate- and GABA-gated chloride channels expressed independently and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes.Ligand-gated chloride channels (LGICs) are important targets for insecticides and parasiticides. Genes encoding subunits of two LGICs, a glutamate-gated chloride channel (MdGluCl-alpha) and a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channel (MdRdl), were cloned from house-flies (Musca domestica L.). These genes were first expressed independently in Xenopus laevis oocytes by <e>cRNA</e> injection in order to investigate the pharmacology of these ligand-gated channels using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. It was found that L-glutamate and GABA activated the MdGluCl-alpha homo-oligomers with an EC(50) value of 30 microM and the MdRdl homo-oligomers with an EC(50) value of 101 microM, respectively. Both channels were chloride ion-permeable, and the MdRdl channel was more sensitive to chloride channel blockers, such as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), fipronil and picrotoxinin, than the MdGluCl-alpha channel. MdGluCl-alpha required only 1-2 days of incubation after cRNA injection to be expressed in oocytes, whereas 4-7 days of incubation was necessary to achieve MdRdl expression. However, when the cRNA of MdGluCl-alpha was injected at a dose of 1% (w/w) 1 day after the injection of the cRNA of MdRdl, a significant increase in the current amplitude of responses to GABA was observed, and the incubation period necessary for MdRdl expression became shorter. These results suggest that MdGluCl-alpha assists in the expression of MdRdl when the two are coexpressed.",M2
17166911,"Influenza virion-derived viral ribonucleoproteins synthesize both mRNA and <e>cRNA</e> in vitro.The mechanisms regulating the synthesis of mRNA, cRNA, and viral genomic RNA (vRNA) by the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are not fully understood. Early results suggested that the RNA polymerase  switched  from a transcriptase to a replicase during the viral life cycle in response to the expression of viral proteins. However, recently an alternative model suggesting that replication of influenza virus is regulated by stabilization of the replicative intermediates was proposed. According to this model, the virion-associated polymerase is capable of synthesizing both mRNA and cRNA. We now demonstrate that virion-derived viral ribonucleoproteins (vvRNPs) synthesize both mRNA and cRNA in vitro in the absence of non-virion-associated RNA polymerase or nucleoproteins. The authenticity of the in vitro-transcribed mRNA and cRNA was confirmed by terminal sequence analysis. The addition of non-virion-associated polymerase or NP had no effect on vvRNP activity. De novo synthesis of cRNA was found to be more sensitive than the capped primer-dependent synthesis of mRNA to the concentration of ATP, CTP, and GTP. We conclude that vvRNPs intrinsically possess both transcriptase and replicase activities and that there is no switch in the synthesis of mRNA to cRNA during the influenza virus life cycle.",M2
17085801,"Microarray analysis of cardiovascular diseases.Microarray analysis is a powerful technique for high-throughput, global transcriptonomic profiling of gene expression. It holds great promise for analyzing the genetic and molecular bases of cardiovascular diseases and various other complex diseases and permits the analysis of thousands of genes simultaneously, both in diseased and nondiseased tissues and/or cell lines. Microarrays or microchips are made by depositing spots of DNA or oligonucleotides representing thousands of genes on a solid support such as a coated glass surface, and can allow the comparison of gene expression patterns in any two samples. Total RNA is isolated from the tissue or cells of interest, converted to cDNA and then <e>cRNA</e> labeled with biotin, and hybridized to the chips. Hybridization signals are then quantified and compared among different samples. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to obtain an unbiased assessment of expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously in normal and diseased coronary arteries. Fifty-six genes showed differential expression in atherosclerotic coronary artery tissues, and 49 of them represent new linked genes for coronary artery disease. These studies can generate novel hypotheses relating to the pathologies of disease and further studies with animal models, molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry will validate these hypotheses and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of disease.",M2
17030872,"Role of the influenza virus heterotrimeric RNA polymerase complex in the initiation of replication.Both transcription and replication of the influenza virus RNA genome are catalysed by a virus-specific RNA polymerase. Recently, an in vitro assay, based on the synthesis of pppApG, for the initiation of replication by recombinant RNA polymerase in the absence of added primer was described. Here, these findings are extended to show that adenosine, AMP and ADP can each substitute for ATP in reactions catalysed by either recombinant ribonucleoprotein or RNA polymerase complexes with either model virion RNA (vRNA) or <e>cRNA</e> promoters. The use of either adenosine or AMP, rather than ATP, provides a convenient, sensitive and easy assay of replication initiation. Moreover, no pppApG was detected when a PB1-PA dimer, rather than the trimeric polymerase, was used to catalyse synthesis, contrasting with a previous report using baculovirus-expressed influenza RNA polymerase. Overall, it is suggested that the heterotrimeric polymerase is essential for the initiation of replication.",M2
16996470,"Evaluation of two methods for generating <e>cRNA</e> for microarray experiments from nanogram amounts of total RNA.Several methods have been developed for amplification of RNA, making it possible to use cDNA microarrays for analysis of samples limited in amount of total RNA. The most widely used amplification protocol, the Eberwine method, amplifies RNA in a linear manner through in vitro transcription (IVT). However, when starting material is limited to nanogram amounts of total RNA, several rounds of amplification are necessary, making this method both expensive and labor-intensive. Amplification by PCR is robust and is able to amplify extremely limiting material. However, it is possible that the nonlinear nature of PCR could result in reduced reproducibility of the amplification compared with IVT. We have evaluated two methods that use a combination of PCR and IVT for amplification of nanogram amounts of total RNA. We have compared microarray results obtained by these methods with results obtained by two established methods: indirect labeling of 20 microg total RNA and Eberwine amplification of 1 microg total RNA. Starting from as little as 5 ng of total RNA, both methods yielded results in concordance with the Eberwine method.",M2
16970301,"Automated target preparation for microarray-based gene expression analysis.DNA microarrays have rapidly evolved toward a platform for massively paralleled gene expression analysis. Despite its widespread use, the technology has been criticized to be vulnerable to technical variability. Addressing this issue, recent comparative, interplatform, and interlaboratory studies have revealed that, given defined procedures for  wet lab  experiments and data processing, a satisfactory reproducibility and little experimental variability can be achieved. In view of these advances in standardization, the requirement for uniform sample preparation becomes evident, especially if a microarray platform is used as a facility, i.e., by different users working in the laboratory. While one option to reduce technical variability is to dedicate one laboratory technician to all microarray studies, we have decided to automate the entire RNA sample preparation implementing a liquid handling system coupled to a thermocycler and a microtiter plate reader. Indeed, automated RNA sample preparation prior to chip analysis enables (1) the reduction of experimentally caused result variability, (2) the separation of (important) biological variability from (undesired) experimental variation, and (3) interstudy comparison of gene expression results. Our robotic platform can process up to 24 samples in parallel, using an automated sample preparation method that produces high-quality biotin-labeled <e>cRNA</e> ready to be hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChips. The results show that the technical interexperiment variation is less pronounced than with manually prepared samples. Moreover, experiments using the same starting material showed that the automated process yields a good reproducibility between samples.",M2
16942765,"Cryoprotectant permeability of aquaporin-3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes.It has been shown that aquaporin-3, a water channel, is expressed in mouse embryos. This type of aquaporin transports not only water but also neutral solutes, including cell-permeating cryoprotectants. Therefore, the expression of this channel may have significant influence on the survival of cryopreserved embryos. However, permeability coefficients of aquaporin-3 to cryoprotectants have not been determined except for glycerol. In addition, permeability coefficients under concentration gradients are important for developing and improving cryopreservation protocols. In this study, we examined the permeability of aquaporin-3 to various cryoprotectants using Xenopus oocytes. The permeability of aquaporin-3 to cryoprotectants was measured by the volume change of aquaporin-3 <e>cRNA</e>-injected oocytes in modified Barth's solution containing either 10% glycerol, 8% ethylene glycol, 10% propylene glycol, 1.5 M acetamide, or 9.5% DMSO (1.51-1.83 Osm/kg) at 25 degrees C. Permeability coefficients of aquaporin-3 for ethylene glycol and propylene glycol were 33.50 and 31.45 x 10(-3) cm/min, respectively, which were as high as the value for glycerol (36.13 x 10(-3) cm/min). These values were much higher than those for water-injected control oocytes (0.04-0.11 x 10(-3) cm/min). On the other hand, the coefficients for acetamide and DMSO were not well determined because the volume data were poorly fitted by the two parameter model, possibly because of membrane damage. To avoid this, the permeability for these cryoprotectants was measured under a low concentration gradient by suspending oocytes in aqueous solutions containing low concentrations of acetamide or DMSO dissolved in water (0.20 Osm/kg). The coefficient for acetamide (24.60 x 10(-3) cm/min) was as high as the coefficients for glycerol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, and was significantly higher than the value for control (6.50 x 10(-3) cm/min). The value for DMSO (6.33 x 10(-3) cm/min) was relatively low, although higher than the value for control (0.79 x 10(-3) cm/min). This is the first reported observation of DMSO transport by aquaporin-3.",M2
16941059,"SYBR Green real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for the generic detection of coronaviruses.Coronaviruses are etiologic agents of respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and in animals. In this study, a one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on SYBR Green chemistry and degenerate primers was developed for the generic detection of coronaviruses. The primers, designed in the open reading frame 1b, enabled the detection of 32 animal coronaviruses including strains of canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). A specific amplification was also observed with the human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The real-time RT-PCR detected down to 10 <e>cRNA</e> copies from TGEV, BCoV, SARS-CoV and IBV. In addition, the assay exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity on clinical samples from different animal species. The developed assay represents a potential tool for laboratory diagnostics and for detecting still uncharacterized coronaviruses.",M2
16940280,"Molecular cloning, testicular postnatal expression, and oocyte-activating potential of porcine phospholipase Czeta.The molecular mechanism by which sperm triggers Ca2+ oscillation, oocyte activation, and early embryonic development has not been clarified. Recently, oocyte activation has been shown to be induced by sperm-specific phospholipase Czeta (PLCzeta). The ability of PLCzeta to induce oocyte activation is highly conserved across vertebrates. In the present study, porcine PLCzeta cDNA was identified and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The expression pattern of porcine PLCzeta mRNA during the period of postnatal testicular development was shown to be similar to that of mouse PLCzeta. PLCzeta mRNA expression in the pig and mouse was detected only in the testes when the elongated spermatids had differentiated, and was detected from day 96 after birth in the pig. Histological examination of porcine testis during the period of postnatal development revealed the presence of spermatozoa from day 110 after birth. These findings suggest that the synthesis of PLCzeta mRNA starts when spermiogenesis is initiated. Microinjection of porcine PLCzeta complementary RNA into porcine oocytes demonstrated that porcine PLCzeta has the ability to trigger repetitive Ca2+ transients in porcine oocytes similar to that observed during fertilization. It was also found that porcine PLCzeta <e>cRNA</e> has the potential to induce oocyte activation and initiate embryonic development up to the blastocyst stage.",M2
16899600,"A validated quantitative assay to detect occult micrometastases by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of guanylyl cyclase C in patients with colorectal cancer.PURPOSE: Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC), a receptor for bacterial diarrheagenic enterotoxins, may be a prognostic and predictive marker to detect occult micrometastases in patients undergoing staging for colorectal cancer. However, quantification of GCC expression in tissues by the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) has not undergone analytic and clinicopathologic validation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A technique to quantify GCC mRNA in tissues employing RT-PCR was developed and validated employing external calibration standards of RNA complementary to GCC. RESULTS: GCC qRT-PCR exhibited reaction efficiencies &gt;92%, coefficients of variations &lt;5%, linearity &gt;6 orders of magnitude, and a limit of quantification of &gt;25 copies of GCC <e>cRNA</e>. This assay confirmed that GCC mRNA was overexpressed by colorectal tumors from 41 patients, which correlated with increased GCC protein quantified by immunohistochemistry. Analyses obtained with 164 lymph nodes from patients free of cancer and 15 nodes harboring metastases established a threshold for metastatic disease of approximately 200 GCC mRNA copies/mug total RNA, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 97%. GCC mRNA above that threshold was detected in 76 of 367 (approximately 21%) nodes free of disease by histopathology from 6 of 23 (26%) patients, suggesting the presence of occult micrometastases. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying GCC mRNA in tissues by RT-PCR employing external calibration standards is analytically robust and reproducible, with high clinicopathologic sensitivity and specificity. This validated assay is being applied to approximately 10,000 lymph nodes in a prospective trial to define the sensitivity of GCC qRT-PCR for staging patients with colorectal cancer.",M2
16842670,"[Electrophysiological characterization of long QT syndrome associated mutations V630A and N633S]OBJECTIVE: To identify the electrophysiological properties of long-QT syndrome (LQTS) associated missense mutations in the outer mouth of the HERG potassium channel in vitro. METHODS: Mutations V630A and N633S were constructed by Megaprimer PCR method and <e>cRNA</e> were produced by T7 RNA polymerase. The electrophysiological properties of the mutation were investigated in the Xenopus oocyte heterologous expression system. RESULTS: Coexpression of mutant and wild-type HERG subunits caused a dominant-negative effect, and the currents were significantly decreased. Compared with wild-type HERG channels, V630A and N633S mutations were related to decreased time constants for inactivation for V630A/WT and N633S/WT at all potentials, reduced slope conductance and the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was shifted to negative potentials for V630A/WT and N633S/WT. CONCLUSION: Present study shows that LQTS associated missense mutations located in the outer mouth of HERG cause a dominant-negative effect and alterations in steady-state voltage dependence of channel gating of heteromultimeric channels suggesting a reduction in expressional current might be one of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of LQTS.",M2
16822950,"Abnormal regulatory interactions of I148T-CFTR and the epithelial Na+ channel in Xenopus oocytes.The mechanisms underlying regulatory interactions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) in Xenopus oocytes are controversial. CFTR's first nucleotide binding domain (NBD-1) may be important in these interactions, because mutations within NBD-1 impair these functional interactions. We hypothesized that an abnormal CFTR containing a non-NBD-1 mutation and able to transport chloride would retain regulatory interactions with murine ENaC (mENaC). We tested this hypothesis for I148T-CFTR, where the mutation is located in CFTR's first intracellular loop. I148T-CFTR has been associated with a severe CF phenotype, perhaps because of defects in its regulation of bicarbonate transport, but it transports chloride similarly to wild-type CFTR in model systems (Choi JY, Muallem D, Kiselyov K, Lee MG, Thomas PJ, Muallem S. Nature 410: 94-97, 2001). <e>cRNAs</e> encoding alphabetagamma-mENaC and I148T-CFTR were injected separately or together into Xenopus oocytes. mENaC and CFTR functional expression were assessed by two-electrode voltage clamp. mENaC whole oocyte expression was determined by immunoblotting, and surface expression was quantitated by surface biotinylation. Injection of I148T-CFTR cRNA alone yielded high levels of CFTR functional expression. In coinjected oocytes, mENaC functional and surface expression was not altered by activation of I148T-CFTR with forskolin/ IBMX. Furthermore, the CFTR potentiator genistein both enhanced functional expression of I148T-CFTR and restored regulation of mENaC surface expression by activated I148T-CFTR. These data suggest that the ability to transport chloride is not a critical determinant of regulation of mENaC by activated CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and provide further evidence that I148T-CFTR is dysfunctional despite maintaining the ability to transport chloride.",M2
16797525,"Expression of aquaporin-3 improves the permeability to water and cryoprotectants of immature oocytes in the medaka (Oryzias latipes).The permeability of the plasma membrane plays a crucial role in the successful cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos. Several efforts have been made to facilitate the movement of water and cryoprotectants across the plasma membrane of fish oocytes/embryos because of their large size. Aquaporin-3 is a water/solute channel that can also transport various cryoprotectants. In this study, we tried to improve the permeability of immature medaka (Oryzias latipes) oocytes to water and cryoprotectants by artificially expressing aquaporin-3. The oocytes were injected with aquaporin-3 <e>cRNA</e> and cultured for 6-7 h. Then, hydraulic conductivity (L(P)) and cryoprotectant permeability (P(S)) were determined from volume changes in a hypertonic sucrose solution and various cryoprotectant solutions, respectively, at 25 degrees C. The L(P) value of the cRNA-injected oocytes was 0.22+/-0.04 microm/min/atm, nearly twice larger than that of intact or water-injected oocytes (0.14+/-0.02 and 0.14+/-0.03 microm/min/atm, respectively). P(S) values of intact oocytes for ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and DMSO were 1.36+/-0.34, 1.97+/-0.20, and 1.17+/-0.52 x 10(-3) cm/min, respectively. The permeability to glycerol could not be calculated because oocytes remained shrunken in the glycerol solution. On the other hand, cRNA-injected oocytes had significantly higher P(S) values (glycerol, 2.20+/-1.29; ethylene glycol, 2.98+/-0.36; propylene glycol, 3.93+/-1.70; DMSO, 3.11+/-0.74 x 10(-3) cm/min) than intact oocytes. When cRNA-injected oocytes were cultured for 12-14 h, 51% matured to the metaphase II stage, and 43% of the matured oocytes were fertilized and hatched following in vitro fertilization and 14 days of culture. Thus, the permeability of medaka oocytes to water and cryoprotectants was improved by the artificial expression of aquaporin-3, and the oocytes retained the ability to develop to term.",M2
16780192,"In situ hybridization using <e>cRNA</e> probes: isotopic and nonisotopic detection methods.In this chapter we describe the use of cRNA (riboprobes) in the detection of gene expression in tissue sections. Riboprobes offer good sensitivity and allow the detection of low-level mRNA expression. In some cases, the use of radiolabeling is justified because this method is still sensitive. However, recent advances in nonisotopic detection methods mean that in some cases digoxigenin (DIG) or biotin labeling also may be sufficiently sensitive to detect mRNA expression in tissues of interest. The use of alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG antibodies improves the sensitivity of DIG detection over peroxidase systems, and the use of amplification systems based on biotinyl tyramide has improved the sensitivity of biotin labelled probe detection. Finally, it can be shown that low-level mRNA expression is easier to detect in frozen sections than in paraffin-embedded material, with a consequent loss in quality of morphology.",M2
16762351,"Identification of eel ghrelin in plasma and stomach by radioimmunoassay and histochemistry.The structure of ghrelin has been determined in the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica. In this study, we identified immunoreactive ghrelin in extracts from plasma and stomach of the eel by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using an antiserum against octanoylated rat ghrelin [1-11]. Using the antiserum, we examined localization of ghrelin-immunopositive cells in the eel stomach. Detection of ghrelin mRNA-expressing cells was also attempted in the eel stomach using a <e>cRNA</e> probe specific for the eel ghrelin gene. Furthermore, we examined ghrelin expression patterns in plasma and stomach after transfer of freshwater (FW) eels to seawater (SW). Multiple types of immunoreactive ghrelin were detected using RIA. These were octanoylated eel ghrelin and other ghrelins that may have different fatty acid modifications, suggesting that this RIA can detect acylated ghrelin of eels as seen previously in the case of rat. Ghrelin-immunopositive cells were observed in the mucosal layer of the stomach, especially in the neck of the fundic gland. Ghrelin mRNA-expressing cells showed similar distribution and characteristics to the immunopositive cells. Plasma ghrelin levels in FW eels starved for one week before experimentation were approximately 40 fmol/ml. Plasma ghrelin levels in control-transferred FW eels did not change for 7 days, but significantly increased on day 14. Plasma ghrelin levels transiently increased fivefold 6h after SW transfer and then declined to the FW level by 24h after transfer. Ghrelin content and ghrelin mRNA levels in the stomach did not change after SW transfer, except for a transient decrease in ghrelin content seen 24h after transfer. The present results suggest that ghrelin may participate in osmoregulation in eels.",M2
16687407,"Effect of human carbonic anhydrase II on the activity of the human electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporter NBCe1-A in Xenopus oocytes.Others report that carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) binds to the C termini of the anion exchanger AE1 and the electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporter NBCe1-A, enhancing transport. After injecting oocytes with NBCe1-A <e>cRNA</e> (Day 0), we measured NBC current (I(NBC)) by two-electrode voltage clamp (Day 3), injected CA II protein + Tris or just Tris (Day 3), measured I(NBC) or the initial rate at which the intracellular pH fell (dpH(i)/dt) upon applying 5% CO2 (Day 4), exposed oocytes to the permeant CA inhibitor ethoxzolamide (EZA), and measured I(NBC) or dpH(i)/dt (Day 4). Because dpH(i)/dt was greater in CA II than Tris oocytes, and EZA eliminated the difference, injected CA II was functional. I(NBC) slope conductance was unaffected by injecting CA II. Moreover, EZA had identical effects in CA II versus Tris oocytes. Thus, injected CA II does not enhance NBC activity. In a second protocol, we made a fusion protein with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the 5' end of NBCe1-A and CA II at the 3' end (EGFP-e1-CAII). We measured I(NBC) or dpH(i)/dt (days 3-4), exposed oocytes to EZA, and measured I(NBC) or dpH(i)/dt (Day 3-4). dpH(i)/dt was greater in oocytes expressing EGFP-e1-CA II versus EGFP-e1, and EZA eliminated the difference. Thus, fused CA II was functional. Slope conductances of EGFP-e1-CAII versus EGFP-e1 oocytes were indistinguishable, and EZA had no effect. Thus, even when fused to NBCe1-A, CA II does not enhance NBCe1-A activity.",M2
16648895,"Rapid, reliable and inexpensive quality assessment of biotinylated <e>cRNA</e>.The interpretation of oligonucleotide array experiments depends on the quality of the target cRNA used. cRNA target quality is assessed by quantitative analysis of the representation of 5' and 3' sequences of control genes using commercially available Test arrays. The Test array provides an economically priced means of determining the quality of labeled target prior to analysis on whole genome expression arrays. This manuscript validates the use of a duplex RT-PCR assay as a faster (6 h) and less expensive (&lt;10 US dollars) but equally accurate alternative to the Test arrays in determining biotinylated cRNA quality. Forty-one different cRNA samples were hybridized to HG-U133A microarrays from Affymetrix. Ten cRNA samples with a beta-actin 3'/5' ratio &gt;6 were chosen and classified as degraded cRNAs, and 31 samples with a beta-actin 3'/5' ratio &lt;6 were selected as good quality cRNAs. Blinded samples were then used for the RT-PCR assay. After gel electrophoresis, optical densities of the amplified 3' and 5' fragments of beta-actin were measured and the 3'/5' ratio was calculated. There was a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.6802) between the array and the RT-PCR beta-actin 3'/5' ratios. Moreover, the RT-PCR 3'/5' ratio was significantly different (P &lt; 0.0001) between undegraded (mean +/- SD, 0.34 +/- 0.09) and degraded (1.71 +/- 0.83) samples. None of the other parameters analyzed, such as i) the starting amount of RNA, ii) RNA quality assessed using the Bioanalyzer Chip technology, or iii) the concentration and OD260/OD280 ratio of the purified biotinylated cRNA, correlated with cRNA quality.",M2
16629162,"Gene chip analyses reveal differential genetic responses to iron deficiency in rat duodenum and jejunum.Previous studies revealed novel genetic changes in the duodenal mucosa of iron-deprived rats during postnatal development. These observations are now extended to compare the genetic response to iron deficiency in the duodenum versus jejunum of 12-wk-old rats. <e>cRNA</e> samples were prepared from the duodenal and jejunal mucosa of three groups each of control and iron-deficient rats and hybridized with RAE 230A and 230B gene chips (Affymetrix). Stringent data reduction strategies were employed. Results showed that several genes were similarly induced in both gut segments, including DMT1, Dcytb, transferrin receptor 1, heme oxygenase 1, metallothionein, the Menkes copper ATPase (ATP7A), tripartitie motif protein 27, and the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter. However, a subset of genes showed regulation in only one or the other gut segment. In duodenum only, gastrokine 1, trefoil factor 1 and claudin 2 were induced by iron-deficiency. Other genes previously identified were only regulated in the duodenum. Overall, these studies demonstrate similarities and distinct differences in the genetic response to iron deprivation in the duodenum versus jejunum and provide evidence that more distal gut segments also may play a role in increasing iron absorption in iron-deficiency anemia.",M2
16595783,"Gene expression profiling of primary cutaneous melanoma and clinical outcome.BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling data for human primary cutaneous melanomas are scarce because of the lack of retrospective collections of frozen tumors. To identify differentially expressed genes that may be involved in melanoma progression and prognosis, we investigated the relationship between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in a cohort of patients with primary melanoma. METHODS: Labeled complementary RNA (<e>cRNA</e>) from each tissue sample was hybridized to a pangenomic 44K 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray. Class comparison and class prediction analyses were performed to identify genes whose expression in primary melanomas was associated with 4-year distant metastasis-free survival among 58 patients with at least 4 years of follow-up, distant metastasis, or death. Results were validated immunohistochemically at the protein level in 176 independent primary melanomas from patients with a median clinical follow-up of 8.5 years. Survival was analyzed with a Cox multivariable model and stratified log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 254 genes that were associated with distant metastasis-free survival of patients with primary melanoma. These 254 genes include genes involved in activating DNA replication origins, such as minichromosome maintenance genes and geminin. Twenty-three of these genes were studied at the protein level; expression of five (MCM4, P = .002; MCM3, P = .030; MCM6, P = .004; KPNA2, P = .021; and geminin, P = .004) was statistically significantly associated with overall survival in the validation set. In a multivariable Cox model adjusted for tumor thickness, ulceration, age, and sex, expression of MCM4 (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 4.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 11.76; P = .010) and MCM6 (HR of death = 7.42, 95% CI = 1.99 to 27.64; P = .003) proteins was still statistically significantly associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: We identified 254 genes whose expression was associated with metastatic dissemination of cutaneous melanomas. These genes may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying poor prognosis in melanoma patients.",M2
16526406,"Comparison of in vitro and in vivo reference genes for internal standardization of real-time PCR data.Real-time PCR is a powerful technique for gene expression studies, which have become increasingly important in a large number of clinical and scientific fields. The significance of the obtained results strongly depends on the normalization of the data to compensate for differences between the samples. The most widely used approach is to use endogenous reference genes (housekeeping genes) as internal standards. This approach is controversially discussed in the literature because none of the reference genes is stably expressed throughout all biological samples. Therefore, candidate reference genes have to be validated for each experimental condition. In our studies, we introduced and evaluated an in vitro synthesized reference <e>cRNA</e> for internal standardization of relative messenger RNA (mRNA) expression patterns. This reference, consisting of the in vitro transcribed coding sequence of aequorin, a jellyfish protein, was incorporated in the extracted RNA. The experimental significance of this approach was representatively tested for the expression of the neurotrophin-3 mRNA in distinct regions of mouse brains. A comparison to three stably expressed reference genes [beta-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (HPRT1)] gave evidence that the spiking of template RNA with in vitro transcribed cRNA is a valuable tool for internal standardization of real-time PCR experiments.",M2
16494876,"A GABA(A) receptor of defined subunit composition and positioning: concatenation of five subunits.We show that the five subunits of a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A) receptor) can be concatenated to yield a functional receptor.

Most of its functional properties are not significantly different from a receptor formed by individual subunits. Extent of expression amounted to about 40% of that of non-concatenated receptors in Xenopus oocytes, after injection of oocytes with comparable amounts of <e>cRNA</e> coding for concatenated and non-concatenated receptors. The ability to express receptors consisting of five subunits enables detailed studies of GABA(A) receptor subtype selective compounds.",M2
16474140,"Different de novo initiation strategies are used by influenza virus RNA polymerase on its <e>cRNA</e> and viral RNA promoters during viral RNA replication.Various mechanisms are used by single-stranded RNA viruses to initiate and control their replication via the synthesis of replicative intermediates. In general, the same virus-encoded polymerase is responsible for both genome and antigenome strand synthesis from two different, although related promoters. Here we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of initiation of replication by influenza virus RNA polymerase and establish whether initiation of cRNA and viral RNA (vRNA) differed. To do this, two in vitro replication assays, which generated transcripts that had 5' triphosphate end groups characteristic of authentic replication products, were developed. Surprisingly, mutagenesis screening suggested that the polymerase initiated pppApG synthesis internally on the model cRNA promoter, whereas it initiated pppApG synthesis terminally on the model vRNA promoter. The internally synthesized pppApG could subsequently be used as a primer to realign, by base pairing, to the terminal residues of both the model cRNA and vRNA promoters. In vivo evidence, based on the correction of a mutated or deleted residue 1 of a cRNA chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct, supported this internal initiation and realignment model. Thus, influenza virus RNA polymerase uses different initiation strategies on its cRNA and vRNA promoters. To our knowledge, this is novel and has not previously been described for any viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Such a mechanism may have evolved to maintain genome integrity and to control the level of replicative intermediates in infected cells.",M2
16465547,"Evidence that the rabbit proton-peptide co-transporter PepT1 is a multimer when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.To test whether the rabbit proton-coupled peptide transporter PepT1 is a multimer, we have employed a combination of transport assays, luminometry and site-directed mutagenesis. A functional epitope-tagged PepT1 construct (PepT1-FLAG) was co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with a non-functional but normally trafficked mutant form of the same transporter (W294F-PepT1). The amount of PepT1-FLAG <e>cRNA</e> injected into the oocytes was kept constant, while the amount of W294F-PepT1 cRNA was increased over the mole fraction range of 0 to 1. The uptake of [(3)H]-D: -Phe-L: -Gln into the oocytes was measured at pH(out) 5.5, and the surface expression of PepT1-FLAG was quantified by luminometry. As the mole fraction of injected W294F-PepT1 increased, the uptake of D: -Phe-L: -Gln decreased. This occurred despite the surface expression of PepT1-FLAG remaining constant, and so we can conclude that PepT1 must be a multimer. Assuming that PepT1 acts as a homomultimer, the best fit for the modelling suggests that PepT1 could be a tetramer, with a minimum requirement of two functional subunits in each protein complex. Western blotting also showed the presence of higher-order complexes of PepT1-FLAG in oocyte membranes. It should be noted that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that PepT1 interacts with unidentified Xenopus protein(s). The finding that PepT1 is a multimer has important implications for the molecular modelling of this protein.",M2
16423824,"Delta-subunit confers novel biophysical features to alpha beta gamma-human epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) via a physical interaction.Native amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels exhibit a variety of biophysical properties, including variable sensitivities to amiloride, different ion selectivities, and diverse unitary conductances. The molecular basis of these differences has not been elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that co-expression of delta-epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) underlies, at least in part, the multiplicity of amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductances in epithelial cells. For example, the delta-subunit may form multimeric channels with alpha beta gamma-ENaC. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that delta-ENaC is co-expressed with alpha beta gamma-subunits in cultured human lung (H441 and A549), pancreatic (CFPAC), and colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that delta-ENaC is co-expressed with alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC in H441 cells at the protein level. Measurement of current-voltage that cation selectivity ratios for the revealed relationships Na+/Li+/K+/Cs+/Ca2+/Mg2+, the apparent dissociation constant (Ki) for amiloride, and unitary conductances for delta alpha beta gamma-ENaC differed from those of both alpha beta gamma- and delta beta gamma-ENaC (n = 6). The contribution of the delta subunit to P(Li)/P(Na) ratio and unitary Na+ conductance under bi-ionic conditions depended on the injected <e>cRNA</e> concentration. In addition, the EC50 for proton activation, mean open and closed times, and the self-inhibition time of delta alpha beta gamma-ENaC differed from those of alpha beta gamma- and delta beta gamma-ENaC. Co-immunoprecipitation of delta-ENaC with alpha- and gamma-subunits in H441 and transfected COS-7 cells suggests an interaction among these proteins. We, therefore, concluded that the interactions of delta-ENaC with other subunits could account for heterogeneity of native epithelial channels.",M2
16380458,"Molecular characterization of the mercurial sensitivity of a frog urea transporter (fUT).The amphibian urea transporter (fUT) shares many properties with the mammalian urea transporters (UT) derived from UT-A and UT-B genes. The transport of urea by fUT is inhibited by the mercurial agent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (pCMBS). We found that in oocytes expressing <e>cRNA</e> encoding fUT, a 5-min preincubation in 0.5 mM mercury chloride (HgCl2) also significantly reduced urea uptake. The transport of urea by fUT was rendered mercury (Hg2+) insensitive by mutating either of the residues C185 or H187, both of which lie within the M-I region (close to the hypothetical UT pore). In oocytes expressing a mixture of the C185 and H187 mutants, Hg2+ sensitivity was reestablished. The transport of urea by the mouse UTs mUT-A2 and mUT-A3 was not sensitive to Hg2+. Introducing cysteine residues analogous to that mutated in fUT into mUT-A2 or mUT-A3 did not induce Hg2+ sensitivity. Additionally, introducing the double cysteine, histidine mutations into mUT-A2 or mUT-A3 still did not induce Hg2+ sensitivity, indicating that a region outside of the M-I region also contributes to the Hg2+-induced block of fUT. Using a series of chimeras formed between UT-A3 and fUT, we found that as well as C185 and H187, residues within the COOH terminal of fUT determine Hg2+ sensitivity, and we propose that differences in the folding of this region between fUT and mUT-A2/mUT-A3 allow access of Hg2+ to the fUT channel pore.",M2
16332514,"Anaesthetic sensitivity of fMLP-induced cell signalling in Xenopus oocytes.FMLP stimulation of Xenopus oocytes expressing fMLP receptors leads to a concentration-dependent biphasic inward current. To identify the evolution of these currents we have examined the effects of blocking various cell signalling pathways. In addition we have analysed the effects of three intravenous anaesthetics on these fMLP-induced currents. Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with <e>cRNA</e> encoding the fMLP receptor and fMLP-stimulated (100 nM) currents measured, using two-electrode voltage-clamp (-70 mV), before and after injection of heparin (120 ng ml-1), wortmannin (1 microM), U73122 (5 microM) or buffer. Concentration-response curves were established for the action on fMLP-stimulated currents of thiopentone (5-500 microM), methohexitone (0.2-200 microM) and propofol (0.5-500 microM). Heparin significantly enhanced the fast current (p&lt;0.05). Wortmannin had no effect on either current. U73122 inhibited only the slow current (p&lt;0.05). All anaesthetics inhibited both currents, with the maximum inhibition for the fast/slow currents 70%/100%, 60%/60% and 100%/100% for thiopentone (IC50 147/120 microM), methohexitone (IC50 4.7/2.2 microM) and propofol (IC50 33/8 microM), respectively. We suggest (a) the slow current arises via the PLC/PKC pathway because it is reduced by the PLC inhibitor U73122, (b) the PI3K- and PLD-mediated pathways are not involved because wortmannin had no effect and (c) activation of the two conductance channels must be different because U73122 reduced the slow but not the fast current. Since both currents are decreased by all three anaesthetics, their inhibition might be mediated through an action at the agonist/receptor, although, since the slow current is consistently more sensitive than the fast, there may be additionally an action on cell signalling.",M2
16272469,"Development of one-step, real-time, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays for absolute quantitation of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E.The clinical significance of human coronaviruses in more severe respiratory illnesses has recently been shown to be higher than was previously assumed. Rapid and reliable diagnosis of human coronavirus infections therefore becomes indispensable in a routine clinical setting. In this study, we present a very sensitive and specific TaqMan-based, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) for the rapid detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43 and 229E. Absolute viral load measurement in clinical samples was achieved through the construction of in-house HCoV OC43 and 229E <e>cRNA</e> standards for the generation of a standard curve. The HCoV OC43 assay allows quantitation over a range from 20 to 2 x 10(8) RNA copies per reaction mixture (5 microl RNA extract). When this is extrapolated to clinical samples, this corresponds to a detection range of 10(3) to 10(10) viral genome equivalents per ml. By using the HCoV 229E qRT-PCR assay, viral RNA copies ranging from 200 to 2 x 10(9) per reaction mixture can be detected, which corresponds to 10(4) to 10(11) viral genome equivalents per ml sample. A total of 100 respiratory samples screened for the presence of HCoVs OC43 and 229E by using conventional RT-PCR were assessed in parallel by the qRT-PCR assays. By use of the real-time qRT-PCR techniques, the detection rate of HCoVs OC43 and 229E increased from 2.0% to 3.1% and from 0.3% to 2.5%, respectively. The real-time qRT-PCR assays described here allow the rapid, specific, and sensitive laboratory detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E.",M2
16264403,"Widespread expression of liver receptor homolog 1 in mouse brain.OBJECTIVES: The distribution of Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) mRNA was studied in mice brain with the aim to establish whether this nuclear hormone receptor is expressed also in the brain in addition to liver and classical steroidogenic tissues. METHODS: Expression of LRH-1 mRNA in juvenile (30 days old) and adult (60 days old) mouse brain was examined using non-radioactive in situ hybridization with digoxigenin labeled <e>cRNA</e> probes and with RT PCR using specific primers. RESULTS: LRH-1 was strongly expressed throughout the brain. Semiquantitative RT PCR revealed very strong expression of LRH-1 mRNA in cerebrum in comparison to liver and testis, and in situ hybridization revealed that LRH-1 mRNA is uniformly expressed in most brain areas. CONCLUSIONS: LRH-1 is strongly expressed throughout the mouse brain suggesting important roles for this transcription factor, although its precise roles in the CNS remain to be elucidated.",M2
16140622,"Design of a microsphere-based high-throughput gene expression assay to determine estrogenic potential.Recently gene expression studies have been multiplied at an accelerated rate by the use of high-density microarrays. By assaying thousands of transcripts at a time, microarrays have led to the discovery of dozens of genes involved in particular biochemical processes, for example, the response of a tissue/organ to a given chemical with therapeutic or toxic properties. The next step in these studies is to focus on the response of a subset of relevant genes to verify or refine potential therapeutic or toxic properties. We have developed a sensitive, high-throughput gene expression assay for this purpose. In this assay, based on the Luminex xMAP system, carefully selected oligonucleotides were covalently linked to fluorescently coded microspheres that are hybridized to biotinylated <e>cRNA</e> followed by amplification of the signal, which results in a rapid, sensitive, multiplexed assay platform. Using this system, we have developed an RNA expression profiling assay specific for 17 estrogen-responsive transcripts and three controls. This assay can evaluate up to 100 distinct analytes simultaneously in a single sample, in a 96-well plate format. This system has improved sensitivity versus existing microsphere-based assays and has sensitivity and precision comparable with or better than microarray technology. We have achieved detection levels down to 1 amol, detecting rare messages in complex cRNA samples, using as little as 2.5 microg starting cRNA. This assay offers increased throughput with decreased costs compared with existing microarray technologies, with the trade-off being in the total number of transcripts that can be analyzed.",M2
16049313,"Precision profiling and components of variability analysis for Affymetrix microarray assays run in a clinical context.Although gene expression profiling using microarray technology is widely used in research environments, adoption of microarray testing in clinical laboratories is currently limited. In an attempt to determine how such assays would perform in a clinical laboratory, we evaluated the analytical variability of Affymetrix microarray probesets using two generations of human Affymetrix chips (U95Av2 and U133A). The study was designed to mimic potential clinical applications by using multiple operators, machines, and reagent lots, and by performing analyses throughout a period of several months. A mixed model analysis was used to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple factors to overall variability, including operator, instrument, run, <e>cRNA</e>/cDNA synthesis, and changes in reagent lots. Under these conditions, the average probeset coefficient of variation (CV) was relatively low for present probesets on both generations of chips (mean coefficient of variation, 21.9% and 27.2% for U95Av2 and U133A chips, respectively). The largest contribution to overall variation was chip-to-chip (residual) variability, which was responsible for between 40 to 60% of the total variability observed. Changes in individual reagent lots and instrumentation contributed very little to the overall variability. We conclude that the approach demonstrated here could be applied to clinical validation of Affymetrix-based assays and that the analytical precision of this technique is sufficient to answer many biological questions.",M2
16049153,"Phospholipase Czeta, the trigger of egg activation in mammals, is present in a non-mammalian species.The activation of the egg to begin development into an embryo is triggered by a sperm-induced increase in intracellular egg Ca2+. There has been much controversy about how the sperm induces this fundamental developmental event, but recent studies suggest that, in mammals, egg activation is triggered by a testis-specific phospholipase C: PLCzeta. Since the discovery of PLCzeta, it has been unclear whether its role in triggering egg activation is common to all vertebrates, or is confined to mammals. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that PLCzeta is present in a non-mammalian vertebrate. Using genomic and cDNA databases, we have identified the cDNA encoding a PLCzeta orthologue in the domestic chicken that, like the mammalian isoforms, is a testis-specific gene. The chicken PLCzeta cDNA is 2152 bp in size and encodes an open reading frame of 639 amino acids. When injected into mouse oocytes, chicken PLCzeta <e>cRNA</e> triggers Ca2+ oscillations, indicating that it has functional properties similar to those of mammalian PLCzeta. Our findings suggest that PLCzeta may have a universal role in triggering egg activation in vertebrates.",M2
16038869,"<e>cRNA</e> target preparation for microarrays: comparison of gene expression profiles generated with different amplification procedures.Microarray technology has become a standard tool for generation of gene expression profiles to explore human disease processes. Being able to start from minute amounts of RNA extends the fields of application to core needle biopsies, laser capture microdissected cells, and flow-sorted cells. Several RNA amplification methods have been developed, but no extensive comparability and concordance studies of gene expression profiles are available. Different amplification methods may produce differences in gene expression patterns. Therefore, we compared profiles processed by a standard microarray protocol with three different types of RNA amplification: (i) two rounds of linear target amplification, (ii) random amplification, and (iii) amplification based on a template switching mechanism. The latter two methods accomplish target amplification in a nonlinear way using PCR technology. Starting from as little as 50 ng of total RNA, the yield of labeled cRNA was sufficient for hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip array using the respective methods. Replicate experiments were highly reproducible for each method. In comparison with the standard protocol, all three approaches are less sensitive and introduced a minor but clearly detectable bias of the detection call. In conclusion, the three amplification protocols used are applicable for GeneChip analysis of small tissue samples.",M2

16000875,"Co-localization and interaction of organic anion transporter 1 with caveolin-2 in rat kidney.The organic anion transporters (OAT) have recently been identified. Although the some transport properties of OATs in the kidney have been verified, the regulatory mechanisms for OAT's functions are still not fully understood. The rat OAT1 (rOAT1) transports a number of negatively charged organic compounds between the cells and their extracellular milieu. Caveolin (Cav) also plays a role in membrane transport. Therefore, we investigated the protein-protein interactions between rOAT1 and caveolin-2. In the rat kidney, the expressions of rOAT1 mRNA and protein were observed in both the cortex and the outer medulla. With respect to Cav-2, the expressions of mRNA and protein were observed in all portions of the kidney (cortex &lt; outer medulla = inner medulla). The results of Western blot analysis using the isolated caveolae-enriched membrane fractions or the immunoprecipitates by respective antibodies from the rat kidney showed that rOAT1 and Cav-2 co-localized in the same fractions and they formed complexes each other. These results were confirmed by performing confocal microscopy with immunocytochemistry using the primary cultured renal proximal tubular cells. When the synthesized <e>cRNA</e> of rOAT1 along with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of Xenopus Cav-2 were co-injected into Xenopus oocytes, the [(14)C]p-aminohippurate and [(3)H]methotrexate uptake was slightly, but significantly decreased. The similar results were also observed in rOAT1 over-expressed Chinese hamster ovary cells. These findings suggest that rOAT1 and caveolin-2 are co-expressed in the plasma membrane and rOAT1's function for organic compound transport is upregulated by Cav-2 in the normal physiological condition.",M2
15847692,"Increased DNA microarray hybridization specificity using sscDNA targets.BACKGROUND: The most widely used amplification method for microarray analysis of gene expression uses T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription (IVT) to produce complementary RNA (<e>cRNA</e>) that can be hybridized to arrays. However, multiple rounds of amplification are required when assaying very small amounts of starting RNA. Moreover, certain cRNA-DNA mismatches are more stable than the analogous cDNA-DNA mismatches and this might increase non-specific hybridization. We sought to determine whether a recently developed linear isothermal amplification method (ribo-SPIA) that produces single stranded cDNA would offer advantages over traditional IVT-based methods for microarray-based analyses of transcript expression. RESULTS: A single round of ribo-SPIA amplification produced sufficient sscDNA for hybridizations when as little as 5 ng of starting total RNA was used. Comparisons of probe set signal intensities obtained from replicate amplifications showed consistently high correlations (r = 0.99). We compared gene expression in two different human RNA samples using ribo-SPIA. Compared with one round IVT, ribo-SPIA had a larger dynamic range and correlated better with quantitative PCR results even though we used 1000-fold less starting RNA. The improved dynamic range was associated with decreases in hybridization to mismatch control probes. CONCLUSION: The use of amplified sscDNA may offer substantial advantages over IVT-based amplification methods, especially when very limited amounts of starting RNA are available. The use of sscDNA targets instead of cRNA targets appears to improve hybridization specificity.",M2
15805883,"Gene expression profiling in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity shows abnormalities in several signaling pathways.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To examine gene expression profiles in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (oral SCC) compared with histologically matched normal tissue. STUDY DESIGN: Fresh-frozen tissue was prospectively obtained from individuals undergoing surgical resections for oral SCC. METHODS: RNA was extracted from seven sets of oral SCC and matched normal tissue. Gene expression profiles were obtained by interrogation of Affymetrix Gene Chip Arrays with <e>cRNA</e> prepared from the tissue. Expression values were subjected to a paired t test. Genes that were judged to differ between oral SCC and normal tissue were annotated according to their name in the Affymetrix Netaffx database and according to their function as indicated by their Gene Ontology Consortium number. RESULTS: Of the 10,599 probe sets that were analyzed, 523 genes were abnormally expressed in SCC of the head and neck (P &lt; or = .01), and 417 of these genes were abnormally expressed in all seven tumors in the same manner. Hierarchical clustering of the 121 genes that were abnormally expressed in cancerous relative to normal tissue (P &lt; or = .001) showed that the tissue segregated into two groups consisting of normal and transformed tissue, as expected. The abnormal expression of two genes that were up regulated in oral SCC (ADAM 12 and PTHLH) and two genes that were down-regulated in SCCHN (EMP-1 and P11) were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (ADAM 12) using additional sets of tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that oral SCC aberrantly express genes in cellular pathways related to proliferation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, adhesion, transforming growth factor-beta signaling, and transcription. Further work is needed to determine the role of these genes in the development and progression of oral SCC.",M2
15725949,"Differential blocking action of dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists on a T-type Ca2+ channel (alpha1G) expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Recent reports show that efonidipine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist, has blocking action on T-type Ca2+ channels, which may produce favorable actions on cardiovascular systems. However, the effects of other dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists on T-type Ca2+ channels have not been investigated yet. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of dihydropyridine compounds clinically used for treatment of hypertension on a T-type Ca2+ channel subtype, alpha1G, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These effects were compared with those on T-type Ca2+ channel. Rabbit L-type (alpha1Calpha2/deltabeta1a) or rat T-type (alpha1G) Ca2+ channel was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of <e>cRNA</e> for each subunit. The Ba currents through expressed channels were measured by conventional 2-microelectrode voltage-clamp methods. Twelve DHPs (amlodipine, barnidipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, efonidipine, felodipine, manidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nilvadipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine) and mibefradil were tested. Cilnidipine, felodipine, nifedipine, nilvadipine, minodipine, and nitrendipine had little effect on the T-type channel. The blocks by drugs at 10 microM were less than 10% at a holding potential of -100 mV. The remaining 6 drugs had blocking action on the T-type channel comparable to that on the L-type channel. The blocking actions were also comparable to that by mibefradil. These results show that many dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists have blocking action on the alpha1G channel subtype. The action of dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists in clinical treatment should be evaluated on the basis of subtype selectivity.",M2
15690487,"Neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor mRNA in rodent brain: distribution and colocalization with melanocortin-4 receptor.The central neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor (Y1-R) system has been implicated in feeding, endocrine, and autonomic regulation. In the present study, we systematically examined the brain distribution of Y1-R mRNA in rodents by using radioisotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with a novel sensitive <e>cRNA</e> probe. Within the rat hypothalamus, Y1-R-specific hybridization was observed in the anteroventral periventricular, ventromedial preoptic, suprachiasmatic, paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial, ventromedial, arcuate, and mamillary nuclei. In the rat, Y1-R mRNA expression was also seen in the subfornical organ, anterior hypothalamic area, dorsal hypothalamic area, and in the lateral hypothalamic area. In addition, Y1-R hybridization was evident in several extrahypothalamic forebrain and hindbrain sites involved in feeding and/or autonomic regulation in the rat. A similar distribution pattern of Y1-R mRNA was observed in the mouse brain. Moreover, by using a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) promoter, we observed Y1-R mRNA expression in MC4-R-positive cells in several brain sites such as the PVH and central nucleus of the amygdala. Additionally, dual-label ISHH demonstrated that hypophysiotropic PVH cells coexpress Y1-R and pro-thyrotropin-releasing hormone mRNAs in the rat. These observations are consistent with the proposed roles of the central NPY/Y1-R system in energy homeostasis.",M2
15669712,"Preparation of label from small cell numbers for microarray screening.Common methods for amplification of labelled <e>cRNA</e> for hybridisation to Affymetrix GeneChips (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) assume that starting material is not limiting and require 2-5 microg of total RNA. However, often the target population of cells under study is a rare subset like stem cells or dendritic cells. To bypass this difficulty in the past, either the whole tissue or a representative cell line was used to obtain enough cells for experimentation. There are obvious limitations with these approaches. In the case of whole tissue, there are contaminating cells types, and cell lines may not exactly reflect cells in vivo. It has been reported that two cycles of amplification can generate enough labelled cRNA for hybridisation from as little as 2 ng of total RNA. This allows Affymetrix technology to be used to screen the gene expression of cells in low number, rare cell subsets or small patient biopsies. Adoption of this approach can be used to give an accurate profile of genes expressed in the specific cell subset of interest. Published methods and successful variations applied to these are discussed here.",M2
15668517,"Gene expression levels in small specimens from patients detected using oligonucleotide arrays.Large-scale gene expression profiling using microarray technology is often limited by the amount of tissue or cells available. A number of RNA amplification protocols have been published to overcome this problem. However, additional amplification steps can result in both a 3' bias and poor reproducibility for low abundance transcripts. We performed microarray experiments using HG-U133A GeneChip arrays to ascertain whether less than the recommended amount of RNA can be used, thus avoiding additional amplification steps. In a titration experiment, 2-10 microg of total RNA from a single cryopreserved patient specimen was used to prepare biotinylated <e>cRNA</e>, and the recommended standard amount of 15 microg of each preparation was used for hybridization. Statistical analysis using box plots, correlation coefficients, MvA plots, and concordance percentages revealed almost identical levels of gene expression, independent of the amount of RNA used for target preparation. Most importantly, there was no statistically significant difference when the concordance percentages for low abundance genes were compared, demonstrating that as little as 2 microg of total RNA is sufficient to perform GeneChip analysis.",M2
15648446,"From transcription profile to expression: the signaling repertoire of the SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell-line.SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells are routinely cultured and widely used as a model system in biochemical and pharmacological experiments. To clarify the gene expression patterns of SK-N-MC cells with respect to G protein-coupled receptors and signaling network components, we describe in this report the transcription profile of the cell line. Following the traditional pathway from genome to proteome, selected examples are further examined at the level of protein expression and by functional assays. <e>cRNA</e> targets derived from total RNA extracts were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChip arrays, and the data were analyzed and grouped according to functional aspects. Results obtained for neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1, Y5, and orexin Ox1 receptors were confirmed by RT-PCR. It is surprising that we found the presence of both NPY receptor subtypes and the absence of the orexin receptor at the mRNA level. Receptor-binding experiments confirmed NPY binding of the Y1 receptor in the nanomolar range but gave no evidence for high expression levels of Y5 receptor subtypes on the cell surface. Protein expression was assayed with immunoblots by using antibodies directed against selected Galpha protein subunits. The presence of at least Galphas, Galphai3, and Galphai2 subunits was indicated.",M2
15632173,"Identification and characterization of a polyamine permease from the protozoan parasite Leishmania major.The proteins that mediate polyamine translocation into eukaryotic cells have not been identified at the molecular level. To define the polyamine transport pathways in eukaryotic cells we have cloned a gene, LmPOT1, that encodes a polyamine transporter from the protozoan pathogen, Leishmania major. Sequence analysis of LmPOT1 predicted an unusual 803-residue polytopic protein with 9-12 transmembrane domains. Expression of LmPOT1 <e>cRNA</e> in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed LmPOT1 to be a high affinity transporter for both putrescine and spermidine, whereas expression of LmPOT1 in Trypanosoma brucei stimulated putrescine uptake that was sensitive to inhibition by pentamidine and proton ionophores. Immunoblot analysis established that LmPOT1 was expressed predominantly in the insect vector form of L. major, and immunofluorescence demonstrated that LmPOT1 was localized predominantly to the parasite plasma membrane. To our knowledge this is the first molecular identification and characterization of a cell surface polyamine transporter in eukaryotic cells.",M2
15555575,"Application of amplified RNA and evaluation of <e>cRNA</e> targets for spotted-oligonucleotide microarray.Among different RNA amplification methods, T7 RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription (IVT) that generates antisense RNA is most common in DNA microarray protocol. However, despite the fact that cRNA targets labeled during IVT are feasible for spotted-oligonucleotide microarray (spotted-oligoarray) hybridization due to complementary sequence of single-stranded oligonucleotide probe, no systemic assessment for the use of amplified cRNA targets has been reported for spotted-oligoarrays. In this investigation, we have compared the hybridization performance of amplified cRNA targets with that of cDNA targets from total RNA(T-RNA) using spotted-oligoarrays containing 18,864 genetic elements. Under the optimized hybridization conditions, we found that 86% of oligonucleotide probes were reproducibly detected by both cDNA and cRNA target protocols. In addition, cRNA targets generated by two-rounds of amplification of 10 ng T-RNA were concordant with first-round cRNA targets generated from 100 ng T-RNA by 0.858 of correlation coefficient. Taken together, we demonstrated that cRNA targets from very scant RNA amount could successfully be applied on spotted-oligoarrays, and hopefully this will facilitate the application of much smaller amount of source material based on the high-fidelity and improved target preparation of microarrays.",M2
15475249,"An mRNA amplification procedure with directional cDNA cloning and strand-specific <e>cRNA</e> synthesis for comprehensive gene expression analysis.We developed an integrated system suitable for comprehensive gene expression studies including construction and analysis of cDNA microarrays starting from a small amount of mRNA. We amplified total mRNA first as cDNA mixtures by polymerase chain reaction and then as strand-specific cRNA mixtures by in vitro transcription. These amplified cDNA and cRNA enabled determination of mRNA levels by hybridization analyses such as Southern, Northern, reverse-Northern macroarray, and cDNA microarray analyses, as well as construction of the cDNA library with a unidirectional cDNA insert. By using strand-specific cRNA derived from rat primary-cultured hepatocytes, we detected putative antisense transcripts for the metallothionein gene. cDNA microarray analysis for genes regulated by glucocorticoids and glucagon in the hepatocytes revealed that a number of genes involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation were up- or down-regulated. The present system is widely applicable to gene expression analysis with limited amounts of RNA samples.",M2
15467974,"Differential effects of long-term treatment with clozapine or haloperidol on GABA transporter expression.BACKGROUND: Post-mortem studies with brain samples of schizophrenic patients led revealed altered GABA-ergic markers like reduced expression of the GABA transporter GAT-1. Whether this effect is due to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or to antipsychotic treatment has not been investigated. We therefore established an animal trial of long-term antipsychotic treatment to address this question. METHODS: A total of 33 adult male rats were investigated in three cohorts of 11 animals. One group received clozapine (45 mg/kg/ day), another group haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg/day), and the third one pH-adapted water over a period of 6 months. In situ hybridization with <e>cRNA</e> probes specific for GABA transporters VGAT, GAT-1 and GAT-3 were performed in comparison to control animals. RESULTS: While GAT-1 was upregulated, VGAT expression declined in cortical and limbic brain regions, whereby haloperidol showed a greater effect than clozapine. GAT-3 expression was suppressed in parietal and temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: We thus conclude that long-term antipsychotic treatment alters GABA transporter expression in rat. The upregulation of GAT-1 contrasts with the post-mortem finding of reduced GAT-1 expression in schizophrenic patients. Our results facilitate the distinction between disease dependent changes of GABAergic markers and medication effects.",M2
15364885,"Evaluation of quality-control criteria for microarray gene expression analysis.BACKGROUND: Development of quality-control criteria to ensure reproducibility of microarray results for potential clinical application is still in its infancy. METHODS: In the present studies we developed quality-control criteria and evaluated their effect in microarray data analysis using total RNA from cell lines, frozen tumors, and a commercially available reference RNA. Quality-control criteria such as A(260)/A(280) ratios, percentage of rRNA, and median size of cDNA and <e>cRNA</e> synthesis products were evaluated for robustness in microarray analysis. Furthermore, precision studies using a reference material were performed on the Affymetrix HG-U133A high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The same reference RNA sample was examined in 16 different chips run on 2 different days in the four different modules of the Affymetrix fluidics workstation. Fresh and frozen fragmented cRNAs were also compared. An ANOVA model was fit to identify the main sources of variation. RESULTS: Good-quality samples showed &gt;30% rRNA in the electropherograms and cDNA and cRNA synthesis products with median sizes of 2.0 and 3.0 kb, respectively. Precision studies showed that the main source of variation was the day-to-day variability, minimally affecting hybridization exogenous control genes. Altogether, the results showed that the Affymetrix Genechip system is highly reproducible when RNA that meet the quality-control criteria are used (overall P &gt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the need to establish defined quality-control criteria for sample quality to distinguish between analytical and biological variability.",M2

Expression analysis showed that Cx48.5 is expressed in the adult and embryonic lens and heart, adult testis, and transiently in the embryonic otic vesicles. Injection of Cx48.5 <e>cRNA</e> into Xenopus oocytes elicited intercellular electrical coupling with voltage sensitivity similar to mammalian Cx46. In single oocytes, Cx48.5 also induced large outward currents on depolarization, consistent with gap-junctional hemichannels.

The morpholino-treated embryos also developed small lenses and eyes as well as severe cardiovascular abnormalities.",M2
15163719,"Mutational analysis of the influenza virus <e>cRNA</e> promoter and identification of nucleotides critical for replication.Replication of the influenza A virus virion RNA (vRNA) requires the synthesis of full-length cRNA, which in turn is used as a template for the synthesis of more vRNA. A  corkscrew  secondary-structure model of the cRNA promoter has been proposed recently. However the data in support of that model were indirect, since they were derived from measurement, by use of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter in 293T cells, of mRNA levels from a modified cRNA promoter rather than the authentic cRNA promoter found in influenza A viruses. Here we measured steady-state cRNA and vRNA levels from a CAT reporter in 293T cells, directly measuring the replication of the authentic influenza A virus wild-type cRNA promoter. We found that (i) base pairing between the 5' and 3' ends and (ii) base pairing in the stems of both the 5' and 3' hairpin loops of the cRNA promoter were required for in vivo replication. Moreover, nucleotides in the tetraloop at positions 4, 5, and 7 and nucleotides forming the 2-9 base pair of the 3' hairpin loop were crucial for promoter activity in vivo. However, the 3' hairpin loop was not required for polymerase binding in vitro. Overall, our results suggest that the corkscrew secondary-structure model is required for authentic cRNA promoter activity in vivo, although the precise role of the 3' hairpin loop remains unknown.",M2
15161959,"Coupled amplification and degradation of exogenous RNA injected in amphibian oocytes.The early development of amphibians takes place in the absence of significant transcription and is controlled at the post-transcriptional level. We have reported that in vitro synthesized transcripts injected into axolotl fertilized eggs or oocytes were not continuously degraded as their abundance apparently fluctuated over time, with detected amounts sometimes higher than initial injected amounts. To further characterize this phenomenon, we have co-injected RNA chain terminators to prevent RNA synthesis. This led to the suppression of fluctuations and to a regular decrease in the amount of transcripts that appeared to be more stable in the presence of inhibitors. These observations indicate a coupling between RNA synthesis and an accelerated degradation. Throughout the time course, <e>cRNA</e> molecules could be detected, and their abundance increased in the early phase of the kinetics, supporting the implication of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in an asymmetric amplification process. Finally, when the fate of the injected transcripts was investigated in individual oocytes, we observed an absolute increase in abundance in some but not all oocytes, supporting the existence of a limiting step in the initiation of the RNA amplification stochastic process.",M2
15158131,"Establishment of a real-time RT-PCR for the determination of absolute amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression in liver and extrahepatic sites of the tilapia.We developed a one-tube two-temperature real-time RT-PCR that allows to absolutely quantify the gene expression of hormones using the standard curve method. As our research focuses on the expression of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in bony fish, we established the technique for IGF-I and IGF-II using the tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. As approach, we used primer extension adding a T7 phage polymerase promoter (21 nt) to the 5' end of the antisense primers. This procedure avoids the disadvantages arising from plasmids. Total RNA extracted from liver was subjected to conventional RT-PCR to create templates for in vitro transcription of IGF-I and IGF-II <e>cRNA</e>. Correct template sizes including the T7 promoter were verified (IGF-I: 91 nt; IGF-II: 94 nt). The PCR products were used to create IGF-I and IGF-II cRNAs which were quantified in dot blot by comparison with defined amounts of standardised kanamycin mRNA. Standardised threshold cycle (Ct) values for IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were achieved by real-time RT-PCR and used to create standard curves. To allow sample normalisation the standard curve was also established for beta-actin as internal calibrator (template: 86 nt), and validation experiments were performed demonstrating similar amplification efficiencies for target and reference genes. Based on the standard curves, the absolute amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were determined for liver (IGF-I: 8.90+/-1.90 pg/microg total RNA, IGF-II: 3.59+/-0.98 pg/microg total RNA) and extrahepatic sites, such as heart, kidney, intestine, spleen, gills, gonad, and brain considering the different lengths of cRNAs and mRNAs by correction factors. The reliability of the method was confirmed in additional experiments. The amplification of descending dilutions of cRNA and total liver RNA resulted in parallel slopes of the amplification curves. Furthermore, amplification plots of the standard cRNA and the IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs showed signals starting at the expected Ct values. Thus, the one-tube RT-PCR described here is highly sensitive (detection level approximately 2 pg/microg total RNA) and allows precise absolute quantification. The method is rapid as there are neither separate reverse transcriptions nor post-amplification steps, and can be executed with low risk of contamination. Therefore, it will be helpful when investigating gene expression in any species and tissue whenever absolute levels are of concern.",M2
15114374,"Application of microarrays to the analysis of the inactivation status of human X-linked genes expressed in lymphocytes.Dosage compensation in mammalian females is achieved by the random inactivation of one X chromosome early in development; however, inactivation is not complete. In addition to a majority of pseudoautosomal loci, there are genes that are expressed from both the active and the inactive X chromosomes, and which are interspersed among other genes subject to regular dosage compensation. The patterns of X-linked gene expression in different tissues are of great significance for interpreting their impact on sex differences in development. We have examined the suitability and sensitivity of a microarray approach for determining the inactivation status of X-linked genes. Biotinylated <e>cRNA</e> from six female and six male lymphocyte samples were hybridised to Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. A total of 36 X-linked targets detected significantly higher levels of female transcripts, suggesting that these corresponded to sequences from loci that escaped, at least partly, from inactivation. These included genes for which previous experimental evidence, or circumstantial evidence, existed for their escape, and some novel candidates. Six of the targets were represented by more than one probe set, which gave independent support for the conclusions reached.",M2
15111600,"Retinal colocalization and in vitro interaction of the glutamate transporter EAAT3 and the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 [correction].PURPOSE: The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 regulates several epithelial channels and transporters, the related protein kinase B (PKB) regulates glucose transport. SGK1 is expressed in the brain and could thus regulate glial and/or neuronal transport processes. The present study explores whether SGK1 is expressed in the retina and whether it regulates EAAT3, a Na(+)-coupled glutamate transporter. EAAT3 is expressed in retinal ganglion cells and accomplishes the clearance of glutamate from synaptic clefts. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to test for retinal SGK1 expression. For functional analysis, <e>cRNA</e> encoding EAAT3 was injected into Xenopus oocytes with or without additional injection of wild-type SGK1, constitutively active (S422D)SGK1, inactive (K127N)SGK1, and/or constitutively active (T308D,S473D)PKB. Glutamate induced current (I(GLU)) was taken as a measure for transport. RESULTS: SGK1 is indeed expressed in several retinal cells including retinal ganglion cells where it is colocalized with EAAT3. In EAAT3-expressing Xenopus oocytes, glutamate-induced current was stimulated by coexpression of wild-type SGK1, constitutively active (S422D)SGK1, and constitutively active (T308D,S473D)PKB, but not by inactive (K127N)SGK1. CONCLUSIONS: SGK1 and EAAT3 are coexpressed in retinal neurons, and SGK1 serves to stimulate EAAT3. This function is shared by protein kinase B (PKB). The experiments reveal a novel mechanism regulating EAAT3, which may be essential for the function of the retinal ganglion cells.",M2
15061247,"Differential effects of long-term treatment with clozapine or haloperidol on GABAA receptor binding and GAD67 expression.One of the most consistent findings in postmortem studies of schizophrenia is increased GABAA receptor binding and reduced glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) expression. Due to long-term antipsychotic treatment before death, these findings may reflect not only the consequences of schizophrenia but also medication effects. To differentiate between these options, we used an animal model and evaluated long-term effects of typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine) antipsychotic drugs on the GABAergic system. A total of 33 adult male rats were treated in three cohorts over a period of 6 months. One cohort of 11 animals received clozapine (45 mg/kg/day), another one received haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg/day) and a third one received pH-adapted minimal concentrations of HCl in the drinking water. Receptor autoradiography of the GABAA receptor ([3H]-muscimol binding) and in situ hybridization in adjacent sections with 35S-labeled <e>cRNA</e> probes of the y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing enzyme, GAD67, was performed. While haloperidol increased GABAA receptor binding in striatum and nucleus accumbens (NA), it suppressed GABAA receptor binding in temporal (TEMPC) and parietal (PARC) cortex. Clozapine induced GABAA receptor binding in infralimbic cortex (ILC) and similar like haloperidol in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two regions of the limbic cortex. In addition, either drug increased gene expression of GAD67. It is concluded that antipsychotic drugs differentially alter the GABAergic system, strongly suggesting that drug effects are partially responsible for the up-regulation of GABAA receptor binding in certain brain regions as observed in postmortem brains of schizophrenic patients. However, the reduced GAD67 expression seen in postmortem brains does not appear to reflect drug effects, since our animal model demonstrated increased gene expression.",M2
15055527,"Differential effect of ginsenoside metabolites on the 5-HT3A receptor-mediated ion current in Xenopus oocytes.Ginsenosides are major active ingredients of Panax ginseng. They have a number of pharmacological and physiological actions and are transformed into compound K (CK) or M4 by intestinal microorganisms. CK is derived from protopanaxadiol (PD) ginsenosides, whereas M4 is derived from protopanaxatriol (PT) ginsenosides. Recent reports show that ginsenosides act as pro-drugs for these metabolites. In previous work we demonstrated that the ginsenoside Rg2 regulates human 5-hydroxytryptamine3A (5-HT3A) receptor channel activity [Choi et al. (2003)]. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CK and M4 on the activity of the human 5-HT3A receptor channel. The 5-HT3A receptor was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the current was measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Treatment with CK or M4 had no effect on oocytes injected with 5-HT3A receptor <e>cRNA</e>. However pretreatment with M4 or CK followed by injection of 5-HT3A receptor cRNA led to reversible inhibition of the 5-HT-induced inward peak current (I(5-HT)). Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CK and M4 were 36.9 +/- 9.6 and 7.3 +/- 2.2 microM, respectively. Inhibition by M4 was non-competitive and voltage-independent. These results indicate that M4, a metabolite of PT ginsenosides, acts primarily on 5-HT3A receptors and further, that ginsenosides as well as ginsenoside metabolites can influence 5-HT3A receptor channel activity in Xenopus oocytes.",M2

15016803,"Folding of active calcium channel beta(1b) -subunit by size-exclusion chromatography and its role on channel function.Voltage-gated calcium channels mediate the influx of Ca(2+) ions into eukaryotic cells in response to membrane depolarization. They are hetero-multimer membrane proteins formed by at least three subunits, the poreforming alpha(1)-subunit and the auxiliary beta- and alpha(2)delta-subunits. The beta-subunit is essential for channel performance because it regulates two distinct features of voltage-gated calcium channels, the surface expression and the channel activity. Four beta-subunit genes have been cloned, beta(1-4), with molecular masses ranging from 52 to 78 kDa, and several splice variants have been identified. The beta(1b)-subunit, expressed at high levels in mammalian brain, has been used extensively to study the interaction between the pore forming alpha(1)- and the regulatory beta-subunit. However, structural characterization has been impaired for its tendency to form aggregates when expressed in bacteria. We applied an on-column refolding procedure based on size exclusion chromatography to fold the beta(1b)-subunit of the voltage gated-calcium channels from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The beta(1b)-subunit refolds into monomers, as shown by sucrose gradient analysis, and binds to a glutathione S-transferase protein fused to the known target in the alpha(1)-subunit (the alpha-interaction domain). Using the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp technique, we measured gating and ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing cardiac alpha(1)-subunit (alpha(1C)) co-injected with folded-beta(1b)-protein or beta(1b)-<e>cRNA</e>. We demonstrate that the co-expression of the alpha(1C)-subunit with either folded-beta(1b)-protein or beta(1b)-cRNA increases ionic currents to a similar extent and with no changes in charge movement, indicating that the beta(1b)-subunit primarily modulates channel activity, rather than expression.",M2
14967898,"Use of DNA array to screen blastocyst genes potentially involved in the process of murine implantation.Conceptus implantation to the mother's uterus is a complex series of events involving coordinated expression of numerous genes at both the embryonic and the uterine sides. Since there are no suitable in vivo or in vitro experimental models, sequential changes occurring during the peri-implantation periods have not been well characterized. Using GeneChip technology and a recently introduced murine in vitro model of implantation, the expression of embryonic genes was examined before and after attachment to the uterine stromal cells. Instead of RNA or mRNA, amplified <e>cRNA</e> was subjected to the GeneChip analysis because amounts of mRNA in each blastocyst were minimal. Among 6,500 gene transcripts examined, changes in mRNA levels for 802 genes were identified. Of these detections, transcripts previously unsuspected were changes in a group of tumor suppressor and stress-induced genes, whose transcripts increased as embryos attached to the membrane. Validity of the data was evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization analyses, both of which confirmed developmental changes in selected gene expressions during pre- and post-attachment periods. The present data suggest that GeneChip technology would be very useful for finding genes previously unsuspected, and this method should be used as an initial step, particularly as a screening tool, toward the dissection of complex mechanisms such as the processes of implantation.",M2
14962677,"Evaluation of procedures for amplification of small-size samples for hybridization on microarrays.Various approaches have been developed for the preparation of samples for gene expression monitoring. For Affymetrix chips, a standard protocol is widely used; however, this is inefficient for small samples such as laser capture microdissections. Several amplification procedures for such samples already exist, and our goal was to test two of them: the first is based on random PCR amplification, and the second, linear amplification, involves performing the standard protocol twice. We analyzed a dilution of a commercially available mouse brain total RNA preparation and microdissections from mouse hippocampus and striatum. We evaluated the quality of microarray data by analyzing several chip parameters and performing multiple comparisons. At the biological level, brain microdissections prepared with either method gave similar expression results. At the technical level, analysis of the commercial sample showed that random PCR amplification is more reproducible, requires smaller RNA input, and generates <e>cRNA</e> of higher quality than linear amplification.",M2
14704128,"Effects of acetazolamide and anordiol on osmotic water permeability in AQP1-<e>cRNA</e> injected Xenopus oocyte.AIM: To study the effects of acetazolamide and anordiol on osmotic water permeability in aquaporin 1 (AQP1)-cRNA injected Xenopus oocyte and their mechanisms. METHODS: AQP1 gene constructed in pBluescript was transcripted into cRNA in vitro and then the cRNA was injected in Xenopus oocytes. The effects of acetazolamide and anordiol on the water transport function of AQP1 were observed by assaying the osmotic swelling of oocytes. In addition, their effects on protein expression of AQP1 were quantitatively investigated by Western blotting method. RESULTS: After incubation for 15 min or 72 h, acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, equally reduced the water permeability of AQP1-cRNA injected oocyte in a dose-dependent manner. After incubation for 72 h, anordiol, an antiestrogen with partial estrogenic activity, reduced the osmotic water permeability dose dependently as well; however, no discernable action was observed after incubation with anordiol for 15 min. The Western blotting analysis showed that acetazolamide did not influence the protein expression of AQP1. However, after incubation for 72 h with anordiol (10 micromol/L), the quantity of AQP1 in the oocyte membrane was decreased dramatically (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Both acetazolamide and anordiol inhibited the osmotic water permeability of AQP1-cRNA injected oocyte, but their mechanisms were different. Acetazolamide functionally inhibited the osmotic water permeability of AQP1, whereas anordiol primarily decreased the amount of AQP1 protein in the oocyte membrane.",M2
14699097,"Prevention of ginsenoside-induced desensitization of Ca2+-activated Cl- current by microinjection of inositol hexakisphosphate in Xenopus laevis oocytes: involvement of GRK2 and beta-arrestin I.We demonstrated that ginsenosides, the active ingredient of Panax ginseng, enhance endogenous Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents via Galpha(q/11)-phospholipase C-beta3 pathway in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Moreover, prolonged treatment of ginsenosides induced Cl(-) channel desensitization. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ginsenoside-induced Cl(-) channel desensitization have not yet been determined precisely. To provide answers to these questions, we investigated the changes in ginsenoside-induced Cl(-) channel desensitization after intraoocyte injection of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), which is known to bind beta-arrestins and interfere with beta-arrestin-induced receptor down-regulation, and <e>cRNAs</e> coding beta-arrestin I/II and G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which is known to phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors and attenuate agonist stimulations. When control oocytes were stimulated with ginsenosides, the second, third, and fourth responses to ginsenosides were 69.6 +/- 4.1, 9.2 +/- 2.3, and 2.6 +/- 2.2% of the first responses, respectively. Preintraoocyte injection of InsP(6) before ginsenoside treatment restored ginsenoside effect to initial response levels in a concentration-, time-, and structurally specific manner, in that inositol hexasulfate had no effect. The EC(50) was 13.9 +/- 8.7 microM. Injection of cRNA coding beta-arrestin I but not beta-arrestin II blocked InsP(6) effect on prevention of ginsenoside-induced Cl(-) channel desensitization. Injection of cRNA coding GRK2 abolished ginsenoside effect enhancing Cl(-) current. However, the GRK2-caused loss of ginsenoside effect on Cl(-) current was prevented by coinjection of GRK2 with GRK2-K220R, a dominant-negative mutant of GRK. These results indicate that ginsenoside-induced Cl(-) channel desensitization is mediated via activation of GRK2 and beta-arrestin I.",M2
14694902,"Fxyd3 and Lgi4 expression in the adult mouse: a case of endogenous antisense expression.We have investigated the expression of Fxyd3 and Lgi4 in the adult mouse by Northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization. Murine Fxyd3 and Lgi4 have been mapped to the same locus on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 7, where the last exon of Fxyd3 completely overlaps with the 3'UTR in the last exon of Lgi4, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. The Fxyd3 gene (formerly called Mat-8) encodes an 8-kDa transmembrane protein that is upregulated in mammary tumors and can induce a chloride conductance upon RNA injection into Xenopus oocytes. Fxyd3 is a member of the Fxyd family of which several members are tissue-specific regulators of ion channels. Murine Lgi4 is a recently described member of the leucine-rich-repeat gene family Lgi. Northern blot analyses demonstrated a 0.6-kb Fxyd3 transcript with abundant expression in the murine skin, colon, and mammary gland, but low level expression in the brain. In contrast, a 3.2-kb Lgi4 transcript was abundant in brain, with lower level expression in colon. Lgi4 transcription in the skin was detectable only by RT-PCR. A Fxyd3-specific sense <e>cRNA</e> probe hybridized to a transcript in Northern blots of brain and colon RNA that co-migrated with the Lgi4 mRNA. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that both Fxyd3 and Lgi4 were expressed in the same tissue compartments in skin, uterus, intestine, mammary gland, and brain. These results demonstrate that Fxyd3 and Lgi4 transcripts potentially form double-stranded RNA molecules in many cell types in vivo, which may impact on their respective expression.",M2
14505350,"Human cardiomyocytes express high level of Na+/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1).We have quantitatively measured gene expression for the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2) in 23 human tissues using the method of real time PCR. As predicted, our results revealed that the expression of SGLT1 was very high in the small intestine (1.2E + 6 molecules/microg total RNA) relative to that in the kidney (3E + 4 molecules/microg total RNA). Surprisingly, we observed that the expression of SGLT1 in human heart was unexpectedly high (3.4E + 5 molecules/microg total RNA), approximately 10-fold higher than that observed in kidney tissue. DNA sequencing confirmed that the PCR amplified fragment was indeed the human SGLT1 gene. Moreover, in situ hybridization studies using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense <e>cRNA</e> probe corresponding to human SGLT1 cDNA confirm that human cardiomyocytes express SGLT1 mRNA. In contrast, the expression of SGLT2 in human tissues appears to be ubiquitous, with levels ranging from 6.7E + 4 molecules/microg total RNA (in skeletal muscle) to 3.2E + 6 molecules/microg total RNA (in kidney), levels 10-100-fold higher than the expression of SGLT1 in the same tissues. Our finding that human cardiomyocytes express high levels of SGLT1 RNA suggests that SGLT1 may have a functional role in cardiac glucose transport. Since several SGLT inhibitors are currently in development as potential anti-diabetic agents, it may be important to assess the functional consequences of inhibition of SGLT1 in the heart.",M2
12975798,"Teleost Fh14-3-3a protein protects Xenopus oocytes from hyperosmolality.We have previously cloned and characterized a novel 14-3-3 gene from the euryhaline telost Fundulus heteroclitus, Fh14-3-3a (Kültz et al., 2001). The corresponding gene product is osmoregulated and most highly expressed in gill epithelium of this fish. In the present study we have expressed Fh14-3-3a <e>cRNA</e> in Xenopus laevis oocytes and investigated the survival and electrophysiological parameters of Xenopus oocytes in isosmotic and various hyperosmotic media. Xenopus oocytes expressing Fh14-3-3a show no mortality after a 16 hour exposure to hyperosmolality in the form of elevating medium K(+), Na(+), polyethylene glycol, or sorbitol concentrations up to 444 mosmol/kg. In contrast, 16 hours of the same hyperosmolality caused 100% mortality in control Xenopus oocytes injected with water. As a result of hyperosmolality the Xenopus oocyte membrane potential decreased between 10 and 70% in oocytes expressing Fh14-3-3a whereas it was completely abolished in control oocytes. We report that one potential cause for the osmoprotective effect of Fh14-3-3a on Xenopus oocytes could be its inhibition of an endogenous chloride current. Hyperosmotic urea was not as harmful to Xenopus oocytes as hypertonicity and maybe acting through a different mechanism. Coexpression of Fh14-3-3a with a human calcium channel in Xenopus oocytes did not affect the electrophysiological properties of this exogenous channel. Thus, the osmoprotective effect of Fh14-3-3a may prove a valuable tool for the characterization of exogenous ion channels in Xenopus oocytes exposed to hyperosmotic conditions.",M2
12911626,"Regulation of the glutamate transporter EAAT1 by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 and the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase isoforms SGK1/3 and protein kinase B.Surface expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT1 is stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 through activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. Downstream targets include serum and glucocorticoid-sensitive kinase isoforms SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3, and protein kinase B. SGK1 regulates Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin ligase that prepares cell membrane proteins for degradation. To test whether Nedd4-2, SGK1, SGK3 and protein kinase B regulate EAAT1, <e>cRNA</e> encoding EAAT1 was injected into Xenopus oocytes with or without additional injection of wild-type Nedd4-2, constitutively active S422DSGK1, inactive K127NSGK1, wild-type SGK3 and/or constitutively active T308D,S473DPKB. Glutamate induces a current in Xenopus oocytes expressing EAAT1, but not in water-injected oocytes, which is decreased by co-expression of Nedd4-2, an effect reversed by additional co-expression of S422DSGK1, SGK3 and T308D,S473DPKB, but not K127NSGK1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SGK1 phosphorylation sites in the Nedd4-2 protein (S382A,S468ANedd4-2) and in the EAAT1 protein (T482AEAAT1, T482DEAAT1) significantly blunts the effect of S422DSGK1. Moreover, the current is significantly larger in T482DEAAT1- than in T482AEAAT1-expressing oocytes, indicating that a negative charge mimicking phosphorylation at T482 increases transport. The experiments reveal a powerful novel mechanism that regulates the activity of EAAT1. This mechanism might participate in the regulation of neuronal excitability and glutamate transport in other tissues.",M2
12821651,"Heterologous expression of limulus rhodopsin.Invertebrates such as Drosophila or Limulus assemble their visual pigment into the specialized rhabdomeric membranes of photoreceptors where phototransduction occurs. We have investigated the biosynthesis of rhodopsin from the Limulus lateral eye with three cell culture expression systems: mammalian COS1 cells, insect Sf9 cells, and amphibian Xenopus oocytes. We extracted and affinity-purified epitope-tagged Limulus rhodopsin expressed from a cDNA or <e>cRNA</e> from these systems. We found that all three culture systems could efficiently synthesize the opsin polypeptide in quantities comparable with that found for bovine opsin. However, none of the systems expressed a protein that stably bound 11-cis-retinal. The protein expressed in COS1 and Sf9 cells appeared to be misfolded, improperly localized, and proteolytically degraded. Similarly, Xenopus oocytes injected with Limulus opsin cRNA did not evoke light-sensitive currents after incubation with 11-cis-retinal. However, injecting Xenopus oocytes with mRNA from Limulus lateral eyes yielded light-dependent conductance changes after incubation with 11-cis-retinal. Also, expressing Limulus opsin cDNA in the R1-R6 photoreceptors of transgenic Drosophila yielded a visual pigment that bound retinal, had normal spectral properties, and coupled to the endogenous phototransduction cascade. These results indicate that Limulus opsin may require one or more photoreceptor-specific proteins for correct folding and/or chromophore binding. This may be a general property of invertebrate opsins and may underlie some of the functional differences between invertebrate and vertebrate visual pigments.",M2
14606693,"Molecular dissection of the amygdala and its relevance to autism.The limbic system, and in particular the amygdala, have been implicated in autism. The amygdala is a complex structure that in rodents consists of at least 12 different nuclei or subnuclei. A comparative analysis of amygdala neuroanatomy in normal vs. autistic brains would be aided by the availability of molecular markers to unambiguously recognize these different amygdala substructures. Here we report on the development of methods to identify genes enriched in the central, lateral and medial nuclei of the rodent amygdala. Our results suggest that laser-capture microdissection of specific amygdala subnuclei, when combined with linear amplification of <e>cRNA</e> probes for oligonucleotide microarray hybridization, can efficiently identify genes whose expression is confined to these substructures. Importantly, many of these genes were missed in previous gene expression-profiling experiments using whole amygdala tissue. The isolation of human orthologs of these subnucleus-specific genes, and/or the application of these methods directly to human tissue, may provide useful markers for characterizing neuropathological correlates of autism, as well as for identifying molecular differences between normal and autistic brains.",M2
14534239,"Overexpression of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) channel gene modifies the firing activity of identified motor neurons in a small neural network.The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) is widely distributed in excitable cells. Ih plays important roles in regulation of cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, and synaptic function. We previously showed that, in pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of spiny lobsters, Ih can be endogenously upregulated to compensate for artificial overexpression of the Shal transient potassium channel; this maintains normal firing properties of the neuron despite large increases in potassium current. To further explore the function of Ih in the pyloric network, we injected <e>cRNA</e> of PAIH, a lobster gene that encodes Ih, into rhythmically active PD neurons. Overexpression of PAIH produced a fourfold increase in Ih, although with somewhat different biophysical properties than the endogenous current. Compared with the endogenous Ih, the voltage for half-maximal activation of the PAIH-evoked current was depolarized by 10 mV, and its activation kinetics were significantly faster. This increase in Ih did not affect the expression of IA or other outward currents. Instead, it significantly altered the firing properties of the PD neurons. Increased Ih depolarized the minimum membrane potential of the cell, reduced the oscillation amplitude, decreased the time to the first spike, and increased the duty cycle and number of action potentials per burst. We used both dynamic-clamp experiments, injecting the modeled PAIH currents into PD cells in a functioning STG, and a theoretical model of a two-cell network to demonstrate that the increased Ih was sufficient to cause the observed changes in the PD activity.",M2
