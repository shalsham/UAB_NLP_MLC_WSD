20500885,"Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs).BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is an important cause of pyogenic skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The aim of present study is to investigate the molecular characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus isolates isolated from the pus samples from the patients with purulent skin and soft tissue infections in Wenzhou, China. METHODS: Between December 2002 and June 2008, a total of 111 nonduplicate S. aureus isolates were collected from the pus samples of the patients with SSTIs in a teaching hospital in Wenzhou, China. All the tested isolates were confirmed as S. aureus using a <e>Staph</e> SPA agglutination kit, Gram's stain and a Vitek-60 microbiology analyzer. The homology among the tested isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to determine the sequence types (STs) of the selected isolates. The genotypes of SCCmec were determined by a multiplex PCR in the MRSA isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes and mecA were also determined by another multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Among the 111 S. aureus isolates, 48 and 63 isolates were community-acquired and hospital-acquired respectively. Sixty isolates were confirmed as MRSA harboring mecA detected by PCR. A total of 32 PFGE clonal types were obtained by PFGE, with 10 predominant patterns (types A to J). Twenty-five different STs including ST398 and three novel STs were found among 51 selected isolates. The main STs were ST239, ST1018, ST59, ST7 and ST88. Of 60 MRSA isolates, SCCmec II, III, IV and SCCmec V were found in three, 50, three and two isolates, respectively. The positive rates of PVL genes in overall isolates, HA-isolates, CA-isolates, MRSA isolates and MSSA isolates were 23.4% (26/111), 20.6% (13/63), 27.1% (13/48), 21.7% (13/60) and 25.5% (13/51), respectively. Eight (33.3%, 8/24) of 24 CA-MRSA isolates and 5 (13.9%, 5/36) of 36 HA-MRSA isolates were positive for PVL genes. ST239-MRSA-SCCmecIII and ST1018-MRSA-SCCmecIII clones were found to be main clones and spread between community and hospital. CONCLUSION: S. aureus isolates causing SSTIs showed considerable molecular heterogeneity and harbored high prevalence of PVL genes. Clonal spread was responsible for the dissemination of the isolates of S. aureus associated with SSTIs.",M1
20338430,"An improved method to culture Staphylococcus aureus from bovine milk.Staphylococcus aureus is an important udder pathogen often associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. Identification of <e>Staph</e>. aureus-positive udder quarters and cows is an important part of control programs to reduce spread of Staph. aureus within and between dairy herds. Therefore, accurate and easy-to-perform culturing methods of Staph. aureus in milk are needed. In the present study, 8 methods for isolation of Staph. aureus in bovine milk samples were investigated. The methods involved different culturing volumes, enrichment, incubation, and freezing processes as well as sedimentation and use of the Mastistrip cassette (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden). Three different sets of milk samples were collected, and 6, 5, and 4 methods were used in each subset of samples. Our results indicate an increased probability of detecting Staph. aureus in milk samples when a simple incubation step (37 degrees C for 18 h) without additives was included before culturing. Using this incubation method, the number of Staph. aureus-positive udder quarters and cows increased by 50 and 29%, respectively, compared with using the standard method of direct culturing of 10 microL of milk. The improved method may be especially useful for detection of low concentrations of Staph. aureus in milk; for example, when screening herds for Staph. aureus.",M1
20130329,"The prophylactic effects of platelet-leucocyte gel in osteomyelitis: an experimental study in a rabbit model.Platelet-leucocyte gel (PLG), a new biotechnological blood product, has hitherto been used primarily to treat chronic ulcers and to promote soft-tissue and bone regeneration in a wide range of medical fields. In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of PLG against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) was investigated in a rabbit model of osteomyelitis. Autologous PLG was injected into the tibial canal after inoculation with <e>Staph</e>. aureus. The prophylactic efficacy of PLG was evaluated by microbiological, radiological and histological examination. Animal groups included a treatment group that received systemic cefazolin and a control group that received no treatment. Treatment with PLG or cefazolin significantly reduced radiological and histological severity scores compared to the control group. This result was confirmed by a significant reduction in the infection rate and the number of viable bacteria. Although not comparable to cefazolin, PLG exhibited antimicrobial efficacy in vivo and therefore represents a novel strategy to prevent bone infection in humans.",M1
20059917,"Identification of potential sources of Staphylococcus aureus in herds with mastitis problems.Staphylococcus aureus is a common udder pathogen of dairy cows that often causes herd problems. Various mastitis control programs have been used to combat the problem but have not always been efficient in preventing new <e>Staph</e>. aureus infections, indicating the presence of possible sources of infection other than those traditionally considered. Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify potential sources of infection relevant for Staph. aureus mastitis within 5 dairy herds with udder health problems caused by Staph. aureus. Samples were collected from milk of lactating cows, from body sites, and from the environment of lactating cows, dry cows, late pregnant heifers, young heifers 4 to 12 mo old, and heifer calves 0 to 3 mo old. Isolates of Staph. aureus were identified and compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Four to 7 unique Staph. aureus pulsotypes were found within each herd, with one strain predominating in milk in each herd. The milk pulsotypes were also frequently isolated in body samples, especially on hock skin, and in the immediate environment of lactating cows, and were sometimes found in other animal groups, especially in dry cows and heifer calves 0 to 3 mo old. The prevalence of Staph. aureus in milk and other types of samples varied markedly between herds. Staphylococcus aureus isolates with genotypes indistinguishable from those found in milk also dominated in extra-mammary sites within the dairy herds studied, and hock skin was identified as an important reservoir of Staph. aureus. The results contribute new knowledge necessary to improve strategies for udder health control in herds.",M1
20030902,"Relationship between virulence factor genes in bovine Staphylococcus aureus subclinical mastitis isolates and binding to anti-adhesin antibodies.Staphylococcus aureus is the most common aetiologic agent of contagious bovine mastitis. It is characterized by a wide array of virulence factors. The differences among strains jeopardize the development of effective vaccines against <e>Staph</e>. aureus mastitis. We tested the immunogenicity of a peptide subunit vaccine coding for three different adhesion factors, fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb), fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbpA) and clumping factor A (ClfA). Then we evaluated the influence of some virulence factors on the ability of specific anti-adhesin antibodies to react with sixteen Staph. aureus strains isolated from bovine subclinical mastitis. Immunization with the recombinant adhesins stimulated a strong humoural (IgG and IgA) and mucosal IgA immune response in all animals tested. Hyperimmune serum recognized with diverse efficiency the sixteen Staph. aureus strains and this circumstance correlated well with the level of expression of adhesins. Among the different virulence factors considered to classify strains, spa gene polymorphisms showed the strongest influence on isolate reactions to hyperimmune serum. Our results indicate the importance of a disease- and environment-specific analysis of isolates. Thus, as opposed to other pathogens to obtain an effective vaccine we should characterize multiple strains and identify the prevalent virulence factors expressed.",M1
20002576,"Human cathelicidin peptide LL37 inhibits both attachment capability and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis.AIMS: The aim of this work was to investigate the possible effect of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL37 on biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a major causative agent of indwelling device-related infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed initial attachment assay and biofilm formation solid surface assay in microtitre plates, as well as growth experiment in liquid medium using laboratory strain <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis ATCC35984. We found that already a low concentration of the peptide LL37 (1 mg l(-1)) significantly decreased both the attachment of bacteria to the surface and also the biofilm mass. No growth inhibition was observed even at 16 mg l(-1) concentration of LL37, indicating a direct effect of the peptide on biofilm production. CONCLUSIONS: As biofilm protects bacteria during infections in humans and allows their survival in a hostile environment, inhibition of biofilm formation by LL37 may have a key role to prevent bacterial colonization on indwelling devices. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our findings suggest that this host defence factor can be a potential candidate in prevention and treatment strategies of Staph. epidermidis infections in humans.",M1
19951328,"Low-level glycopeptide resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and how to test it.Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has emerged over the last ten years due to varying mechanisms and giving variable levels of resistance to vancomycin. The most resistant strains (fortunately rare) bear the vanA gene cluster and these are generally recognisable as MICs of vancomycin are usually found to be in the range 32-64mg/L. It should be noted that some automated systems have failed to detect these isolates. The much more commonly encountered GISA and hGISA vancomycin resistant strains of MRSA and methicillin sensitive <e>Staph</e>. aureus (MSSA) exhibit lower levels of resistance and difficulty is encountered in reliably defining and identifying these strains in clinical laboratories. No single completely reliable, convenient test either phonotypical genetic currently exists which can be readily applied in the clinical laboratory for the detection of hGISA/GISA. The population analysis profile (PAP) method is currently regarded as the reference method but is slow and tedious to perform on a large number of isolates. This enables the differentiation of hGISA and GISA from fully vancomycin sensitive strains. In the clinical laboratory the use of Meuller-Hinton agar with 5mg/L teicoplanin and a 10microL innoculum of MacFarland 0.5 incubated for 48h represents the most reliable and economical screening test. Further confirmation would be required using either macrodilution Etest methodology using an MIC &gt;or= 8mg/L of vancomycin and/or teicoplanin as the cut off for hGISA or the newer GRD (glycopeptide resistance detection) strip.",M1
19828918,"Free corticoperiosteal flap in the treatment of an infected bone defect of the tibia. A case report.The treatment of septic bone defects represents a significant challenge in orthopaedic surgery. Non-vascularised cancellous bone grafts are very commonly used. In contrast, thin and malleable periosteal grafts have generally only been investigated in animal models. The free corticoperiosteal flap is used only in exceptional cases in traumatology. This case report describes the treatment of an infected and non-reactive bone defect in the shaft of the tibia. This case involves a septic non-union over two years old with evidence of methicillin-resistant <e>Staph</e>. aureus. A vascularised corticoperiosteal flap was used to bridge this defect. The procedure was supplemented by rigid internal fixation. There were no postoperative complications. Bone healing was documented eleven months after the described treatment. No further invasive procedures were required. The patient was able to return to his original occupation as a store manager. Stable internal fixation is an important precondition for successful treatment. The method described in this article can be considered for short defects when a conventional cancellous bone graft appears to be contraindicated.",M1
19818007,"Bacterial contamination on touch surfaces in the public transport system and in public areas of a hospital in London.AIMS: To investigate bacterial contamination on hand-touch surfaces in the public transport system and in public areas of a hospital in central London. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dipslides were used to sample 118 hand-touch surfaces in buses, trains, stations, hotels and public areas of a hospital in central London. Total aerobic counts were determined, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified and characterized. Bacteria were cultured from 112 (95%) of sites at a median concentration of 12 CFU cm(-2). Methicillin-susceptible <e>Staph</e>. aureus (MSSA) was cultured from nine (8%) of sites; no sites grew methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). CONCLUSIONS: Hand-touch sites in London are frequently contaminated with bacteria and can harbour MSSA, but none of the sites tested were contaminated with MRSA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Hand-touch sites can become contaminated with staphylococci and may be fomites for the transmission of bacteria between humans. Such sites could provide a reservoir for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in high prevalence areas but were not present in London, a geographical area with a low incidence of CA-MRSA.",M1
19709343,"Surface disinfection properties of the combination of an antimicrobial peptide, ranalexin, with an endopeptidase, lysostaphin, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).AIMS: To characterize the antibacterial synergy of the antimicrobial peptide, ranalexin, used in combination with the anti-staphylococcal endopeptidase, lysostaphin, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to assess the combination's potential as a topical disinfectant or decolonizing agent for MRSA. MRSA causes potentially lethal infections, and pre-operative patients colonized with MRSA are often treated with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin cream to eradicate carriage. However, chlorhexidine is unsuitable for some patients, and mupirocin resistance is increasingly encountered, indicating new agents are required. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using an ex vivo assay, ranalexin and lysostaphin tested in combination reduced viable MRSA on human skin to a greater extent than either compound individually. The combination killed bacteria within 5 min and remained effective and synergistic even in high salt and low pH conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination is active against MRSA on human skin and under conditions that may be encountered in sweat. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although the exact mechanism of activity remains unresolved, considering its specific spectrum of activity, fast killing kinetics and low likelihood of resistance arising, the combination of ranalexin with lysostaphin warrants consideration as a new agent to eradicate nasal and skin carriage of <e>Staph</e>. aureus, including MRSA.",M1
19623664,"An animal model for open femur fracture and osteomyelitis--Part II: Immunomodulation with systemic IL-12.Infection resulting from open fracture is a common problem in orthopedics. The purpose of this project was to study the effect of Interleukin-12 (IL-12) systemic therapy on a previously established open fracture model. One hundred seven male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five groups: (1) normal (baseline), (2) control (controlled for anesthesia), (3) fracture, (4) <e>staph</e>, and (5) staph and IL-12 (SIL). Each group was divided into four time periods: 6, 10, 14, and 21 days after injury and fixation. The operative groups had a standardized femur fracture and fixation using a Kirschner wire as an intramedullary device. The two infection groups (staph and SIL) were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus following fracture and fixed with an identical technique. The SIL group was treated with systemic IL-12 for a total of 10 doses over 10 days. Significantly decreased serum IL-12 levels were noted at day 10 in the operative groups compared to the normal and control groups. The SIL group showed significantly higher macrophage activation levels and total platelet counts at day 21 compared to all the other groups. The overall infection rate was not changed by IL-12 supplementation; however, bacterial qualitative growth scores were significantly lower in the SIL group at day 10, which corresponded to the lowest level of systemic IL-12 in the fracture group.",M1
19548887,"Antimicrobial and antistaphylococcal biofilm activity from the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus.AIMS: Staphylococcal biofilm-associated infections are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Consequently, new agents are needed to treat them. With this aim, we focused on the effector cells (coelomocytes) of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus immune system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested the activity of the 5-kDa peptide fraction of the cytosol from coelomocytes (5-CC) against a group of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. We determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 253.7 to 15.8 mg ml(-1). We observed an inhibitory activity and antibiofilm properties of 5-CC against staphylococcal biofilms of reference strains Staphylococcus epidermidis DSM 3269 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. The antimicrobial efficacy of 5-CC against the biofilms of clinical strain <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis 1457 was also tested using live/dead staining in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy. At a sub-MIC concentration (31 x 7 mg ml(-1)) of 5-CC the formation of young (6-h old) and mature (24-h old) staphylococcal biofilms was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: The biological activity of 5-CC could be attributed to three peptides belonging to the sequence segment 9-41 of a beta-thymosin of P. lividus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The effector cells of P. lividus represent an interesting source of marine invertebrates-derived antimicrobial agents in the development of new strategies to treat staphylococcal biofilms.",M1
19307625,"Mastitis-related subtypes of bovine Staphylococcus aureus are characterized by different clinical properties.Based on a former study from our group, one subtype of Staphylococcus aureus was associated with high within-herd prevalence of mastitis, whereas the other subtypes were associated with a low prevalence (sporadic intramammary infection). To confirm this hypothesis, a prospective study was done in 29 Swiss dairy herds. In particular, milk samples were collected from 10 herds with <e>Staph</e>. aureus herd problems (cases) and compared with samples from 19 herds with only sporadic cases of with Staph. aureus intramammary infection (controls). The isolates were tested for their virulence gene pattern and genotyped by PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer. The patterns and genotypes were then associated and compared with epidemiological and clinical data. Confirming the hypothesis, one particular subtype (genotype B) was associated with high within-herd and within-cow prevalence of intramammary infection, whereas the other subtypes were associated with low within-herd prevalence and infected single quarters. The gene patterns and genotypes were highly related, demonstrating the genetic diversity of the genotypes. The somatic cell counts were clearly increased in herds with a genotype B problem compared with herds with infections of other genotypes. Based on the different clinical properties and treatment consequences associated with these different genotypes found in Switzerland, we recommend subtyping Staph. aureus in other countries to determine if this finding is universally applicable.",M1
19146490,"Characterization of specific egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against mastitis-causing Staphylococcus aureus.AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro activity of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against mastitis-causing Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific IgY was produced by immunizing hens with formaldehyde-killed <e>Staph</e>. aureus, using a bacterial strain known to cause mastitis. The IgY, of 94% purity, was obtained from yolks by water dilution, salt precipitations, ultrafiltration and gel filtration. ELISA indicated that the IgY produced was specific to the antigen and five Staph. aureus isolates obtained from mastitic cows. The growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited by specific IgY at concentrations from 1 to 10 mg ml(-1) in a dose-dependent manner. The phagocytosis of Staph. aureus by milk macrophages was enhanced in the presence of specific IgY with the highest phagocytic percentage being 30% higher than that without IgY (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The specific IgY against mastitis-causing Staph. aureus inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus and enhanced the phagocytosis of Staph. aureus by milk macrophages. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Specific IgY would be a potential treatment for bovine mastitis.",M1
18986102,"Evaluation of a new Staphylococcus aureus latex agglutination kit, Prolex <e>Staph</e> Xtra, against other third-generation kits.Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, continues to be a common cause of infection/colonisation, which necessitates accurate and prompt diagnosis in the laboratory. Several rapid agglutination tests that aid this function are available, and some have been modified to improve their performance. One such kit, Prolex Staph Xtra, has been released recently. This study aims to compare this kit with other improved kits (i.e., Pastorex Staph-Plus, Staphaurex Plus and Staphytect Plus) and investigate their ability to confirm the identity of 100 strains of S. aureus. Results showed that 50 were resistant to methicillin. Specificity was checked against 30 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 20 Enterococcus species isolates. Of the four kits tested, Prolex Staph Xtra and Pastorex Staph-Plus proved superior in terms of sensitivity and speed.",M1
18922199,"The role of teat skin contamination in the epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infections.Knowledge of the epidemiological pattern and the potential sources of infections is important to control Staphylococcus aureus in dairy herds. This paper reports the results of a study applying both pulse field gel electrophoresis (PGFE) and the assessment of a selected number of virulence genes to investigate the role of teat skin on <e>Staph</e>. aureus transmission among cows and on the contamination of milk. Overall 61 isolates were considered, 23 from teat skin, 33 from milk samples and 5 from curd samples. Teat swabs were taken in five herds, but in only three of them could Staph. aureus be isolated. Curd was sampled in three herds, but Staph. aureus could be isolated in only two herds. The distribution of isolates among herds confirmed the presence of herd-specific Staph. aureus strain in most of the herds. The same pattern was observed in teat skin samples, in quarter milk samples, and in the curd samples. Our findings are consistent with other studies showing the role of teat skin as a potential reservoir. Moreover, Staph. aureus was isolated from teat skin of confirmed Staph. aureus-negative cows that were segregated from infected ones. Our findings also suggest that some strains have higher chances to survive on teat skin and therefore to increase the risk for contamination of milk and milk products due to the persistence of intramammary infections.",M1
18922198,"Outbreak of subclinical mastitis in a flock of dairy goats associated with atypical Staphylococcus haemolyticus.Staphylococcus haemolyticus is a pathogen frequently isolated from dairy cows and small ruminants. However, it always appears in only a few animals and not as a major pathogen. Recently, in a dairy goat herd of approximately 250 milking animals, 25.6% (46/180 goats) had milk cultures with atypical highly mucoid colonies accompanied by elevated somatic cell counts. The isolates were identified as <e>Staph</e>. haemolyticus. The present study describes the steps used in an attempt to identify the bacterium and to compare it with other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) including Staph. haemolyticus. Species identification performed with the API STAPH-IDENT 32 kit showed &gt;99.4% identity confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing tests. Microscopically the atypical Staph. haemolyticus strains showed unique cuboidal tetrad clusters reminiscent of those of the genus Sarcina. The outbreak caused by an atypical CNS underlines the need for accurate biochemical and genetic methods for ultimate identification of CNS to the species level.",M1
18922193,"Association between isolation of Staphylococcus aureus one week after calving and milk yield, somatic cell count, clinical mastitis, and culling through the remaining lactation.Cows with isolation of Staphylococcus aureus approximately 1 week after calving and milk yield, somatic cell count (SCC), clinical mastitis (CM), and culling risk through the remaining lactation were assessed in 178 Norwegian dairy herds. Mixed models with repeated measures were used to compare milk yield and SCC, and survival analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio for CM and culling. On average, cows with an isolate of <e>Staph</e>. aureus had a significantly higher SCC than culture-negative cows. If no post-milking teat disinfection (PMTD) was used, the mean values of SCC were 42,000, 61,000, 68,000 and 77,000 cells/ml for cows with no Staph. aureus isolate, with Staph. aureus isolated in 1 quarter, in 2 quarters and more than 2 quarters respectively. If iodine PMTD was used, SCC means were 36,000; 63,000; 70,000 and 122,000, respectively. Primiparous cows testing positive for Staph. aureus had the same milk yield curve as culture-negative cows, except for those with Staph. aureus isolated in more than 2 quarters. They produced 229 kg less during a 305-d lactation. Multiparous cows with isolation of Staph. aureus in at least 1 quarter produced 94-161 kg less milk in 2nd and &gt;3rd parity, respectively, and those with isolation in more than 2 quarters produced 303-390 kg less than multiparous culture-negative animals during a 305-d lactation. Compared with culture-negative cows, the hazard ratio for CM and culling in cows with isolation of Staph. aureus in at least 1 quarter was 2.0 (1.6-2.4) and 1.7 (1.5-1.9), respectively. There was a decrease in the SCC and in the CM risk in culture-negative cows where iodine PMTD had been used, indicating that iodine PMTD has a preventive effect on already healthy cows. For cows testing positive for Staph. aureus in more than 2 quarters at calving, iodine PMTD had a negative effect on the CM risk and on the SCC through the remaining lactation.",M1
18759121,"Multiplex PCR detection of the antibiotic resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from auricular infections.Thirty-five Staphylococcus aureus strains from auricular infections were isolated. The identification of strains was confirmed by Api ID 32 <e>Staph</e> strips, the antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using ATB Staph kit. PCR assay was used to detect the oxacillin resistance gene (mecA) and the erythromycin genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA and mef). The susceptibility profile of all strains revealed a low resistance level to oxacillin and erythromycin. The PCR results show that 60 % of the strains are mecA positive. The frequency of erythromycin genes was: ermA (+) 22.8 %, ermB (+) 45.7, ermC (+) 17.1, msrA (+) 28.6. The mef gene was not detected in any strain. No correlations between genotypic and phenotypic methods for the determination of oxacillin and erythromycin resistance was found. However, multiplex PCR technique was shown to be a fast, practical and economic technique for the detection of methicillin-and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci.",M1
18691102,"New developments in antimicrobial use in sepsis.Over the past decade, trends in antimicrobial resistance, epidemiology, and drug development have occurred that affect both the empiric and definite selection of antimicrobials in the septic patient. The rapid spread of highly pathogenic community-associated methicillin resistant <e>Staph</e> aureus (MRSA) requires clinicians to consider the inclusion of empiric coverage for MRSA even in community-acquired sepsis. Moreover, vancomycin appears to be losing its effectiveness, and while a number of new agents with broad gram positive activity have been licensed, none have emerged as clearly superior. An alarming increase in the number of hospital-acquired infections due to multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria has also occurred, and few new gram negative drugs are in development. Clinicians, faced with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumanii isolates resistant to all commonly used drugs, must resort to toxic older drugs such as colistin or therapy combining drugs not effective as monotherapy. Based on a desire to limit overall antimicrobial use, a re-evaluation of older data in both the neutropenic and non-neutropenic host has called into question the common practice of using combination therapy for some gram negative infections. An emerging consensus advocates emphasizing local unit specific antimicrobial sensitivity data in selecting empiric therapy and determining if combination therapy is required. New antifungal drugs and a better understanding of the risk factors for infection with Candida spp. has altered the approach to empiric and definitive treatment of Candida infections in the septic patient.",M1
18680613,"Evaluation of breed-dependent differences in the innate immune responses of Holstein and Jersey cows to Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection.Mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases of cattle. Various studies have reported breed-dependent differences in the risk for developing this disease. Among two major breeds, Jersey cows have been identified as having a lower prevalence of mastitis than Holstein cows. It is well established that the nature of the initial innate immune response to infection influences the ability of the host to clear harmful bacterial pathogens. Whether differences in the innate immune response to intramammary infections explain, in part, the differential prevalence of mastitis in Holstein and Jersey cows remains unknown. The objective of the current study was to evaluate several parameters of the innate immune response of Holstein and Jersey cows to intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus, a common mastitis-inducing pathogen. To control for non-breed related factors that could influence these parameters, all cows were of the same parity, in similar stages of milk production, housed and managed under identical conditions, and experimentally infected and sampled in parallel. The following parameters of the innate immune response were evaluated: acute phase protein synthesis of serum amyloid A and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; total and differential circulating white blood cell counts; milk somatic cell counts; mammary vascular permeability; milk N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity; and production of the cytokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12, tumour growth factor(TGF)-alpha, and TGF-beta1. The temporal response of all of these parameters following infection was similar between Holstein and Jersey cows. Further, with the exception of changes in circulating neutrophils and NAGase activity, the overall magnitude of these parameters were also comparable. Together, these data demonstrate that the innate immune response of Holstein and Jersey cows to <e>Staph</e>. aureus intramammary infection remains highly conserved despite previously reported differences in mastitis prevalence, as well as genotypic and phenotypic traits, that exist between the two breeds.",M1
18594171,"Acute lymphadenitis with cellulitis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis.Although coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have been considered part of the resident flora on the human skin, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an unusually virulent CNS and can cause many types of infection. We report a rare case of acute lymphadenitis with cellulitis in the right infraauricular region caused by S. lugdunensis. A 62-yr-old woman visited the Department of Otolaryngology of Busan Paik university hospital. She had a palpable mass and swelling in the right infraauricular region and complained of aggressive pain and a febrile sensation in the region for 5 days. On the suspicion of abscess with infection, percutaneous aspiration was performed and smooth, flat, white, opaque colonies grew on a blood agar plate as a pure culture. The biochemical test results showed the organism to be catalase positive, tube coagulase negative, ornithine decarboxylase positive, slide coagulase positive, and latex agglutination tests for coagulase positive. The API <e>Staph</e> Kit was used to identify the isolate to the species level as S. lugdunensis with a 64.6% probability (profile 6716152). We confirmed the species identification of this strain by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The patient's clinical condition improved with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and pus drainage.",M1

18474133,"Effect of a biological response modifier on cellular death mechanisms at drying off.Agents that increase natural protective mechanisms have been proposed for prevention and treatment of intramammary infections. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of a single intramammary infusion of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-based biological response modifier (BRM) on cellular death mechanism in uninfected and Staphylococcus aureus-infected bovine mammary glands during involution. Three groups of 12 cows, each one including 6 <e>Staph</e>. aureus-infected and 6 uninfected, were infused in two mammary quarters with BRM or placebo and slaughtered at 7, 14 and 21 d of involution. In infected quarters, BRM treatment produced a significant increase in percent of stained epithelial cells for the apoptosis-promoting protein Bax at every observation period. In addition, BRM produced a significant increase of immunostained stromal cells for Bax compared with placebo-treated quarters. BRM treatment produced an increase in percentages of epithelial cells staining with active caspase-3 at 7 d and 14 d of involution compared with placebo-treated quarters and a significant decrease in percentages of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive epithelial cells at 7 d and 21 d of involution. In addition, BRM treatment caused an increase in percentage of stromal cells immunostaining for active caspase-3 and TUNEL. An increase of active caspase-3 and TUNEL epithelial and stromal cell immunostaining was observed in Staph. aureus-infected compared with uninfected quarters. Cellular proliferation, determined by Ki-67 immunostaining, was increased in epithelial and stromal cells from Staph. aureus-infected compared with uninfected quarters at every observation period. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of mammary cell death in uninfected and Staph. aureus-infected bovine mammary gland during involution and illustrate the effects of LPS-based BRM on apoptosis and cell proliferation during mammary involution.",M1
18420617,"Relationship between milk lactoferrin and etiological agent in the mastitic bovine mammary gland.Bovine mastitis is one of the most deleterious diseases for dairy herds and is mainly caused by contagious and environmental bacterial pathogens. Among contagious bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent, whereas the main environmental mastitis pathogens are Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli. Bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is an approximately 80-kDa glycoprotein present in milk that participates in the innate response of the mammary gland against bacterial infection. The objectives of the current study were to analyze potential changes in bLF milk concentration, which would constitute a response of the mammary gland toward mastitis induced by different etiologic agents, and to evaluate a possible relation between this response and pathogen susceptibility to bLF. Microbiology analysis and bLF quantification in milk from different bovine mammary gland quarters were performed. Infected quarters presented greater concentrations of bLF compared with those from microbiologically negative quarters. Analysis of individual pathogen contributions showed that most of this increase was attributable to Strep. uberis intra-mammary infection. The ability of mammary gland cells to synthesize bLF in response to Strep. uberis challenge was demonstrated by immunodetection of the protein in in vitro infection experiments. Susceptibility of Strep. uberis, E. coli, and <e>Staph</e>. aureus to the antimicrobial activity of bLF was determined by growth inhibition assays conducted with 4 different isolates of each species. Whereas Staph. aureus and E. coli were shown to be susceptible to this protein, Strep. uberis appeared to be resistant to the antimicrobial activity of bLF. Molecular typing of the 4 Strep. uberis isolates used throughout this study showed that this result was representative of the species and not exclusive of a particular strain. Results presented herein suggest that different bacteria species may elicit different mammary gland responses mediated by bLF secretion and that Strep. uberis has probably adapted to this immune reaction by developing resistance to bLF inhibitory action.",M1

18314283,"Microbiology of otitis externa in the secondary care in United Kingdom and antimicrobial sensitivity.INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is one of the most common conditions seen in the otolaryngology clinics. There are no recently published studies that have looked at the causative pathogens of the otitis externa seen in secondary care in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial sensitivities. We present results of a prospective study to determine the current bacteriology of the condition. METHODS: Swabs were taken from the external auditory canals of the patients who presented to the otolaryngology emergency clinic with symptoms of otitis externa. These were analysed using microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing in one laboratory. The samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud agar, fastidious anaerobes agar with neomycin and <e>staph</e>/strep agar. Antimicrobial sensitivities of isolated pathogens were tested on iso-sensitest and blood agars using the BSAC disc diffusion template program. RESULTS: The most commonly identified pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (45.1%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (9%), anaerobes (6.3%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group G (2.8%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A (1.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%), methicillin resistant S. aureus (0.7%), Candida species (9.7%), Aspergillus species (4.2%) and Absidia corymbifera (0.7%). One hundred percent resistance of Pseudomonas isolates to neomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and amoxicillin was observed while most were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%), polymixin B (100%) and gentamicin (98.5%). S. aureus isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and flucloxacillin (100%). 92.3% were sensitive to neomycin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin is observed. All isolates anaerobes were sensitive to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Polymixin B, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin topical preparations should be used as first line treatment of otitis externa. If the infection does not settle swab results should be used to guide further treatment.",M1
18310748,"Surgical site infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after primary total hip replacement.We have analysed the management and clinical outcome of a series of consecutive patients who had a total hip replacement and developed post-operative surgical site infection (SSI) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of this infection was 1% over a period of five years. We studied SSI in 15 patients (16 infections) with a mean age of 72.7 years (53 to 81). In all, 12 of the infections occurred early and half of the infections involved the prosthesis, resulting in an increase of 11-fold in the cumulative hospital stay. Methicillin-resistant <e>Staph</e>. aureus was successfully eradicated in all the patients after a mean follow-up of 53.6 months (25 to 88). Superficial incisional infections resolved after antibiotic therapy alone while deep infections required multiple operative debridements. Attempted retention of the implant in early organ space infections was successful in only one of five patients. Only three patients with implant-level infections obtained a pain-free, functional prosthesis while a further three required excision arthroplasty. We have formulated a protocol of treatment which may serve as a guide in the management of these infections.",M1
18284856,"Use of an electronic nose for detection of biofilms.BACKGROUND: Prior work has indicated that electronic nose (enose) technology can distinguish among bacteria samples and identify patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and rhinosinusitis. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that an enose can distinguish between biofilm-producing and non-biofilm-producing bacteria of the same species. METHODS: Biofilm-producing and non-biofilm-producing mutant strains of Pseudomonas (PA01 and Sad36) and Staphylococcus (<e>Staph</e> WT and Staph SrtA-B-) were incubated and then sampled by the enose. Data were evaluated by logistic regression to perform binary classification of the bacteria. Training sets and testing sets were developed in two ways: by cross-validation with a leave-1-day-out method, and then by testing the last 4 days versus the first 18 days. RESULTS: By the leave-1-day-out method, logistic regression analysis of 198 samples of each bacterium determined that the training accuracy of the enose for both Pseudomonas species was 100% and the testing accuracy was 91.4% for PA01 and 88.4% for Sad36. The training accuracy of the enose for Staphylococcus species was 87.1% for Staph SrtA-B- and 88.2% for Staph WT and the testing accuracy was, respectively, 75.3 and 76.8%. By separating the first 18 days from the last 4 days, logistic regression analysis determined that the training accuracy of the enose for both Pseudomonas species was 100% and the testing accuracy was 100% for PA01 and 80.6% for Sad36. The training accuracy of the enose for Staphylococcus species was 87.7% for Staph SrtA-B- and 86.4% for Staph WT and the testing accuracy was respectively, 72.2 and 91.7%. CONCLUSION: The enose was able to identify correctly biofilm- versus non-biofilm-producing Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus species with accuracy ranging from 72.2 to 100%, depending on the particular organism and the data analysis methodology. These results suggest that biofilms may be an in vivo marker, which the enose can use to identify patients with particularly virulent and medically recalcitrant forms of chronic rhinosinusitis.",M1
18226294,"Risk factors for isolation of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus dysgalactiae from milk culture obtained approximately 6 days post calving.Milk culture results at approximately 6 d post calving were assessed in a 2-year retrospective single-cohort study in 178 Norwegian herds. A combined teat dipping and selective antibiotic therapy trial was performed in these herds where cows with composite milk somatic cell count (CMSCC) &gt;100,000 cells/ml before drying-off (geometric mean of the last three CMSCC test-days) and isolation of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus dysgalactiae were selected for either short-acting lactation antibiotic treatment or long-acting dry cow antibiotic treatment. Milk culture results at approximately 6 d post-calving were available from 437 treated cows and 3061 non-treated cows before drying-off and separate multivariable logistic regression models were ran for these two groups. Risk factors associated with isolation of <e>Staph</e>. aureus 6 d post calving for non-treated cows were CMSCC &gt;400,000 cells/ml before drying-off v. &lt;400,000 cells/ml (Odd ratio (OR) = 2.4) and clinical mastitis (CM) in the previous lactation v . non-treated (OR=1.5). Risk factors associated with Staph. aureus 6 d post calving for treated cows was a CMS &gt; 200,000 cells/ml before drying-off v. &lt;200,000 cells/ml (OR=2.3) and CM in the previous lactation verus non-treated (OR=1.7). For non-treated cows it was 1.7 times more likely to isolate Str. dysgalactiae 6 d post-calving if the CMSCC was &gt; 50,000 cells/ml compared with &lt;50,000 cells/ml. For treated cows it was 3.7-5.8-times more likely to isolate Str. dysgalactiae 6 d post calving if given short-acting lactation formula at quarter level compared with long-acting dry cow formula used at cow level. Regular use of iodine post-milking teat disinfection (PMTD) did not influence the isolation of Staph. aureus 6 d post calvin, but it was less likely to isolate Str. dysgalactiae 6 d post calving if iodine PMTD was used regularly rather than irregularly. The external teat sealant had no effect on either of the two bacteria. This study indicates that the CMSCC limit for sampling cows before drying-off can be reduced to 50,000 cells/ml in herds with a Str. dysgalactiae problem. Iodine PMTD should also be recommended in these herds. Cows with a CMSCC &gt; 400,000 cells/ml prior to drying-off should receive long-acting dry cow formula irrespective of the milk result.",M1

18024774,"Prevalence of mastitis pathogens in Ragusa, Sicily, from 2000 to 2006.The objective of this study was to report the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) in Ragusa, Sicily, from milk samples (n = 18,711) collected between October 2000 and June 2006 from 101 dairy herds. Milk samples were collected at 9,747 cow sampling events from 5,285 individual cows. Samples were individual quarter (92.8%) or composite samples (7.2%) from an individual cow. Logistic regression was used to examine the prevalence of IMI at the level of milk sample and at the level of cow, controlling for year and season of collection, type of sample (individual quarter or composite), and type of housing and bedding of the cow at the time of collection. Bedding and housing types were as follows, respectively (number of herd groups): bedding: none (61), organic [51 (straw, 50; sawdust, 1)], and sand (3); housing: bedded pack (37), free stalls (57), tie stalls (4), and paddock (17). Raw prevalence of cow IMI for a sample event was as follows (percentage of cow samples): no growth, 47.4%; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 22.6%; Staphylococcus aureus, 20.6%; other Streptococcus spp., 11.1%; Streptococcus agalactiae, 2.3%; coliform bacteria, 2.9%; and other organisms, 5.8%. Prevalence of IMI differed by bedding type for <e>Staph</e>. aureus (none, 24.5%; organic, 12.7%; sand, 12.3%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (none, 13.1%; organic, 27.4%; sand, 26.9%) but not for Streptococcus spp. or coliform bacteria. Prevalence of Streptococcus spp. IMI differed by housing type (tie stalls, 22.2%; bedded pack, 12.8%; free stalls, 8.4%; paddock, 7.1%). Housing was not associated with the prevalence of IMI for other bacteria. Herd monthly prevalence of Staph. aureus and Streptococcus spp. IMI was associated with decreased mean milk production (Staph. aureus, -1.42 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.51; Streptococcus spp., -1.31 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.64) and increased mean linear score (Staph. aureus, 1.01 units/d per cow, SEM 0.16; Streptococcus spp., 0.59 units/d per cow, SEM 0.22). Herds (n = 11) with a mean linear score (MLS) less than 3.3 units had the lowest prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI and monthly MLS and the greatest monthly mean milk production compared with other herds grouped by MLS [MLS 3.31 to 3.99 (n = 20), MLS 4.00 to 4.46 (n = 20), MLS &gt;4.46 (n = 17), and MLS not available (n = 33)].

17931220,"Somatic cell count in milk of selenium-supplemented dairy cows after an intramammary challenge with Staphylococcus aureus.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of selenium (Se) supplementation on milk somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows were fed a diet containing a suboptimal Se concentration (&lt;0.05 ppm, dry basis) starting 2 months before calving. Supplemented cows (n=6) received a single s.c. injection of barium selenate (1 ml/50 kg BW) 45 days prior to calving, whereas control group was kept unsupplemented. Twenty weeks after calving, two mammary quarters (right side) of each cow were challenged with 205,000 cfu/ml of Staphylococcus aureus (strain Newbould 305). Blood was collected bi-weekly until day 150 of lactation for the analysis of blood glutathione peroxidase (GPx1; EC 1.11.1.9) activity. To re-isolate the challenging pathogen and to evaluate SCC, aseptic milk samples were collected daily starting on the day of challenge, and finishing 7 days after inoculation. Unsupplemented cows had a lower activity of GPx1 through the experiment (P&lt;0.001). Natural log SCC (lnSCC) was higher in unsupplemented than Se-supplemented cows (P=0.04), showing evidence of significance after 5 days.

17881689,"Short communication: Changes in micromineral, magnesium, cytokine, and cortisol concentrations in blood of dairy goats following intramammary inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus.The aim of this study was to investigate mineral metabolism and immune response in dairy goats following intramammary inoculation with varying doses of Staphylococcus aureus. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after intramammary inoculation. Lowered plasma Fe concentrations were observed from 12 to 24 h postinoculation in groups SAA (<e>Staph</e>. aureus at 10(4) cfu, n = 5) and SAB (Staph. aureus at 10(8) cfu, n = 5). Plasma Cu concentrations increased in group SAB 2 h after inoculation and maintained greater concentrations until the end of the experiment compared with the control group (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Increased plasma Zn concentrations in group SAB were observed 48 h after inoculation, and the concentration was still greater 72 h after inoculation compared with the control group. Greater plasma Mg concentrations were detected in groups SAA and SAB compared with the control group at all timepoints after inoculation. Plasma Mg concentrations were generally greater in group SAA than in group SAB through 72 h (except at 2 h). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were unchanged following intramammary inoculation with Staph. aureus throughout the study. Plasma IL-6 concentrations in groups SAA and SAB increased gradually compared with the control group and peaked at 48 h after inoculation. In group SAB, serum cortisol concentrations started to increase from 8 h postinoculation and peaked at 12 h postinoculation. In conclusion, increasing the inoculum dose does not induce more rapid proinflammatory cytokine responses, whereas the data indicate that mineral metabolic alterations occur during the course of Staph. aureus mastitis in the goat.",M1
17881688,"Relationships between milk culture results and milk yield in Norwegian dairy cattle.Associations between test-day milk yield and positive milk cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and other mastitis pathogens or a negative milk culture for mastitis pathogens were assessed in quarter milk samples from randomly sampled cows selected without regard to current or previous udder health status. Staphylococcus aureus was dichotomized according to sparse (&lt; or =1,500 cfu/mL of milk) or rich (&gt;1,500 cfu/mL of milk) growth of the bacteria. Quarter milk samples were obtained on 1 to 4 occasions from 2,740 cows in 354 Norwegian dairy herds, resulting in a total of 3,430 samplings. Measures of test-day milk yield were obtained monthly and related to 3,547 microbiological diagnoses at the cow level. Mixed model linear regression models incorporating an autoregressive covariance structure accounting for repeated test-day milk yields within cow and random effects at the herd and sample level were used to quantify the effect of positive milk cultures on test-day milk yields. Identical models were run separately for first-parity, second-parity, and third-parity or older cows. Fixed effects were days in milk, the natural logarithm of days in milk, sparse and rich growth of <e>Staph</e>. aureus (1/0), Streptococcus spp. (1/0), other mastitis pathogens (1/0), calving season, time of test-day milk yields relative to time of microbiological diagnosis (test day relative to time of diagnosis), and the interaction terms between microbiological diagnosis and test day relative to time of diagnosis. The models were run with the logarithmically transformed composite milk somatic cell count excluded and included. Rich growth of Staph. aureus was associated with decreased production levels in first-parity cows. An interaction between rich growth of Staph. aureus and test day relative to time of diagnosis also predicted a decline in milk production in third-parity or older cows. Interaction between sparse growth of Staph. aureus and test day relative to time of diagnosis predicted declining test-day milk yields in first-parity cows. Sparse growth of Staph. aureus was associated with high milk yields in third-parity or older cows after including the logarithmically transformed composite milk somatic cell count in the model, which illustrates that lower production levels are related to elevated somatic cell counts in high-producing cows. The same association with test-day milk yield was found among Streptococcus spp.-positive pluriparous cows.",M1
17881687,"Development of a highly sensitive and specific assay to detect Staphylococcus aureus in bovine mastitic milk.Diagnosis of udder infections with Staphylococcus aureus by bacteriological milk testing of quarter milk samples is often not satisfactory. To get reliable results, repeated sampling is necessary, which is normally too expensive. Therefore, we developed a test that allows the highly specific detection of <e>Staph</e>. aureus in bovine milk samples at very low concentrations. It is based on a fast procedure to prepare bacteria from milk, followed by DNA extraction and quantitative PCR. The whole analysis is done within 5 h. For clinical milk samples, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was 50.7 times and 507 times higher than conventional bacteriology with 100 and 10 microL, respectively. The diagnostic specificity was 100%. The test is further characterized by a low intra- and interassay variability as well as by a good recovery of Staph. aureus from raw milk. Furthermore, a high correlation (R = 0.925) between the agar plate counts and the quantitative PCR methodology over the whole range of measurement was found. In addition, our test revealed considerably more positive results than bacteriology. Due to its favorable properties, the assay might become an important diagnostic tool in the context of bovine mastitis caused by Staph. aureus.",M1

All patients treated for more than one month on Peritoneal Dialysis were included: Fourty-eight in Period 1 (P1), 48 in Period 2 (P2), and 54 in Period 3 (P3). Each period was of 3 years. METHODS: Infection prophylaxis protocol: P1: hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine and non-occlusive dressing; P2: sterile water (boiled water) instead of antiseptic agents, semi-permeable dressing for taking showers, and nasal mupirocine prophylaxis for Staphylococcus aureus carriers; P3: equal to P2, plus local application of antibiotics in equivocal exit-site for infection and argentic nitrate in granulation tissue. Main outcome measure: The rates of catheter infection and microorganisms causing infection were analysed by means of the Poisson regression method. Chi-square and ANOVA when appropriate. RESULTS: The proportion of catheters implanted by nephrologist or surgeon (p&lt;0.01) and modality treatment by CAPD or CCPD (p&lt;0.0001) were significantly different in the three periods, while the <e>Staph</e>. Aureus carrieres was in the limit of significance (p=0.048). Throughout the three periods, a significantly decreasing rate of total (P=0.0035) and acute infections (P&lt;0.001), Staph. aureus (P=0.003) and peritonitis (P=0.0025) were found. The Pseudomonas aer. (P=0.006) and Gram negative Bacteria (P=0.023) decreased significantly in P2. The multiple factor analysis included eight factors: sex, age group, ESRD, DM, catheter implantation (nephrologist, surgeon), modality treatment (CAPD, CCPD), manufacturer and prophylaxis period as possible predictors of the catheter infections, the specific microorganisms and the peritonitis. That analysis revealed the prophylaxis period as the main predictive factor of the improvements found (p&lt;0.02,- p&lt;0.001). In contrast, the Corynebacteria spp. increased significantly (P=0.008) throughout the three periods. One half of the Corynebacteria in each period could be considered colonisers. The other half caused true infections, but not one of those episodes required catheter intervention. The non-diphtheria Corynebacteria increase was found related with the continuous cycling Peritoneal Dialysis treatment in multiple factor analysis (p=0.0023) and in the proportion analysis (P=0.039, c2). CONCLUSION: The progressive protocol applied obtained good results, without the continued use of local antiseptics or antibiotics at the exit-site. However, the non-diphtheria Corynebacteria sp. infection increment favours the consideration of an antiseptic agent for the exit-site care.",M1

Of the 130 isolates included in the analysis 86.9% were high prevalence strains (more than three isolates per herd), while 13.1% were strains that were only identified in one or two samples. Low prevalence strains were found in all six herds. The proportion of low prevalence strains was higher in multiparous than in primiparous cows (odds ratio, OR 4.4, 1.2-16.6).

17650189,"Biofilm reduction by a new burn gel that targets nociception.AIMS: To compare the ability of an amorphous first aid topical gel containing vinegar, citric acid and EDTA (RescuDerm(TM); RESC) and various derivative formulations to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSEUD) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (<e>STAPH</e>) biofilms. METHODS AND RESULTS: 24-h biofilms prepared using the Minimum Biofilm Elimination Concentration (MBEC) Assay System were exposed for 4 or 24 h to the different gel formulations. Citric acid-free, acetic acid-free or acetic acid-free/sodium acetate-supplemented RESC gels reduced PSEUD and STAPH biofilm formation as effectively as RESC. Substituting the weak organic acids with equivalent concentrations of glacial acetic acid reduced the effectiveness of gel against PSEUD and STAPH biofilms by half, but viable bacterial counts still remained below 4 log(10) CFU/peg. Removal of gelling agent and/or EDTA enhanced efficacy against PSEUD but not STAPH biofilms. An acidified placebo gel formulation generated an only marginal bactericidal effect compared to that of RESC. CONCLUSIONS: RESC is a promising new antimicrobial agent. Its weak organic acid content, rather than merely acidic pH, mediates its considerable in vitro bactericidal efficacy against bacterial biofilms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data, taken together with the observation that RescuDerm possesses broad in vitro bactericidal activity against other pathogen species, suggest the potential usefulness of this product for controlling biofilm formation on a variety of cutaneous traumatic and surgical wounds.",M1

The strains were identified by classic methods (colonial morphology, Gram staining, catalase test, coagulase test, and DNase test) as well as by API ID32 <e>Staph</e>. Susceptibilities to 18 antibiotics were tested with the ATB Staph kit. Most of the tested strains were resistant to penicillin. In addition, the presence of multidrug resistant strains that showed resistance to different antibiotics was recorded.

17639009,"Efficacy of nisin in treatment of clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.Nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by Lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. A total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (GM)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 IU; in the GM-treated group, intramammary infusion of GM was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. Results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to GM (90.2 vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than GM-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). Proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts &lt;500,000 cells/mL was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the GM-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. Of 17 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to GM, but none of them to nisin. Nisin therapy eliminated 54.5% (6 of 11) of S. aureus IMI, whereas GM eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). Nisin in milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 IU/mL) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/mL) allowed as preservative in milk by the China authority. Because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant <e>Staph</e>. aureus-caused IMI, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.",M1

The MIC that inhibited 90% of the isolates tested (MIC90) of penicillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin were, respectively, 4, 0.5, 1, 1, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.06 microg/mL for <e>Staph</e>. aureus and &gt; or = 64, 8, 1, 32, &gt; or = 64, &gt; or = 64, and 0.06 microg/mL for Staph. epidermidis. All Staph. aureus isolates showed susceptibility to oxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and enrofloxacin. Beta-lactamase production was detected in 20 of these isolates (66.7%), all of which were resistant to penicillin. Of the 31 Staph. epidermidis tested, 24 (77.4%) were beta-lactamase positive. All isolates were susceptible to both cefazolin and enrofloxacin. Nine Staph. epidermidis isolates were resistant to oxacillin, with MIC values ranging from 4 to 8 microg/mL. The MIC values of 5 antimicrobial agents tested were higher than those reported in other countries. Enrofloxacin was the only exception, showing lower MIC values compared with other reports. Overall, the antimicrobial agents tested in our study, with the exception of penicillin, were active against the 61 isolates studied.",M1
17517718,"Efficacy of a lactoferrin-penicillin combination to treat {beta}-lactam-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.The efficacy of intramammary (IM) treatments containing penicillin G (PG) alone or a combination of PG and bovine lactoferrin (bLF) was evaluated using a model of experimentally induced chronic bovine mastitis caused by a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. First, we confirmed that this strain could cause mastitis and infection could not be cured with PG alone. In a second trial, chronic mastitis was induced in 19 late-lactating cows by injecting a low dose of <e>Staph</e>. aureus through the teat canal of all quarters. After 15 d, cows with stable infections in their 4 quarters had their mammary quarters randomly assigned, within cow, to 1 of 4 IM treatments as follows: 1) citrate buffer, 2) 100,000 IU of PG, (3) 1 g of bLF, or 4) 1 g of bLF + 100,000 IU of PG. Treatments were repeated twice a day for 5 d. A third trial was undertaken to investigate the effect of an extended therapy on chronic mastitis acquired in a previous lactation. One month before dry-off, 20 gravid cows regrouped by dates of calving were infected in their 4 quarters. Once infections were established, cows were dried off abruptly. After calving, aseptic milk samples were collected separately from all quarters for 4 wk to monitor infection. Mammary quarters from enrolled cows were then randomly assigned, within cow, to 1 of 2 treatments as follows: 1) 100,000 IU of PG or 2) 250 mg of bLF + 100,000 IU of PG. Treatments were administered IM twice a day for 7 d. For all trials, milk samples were taken to monitor bacterial concentration and somatic cell count. Bacteriological cure rate was determined using milk samples taken 3 and 4 wk after initiation of treatments. For the second trial, cure rate was null for control quarters, 11.1% for bLF, 9.1% for PG, and 45.5% for the bLF + PG combination. For cows infected in their previous lactation, cure rate was higher for the bLF + PG combination (33.3%) compared with PG alone (12.5%). In conclusion, bLF added to PG is an effective combination (i.e., 3- to 5-times higher cure rate) for the treatment of stable Staph. aureu infections highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.",M1
17495100,"Role of interleukin-6 in the pathogenesis of an avian model of Staphylococcus aureus arthritis.To evaluate the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in arthritis induced by Staphylococcus aureus, a chicken model was developed for study. A total of 120 healthy broilers (8 wk old) were randomly divided into 4 groups. Two groups were injected with 0.35 mL of <e>Staph</e>. aureus (7.1x10(9) cfu/mL) into the right hock joints and the other 2 were injected with 0.35 mL of sterile saline into the same joints. One group of each of the 2 treatment groups was fed levofloxacin at a dose of 5 mg/kg of BW on the third day postinoculation for 4 successive days. Chicken blood samples were obtained on d 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 postinoculation. Chicken IL-6 (chIL-6) activities and concentrations in serum were quantified by B9 bioassay and human IL-6 ELISA, respectively. The results showed that chIL-6 activities and concentrations were reduced (P&lt;0.05) in the serum of infected broilers treated with levofloxacin compared with birds injected only with Staph. aureus. Levofloxacin treatment had no effect on IL-6 activities and concentrations in uninfected broilers. There was a strong correlation (r=0.91) between serum chIL-6 activities by the B9 bioassay and serum IL-6 concentrations determined by the human IL-6 ELISA. We concluded that chIL-6 is involved in the progression of chicken arthritis induced by Staph. aureus, and that it contributes to disease incidence and mortality.",M1

17322188,"Nasopharyngeal co-colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in children is bacterial genotype independent.Bacterial interference between Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx has been observed during colonization, which might have important clinical implications for the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in young children. This study aimed to determine whether the capacity of <e>Staph</e>. aureus to compete with Strep. pneumoniae is dependent on bacterial genotype. Demographic and microbiological determinants of carriage of specific genotypes of Staph. aureus in children were also studied. Children (n=3198) were sampled in the nasopharynx to detect carriage of Staph. aureus, Strep. pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Staph. aureus genotypes and pneumococcal sero- and genotypes were determined. Age, gender, zip code, active smoking and co-colonization with N. meningitidis or Strep. pneumoniae, both vaccine- and non-vaccine types, were not associated with colonization by specific Staph. aureus genotypes. Based on the whole-genome typing data obtained, there was no obvious correlation between staphylococcal and pneumococcal genotypes during co-colonization. Passive smoking showed a significant association (P=0.003) with carriage of a specific Staph. aureus cluster. This study suggests that there are no major differences between Staph. aureus clones (with different disease-invoking potential) in their capacity to compete with Strep. pneumoniae subtypes. Further studies should demonstrate whether differences in bacterial interference are due to more subtle genetic changes.",M1
17176777,"Sinusitis: viral, bacterial, or fungal and what is the role of <e>Staph</e>?Recently, it has been recognized that inflammation is the major cause of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) rather than bacterial infection. Fungi have emerged as a possible pathogenic agent that drives CRS. One clear-cut group of fungal sinusitis can be divided into invasive and noninvasive. The condition that the allergist is most likely to see is allergic fungal sinusitis. Generally, it appears in atopic, immunocompetent, adolescents and young adults and is marked by the presence of nasal polyps and allergic mucin, which includes eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and fungal hyphae. Computer tomographic imaging shows sinus opacification with hyperdense areas. Treatment has been successful with definitive nasosinus surgery and long-term oral prednisone. There is some evidence that fungi also may account for a large percentage of the remaining CRS patients. In this instance, the immune response to common airborne fungi appears to be IgG mediated rather than IgE mediated. Promising therapeutic results have been seen with intranasal antifungal agents but larger multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled studies are needed. Another unanswered question includes the possible role of staphylococcus-derived enterotoxins in the pathogenesis of CRS.",M1
17106086,"Long-term persistence of specific genetic types of mastitis-causing Staphylococcus aureus on three dairies.Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI digestion was used to investigate the persistence of specific genotypes of bovine mammary gland isolates of Staphylococcus aureus on 3 dairy herds. A total of 341 isolates of <e>Staph</e>. aureus were available from cows in 3 herds, collected over a period of 15 yr. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis band patterns of Staph. aureus isolates were analyzed visually and with gel analysis and comparison software. Based on this analysis, isolates were classified by PFGE type. Persistence was determined as the time period from the first to the last isolation of a particular PFGE type of Staph. aureus within a herd. Specific types of mastitis-causing Staph. aureus persisted long-term on these dairies. For example, PFGE type 3 isolates persisted on farms A, B, and C for 15, 15, and 13 yr, respectively. Type 6 was found to persist for 13 yr on farm C. Despite the application of standard mastitis control practices, mastitis-causing Staph. aureus types appeared to persist long-term, as detected by PFGE, and were isolated coincident with herd problems of increased milk somatic cell counts and decreased milk production.",M1
17093032,"Combined use of Pastorex <e>Staph</e>-Plus and either of two new chromogenic agars, MRSA ID and CHROMagar MRSA, for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.We describe the search toward a fast and reliable strategy to detect and confirm the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in screening samples. First, we evaluated the sensitivities and specificities of oxacillin resistance screening agar (ORSA) with enrichment (tryptic soy broth [TSB] and ORSA [TSB-ORSA]) and without enrichment (ORSA), MRSA ID (MRSA_ID) plates, and CHROMagar MRSA (C_MRSA) plates, all of which were inoculated with equal volumes of a suspension made by emulsifying screening swabs. Whereas the sensitivities after 48 h were similar for all media tested (77% for MRSA_ID and ORSA; 73% for C_MRSA and ORSA after enrichment [TSB-ORSA]), the specificities of MRSA_ID (98% after 24 h and 94% after 48 h) and C_MRSA (98% after 24 h and 90% after 48 h) were superior to the specificities of ORSAs (92% after 24 h and 83% after 48 h) and TSB-ORSA (86% after 24 h and 81% after 48 h). Subsequently, the performance of the Pastorex Staph-Plus agglutination test with presumptive MRSA isolates taken directly from chromogenic agars (direct_Pastorex agglutination) was compared to that of the Pastorex Staph-Plus agglutination test with isolates from blood agar subcultures (conventional_Pastorex agglutination). When the direct_Pastorex agglutination test on MRSA_ID plates was combined with Gram staining, the direct_Pastorex agglutination test with samples from MRSA_ID plates was as reliable as the conventional_Pastorex agglutination test with samples from blood agar subcultures from MRSA_ID plates. In contrast, the direct_Pastorex agglutination test with samples from C_MRSA plates gave false-negative results. Finally, we calculated the processing times of the four different strategies, namely, (i) enrichment in TSB supplemented with NaCl, subsequent culture on ORSA, and the conventional_Pastorex agglutination test; (ii) direct inoculation of ORSA combined with conventional_Pastorex agglutination test; (iii) direct inoculation of MRSA_ID plates combined with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex agglutination test; and (iv) direct inoculation of C_MRSA plates combined with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex agglutination test. We concluded that the use of MRSA_ID in combination with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex agglutination test is faster and more specific than the other strategies tested.",M1
16978433,"Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae in Norwegian herds after introduction of selective dry cow therapy and teat dipping.The objective was to promote a reduction in the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae after 2 years of selective dry cow therapies and teat dipping/external teat sealant implementation. Three different dry cow treatments, one long-acting and two short-acting penicillin-based products were tested at herd level together with a negative control teat dipping group, an iodine teat dipping group and DryFlextrade mark, an external teat sealant. The regimes were independently randomly allocated to 178 dairy herds. Yearly bacteriological quarter milk samples were collected from all cows at the beginning of the trial, after 1 year and 2 years. At herd level, a total of 15% of the herds showed no Staphylococcus aureus isolates after 2 years, compared with 5% at the beginning. The distribution of Streptococcus dysgalactiae infected herds remained the same after 2 years. At cow level, there were no significant differences in the reduction of <e>Staph</e>. aureus between the different dry cow therapies and teat dipping regimes. But there was a significant reduction of Str. dysgalactiae in the iodine teat dipping group compared with Dryflextrade mark and the negative control group. The proportional rate of Staph. aureus positive quarters was reduced from 65.9% to 54.9% after 2 years. As for Str. dysgalactiae, an increase was observed from 14.2% to 15.2%.",M1

Identification based on phenotypic testing and polymerase chain reaction detection of the S. aureus species-specific nuc gene and the coagulase gene indicated that the mannitol-negative isolates were S. aureus. Furthermore, they were mecA positive, and SCCmec typing demonstrated that all the isolates harbored type IV SCCmec. API <e>STAPH</e> (Biomerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) misidentified 2 mannitol-negative MRSA that belonged to the major clone in KZN province, as Staphylococcus lugdunensis.

Three consecutive bulk milk samples were obtained at weekly intervals from all 258 PEI dairy herds and were cultured using routine laboratory methods. Cumulative prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis and M. alkalescens) was 74%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Bulk milk somatic cell count of <e>Staph</e>. aureus-positive herds was higher than that of negative herds.

16702252,"Invited Review: The role of cow, pathogen, and treatment regimen in the therapeutic success of bovine Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of udder infections in dairy herds. Both lactational and dry cow therapy are part of <e>Staph</e>. aureus control programs. Reported cure rates for Staph. aureus mastitis vary considerably. The probability of cure depends on cow, pathogen, and treatment factors. Cure rates decrease with increasing age of the cow, increasing somatic cell count, increasing duration of infection, increasing bacterial colony counts in milk before treatment, and increasing number of quarters infected. Staphylococcus aureus mastitis in hind quarters has a low cure rate compared with front quarters. Antimicrobial treatment of intramammary infections with penicillin-resistant Staph. aureus strains results in a lower cure rate for treatment with either beta-lactam or non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Other strain-specific factors may affect the probability of cure but routine diagnostic methods for use in bacteriology laboratories or veterinary practices are not yet available. The most important treatment factor affecting cure is treatment duration. Increased duration of treatment is associated with increased chance of cure. Economically, extended treatment is not always justified, even when indirect effects of treatment such as prevention of contagious transmission are taken into consideration. Usefulness of treatment trials could be improved by standardization of case definitions, consideration of host and strain factors, and sufficient statistical power. Treatment of young animals with penicillin-sensitive Staph. aureus infections is often justified based on bacteriological cure and economic outcome, whereas treatment of older animals, chronic infections, or penicillin-resistant isolates should be discouraged.",M1
16698698,"Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp.CONCLUSIONS: We recommend amoxacillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins and macrolides rather than penicillin as the first-line drug in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. In cases where there is no improvement of symptoms, cultures should be taken from the middle meatus, followed by appropriate selection of second-line antibiotics according to the sensitivity test results. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causative bacteria and the antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of maxillary sinus aspirates from 81 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Aerobes were isolated from 58.0% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 48.1% of those from the maxillary sinus. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most prevalent aerobic pathogens. Anaerobes were isolated from 8.6% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 18.5% of the cultures from the maxillary sinus. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus in adults but none of them were cultured in children. A high rate of concordance of the middle meatus and maxillary sinus was noted. Monomicrobial infection was most commonly observed. Ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates were cultured in 46% of the cases. Penicillin resistance rates were 93% for <e>Staph</e>. aureus; 25% of Strep. pneumoniae were intermediate and 25% were resistant.",M1
16698694,"Inner ear and facial nerve complications of acute otitis media with focus on bacteriology and virology.CONCLUSION: Among 20 patients with inner ear complications and/or peripheral facial palsy secondary to acute otitis media (AOM) a proven or probable bacteriological cause was found in 13 (65%). In seven patients (35%), a proven or probable viral cause was found. Only two of the patients (10%), with a proven bacterial AOM and a clinical picture of a purulent labyrinthitis in both, together with a facial palsy in one, had a substantial degree of dysfunction. Although the number of patients in this study is relatively low our findings show that inner ear complications and facial palsy due to AOM can be of both bacterial and viral origin. Severe sequelae were found only where a bacterial origin was proven. OBJECTIVES: Inner ear complications and/or peripheral facial palsy secondary to AOM are rare. The general understanding is that they are due to bacterial infections. However, in some of these patients there are no clinical or laboratory signs of bacterial infections and they have negative bacterial cultures. During recent years different viruses have been isolated from the middle ear or serologically proven in AOM patients and are thought to play a pathogenetic role. We suggest that in some cases of AOM complications from the inner ear and the facial nerve can be caused by viruses. The purpose of our study was to analyze infectious agents present in patients with inner ear complications and/or facial palsy arising from AOM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 20 patients who had inner ear complications and/or facial palsy following AOM ( unilateral in 18, bilateral in 2) between January 1989 and March 2003 were evaluated. Bacterial cultures were carried out for all patients. Sera from 12 of the patients were stored and tested for a battery of specific viral antibodies. In three patients, investigated between November 2002 and March 2003, viral cultures were also performed on samples from the middle ear and nasopharynx. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had inner ear symptoms. Eight of them had a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo, three had vertigo as an isolated symptom and one, with bilateral AOM, had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Seven patients had a combination of facial palsy and inner ear symptoms (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in three, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in two, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in one, with bilateral AOM, and vertigo alone in one). One patient had an isolated facial palsy. Healing was complete in 11 of the 20 patients. In seven patients a minor defect remained at follow-up (a sensorineural hearing loss at higher frequencies in all). Only two patients had obvious defects (a pronounced hearing loss in combination with a moderate to severe facial palsy (House-Brackman grade 4) in one, distinct vestibular symptoms and a total caloric loss in combination with a high-frequency loss in the other. Eight patients had positive bacteriological cultures from middle ear contents: Streptococcus pneumoniae in two, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A in two, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A together with Staphylococcus aureus in one, <e>Staph</e>. aureus alone in one and coagulase-negative staphylococci (interpreted as pathogens) in two. In the 12 patients with negative cultures, there was a probable bacteriological cause due to the outcome in SR/CRP and leukocyte count in five. In four patients serological testing showed a concomitant viral infection that was interpreted to be the cause (varicella zoster virus in two, herpes simplex virus in one and adenovirus in one.) In three there was a probable viral cause despite negative viral antibody test due to normal outcome in SR/CRP, normal leukocyte count, serous fluid at myringotomy and a relatively short pre-complication antibiotic treatment period.",M1
16569278,"Comparative sequence analysis of spa gene of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis: characterization of an unusual spa gene variant.The protein A encoding gene spa of four Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bovine clinical mastitis was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The four strains were selected after an initial screening of spa gene of 41 strains isolated from mastitic cows and were subjected to detailed investigations. According to the sequencing results the spa gene of three strains (M1, M2, M3) appeared with gene segments encoding five (E, D, A, B and C) and four (E, A, B and C) IgG binding domains for two (M1, M3) and one (M2) strain, respectively and with gene segments encoding four, two and two repeats of the octapeptide Xr-repeats for the strains M1, M2 and M3, respectively. For the remaining <e>Staph</e>. aureus strain (M4) gene segments encoding IgG binding domains E, D and A and a new domain BC with a size of 219 bp could be observed. The BC domain appears, with a deletion of a 123 bp segment from the border region between both domains, as fused domain of both previously characterized domains.

16528393,"Mastitis pathogens present in bulk tank milk from seven dairy herds in the Waikato region, New Zealand.AIM: To identify and enumerate colony forming units (cfu) of mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk (BTM) from pasture-fed New Zealand dairy cows in the Waikato region. METHODS: BTM samples from seven seasonal-calving dairy herds in the Waikato region were collected monthly from August to December 2004 (cows calved during July-September). Milk samples were cultured on blood aesculin and MacConkey agar plates for 24 h, and the number of mastitis pathogens identified and counted. RESULTS: Colonies identified in BTM included aesculin-positive streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and coliforms; counts ranged from zero to &gt;1,000 cfu/ml. Counts&gt;1,000 cfu/ml for total aesculin-positive streptococci, CNS and coliforms were present in 48%, 51% and 11% of BTM samples, respectively. Counts of <e>Staph</e>. aureus ranged from zero to 1,000 cfu/ml, but first appeared in BTM samples only in October. Staphylococcus aureus was repeatedly isolated in BTM from 4/7 farms during the testing period. CONCLUSIONS: Counts of mastitis pathogens in this study appeared high relative to interpretive criteria set by other workers, which may indicate a high prevalence of mastitis risk factors on these farms. Interpretation of results is difficult as aesculin-positive streptococci, CNS and coliforms can be isolated from the environment as well as from cows with clinical or subclinical mastitis. Furthermore, Staph. aureus is inconsistently excreted from infected bovine mammary glands. More extensive study of this method is required in New Zealand to attempt to further validate the interpretation of results of bacterial culture of BTM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This method may be used to monitor challenge from mastitis pathogens over time as part of milk quality control programmes. The technique may be of use as a screening test to provide information to veterinarians, affording them the opportunity to have an input into mastitis control on dairy farms in New Zealand.",M1

METHODS AND RESULTS: Four bacteriocins produced by <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis (Pep5, epidermin, epilancin K7 and epicidin 280) and three produced by Staph. aureus (aureocins A70, A53 and 215FN) were tested. Sixteen Staph. aureus strains, including a representative strain of the endemic Brazilian methicillin-resistant clone (MRSA), and 57 CNS strains were used as indicators. Among the staphylococcins used, Pep5 was able to inhibit 77.2% of the CNS strains and 87.5% of the Staph. aureus strains tested, including the Brazilian MRSA endemic clone, responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections in Brazil. On the other hand, aureocin A53 and epidermin presented a high antagonistic activity only against the Staph. aureus strains, being able to inhibit, respectively, 87.5% and 81.3% of them, including also the Brazilian MRSA endemic clone. The remaining bacteriocins inhibited only a low percentage of the nosocomial staphylococcal strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Aureocin A53 and epidermin have potential applications against MRSA, whereas Pep5 seems to be an attractive agent against both MRSA and CNS, including mupirocin-resistant strains and the Brazilian endemic clone of MRSA, which is also found disseminated in other countries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriocins may represent alternative agents to control important nosocomial pathogens.",M1
16476792,"Evaluation of six agglutination tests for Staphylococcus aureus identification depending upon local prevalence of meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).Most routine laboratory detection of Staphylococcus aureus isolates is based on rapid agglutination test systems. Failure of agglutination assays to identify meticillin-resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA) has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate six commercially available agglutination tests for the detection of meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and mecA-positive MRSA strains. The Dry Spot Staphytect Plus test (Oxoid), the Pastorex <e>Staph</e> Plus test (Bio-Rad), the Slidex Staph-Kit and Slidex Staph Plus test (bioMérieux), the Staphaurex Plus test (Remel) and the Staphylase Test (Oxoid) were used. As determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, 52 distinct MRSA strains from five countries, 83 MSSA strains and 150 coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. Species identification and determination of susceptibility patterns were performed using colony morphology, Gram stain, catalase testing, tube coagulase testing, DNase testing, mannitol fermentation, susceptibility testing towards oxacillin by Etest, coagulase gene PCR, fibrinogen receptor gene PCR and PCR of the mecA gene. Sensitivity of the agglutination tests ranged from 82.7 to 100.0 % for MRSA strains and 92.8 to 100.0 % for MSSA strains, respectively. Specificity of the test systems ranged from 91.3 to 99.1 %. None of the six agglutination assays produced correct reactions for all staphylococci tested. Only the Dry Spot Staphytect Plus test correctly identified all 52 MRSA strains. For the other tests kits, sensitivity of MRSA detection was lower than for MSSA isolates. Depending upon the local MRSA prevalence and the parameter of interest (sensitivity or specificity), these test systems may be useful for routine diagnostic purposes.",M1

Forty-seven Holstein-Friesian heifers were randomly assigned to one of four groups such that Group 1 (n=11) received a three-isolate experimental bacterin, Group 2 (n=11) received a five-isolate experimental bacterin, Group 3 (n=14) received Lysigin, and Group 4 (n=11) served as unvaccinated controls. Vaccinations were administered twice 28 d apart in late gestation. All groups were challenged with a heterologous strain of Staph. aureus (ATCC 29740) on days 6, 7, and 8 of lactation. Mastitis score, somatic cell count (SCC), milk culture yield, and total daily milk yield data were collected before and after challenge. All 47 cattle developed a Staph. aureus IMI post-challenge with three animals in Group 1 and one animal in Group 3 clearing their Staph. aureus IMI by the end of the study. However, there was no evidence of a difference between vaccinates and control with regard to Staph. aureus clearance rates post-challenge (P&gt; or =0.214). Cattle vaccinated with Lysigin had a lower mean duration of clinical mastitis and lower total mastitis score post-challenge than controls (P=0.045 and P=0.046, respectively). Overall, there was no evidence that any of the vaccinated groups had a lower mean SCC than control (P&gt; or =0.148) for the tested study days. Likewise there was no evidence that vaccinates had greater milk yield than controls post-challenge (P=0.617). Hence, there was no evidence that the vaccines reliably prevented Staph. aureus IMI, but Lysigin showed benefit in reducing the clinical severity and duration of clinical disease post-challenge. Neither of the experimental bacterins appeared to perform better than Lysigin.",M1
16027214,"Evaluation of Petrifilm for the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from milk samples.Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the Petrifilm <e>Staph</e> Express Count plate (3M, Minneapolis, MN) for diagnosis of mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The objective of experiment 1 was to determine the sensitivity of Petrifilm compared with results of standard and augmented microbiological techniques, and the objective of experiment 2 was to compare microbiological results of composite and quarter milk samples processed using Petrifilm. Experiment 3 was conducted to determine the specificity of the Petrifilm method based on different interpretation parameters, and the objective of experiment 4 was to determine the repeatability of reading Petrifilm Staph Express plates. Results of standard microbiological techniques used for experiments 1 and 2 were compared with results of samples preprocessed using centrifugation or preincubation. The prevalence of recovery of Staph. aureus from milk samples processed using Petrifilm was significantly greater than the prevalence of milk samples processed using standard microbiological techniques. The sensitivity of isolation of Staph. aureus was 65.6, 75.0, 84.4, and 87.5% for standard, centrifugation, incubation, and Petrifilm methods, respectively. The occurrence of a distinct pink zone surrounding a colony was highly specific for Staph. aureus, and the specificity was 98.5 and 96.0% for experiments 3 and 4, respectively. The use of a weak pink zone to diagnose Staph. aureus resulted in a high rate of false-positive results. The interpretation of results of Petrifilm Staph Express was associated with the person that read the plates. Results from all 4 experiments indicate potential for the Petrifilm products as a diagnostic tool in some herd situations when Staph. aureus is the pathogen of interest. Results also indicate the need for standardization of interpretive criteria for personnel working with the products.",M1
16011521,"Pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein D expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. In vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. The aim of the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine SP-D (pSP-D) in the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. Furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among pSP-D, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. Lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by <e>Staph</e>. aureus or Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. By comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse pSP-D immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of pSP-D was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. Co-localization of pSP-D, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and pSP-D showed a patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. SP-D immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. The dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. Increased expression of pSP-D in the surfactant coincided with presence of pSP-D-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), indicating a possible transport of pSP-D through the specialized M cells overlying (BALT). In conclusion, we have shown that pSP-D expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and with dendritic cells in microbial-induced BALT. The function of the interaction between pSP-D and dendritic cells in BALT remain unclear, but pSP-D could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in BALT.",M1
15947848,"Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus introduced into intensive care units of a University Hospital.Staphylococcus aureus is one of the principal human pathogens that colonize healthy individuals in the community in general, and it is responsible for severe infections in hospitalized patients. Due to an increase in the prevalence of strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), combating these microorganisms has become increasingly difficult. A descriptive study was carried out on 231 patients in intensive care at the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital (HUOC) in Recife, Brazil between January and April 2003 to determine the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA and to evaluate risk factors for colonization by these bacteria when introduced into Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Body secretions were collected from the nostrils, axillary and perineal regions, and from broken skin lesions, of all patients during the first 48 hours following admission to the ICU. Samples were inoculated into blood agar and mannitol-salt-agar culture medium and identified by Gram staining, and by coagulase, DNAse and agglutination (Slidex <e>Staph</e> Test) tests. Growth in Mueller-Hinton agar with 4% sodium chloride and 6 mg/L oxacillin was used to identify MRSA. In addition, the latex agglutination test was performed to identify penicillin-binding protein, PBP 2A. The prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA was 87/231 (37.7%) and 30/231 (12.98%), respectively. There was no association between any risk factor studied (age, sex, origin of the patient--whether hospital or community, previous hospitalization, use of current or previous antibiotic therapy, corticotherapy and/or immunotherapy, reason for hospitalization and place of hospitalization) and the presence of S. aureus. However, a significant association was established between previous hospitalization and the presence of MRSA (RR:1.85; CI:1.00-3.41; p=0.041). The nostrils were the principal site of colonization by both S. aureus (80.4%) and MRSA (26.4%), followed by the perineal area, with rates of 27.6% and 12.6%, respectively. If only the nostrils had been investigated, the study would have failed to diagnose 17 patients (19.5%) as carriers of the pathogen into the ICU, thus contributing towards cross-dissemination.",M1
15911671,"Infection of the surgical site after arthroplasty of the hip.We wished to estimate the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI) after total hip replacement (THR) and hemiarthroplasty and its strength of association with major risk factors. The SSI surveillance service prospectively gathered clinical, operative and infection data on inpatients from 102 hospitals in England during a four-year period. The overall incidence of SSI was 2.23% for 16,291 THRs, 4.97% for 5769 hemiarthroplasty procedures, 3.68% for 2550 revision THRs and 7.6% for 198 revision hemiarthroplasties. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 50% of SSIs; 59% of these isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). In the single variable analysis of THRs, age, female gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, body mass index, trauma, duration of operation and pre-operative stay were significantly associated with the risk of SSI (p &lt; 0.05). For hemiarthroplasty, the ASA score and age were significant factors. In revision THRs male gender, ASA score, trauma, wound class, duration of operation and pre-operative stay were significant risk factors. The median time to detection of SSI was eight days for superficial incisional, 11 days for deep incisional and 11 days for joint/bone infections. For each procedure the mean length of stay doubled for patients with SSI. The multivariate analysis identified age group, trauma, duration of operation and ASA score as significant, independent risk factors for SSI. There was significant interhospital variation in the rates of SSI. MRSA was the most common pathogen to cause SSI in hip arthroplasty, especially in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty, but coagulase-negative <e>Staph</e>. aureus may be more important in deep infections involving the joint.",M1
15909684,"Staphylococcus aureus leucocidin, a virulence factor in bovine mastitis.The involvement of Staphylococcus aureus exosecretions in bovine udder infection (Younis et al. 2003) suggests that four different monomer protein bands appearing between 36 and 31 kDa, are associated with the severity of the cow's infection response. Three out of these four bands have been identified by means of protein sequencing. Band B, with a MW of 35 kDa was identified as Panton-Valentaine leucocidin LukF'-PV chain- <e>Staph</e>. aureus; band C, with a MW of 32 kDa was identified as leucocidin chain LukM precursor- Staph. aureus; and band D was found to be similar, but not identical, to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase-C-X. Bands B and C were purified by gel filtration using FPLC. The ability of these proteins to induce udder inflammation in vivo, and proliferation response in vitro and cytokine secretion were tested for both the crude exosecretions and purified bands. Three cows were inoculated intracisternally, with three quarters receiving either 0.007-0.008 mg (as total proteins) of Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion, pooled fraction 39-41 (bands B and C), or culture broth medium. The fourth quarter was left free as a control. Quarters that received fraction 39-41 of Staph. aureus FR2449/1, exhibited induced inflammation, which was indicated by increased somatic cell count and enhanced NAGase activity that was significantly higher than that of the original Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion. Proliferation tests of bovine blood lymphocytes in vitro showed that the pooled fraction 39-41 stimulated bovine proliferation of mononuclear cells much more than the original Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion. Secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 was in accordance with the contents of LukF'-PV and LukM precursor in the exosecretions. The results suggest that LukM/ LukF' induce inflammation into the udder by a mechanism similar to that of LPS or by a unique mechanism(s) which requires further investigation.",M1
15909681,"The lantibiotic lacticin 3147 produced in a milk-based medium improves the efficacy of a bismuth-based teat seal in cattle deliberately infected with Staphylococcus aureus.A preparation of the bacteriocin lacticin 3147 (prepared from a demineralized whey protein fermentation liquor) was combined as a powder with a bismuth-based intramammary teat seal and evaluated for its potential as an antimicrobial in non-lactating cows. The lacticin/teat seal formulation enabled significant bacteriocin release from the seal without the requirement for a surfactant. Studies in vivo in lactating cows demonstrated that this formulation was effective in reducing bacterial recoveries (approximately 20-fold) from teats deliberately inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus after infusion. Moreover, this formulation also significantly reduced the numbers of <e>Staph</e>. aureus recovered from teats that were exposed to the challenge bacterium before the infusion of the teat seal preparation. The powdered preparation of lacticin 3147 did, however, cause some teat irritation as evidenced by associated rises in somatic cell count (SCC). However, this effect was short-lived and when the mean SCC readings pre-infusion and the final two readings post-infusion were compared, there was no significant difference in the immunological acceptance between treatments.",M1
15899769,"BBL CHROMagar <e>Staph</e> aureus is superior to mannitol salt for detection of Staphylococcus aureus in complex mixed infections.We used 200 sputum specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis to evaluate BBL CHROMagar Staph aureus medium (CSA; BD Diagnostics, Spark, MD). Samples were inoculated to CSA, trypticase soy blood agar (BA), and Mannitol Salt (MS; BD Diagnostics). After 18 hours of incubation, CSA detected 39 (78%) of 50 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) samples; BA detected 30 (60%); and MS detected 29 (58%). Sensitivity after overnight incubation (at least 18 hours) was 82% for CSA, 72% for BA, and 71% for MS. At 2 days, CSA detected 48 (96%) of the SA. There were 2 false-positive results on CSA (99% specificity). There were 4 (8%) minor and no major or very major discrepancies between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results for isolates grown on CSA and those grown on BA. Even at early reading times, CSA was superior to conventional media for detection of SA in these very complex cultures. MICs from all SA samples can be reported 24 hours sooner, and an additional BA subculture is not needed.",M1
15877608,"A Staphylococcus aureus mouse keratitis topical infection model: cytokine balance in different strains of mice.Staphylococcus is a leading cause of the potentially blinding disease microbial keratitis. Even with the use of antibiotic therapy, the host inflammatory response continues to damage the cornea, which may lead to blindness. Manipulation of the host response may help improve patient outcome from this devastating disease. We aim to understand the contribution of the host response to Staphylococcus aureus infection. A S. aureus keratitis mouse model was developed in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice using two different strains of S. aureus (8325-4 and <e>Staph</e> 38). Twenty-four hours postinfection, mice were killed and eyes were harvested for enumeration of bacteria, polymorphonuclear leucocytes, chemokines and cytokines. The laboratory strain 8325-4 was not as virulent as the clinical isolate Staph 38. In vitro data showed a 250-fold increase in invasion of human corneal epithelial cells by Staph 38 compared to 8325-4. BALB/c mice were susceptible to S. aureus infection whereas C57BL/6 mice were resistant. The resistant C57BL/6 mice were polarized towards a Th2 response, which may be protective for these mice. IL-4, IL-10 and IL-6 were elevated significantly in C57BL/6 mice infected with Staph 38 (P &lt; 0.05). Macrophage inflammatory peptide (MIP)-2 was also significantly elevated in C57BL/6 mice (P &lt; 0.001). The susceptible BALB/c mice had a muted cytokine response, which suggests that S. aureus might be 'walled off' during infection and might avoid host defences. IL-4, IL-10 and IL-6 cytokines may be protective during Gram-positive corneal infection and therefore may be useful for adjunct therapies in the treatment of this disease.",M1
15723819,"The role of the print media in informing the community about safety in public hospitals in Victoria, Australia: the case of  golden <e>staph</e> .OBJECTIVE: In this article the authors explore how the print media contribute to information and education of the community on issues of safety and quality in the health services, since this is an important avenue of such information and education for many members of the community. STUDY DESIGN: The authors undertook a qualitative study of a random sample of articles in the Australian print press between 1996 and 2004 where  golden staph  was presented as a major issue of risk to the safety of consumers of health services. The content of each article was examined with reference to several criteria including title, the source of the article, and the metaphorical language employed by the journalist. RESULTS: Results show that while the articles are substantially accurate as sources of information on concrete events, they do not serve as sources of education on issues of safety, typically apportioning blame and serving to maintain the status quo. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that print media are not a good source of community education in areas of safety and quality and do not assist members of the community to participate in addressing issues of safety in health services.",M1
15483155,"Neutrophils in the war against Staphylococcus aureus: predator-prey models to the rescue.To address the question of whether a minimum concentration of blood neutrophils is necessary to decrease Staphylococcus aureus concentration in mastitic milk, literature was searched for studies in which neutrophils were incubated with <e>Staph</e>. aureus. Different mathematical models that describe the changes in Staph. aureus population as a function of neutrophilic concentrations were applied to the collected data. The best fitted model established (1) that the rate of bacterial killing depended on the ratio of neutrophils to bacteria with neutrophilic attack rate accelerating at first before decelerating as the ratio increases, and (2) that neutrophil concentration should be within a limited range to trigger a decline in the bacterial population. Outcomes of this model are supported by what is known about neutrophilic functions and laboratory findings in bovine and human neutrophils. These results may be of assistance in setting selection goals for a better resilience to Staph. aureus mastitis in dairy cattle. Indeed, an optimal neutrophilic concentration appears to exist for successful clearance of Staph. aureus infection, which is neither the lowest nor the highest one.",M1
15377615,"Effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on milk yield in dairy cows.Our objective was to estimate the effects of the first occurrence of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM) on milk yield in 3071 dairy cows in 2 New York State farms. The pathogens studied were Streptococcus spp.,Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, other pathogens grouped together, and  no pathogen isolated.  Data were collected from October 1999 to July 2001. Milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of CM and were sent to the Quality Milk Production Services laboratory at Cornell University for microbiological culture. The SAS statistical procedure PROC MIXED, with an autoregressive covariance structure, was used to quantify the effect of CM and several other control variables (herd, calving season, parity, month of lactation, J-5 vaccination status, and other diseases) on weekly milk yield. Separate models were fitted for primipara and multipara, because of the different shapes of their lactation curves. To observe effects of mastitis, milk weights were divided into several periods both pre- and postdiagnosis, according to when they were measured in relation to disease occurrence. Another category contained cows without the type of CM being modeled. Because all pathogens were modeled simultaneously, a control cow was one without CM. Among primipara, <e>Staph</e>. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and  no pathogen isolated  caused the greatest losses. Milk yield generally began to drop 1 or 2 wk before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. Mastitic cows often never recovered their potential yield. Among older cows, Streptococcus spp., Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. caused the most significant losses. Many multipara that developed CM were actually higher producers before diagnosis than their nonmastitic herd-mates. As in primipara, milk yield in multipara often began to decline shortly before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. Milk loss persisted until at least 70 d after diagnosis for Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and A. pyogenes. The tendency for higher producing cows to contract CM may mask its impact on cow health and production. These findings provide dairy producers with more information on which pathogen-specific CM cases should receive treatment and how to manage these cows, thereby reducing CM impact on cow well being and profitability.",M1
15328260,"Efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.Little research has focused on treatment of cows with subclinical mastitis during lactation. Ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. Ceftiofur should be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. Holstein and Jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. Cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts &gt;400,000/mL and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. Cows with one or more intramammary infections (IMI) were blocked by parity and DIM and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 IMI), 5-d (n = 41 IMI), and 8-d (n = 38 IMI) treatment regimens. For all groups, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. Eighteen cows with 38 IMI were included as an untreated negative control group. A bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at 14 and 28 d after the last treatment. Efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical IMI was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively. Four of 38 (10.5%) IMI in control cows were cured spontaneously without treatment. All 3 ceftiofur treatment regimens were significantly better than the negative control, and the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen treatment group was significantly better than the standard 2-d treatment group. Pathogen groups had significantly different cure rates from one another. The cure rate for the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen was 70% for Corynebacterium bovis, 86% for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, 36% for <e>Staph</e>. aureus, 80% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae, and 67% for Strep. uberis.",M1
15313528,"Optimal detection of Staphylococcus aureus from clinical specimens using a new chromogenic medium.The new chromogenic medium CHROMagar <e>Staph</e> aureus (CASA) was evaluated for its ability to detect and presumptively identify Staphylococcus aureus. Nine hundred forty-two clinical specimens (742 wound, 200 sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage) were cultured on CASA, tryptic soy blood agar (TSBA), and mannitol salt agar (MSA). Of the 153 S. aureus isolates from wounds on any media, 151 grew on CASA and TSBA and 146 on MSA. Sensitivity after 24 hours was 93.5%, 94%, and 77%, respectively, and increased after 48 hours to 99% for CASA and TSBA and to 95% for MSA. Of the 41 isolates recovered from sputum and lavage, all grew on CASA, 27 on TSBA, and 36 on MSA. Sensitivity after 24 hours was 93%, 66%, and 81%, respectively, and 100%, 66%, and 88% after 48 hours. All specimens revealed 99% sensitivity for CASA, 92% for TSBA, and 94% for MSA. Specificity for CASA was 100%. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed full agreement between isolates from CASA and from reference media. In conclusion, CASA has a high sensitivity and can identify isolates undetected on conventional media (p value for CASA vs. TSBA was 0.001 and vs. MSA, 0.006). This difference is particularly notable when mixed flora are present. The simplicity of the colony recognition increased the medium specificity, allowing a reliable and rapid method for the detection of S. aureus on the primary plate.",M1
15290974,"Somatic cell count distributions during lactation predict clinical mastitis.This research investigated somatic cell count (SCC) records during lactation, with the purpose of identifying distribution characteristics (mean and measures of variation) that were most closely associated with clinical mastitis. Three separate data sets were used, one containing quarter SCC (n = 1444) and two containing cow SCC (n = 933 and 11,825). Clinical mastitis was defined as a binary outcome, present or absent, for each lactation, and SCC were log (base 10) transformed. A generalized linear mixed model within a Bayesian framework was used for analysis. Parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Gibbs sampling. Results from the 3 data sets were similar. Increased maximum and standard deviation log SCC during lactation, rather than increased geometric mean, were the best overall indicators of clinical mastitis. Distributions of SCC were also investigated separately for different mastitis pathogens. Increased maximum log SCC was associated with clinical mastitis caused by all pathogen types. Increased standard deviation log SCC was associated with Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis clinical mastitis and increased coefficient of variation log SCC (standard deviation divided by mean) was associated with Escherichia coli clinical mastitis. Increased geometric mean lactation SCC was associated with an increased risk of <e>Staph</e>. aureus clinical mastitis but a reduced risk of E. coli clinical mastitis. Our results suggest that using measures of variation and maximum cow SCC would enhance the accuracy of predicting clinical mastitis, compared with geometric mean SCC, and therefore improve genetic programs that aim to select for clinical mastitis resistance. The results are also consistent with low SCC increasing susceptibility to some mastitis pathogens.",M1
15259232,"Short communication: influence of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection on serum copper, zinc, and iron concentrations.The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in serum trace mineral concentrations in cattle with experimentally induced Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. Nine primiparous Holstein-Friesian cattle were challenged with approximately 150 cfu of <e>Staph</e>. aureus ATCC29740 by intramammary infusion on d 6, 7, and 8 of lactation. Serum Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations were determined immediately before and at 24, 48, and 72 h after the final intramammary infusion of Staph. aureus. Infection status (cfu/mL of Staph. aureus), milk somatic cell count, and mastitis score were also determined at these times. Infection resulted in a decrease in mean serum Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations to 89, 83, and 81% of preinfection concentrations at 24 h postchallenge. One-way analysis of variance for repeated measures demonstrated a significant change in serum zinc concentration. The reductions in trace mineral concentrations were of less magnitude than observed following experimental E. coli mastitis.",M1
15217174,"Retropharyngeal space infection.Retropharyngeal space infections are relatively rare since the widespread use of modern antibiotics. In children, retropharyngeal space infections usually occur following an upper respiratory tract infection, while in adults they are usually caused by trauma, foreign bodies or extension from adjacent spaces. The authors reviewed 12 patients with retropharyngeal space infection between July 1996 and June 2002. Age, sex, duration of symptoms and hospitalization time, clinical presentation, etiology, underlying disease, bacteriology, treatment and complications were analyzed. Widening of the prevertebral soft tissue as seen on a plain film of the lateral neck was the most important diagnostic tool. Fever was the most common symptom (91.6%) and showed a high prevalence in adult populations (66.6%). Half of the cases were caused by ingestion of a foreign body. Nine cases underwent surgical drainage which was positive in eight cases (88.8%). <e>Staph</e>. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter species were the predominant pathogens.

15131155,"Specific identification of Staphylococcus aureus by Staphychrom II, a rapid chromogenic staphylocoagulase test.We compared the performance of Staphychrom II (International Microbio, Signes, France), a rapid (2-h) chromogenic staphylocoagulase test that uses human prothrombin and protease inhibitors, with those of the reference tube coagulase test (TCT) and the latex agglutination test (LAT) Slidex <e>Staph</e> Plus for the rapid identification of S. aureus. Prospective evaluation with 293 fresh clinical isolates yielded sensitivities, specificities, and predictive and negative predictive values of 98.1, 100, 100, and 95.1%, respectively, for the Staphychrom II test; 98.6, 98.7, 99.6, and 96.3%, respectively, for LAT; and 97.6, 98.7, 99.5, and 93.9%, respectively, for TCT. The perfect specificity of the Staphychrom II test was confirmed by testing 193 collection strains selected because of their potential testing pitfalls.

15130145,"Occurrence and clonal relatedness of sec/tst-gene positive Staphylococcus aureus isolates of quartermilk samples of cows suffering from mastitis.AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of sec/tst-gene positive Staphylococcus aureus in bovine mastitis and to get information about the clonal relatedness of these clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 533 <e>Staph</e>. aureus strains isolated from bovine mastitic quartermilk samples at 493 randomized dairy farms in Hessia, Germany, from January 1997 until June 1998 were examined for enterotoxin C (sec) gene and toxic shock syndrome toxin (tst) gene by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-three (9.3%) of the strains were sec/tst-gene positive. Phenotypic TSST-1 production was found in all positive strains by reversed passive latex agglutination test. With DNA macrorestriction analysis, sec/tst-gene positive strains were divided into five different macrorestriction types. Type I (10 isolates) and III (40 isolates) were found to be the predominant types in terms of frequency of isolation in the investigated area. These DNA macrorestriction types differed in only two bands in the 500 and 270 bp region. CONCLUSIONS: Closely related Staph. aureus strains seem to be responsible for an unusual large proportion of bovine mastitis cases in geographically widely distinct locations.

Identification results were concordant with those of the ID 32 <e>STAPH</e> system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) for 100% of S. aureus (223/223) and 97.4% (263/270) of CoNS isolates. For S. aureus isolates, Phoenix oxacillin-susceptibility results fully concurred with those of mecA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (reference method): 96 mecA-positive isolates identified as resistant, 127 mecA-negative strains as susceptible. Two of the 210 mecA-positive CoNS isolates were misclassified as susceptible by the Phoenix (sensitivity 99%, positive predictive value 97.6%).

14765830,"Effects of an automatic postmilking teat dipping system on new intramammary infections and iodine in milk.A technology of automatically applying a postmilking teat dip via the milking machine prior to machine detachment was compared to manual postmilking teat dipping with a teat dip cup for effects on new IMI and iodine content in milk. One hundred twenty Holstein cows were experimentally challenged in a 22-wk trial with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and 148 Holstein cows were experimentally challenged with Streptococcus uberis in another 22-wk trial. The bacterial suspensions were applied to teats of all of the cows after premilking udder preparation and immediately prior to milking machine attachment. In both trials, cows were divided among four treatments: no postmilking teat dipping; manual postmilking teat dipping with a proven efficacious iodophor teat dip; manual postmilking teat dipping with an iodophor teat dip formulated for an automatic postmilking teat dipping system; and automatically postmilking teat dipping via milking machines with an iodophor teat dip formulated for the automatic postmilking teat dipping system. The postmilking teat dipping treatments reduced new <e>Staph</e>. aureus IMI by 64.5, 76.5, and 88.2%; new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 61.5, 77.8, and 94.4%; and new Strep. uberis IMI by 63.5, 82.5, and 93.8%, respectively, against the treatment of no postmilking teat dipping. The treatment applying the postmilking teat dip automatically via milking machines had the lowest number of new IMI caused by the three pathogens. Teat end and teat skin condition were characterized as normal at the end of the study with no differences between treatments. There were no differences with regard to iodine content in milk between treatments.",M1

14662963,"Evaluation of S. aureus ID, a new chromogenic agar medium for detection of Staphylococcus aureus.S. aureus ID (bioMérieux, La Balme Les Grottes, France) is a new chromogenic agar medium designed to enable the isolation of staphylococci and the specific identification of Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus produces green colonies on this medium due to production of alpha-glucosidase. To evaluate this medium, a total of 350 wound swabs were cultured onto S. aureus ID, CHROMagar <e>Staph</e>. aureus, and conventional media routinely used in our laboratory. After 18 to 20 h of incubation, 96.8% of strains formed green colonies on S. aureus ID compared with 91.1% of strains forming mauve colonies on CHROMagar Staph. aureus. A total of 94.3% of strains were recovered within 18 to 20 h with conventional media. The sensitivity was increased after 48 h of incubation to 98.7, 96.2, and 95.6% with S. aureus ID, CHROMagar Staph. aureus, and conventional media, respectively. A total of 97.4% of green colonies on S. aureus ID were confirmed as S. aureus compared with 94.4% of mauve colonies on CHROMagar Staph. aureus.

14602604,"Methicillin (Oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from major food animals and their potential transmission to humans.From May 2001 to April 2003, various types of specimens from cattle, pigs, and chickens were collected and examined for the presence of methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). S. aureus was isolated and positively identified by using Gram staining, colony morphology, tests for coagulase and urease activities, and an API <e>Staph</e> Ident system. Among 1,913 specimens collected from the animals, 421 contained S. aureus; of these, 28 contained S. aureus resistant to concentrations of oxacillin higher than 2 micro g/ml. Isolates from 15 of the 28 specimens were positive by PCR for the mecA gene. Of the 15 mecA-positive MRSA isolates, 12 were from dairy cows and 3 were from chickens. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of mecA-positive MRSA strains were performed by the disk diffusion method. All isolates were resistant to members of the penicillin family, such as ampicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin. All isolates were also susceptible to amikacin, vancomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. To determine molecular epidemiological relatedness of these 15 animal MRSA isolates to isolates from humans, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns were generated by arbitrarily primed PCR. The RAPD patterns of six of the isolates from animals were identical to the patterns of certain isolates from humans. The antibiotypes of the six animal isolates revealed types similar to those of the human isolates. These data suggested that the genomes of the six animal MRSA isolates were very closely related to those of some human MRSA isolates and were a possible source of human infections caused by consuming contaminated food products made from these animals.",M1
14574603,"Overwhelming septic infection with a multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) after total knee replacement.INTRODUCTION: The incidence of early deep infection after arthroplasty of the knee is very low but could represent a serious future problem. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors report on a 71-year-old woman with gonarthritis who was supplied with a total knee endoprosthesis and developed a local infection followed by septic shock. RESULTS: The infection was evidently caused by a multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (<e>Staph</e>. aureus). The primary clinical signs closely resembled a necrotizing fasciitis. Systemic and local application of vancomycin led to an improvement of the symptoms at secondary sites, but only the amputation of the primarily infected leg was lifesaving. CONCLUSION: In order to prevent such events, the authors recommend a number of additional presurgical measures. Firstly, a swab from the nose and throat should be taken prior to an elective surgery in patients with elevated risk of immunodeficiency, for example in patients with diabetes. The diabetes should be adequately treated before an elective operation is undertaken. Secondly, an early punction of the knee joint should be carried out if there is any doubt regarding inflammation. Isolated infectious agents should be grounds for early revision, which should always be completed with a rinsing procedure and with adequate antibiotics. Immunotherapy should be taken into consideration. Antiepidemic measures are recommended in cases with known Staph. aureus.",M1
14528456,"A new model of implant-related osteomyelitis in rats.Infection related to osteosynthesis often has dramatic consequences for the patient. Prolonged hospitalization with systemic antibiotic therapy, several revision procedures, possible amputation, and even death may occur. To investigate the pathology of infection in orthopedic surgery, a new rat model of implant related osteomyelitis was developed. Three different concentrations (10(6), 10(3), and 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/10 microl) of Staphylococcus aureus were inoculated into the tibial medullary cavity with simultaneous insertion of a titanium Kirschner wire. Controls received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Each group consisted of 10 animals. Animals were followed for 4 weeks until sacrifice. X-rays of the tibiae were taken weekly, blood counts were analyzed, and body temperature and weight were determined. After sacrifice, infection was evaluated by histological and microbiological investigations. All animals inoculated with <e>Staph</e>. aureus in either concentration developed microbiological, histological, and radiological signs of osteomyelitis in correlation to the amount of inoculated bacteria. X-rays clearly revealed osseous destruction after 14 days with progression of osteomyelitis during the following weeks. CFU/g bone and bone weight after sacrifice showed dependence on the amount of inoculated CFU. The histological results confirmed the radiological findings. No significant changes in blood counts, body weight, and body temperature between the groups could be observed. The results demonstrate that it is possible to develop a model of implant-related osteomyelitis in rats with dependence on the amount of inoculated bacteria. No other promoters of infection besides intramedullary insertion of titanium Kirschner wires were used in this model.",M1
12931819,"Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus. A mechanism for the indolence of osteomyelitis.Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial pathogen which is responsible for approximately 80% of all cases of human osteomyelitis. It can invade and remain within osteoblasts. The fate of intracellular <e>Staph</e>. aureus after the death of the osteoblast has not been documented. We exposed human osteoblasts to Staph. aureus. After infection, the osteoblasts were either lysed with Triton X-100 or trypsinised. The bacteria released from both the trypsinised and lysed osteoblasts were cultured and counted. Colonies of the recovered bacteria were then introduced to additional cultures of human osteoblasts. The number of intracellular Staph. aureus recovered from the two techniques was equivalent. Staph. aureus recovered from time zero and 24 hours after infection, followed by lysis/trypsinisation, were capable of invading a second culture of human osteoblasts. Our findings indicate that dead or dying osteoblasts are capable of releasing viable Staph. aureus and that Staph. aureus released from dying or dead osteoblasts is capable of reinfecting human osteoblasts in culture.",M1

A total of 42 paired milk line and bulk tank samples were collected at separate milking events from 21 different herds. Concordance correlation coefficients showed a high level of agreement between the two sample types, with values ranging between 0.74 and 0.99 for all parameters and bacterial species measured. ANOVA showed that SCC and bacterial culture results for Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus non-agalactiae, Coliforms, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were neither numerically or statistically different between milk line and bulk tank samples. KAPPA analysis showed that overall agreement beyond chance between milk line and bulk tank samples in determining whether a herd was positive or negative for either Strep. agalactiae or <e>Staph</e>. aureus were 100 and 75%, respectively. While further research is needed to fully assess the utility of this tool for the purpose of bacterial culture, the results of this study suggest that the strategy of milk line sampling is a very promising monitoring tool.

20383373,"MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry speciation of staphylococci and their discrimination from micrococci isolated from indoor air of schoolrooms.The focus of our work is the identification of medically relevant staphylococci from the environment; these organisms are among the major opportunistic pathogens associated with human disease. Andersen sampling was performed in schoolrooms during the school year. Eleven of thirty six isolates (all Gram-positive tetrads) were identified as staphylococci and 23 were characterized as micrococci. MALDI-TOF MS profiling was used as the first stage in the classification followed by standard biochemical tests including API <e>Staph</e> profiling. The staphylococcal isolates were each speciated; coagulase positive (Staphylococcus aureus [3 strains]) and coagulase negative: Staphylococcus warneri (4 isolates), Staphylococcus hominis (2), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1) and Staphylococcus cohnii (1). S. aureus is most commonly found in the human nares but is frequently isolated from skin. The other staphylococcal species are among those most commonly isolated from human skin. Micrococci were much more frequently isolated from indoor air than reported by others for clinical samples. It is suggested that, without discrimination from micrococci, misidentification of staphylococci would be common on air sampling.",M2
19244465,"Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the community.Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a rare cause of severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, often causes superficial skin infections similar to Staphylococcus aureus infections. We initiated a study to optimize the identification methods in the routine laboratory, followed by a population-based epidemiologic analysis of patients infected with S. lugdunensis in Viborg County, Denmark. Recognition of a characteristic Eikenella corrodens-like odor on Columbia sheep blood agar combined with colony pleomorphism and prominent beta-hemolysis after 2 days of incubation, confirmed by API-ID-32 <e>Staph</e>, led to an 11-fold increase in the detection of S. lugdunensis. By these methods we found 491 S. lugdunensis infections in 4 years, corresponding to an incidence of 53 per 100,000 per year, an increase from 5 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the preceding years. Seventy-five percent of the cases were found in general practice; these were dominated by skin abscesses (36%), wound infections (25%), and paronychias (13%). Fifty-six percent of the infections occurred below the waist, and toes were the most frequently infected site (21%). Only 3% of the patients suffered from severe invasive infections. The median age was 52 years, and the male/female ratio was 0.69. Our study shows that S. lugdunensis is a common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) and is probably underrated by many laboratories. S. lugdunensis should be accepted as a significant pathogen in SSTI and should be looked for in all routine bacteriological examinations, and clinicians should be acquainted with the name and the pathology of the bacterium.",M2
19121234,"Effect of bovine lactoferrin on the internalization of coagulase-negative staphylococci into bovine mammary epithelial cells under in-vitro conditions.Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have emerged as bovine mastitis pathogens in many countries. CNS mastitis is generally mild but can persist in the udder for long periods. Pathogenesis of CNS intramammary infection is not well understood. In the present study, adhesion, invasion and intracellular replication of twenty-two CNS strains isolated from bovine mastitis and the effect of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) on the internalization were studied in vitro in a bovine mammary epithelial (BME) cell model. The CNS strains were of Staphylococcus chromogenes, <e>Staph</e>. simulans, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. cohnii urealyticus; two strains of Staph. aureus were used as controls. Seven of the CNS strains originated from persistent and five from transient mastitis infections. The in-vitro susceptibility of the strains to bLf was also investigated. All CNS species examined had an adhesive ability equal to that of Staph. aureus, but internalization varied among staphylococcal strains. The antagonistic effect of bLf on the adhesion and invasion of CNS strains was weak, but bLf significantly decreased intracellular replication and replication rates of CNS. No correlation between the in-vitro susceptibility of the strain to bLf or internalization among clinical signs of mastitis was established. No difference between the persistent and transient CNS strains in adhesion, invasion or replication rate was recorded. This in-vitro BME cell model can be used to study the virulence potential of mastitis pathogens, although the severity and persistence of eventual infections shall be further investigated in vivo. The role of bLf in intramammary infection caused by CNS may be limited.",M2
18556995,"Prosthetic vascular conduit in contaminated fields: a new technology to decrease ePTFE infections.Vascular reconstruction using prosthetic materials in contaminated fields can lead to infection, graft loss, and subsequent amputation. We hypothesized that minocycline and rifampin bound to an ePTFE graft using a unique methacrylate technology would provide for resistance from infection and controlled antibiotic elution. Kirby Bauer susceptibility testing was performed on plates overlaid with <e>Staph</e> aureus (SA) and Staph epidermidis (SE) using 6 mm diameter discs of uncoated graft or antibiotic coated graft (ABX). Zones of inhibition (ZIH) were determined after 24 hours. ABX grafts were then placed in a continuous water bath and a recirculating, pulsatile flow device. Susceptibility testing and high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy was performed to determine graft performance and antibiotic elution rate. ABX grafts had an average ZIH of 35 mm for SA and 44 mm for SE (each P &lt; 0.0001). After the 1 week water bath, the ZIH of the ABX grafts was 23 mm on both the SA and SE plates. The high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy revealed that after 24 hours, 50 per cent of the antibiotics remained on the graft, and there was a sustained elution for 7 days. Minocycline and rifampin can be bound to ePTFE vascular grafts using a unique methacrylate method. In vitro, the grafts provide a slow elution of antibiotics that provide resistance from infection by SA and SE for up to 2 weeks after graft insertion.",M2
18541166,"Differentiation of Staphylococci from Iberian dry fermented sausages by protein fingerprinting.The Staphylococci populations in different types of Iberian dry fermented sausages from central-west Spain were identified. A simple electrophoretic method of whole-cell proteins and extracellular protein profiling was evaluated for speed of identification. This study was correlated with a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and biochemical identification by API <e>Staph</e>. A total of 81 isolates were identified by SDS-PAGE of the whole-cell proteins. These showed stable profiles in the range 99-14kDa that were clearly different for the different species, and were grouped into clusters together with the profiles of the eight reference strains. SDS-PAGE of the extracellular protein extracts provided additional characteristic banding patterns for the characterization of the Staphylococcus species present. The whole-cell SDS-PAGE showed that the predominant species was Staphylococcus saprophyticus (61.7%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.7%). The identifications were confirmed by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and by a BLAST search of the GenBank database. However, the API Staph biochemical identifications were frequently erroneous at the species level. In sum, SDS-PAGE analysis showed itself to be rapid and accurate in identifying the most commonly encountered Staphylococcus isolates in dry fermented sausages.",M2
18487673,"Pathogen-specific effects of quantitative trait loci affecting clinical mastitis and somatic cell count in Danish Holstein cattle.The aim of this study was to investigate whether quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the risk of clinical mastitis (CM) and QTL affecting somatic cell score (SCS) exhibit pathogen-specific effects on the incidence of mastitis. Bacteriological data on mastitis pathogens were used to investigate pathogen specificity of QTL affecting treatments of mastitis in first parity (CM1), second parity (CM2), and third parity (CM3), and QTL affecting SCS. The 5 most common mastitis pathogens in the Danish dairy population were analyzed: Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis. Data were analyzed using 2 approaches: an independence test and a generalized linear mixed model. Three different data sets were used to investigate the effect of data sampling: all samples, only samples that were followed by antibiotic treatment, and samples from first-crop daughters only. The results showed with high certainty that 2 QTL affecting SCS exhibited pathogen specificity against <e>Staph</e>. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The latter result might be explained by a pleiotropic QTL that also affects CM2 and CM3. Less certain results were found for QTL affecting CM. A QTL affecting CM1 was found to be specific against Strep. dysgalactiae and Staph. aureus, a QTL affecting CM2 was found to be specific against E. coli, and finally a QTL affecting CM3 was found to be specific against Staph. aureus. None of the QTL analyzed was found to be specific against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Strep. uberis. Our results show that particular mastitis QTL are highly likely to exhibit pathogen-specificity. However, the results should be interpreted carefully because the results are sensitive to the sampling method and method of analysis. Field data were used in this study. These kind of data may be heavily biased because there is no standard procedure for collecting milk samples for bacteriological analysis in Denmark. Furthermore, using only the mean SCS from d 10 to 180 after parturition may lead to truncated effects of SCS-QTL when samples collected after d 180 are used. Additionally, repeated samples were used, which could boost the difference in incidence of pathogens between daughters of sires inheriting the positive and negative QTL allele, respectively. However, the magnitude of these effects in this study is unclear.",M2

However, none of these 12 isolates were recognized by a S. lugdunensis translation elongation factor Tu (tuf) gene-specific probe. Under the API <e>STAPH</e> V4.0 identification system (bioMérieux, Durham, NC), 8 of these 12 isolates could not be identified with low discrimination scores, and 4 were identified as Kocuria varians/rosea with identification probabilities that ranged from 95.5% to 99.6%. All 12 isolates possessed identical partial 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the full 16S rRNA gene sequences of the prototype strain B006 were closely related to a tentatively assigned  Staphylococcus pettenkoferi . All 12 isolates had identical partial tuf gene sequences corresponding to 666 to 858 nucleotide positions, and the 1188-base pair full tuf sequences of B006 strain were mostly related to 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates with a 93.02% similarity.

19738354,"Characterization of Staphylococcus species isolated from raw milk and milk products (lben and jben) in North Morocco.BACKGROUND: To investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of staphylococcal strains isolated from milk and milk products and to trace the ecological origin of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated. METHODOLOGY: Eighty-one samples of raw milk, lben (whey) and jben (cheese) were analyzed for the presence of staphylococcal strains. Isolates were identified by Gram stains, tests for coagulase, the API <e>staph</e> system and the WalkAway 40/96, which also determines the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. The S. aureus strains were biotyped, and variable regions of the coagulase gene were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The identification results showed a predominance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (54 %). Coagulase-positive staphylococci that were identified were divided into 3 groups comprising S. aureus (40%), Staphylococcus intermedius (2 %) and Staphylococcus hyicus (4%). Among the S. aureus that was isolated, biotype C was the predominant biotype. Among 40 coagulase gene PCR-amplification products, 37 produced a single band, while 3 isolates produced two bands. The antimicrobial susceptibility-profile of the staphylococcal strains revealed a high incidence of S. aureus to penicillin G. In addition, Staphylococcus lentus presented considerable resistance to the oxacillin, erythromycin and lincomycin. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of staphylococci in raw milk, lben and jben in areas of northern Morocco poses a health hazard, so it is necessary for the public health inspectors to properly examine the conditions during production, storage and commercialization of all products made with unpasteurized milk.",M2
17887985,"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a histidine decarboxylase from Staphylococcus capitis.AIMS: Histamine intoxication is probably the best known toxicological problem of food-borne disease. A histamine-producing Staphylococcus capitis strain has been isolated from a cured meat product. The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into the genetic determinants for histamine production in <e>Staph</e>. capitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence of a 6446-bp chromosomal DNA fragment containing the hdcA gene encoding histidine decarboxylase (HDC) has been determined in Staph. capitis IFIJ12. This DNA fragment contains five complete and two partial open reading frames. Putative functions have been assigned to gene products by sequence comparison with proteins included in the databases. The hdcA gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli resulting in HDC activity. The presence of a functional promoter (Phdc) located upstream of hdcA has been demonstrated. Insertion of the histamine biosynthetic locus in Staph. capitis seems to be associated with a noticeable genome reorganization. CONCLUSIONS: Among the staphylococcal species analysed in this study only Staph. capitis strains produce histamine. The hdcA gene cloned from Staph. capitis encodes a functional HDC that produce histamine from the amino acid histidine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The identification of the DNA region involved in histamine production in Staph. capitis will allow further work in order to avoid histamine production in foods.",M2

Slime production was detected both by the conventional Christensen's method as well as by the Congo red agar method. Seventy-two strains of staphylococci isolates (38.5%) were found to be slime producers by Christensen's test tube method whereas 58 strains (31%) were slime positive with Congo red agar method. There was no statistically significant difference between the two methods for the detection of slime production (P &gt; 0.05). Susceptibility of isolates against antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method. Staphylococcal species had resistance to one or more antibiotics. Among the various antimicrobial agents, oxacillin (71.1%) and erythromycin (47.1%) showed higher resistance than most of the agents used against all isolates. Oxacillin resistant S. aureus (ORSA) and oxacillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (ORCNS), 97 (75.2%) and 36 (62.1%) respectively were frequently observed in strains isolated from clinical materials. Among the ORSA strains, two strains were resistant to vancomycin. Moreover, 96 (74.4%) of 129 S. aureus strains were positive for beta-lactamase enzyme.

17227599,"Effect of subclinical intramammary infection on somatic cell counts and chemical composition of goats' milk.We investigated effects of subclinical intramammary infection (IMI) on milk somatic cell count (SCC) and milk composition in udder halves of dairy goats. A total of 35 mixed-age Alpine does (70 udder halves; approximately 55 kg body weight) were rotationally grazed on a mixture of vegetative forages (wheat/berseem clover, sudan grass and cowpeas). Milk samples for bacterial analysis and SCC were collected monthly from both halves from April to September, 2001. Across stages of lactation, 19-31% of udder halves became infected. The prevalence of IMI exhibited quadratic patterns through multi-peaked responses within each stage of lactation. Higher rates of IMI were observed during the early stage of lactation (19% in May) and in the late stage of lactation (31% in September). Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS, 43.7%), <e>Staph</e>. aureus (35.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.4%) were the most prevalent pathogens. Within single-strain IMI, log SCC (6.24) was lower (P&lt;0.01) for CNS than those derived from IMI by Staph. aureus (6.49), Ps. aeruginosa (6.53) or Serratia spp. (6.90). Infected udder halves had a higher average SCC (4761 v. 2259 x 10(3) cells/ml; P&lt;0.01) than uninfected halves, but uninfected halves often had similar levels of SCC to infected halves. Daily average milk production was not significantly different between infected and non-infected goats and the relationship between IMI and SCC was not always correlated. Effective mastitis screening requires bacteriological culture since SCC was not highly correlated.",M2
17045110,"DNA fingerprinting of a multi-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from biomaterials in dialysis services.BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen isolated in hospital. Several species of CoNS have been implicated in human infections and disease especially in patients with poor health status. METHODS: A total of 71 clinical strains of CoNS were isolated from dialysis fluid and needles in a dialysis unit and characterized. Susceptibility to antibiotics, biofilm production and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were achieved. RESULTS: The main isolated CoNS strains were Staphylococcus epidermidis (45%), Staphylococcus hominis (14%) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (12.7%). The susceptibility profile of all strains revealed high resistance level to penicillin and oxacillin. PCR detection of oxacillin resistance gene (mecA gene) revealed a higher percentage of positive strains than the classic test (ATB <e>Staph</e>). Slime production test was positive in 60.6% of CoNS strains. PFGE analysis showed the presence of 69 restriction profiles clustered in 56 patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Profiles of all isolates were generally heterogeneous, suggesting independent circulation with some evidence of cross-transmission.",M2
16978429,"Growth and colour development of some surface ripening bacteria with Debaryomyces hansenii on aseptic cheese curd.The growth of five bacteria isolated from red-smear cheeses, Brevibacterium aurantiacum, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, Microbacterium gubbeenense and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in mixed cultures with Debaryomyces hansenii on aseptic model cheese curd at 10 and 14 degrees C was investigated. At both temperatures, C. casei and Micro. gubbeenense had a longer lag phase than C. variabile, Brevi. aurantiacum and <e>Staph</e>. saprophyticus. In all cultures, lactose was utilised first and was consumed more rapidly at 14 degrees C than at 10 degrees C, i.e., 6 d at 14 degrees C and 10 d at 10 degrees C. This utilisation coincided with the exponential growth of Deb. hansenii on the cheese surface. Lactate was also used as a carbon source and was totally consumed after 21 d at 14 degrees C and approximately 90% was consumed after 21 d at 10 degrees C regardless of the ripening culture. Small differences (&lt;0.5 pH unit) in the surface-pH during ripening were noticeable between ripening cultures. Differences in the colour development of the mixed cultures with the yeast control were only noticeable after 15 d for Brevi. aurantiacum and after 21 d for the other bacteria. Regardless of the organisms tested, colour development and colour intensity were also greater at 14 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. This study has provided useful information on the growth and contribution to colour development of these bacteria on cheese.",M2
16965378,"Comparison of two commercial methods with PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism of the tuf gene in the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.AIMS: Two commercial methods for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were compared with the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplified tuf gene, which served as the reference method. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five CNS were evaluated using the API 32 <e>Staph</e> ID and the Crystal GP/ID BBL systems. The PCR-RFLP of the tuf gene served as the reference method. The APIStaph and the GP/ID BBL had an overall rate of agreement with the molecular method of 58.6% and 46.2% respectively, with the inability of the GP/ID BBL to characterize 11.7% of the isolates. The APIStaph showed higher sensitivity and better agreement than the GP/ID BBL with the PCR-RFLP, except for Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus capitis. CONCLUSIONS: Neither of the commercial systems was as reliable as the PCR-RFLP method for identifying isolates of CNS. Overall the APIStaph had better agreement with the PCR-RFLP than the GP/ID system. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicate that the PCR-RFLP method is more reliable than the two commercial systems tested, suggesting that it is more reliable for routinely identifying CNS.",M2
16834723,"Isolation from poultry litter and characterization [corrected] of Staphylococcus spp. capable of growth in high phosphate conditions [corrected]AIMS: To isolate and characterize micro-organisms from poultry litter capable of growing under phosphate concentrations typical of poultry litter. METHODS AND RESULTS: Poultry litter extracts were plated onto brain-heart infusion medium (BHI) containing an additional 0.75 mol l(-1) phosphate (BHI-P). Colonies were screened for the presence of inclusion granules with five being selected for further study. All strains displayed identical biochemical characteristics consistent with Staphylococcus spp. and grouped with Staphylococcus spp. by comparative 16S rDNA analysis. Thus all five strains were identified as such. All strains displayed elevated intracellular phosphate levels when cultured in BHI-P broth (0.417-0.600 microg phosphate mg(-1) protein) vs BHI broth (0.075-0.093 microg phosphate mg(-1) protein). When grown using an austere semi-defined medium or BHI-P, <e>Staph</e>. sp. #7 displayed similar elevated intracellular phosphate levels compared with growth in BHI. CONCLUSIONS: Poultry litter contains novel Staphylococcus spp. capable of robust growth when exposed to phosphate levels comparable with that typically found in poultry litter. Data suggest intracellular phosphate levels in these strains increase in response to increasing phosphate in the medium or austere medium conditions. Intracellular phosphate did not reach levels comparable with known hyper-accumulating micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data suggest poultry litter possesses a resident microflora that thrives and accumulates intracellular phosphate in response to high phosphate conditions.",M2

16507696,"Milk culture results in a large Norwegian survey--effects of season, parity, days in milk, resistance, and clustering.A nationwide random computerized assignment survey that included 3,538 sets of 4 quarter milk samples from 2,834 dairy cows was conducted during 2000. Every fifth cow from every 50th herd was randomly selected for sampling and culture during each quarter of the year. Milk culture results of pathogens known to be related to mastitis were recorded regardless of whether mastitis had been indicated by any inflammatory measure or not. Farmers were blinded to all test results to minimize any potential interventions that might be prompted by the results. The most prevalent isolate was Staphylococcus aureus, which was identified in 8.2% of the quarter milk samples. More than 15 colony-forming units/0.01 mL of <e>Staph</e>. aureus were found in 4.3% of the quarter milk samples, whereas 3.5% had only 1 to 3 colony-forming units/0.01 mL. Streptococcus dysgalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and Streptococcus uberis were isolated from 1.2, 3.3, and 0.4% of quarter milk samples, respectively. No isolates were found in 76.6% of the quarter milk samples tested. Among individual cows, 22.2% had an isolate of Staph. aureus in &gt; or = 1 quarter. Only Strep. dysgalactiae exhibited a higher prevalence with increased parity. Prevalence of Staph. aureus decreased throughout days in milk, but prevalence of Strep. dysgalactiae increased. There was a strong seasonal effect; the highest prevalence of Strep. dysgalactiae and CNS was observed during April and May (late indoor season), and the highest prevalence of Staph. aureus and Strep. uberis was observed during June and July (the outdoor season). A substantial within-cow clustering effect was found for Strep. dysgalactiae, Staph. aureus, and CNS. Additionally, a within-herd effect was found for Strep. uberis, penicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, total Staph. aureus, and CNS. No within-county cluster effect was found. Lastly, both Staph. aureus and CNS exhibited a surprisingly high seasonal effect regarding the prevalence of resistance to penicillin G. Penicillin resistance of Staph. aureus was likely due to higher prevalence of Staph. aureus as a whole, but for CNS, there was also an additional increase caused by a higher proportional rate of penicillin resistance during the late indoor season.",M2
15872257,"Comparison of genotypic and phenotypic methods for species-level identification of clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci.To compare commonly used phenotypic methods with genotypic identification methods 47 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), 10 CONS ATCC strains, and a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate were identified using the API <e>Staph</e> ID test, BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System, and 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing. When necessary part of the sodA gene was sequenced for definitive identification. The results show that tuf gene sequencing is the best method for identification of CONS, but the API Staph ID test is a reasonably reliable phenotypic alternative. The performance of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System for identification of CONS is poor. The present study also showed that although genotypic methods are clearly superior to phenotypic identifications, a drawback of sequence-based genotypic methods may be a lack of quality of deposited sequences in data banks. In particular, 16S rRNA gene sequencing suffers from the lack of high quality among sequences deposited in GenBank. Furthermore, genotypic identification based on 16S rRNA sequences has limited discriminating power for closely related Staphylococcus species. We propose partial sequencing of the tuf gene as a reliable and reproducible method for identification of CONS species.",M2
15761602,"Comparison of methods for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species identification is still difficult for most clinical laboratories. The scheme proposed by Kloos and Schleifer and modified by Bannerman is the reference method used for the identification of staphylococcal species and subspecies; however, this method is relatively laborious for routine use since it requires the utilization of a large number of biochemical tests. The objective of the present study was to compare four methods, i.e., the reference method, the API <e>Staph</e> system (bioMérieux) and two methods modified from the reference method in our laboratory (simplified method and disk method), in the identification of 100 CNS strains. Compared to the reference method, the simplified method and disk method correctly identified 100 and 99% of the CNS species, respectively, while this rate was 84% for the API Staph system. Inaccurate identification by the API Staph method was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), S. hominis (25%), S. haemolyticus (37.5%), and S. warneri (47.1%). The simplified method using the simple identification scheme proposed in the present study was found to be efficient for all strains tested, with 100% sensitivity and specificity and proved to be available alternative for the identification of staphylococci, offering, higher reliability and lower cost than the currently available commercial systems. This method would be very useful in clinical microbiology laboratory, especially in places with limited resources.",M2
15715714,"Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis by automated ribotyping.As routine identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci is problematic, the performance of automated ribotyping was evaluated for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis. In total, 177 isolates were tested, comprising 149 isolates from blood samples, 15 isolates that were not identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-PCR in a previous study, and 13 reference strains. The identification results were compared with those obtained by the API 20 <e>Staph</e> system, with standard phenotypic and molecular methods as reference. Most (n = 166; 93.8%) isolates were identified correctly by automated ribotyping. For 61 isolates, API 20 Staph and ribotyping were in agreement, but for 105 isolates, ribotyping provided correct identification and API 20 Staph did not. Four isolates not identified by automated ribotyping were recognised correctly by API 20 Staph. The remaining seven isolates could not be identified by either of the two methods. Automated ribotyping was able to distinguish Staphylococcus capitis reliably from Staphylococcus caprae. The results demonstrate the value of automated ribotyping for identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) isolates from human sources and may help to clarify the clinical relevance of CoNS species. In addition, automated ribotyping was able to detect polymorphisms that may be useful for epidemiological purposes within S. capitis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, S. caprae, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus schleiferi, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus pasteuri and Staphylococcus xylosus.",M2
15508648,"Development of a PCR test to differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius.The presence of Staphylococcus intermedius in food remains unclear because routine laboratory analysis does not discriminate between S. intermedius and Staphylococcus aureus, a major cause of food poisoning. Both species share many phenotypic characteristics, including coagulase and thermonuclease production. In both species, some strains can produce enterotoxin and therefore can be the cause of food poisoning outbreaks. Although the ID32 <e>Staph</e> System (bioMérieux, SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France), based on a miniaturized phenotypic characterization, gives satisfactory results for discriminating between these two species, some rapid molecular PCR-based methods have been developed to identify S. aureus specifically, but they do not identify S. intermedius. Here, we developed a rapid, accurate, and discriminative multiplex PCR method that targets species-specific sequences in the nuc gene, which encodes thermonuclease in the two species. The test includes an internal positive control that targets a highly conserved region of 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA). A total of 116 strains were used to validate our test. The test gave no signal on the following Staphylococcus species: S. epidermidis, S. chromogenes, S. hyicus, S. warneri, S. xylosus, S. lentus, and S. sciuri. It allowed a 100% successful discrimination between S. aureus (44 strains tested) and S. intermedius (57 strains) isolated from different origins.",M2
15453485,"Influence of prepartum pirlimycin hydrochloride or penicillin-novobiocin therapy on mastitis in heifers during early lactation.A study was conducted in 2 dairy research herds to determine whether prepartum therapy of heifer mammary glands with penicillin-novobiocin or pirlimycin hydrochloride was effective for reducing the percentage of heifers and mammary quarters infected with mastitis pathogens during early lactation. Almost 96% of Jersey heifers (67 of 70) and 71.3% of quarters (199 of 279) were infected 14 d before expected calving. Of the quarters infected at 14 d before expected parturition, 75% (54 of 72) were uninfected following treatment with penicillin-novobiocin; 87% (61 of 70) were uninfected following treatment with pirlimycin, and 56% (32 of 57) were uninfected in the untreated negative control group. The majority of intramammary infections in Jersey heifers were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (61%), Streptococcus species, primarily Streptococcus uberis (19%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). Almost 73% of Holstein heifers (40 of 55) and 34.3% of mammary quarters (73 of 213) were infected 14 d before expected calving. Of the quarters infected at 14 d before expected parturition, 76% (19 of 25) were uninfected following treatment with penicillin-novobiocin; 59% (17 of 29) were uninfected following treatment with pirlimycin, and 26% (5 of 19) were uninfected in the untreated negative control group. The majority of intramammary infections in Holstein heifers were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (44%) and <e>Staph</e>. aureus (30%). In both herds, the bacteriological cure rate was significantly higher in heifer mammary glands treated with penicillin-novobiocin or pirlimycin hydrochloride than in untreated controls. Prepartum therapy of heifer mammary glands with penicillin-novobiocin or pirlimycin hydrochloride significantly reduced the percentage of heifers and quarters infected with mastitis pathogens during early lactation.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: A multiplex PCR employing specific primers for each of the genes encoding four different exfoliative toxins was developed and evaluated using a collection of Staph. hyicus with known toxin type and a number of other staphylococcal species. A total of 314 Staph. hyicus isolates from pigs with EE were screened by multiplex PCR and the combined results of the present and previous investigations showed that ExhA, ExhB, ExhC and ExhD was found in 20, 33, 18 and 22%, respectively, of 60 cases of EE investigated. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided a new tool for detection of toxigenic Staph. hyicus and a more comprehensive picture of the prevalence of the Staph. hyicus exfoliative toxins in Danish pig herds.

15046310,"Molecular identification and differentiation of Staphylococcus species and strains of cheese origin.Amplified Ribosomal-DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) was used to differentiate among 12 species and 4 subspecies of the genus Staphylococcus. With a universal primer pair a 2.4 kbp PCR-product was amplified, including the 16S rDNA, the 16S-23S rDNA interspacer region, and about 500 bp of the 23S rDNA. Species-specific restriction patterns were found using the restriction enzymes HindIII and XmnI separately. Cheese related staphylococci were clearly differentiated. ARDRA results were in good agreement with results of partial sequencing of the 16S rDNA. ARDRA could fully replace the biochemical identification with ID32 <e>Staph</e> (BioMerieux) which was less reliable when staphylococci of cheese origin were analysed. Genomic restriction digests of cheese-related S. equorum strains by SmaI and SacI gave unique strain-specific restriction patterns which can be used to identify starter staphylococci in a complex microbial environment such as the surface of Red-Smear cheeses.",M2
14672176,"Results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination in Wisconsin from 1994 to 2001.The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 1994 and 2001. Results (n = 83,650) of microbiological testing of milk samples (n = 77,172) submitted to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from January 1994 until June 2001 were analyzed. Submissions included milk samples obtained from cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as samples obtained for mastitis surveillance programs. Results were recorded as no growth, contaminated, or identified as specific bacterial pathogens. Statistical analysis was performed to determine trends in the isolation of mastitis pathogens. The proportion of samples identified as contaminated decreased from 20.6 (1997) to 9.5% (2001). The proportion of samples coded as no growth increased from 22.6 (1994) to 49.7% (2001). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 17.7% (1994) of isolates to 9.7% (2001), while isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased from 8.1 (1994) to 3.0% (2001). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 12.7 to 17.5%, environmental Streptococcus spp. were isolated from 11.6 to 20.1%, and Escherichia coli were isolated from 3.1 to 6.7% of all isolates. No growth and contaminated samples comprised almost 50% of total submissions, and it is important that producers have proper expectations when submitting milk samples. The proportion of isolates identified as <e>Staph</e>. aureus and Strep. agalactiae decreased, suggesting the proportion of contagious bacteria causing mastitis has decreased. Environmental and contagious pathogens demonstrated characteristic differences by season.",M2
14500019,"Development of specific PCR primers for a rapid and accurate identification of Staphylococcus xylosus, a species used in food fermentation.Twenty-seven Staphylococcus strains isolated from food and food environments were assigned to Staphylococcus xylosus by API-<e>Staph</e> system. But only seven isolates had similar patterns to this species when compared to the pulse-field gel electrophoresis patterns of 12 S. xylosus strains. To perform a rapid identification of the S. xylosus species, a random amplified polymorphic DNA product of 539-bp shared by all of the S. xylosus strains was used to design a pair of primers. These primers were species-specific for S. xylosus when tested by PCR on 21 staphylococci species. This specific PCR assay confirms the identification of the seven isolates identified by PFGE to S. xylosus. In conclusion, we developed specific PCR primers for a rapid and accurate identification of the S. xylosus species.",M2
12958254,"Use of the VITEK 2 system for rapid identification of clinical isolates of Staphylococci from bloodstream infections.Staphylococci are an increasing cause of bloodstream infections. Rapid reliable identification of these organisms is essential for accurate diagnosis and prompt effective treatment. We evaluated the ability of the VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Inc, Hazelwood, Mo.) to identify these organisms rapidly and accurately. A total of 405 clinically relevant nonduplicate staphylococcal isolates (Staphylococcus aureus, n = 130; coagulase-negative staphylococci, n = 275) collected from blood cultures were tested. VITEK 2 results were considered correct when they were identical to those furnished by the comparison method based on the ID 32 <e>STAPH</e> system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) plus supplementary manual testing. When discrepancies occurred, isolate identity was verified by molecular typing. The VITEK 2 correctly identified 387 (95.6%) isolates at the species level: 379 (including all but one [99.2%] of 130 S. aureus isolates and 249 of 275 [90.5%] coagulase-negative isolates) were identified by the automated reading; for the other eight, supplemental tests suggested by the manufacturer had to be used. Only one strain (0.2%) was misidentified (Staphylococcus hominis as Staphylococcus epidermidis), and four (1%), all S. epidermidis, were not identified. For the remaining 13 strains (including 10 S. hominis), the VITEK 2 system was unable to discriminate among two species, and no supplemental tests were suggested for conclusive identification. Over 90% of results were obtained within 4 h. These results suggest that the VITEK 2 system can provide rapid, accurate, and reliable species-level identification of staphylococci responsible for bloodstream infections, although there is room for improvement in the identification of certain coagulase-negative species, especially S. hominis.",M2
12700009,"Occurrence of resistance to antibiotics, metals, and plasmids in clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp.BACKGROUND: Presence of staphylococci resistant to antibiotics is of concern, as is the possible spread of resistance determinants among Staphylococcus species. During the past several years, a series of staphylococcal isolates that demonstrated reduced susceptibility to vancomycin or other glycopeptides has been reported. However, there are no useful data on species sensitivity of coagulase-negative staphylococci to heavy metals. METHODS: A total of 22 Staphylococcus spp. isolates recovered from clinical sources was studied for antibiotic and heavy metal resistance patterns and plasmid profiles. Isolated strains were biochemically identified by conventional tests followed by use of API <e>Staph</e> system. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by standard methods. Resistance patterns to nickel chloride (NiCl(2)), zinc sulfate (ZnSO(4)), lead acetate Pb(CH(3)COO)(2), cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), copper sulfate (CuSO(4)), potassium chromate (K(2)Cr(2)O(7)), silver nitrate (AgNO(3)), and mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) were surveyed by agar-dilution method. Plasmid DNA was prepared according to a previously described modification of alkaline lysis procedure. RESULTS: In this study, isolated strains included eight (36.4%) Staphylococcus xylosus, five (22.7%) Staphylococcus aureus, four (18.2%) nonidentifiable Staphylococcus spp., one (4.5%) Staphylococcus capitis, one (4.5%) Staphylococcus lentus, one (4.5%) Staphylococcus epidermidis, one (4.5%) Staphylococcus sciuri, and one (4.5%) Staphylococcus chromogenes. All strains showed widest resistance profile to both antibiotics and metals. Methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 40%. Resistance to oxacillin was 53% in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains. No isolate was resistant to vancomycin. All isolates were resistant to K(2)Cr(2)O(7) and Pb(CH(3)COO)(2); on the other hand, all isolates were sensitive to AgNO(3). Highest incidence of metal-antibiotic multiple resistance existed between K(2)Cr(2)O(7), Pb(CH(3)COO)(2), and penicillin-G. Plasmid content and profile studies showed that isolates carried plasmids ranging from 2.224 to 20.650 kb in size. CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent of studied strains harbored plasmids and association between occurence of plasmids and resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals was observed.",M2
12624054,"Five-test simple scheme for species-level identification of clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci.A working scheme developed in our laboratory for identification (by species group and species) of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was evaluated with 201 consecutive isolates and then validated by using the reference method of Kloos and Schleifer (W. E. Kloos and K. H. Schleifer, J. Clin. Microbiol. 1:82-88, 1975). This five-test simple scheme (referred to here as the simple scheme) combines the novobiocin susceptibility test with tests for urease, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, ornithine decarboxylase, and aerobic acid from mannose. The addition of one or two tests within a particular species group could then positively identify the isolate. Two commercial systems, <e>Staph</e>-Zym (Rosco) and API-Staph (bioMérieux), along with results obtained by using Rosco diagnostic tablets (nongrowth tests), were also compared with the reference method. One isolate could not be identified even by the reference method. Of the remaining 200 strains, 191 (95.5%) strains were correctly identified with Staph-Zym and 171 strains (85.5%) were correctly identified with API-Staph. The most frequent clinical CNS species isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (50.5%), S. haemolyticus (18.5%), S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus (16.0%), S. lugdunensis (6.0%), and S. warneri (2.5%). The simple scheme validated with the reference method has demonstrated an excellent correlation in the identification of the three most frequent species isolated: S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus. With the simple scheme, identification of CNS was possible within 24 h after the enzymatic tests were used, whereas up to 72 h is necessary for the growth tests. This methodology would be very useful in any clinical microbiology laboratory for the presumptive identification of CNS species groups and species.",M2

A total of 469 bacterial isolates of the genera Staphylococcus (275 isolates), Enterococcus (179 isolates), and Streptococcus (15 isolates, for ID only) were investigated; of these, 367 were single patient isolates, and 102 were challenge strains tested at one center. Sixty-four antimicrobial drugs were tested, including the following drug classes: aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, cephems, folate antagonists, quinolones, glycopeptides, macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS), and others. Phoenix ID results were compared to those of the laboratories' routine ID systems (API 32 <e>Staph</e>, API 32 Strep, and VITEK 2 [bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France]); Phoenix AST results were compared to those of frozen standard broth microdilution (SBM) panels according to NCCLS guidelines (NCCLS document M 100-S 9, approved standard M 7-A 4). Discrepant results were repeated in duplicate. Concordant IDs of 97.1, 98.9, and 100% were observed for staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci, respectively. For AST results the overall essential agreement was 93.3%; the category agreement was 97.3%; and the very major error rate, major error rate, and minor error rate were 1.2, 1.9, and 1.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the Phoenix ID results showed high agreement with results of the systems to which they were being compared; the AST performance was highly equivalent to that of the SBM reference method.",M2

11980942,"Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API <e>Staph</e> for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.",M2
11928962,"L-methionine degradation potentialities of cheese-ripening microorganisms.Volatile sulphur compounds are major flavouring compounds in many traditional fermented foods including cheeses. These compounds are products of the catabolism of L-methionine by cheese-ripening microorganisms. The diversity of L-methionine degradation by such microorganisms, however, remains to be characterized. The objective of this work was to compare the capacities to produce volatile sulphur compounds by five yeasts, Geotrichum candidum, Yarrowia lipolytica, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and five bacteria, Brevibacterium linens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Arthrobacter sp., Micrococcus lutens and Staphylococcus equorum of technological interest for cheese-ripening. The ability of whole cells of these microorganisms to generate volatile sulphur compounds from L-methionine was compared. The microorganisms produced a wide spectrum of sulphur compounds including methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide, dimethyltrisulfide and also S-methylthioesters, which varied in amount and type according to strain. Most of the yeasts produced methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide but did not produce S-methylthioesters, apart from G. candidum that produced S-methyl thioacetate. Bacteria, especially Arth. sp. and Brevi. linens, produced the highest amounts and the greatest variety of volatile sulphur compounds includling methanethiol, sulfides and S-methylthioesters, e.g. S-methyl thioacetate, S-methyl thiobutyrate, S-methyl thiopropionate and S-methyl thioisovalerate. Cell-free extracts of all the yeasts and bacteria were examined for the activity of enzymes possibly involved in L-methionine catabolism, i.e. L-methionine demethiolase, L-methionine aminotransferase and L-methionine deaminase. They all possessed L-methionine demethiolase activity, while some (K. lactis, Deb. hansenii, Arth. sp., <e>Staph</e>. equorum) were deficient in L-methionine aminotransferase, and none produced L-methionine deaminase. The catabolism of L-methionine in these microorganisms is discussed.",M2
11849340,"Monitoring of Staphylococcus xylosus DSM 20266 added as starter during fermentation and ripening of soppressata molisana, a typical Italian sausage.AIMS:  Soppressata molisana , a fermented sausage produced in southern Italy, is commonly obtained without starter addition. However, the use of starter cultures is more and more recommended in meat fermentation processes in order to guarantee stable production performance. In this study, the survival of the Staphylococcus xylosus DSM 20266 was evaluated during the ripening of  soppressata molisana  fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fastest method of RAPD-PCR was employed for discrimination of the added strain from those naturally present during the ripening of the  soppressata molisana . The results obtained were confirmed by analysis of the DNA macrorestriction profile by PFGE. The electrophoretic pattern of bacterial total proteins was also studied, but clear differences between the different strains could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: The RAPD technique was a valid tool for monitoring <e>Staph</e>. xylosus DSM 20266 in  sopressata molisana .

11556918,"Characterization of catalase and superoxide dismutase in Staphylococcus carnosus 833 strain.AIMS: Staphylococcus carnosus, used as starter culture in fermented meat products, decreases the level of volatiles arising from lipid oxidation. To analyse its antioxidant capacities, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: Catalase and SOD activities were measured with spectrophotometric methods and visualized on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The corresponding sod gene was identified by PCR. Southern hybridizations and enzymatic analyses showed that there was a single catalase and a single SOD in <e>Staph</e>. carnosus 833 strain. The gene encoding the Staph. carnosus SOD was found to encode a protein closely related to SOD requiring manganese. Catalase and SOD levels increased in mid-log phase. Only catalase was induced by oxygen, nitrate or nitrite while glucose induced neither enzyme. Metal ion limitation increased catalase and decreased SOD activities. CONCLUSION: Staph. carnosus synthesizes both enzymes in conditions encountered in sausage manufacturing. These results could explain the antioxidant properties of Staph. carnosus starter culture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The knowledge of the antioxidant properties of Staphylococci will allow a more rational use of these starters in meat fermented products.",M2
11436543,"Differences in functional immune responses of high vs. low hardy healthy individuals.An association between the personality trait of hardiness and immune responses was explored. Blood samples were collected from 21 healthy individuals under nonstressful conditions, who had either high or low levels of hardiness.

11298231,"Identification by 16S-23S rDNA intergenic region amplification, genotypic and phenotypic clustering of Staphylococcus xylosus strains from dry sausages.AIMS: To ascertain the identification and typing of the Gram-positive, coagulase-negative cocci present in 'Salsiccia Sotto Sugna', an Italian artisanal sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one strains were isolated and genotypically identified by amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic region with universal primers. Most isolates were identified as Staphylococcus xylosus and one strain as <e>Staph</e>. condimenti. Isolates were clustered by numerical analysis of both RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) PCR profiles and physiological characters. Genotypic clustering allowed the separation of strains showing nitrate reduction and amino acid decarboxylase activities. Phenotypic clustering distinguished strains isolated at diverse ripening stages. CONCLUSION: The predominance of Staph. xylosus in Italian dry sausages was confirmed. Genotypic similarities related to the possession of single phenotypic traits. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, a rapid method of Staphylococcus and Kocuria species distinction was proposed. The suitability of RAPD PCR to discriminate strains of Staph. xylosus with technologically relevant activities was reported.",M2
11123475,"A survey on the microbiological changes during the manufacture of dry-cured lacón, a Spanish traditional meat product.This article describes a microbiological study carried out on lacón, a dry-cured meat product made in the north-west of Spain from the fore extremity of pig. Using classical methods, aerobic mesophilic flora, salt-tolerant flora, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts were enumerated, some physicochemical parameters (pH, aw and moisture and NaCl contents) were determined and a representative number of isolates of the salt-tolerant flora (the main microbial group) were identified during the manufacture of five batches. All the microbial groups, with the exception of Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci, reached maximum counts both on the surface and in the interior of the pieces at the end of the post-salting stage and afterwards progressively dropped during the drying-ripening stage. Staphylococcus xylosus, <e>Staph</e>. saprophyticus, Staph. simulans, Staph. sciuri and Micrococcus luteus were the main species isolated throughout manufacturing.

Forty-four isolates were obtained, which represents 67.7% of samples. Coagulase-negative species were most commonly found, and the most frequently isolated staphylococcus species were <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis and Staph. aureus. Other species, such as Staph. simulans, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. saprophyticus and Staph. intermedius were also isolated. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 90.9% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. The most active antimicrobial agents against staphylococci isolated from otitis externa of dogs were rifampin and oxacillin. Multidrug resistance was a common finding, and one strain of Staph. haemolyticus species, was resistant to all tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance to three or more different drugs was a common finding, observed in 16 strains (36.4%) of both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci. This study highlights the emergence of cases of otitis externa determined by coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains and once more emphasizes the need for bacterial culture with species identification and susceptibility testing of swab specimens from the ear canal in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents.",M2

10792517,"Limitation of adhesion and growth of Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel surfaces by Staphylococcus sciuri biofilms.The adhesion and subsequent development of Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel was studied in the absence and in the presence of a Staphylococcus sciuri biofilm. In the three growth media studied, the percentage of adherent cells was reduced to nearly the same extent by the presence of 1-day biofilms of <e>Staph</e>. sciuri for the two strains of L. monocytogenes studied. One-day biofilms of Staph. sciuri exhibited the same exopolysaccharide content per square centimetre, although they colonized from 3.5 to 35% of the stainless steel depending on the growth media. This suggests that extracellular substances rather than cell-to-cell interactions were involved in the decreased adhesion. After 3 days of culture, Staphylococcus biofilms prevented the adherent L. monocytogenes population from increasing within the biofilm, leading to an average logarithmic cfu difference of 0.9-2.7 between the pure and mixed culture. A competition for nutrients by Staph. sciuri was observed in one of the three media. A role for extracellular polysaccharides produced by the Staphylococcus biofilm in preventing the adhesion of L. monocytogenes and in modifying the balance existing between its planktonic and biofilm phase is hypothesized. A higher proportion of L. monocytogenes cells was observed in the planktonic phase in mixed cultures, suggesting that the extracellular substances produced by Staph sciuri biofilms and involved in the decreased adhesion of L. monocytogenes could modify the balance existing between planktonic and biofilm populations. In addition, co-cultures of L. monocytogenes and Staph. sciuri in broth showed competition for nutrients for Staph. sciuri in one of the three media.",M2

These bacteria were initially grown together in a conventional chemostat to achieve a steady state before being inoculated into the CDFF over an 18-h period. A dilute tryptone soya broth (TSB) medium was supplied to the CDFF and the biofilm allowed to develop over a 28-d period. This mature biofilm was then subjected to increasing levels of sodium hypochlorite solution to measure any antimicrobial effect. The three organisms were seen to reach a steady state after 6 d in the chemostat before being transferred to the CDFF where the mature multispecies biofilm reached steady state at 17 d. Listeria monocytogenes in both planktonic and biofilm growth stabilized at 1. 8 and 1.5%, respectively, of the total plate counts, while Ps. fragi and <e>Staph</e>. xylosus were the predominant organisms in the biofilm at 59% and 39.5%, respectively, of the total microbial population. Steady-state biofilms in the CDFF were exposed to increasing strengths of sodium hypochlorite; 200, 500 and 1000 p.p.m. free chlorine, but a substantial two-log cycle drop in bacterial numbers was only achieved at 1000 p.p.m. free chlorine.

Twenty-four isolates hosting one of the genes qacA/qacB, smr, qacG or qacH, were subjected to species identification. Species determination was performed by biochemical analyses (API <e>STAPH</e>), comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis and tDNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism analysis. Good correlation was obtained between the different methods. The isolates belonged to six different species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The most commonly found species were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The results also indicated the possible spread of specific isolates of staphylococci which may reflect the dominance of certain strains in environments were QACs are used on a regular basis. The isolates were further characterized by the resistance phenotype to antimicrobial agents including antibiotics and disinfectants. Resistance to ampicillin, penicillin G and dyes was prevalent in strains harbouring the qacA or qacB genes, features also common among clinical staphylococci containing qacA/qacB.

Eight isolates belonging to these four species were analysed for their plasmid content. Southern blot hybridizations were performed to define the resistance determinants of the plasmids harboured by these species. These determinants were found to be carried mainly by Class I staphylococcal plasmids (1-5 kb). A plasmid (4.3 kb) carrying a tetracycline resistance gene was present in five isolates from all identified species. Plasmids carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene were more frequently encountered and found to be of different sizes. Plasmids carrying erythromycin, neomycin, and streptomycin resistance genes were less frequent and were the same size. The results indicate that the occurrence of multi-resistant CNS in polluted waters may constitute a reservoir for disseminating antibiotic-resistance into the community.",M2

A cycle of sausage production was followed collecting samples during the 2 months of ripening process. Microbiological analysis allowed the identification of the main bacterial groups responsible for the fermentation process as lactobacilli and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The use of a polymerase chain reaction-based technique of strain typing, RAPD fingerprinting, demonstrated that the environmental parameters interact to select a limited number of strains that dominate the fermentation process. The staphylococcal populations were characterized for their physiological properties and the two dominant strains were identified as Staphylococcus xylosus and <e>Staph</e>. sciuri.

The bacteria were supposed to belong to the species Staphylococcus caprae. The results obtained from the API-STAPH system showed variations in their phenotypic features. DNA cleavage with EcoRI yielded six ribotypes and three distinct patterns were generated when the DNA of the strains was digested with HindIII. Forty-six strains were correctly characterized as S. caprae by the two methods. In addition, 37 isolates having atypical biochemical profiles with the API-STAPH system were confirmed as being S. caprae by the ribotyping. Three strains remained unclassified by both methods. Ribotypes generated by HindIII were found to be the most informative for species determination, whereas the number of bands generated by EcoRI indicated the usefulness of this enzyme in S. caprae typing.",M2

The commonest C-NS species in mastitic milk of cows varies between reports, with Staphylococcus simulans (Jarp, 1991) in one and <e>Staph</e>. hyicus in another (Watts &amp; Washburn, 1991). The teat skin of heifers may be colonized by Staph. xylosus or Staph. chromogenes, while Staph. chromogenes and Staph. warneri are reported as frequent isolates from teat canals and secretion (Boddie &amp; Nickerson, 1986; White et al. 1989). Staph. haemolyticus was isolated frequently from the nares, the teat skin and the milk of goats (Valle et al. 1991), although others reported Staph. xylosus (Bedidi-Madani et al. 1992) or Staph. epidermidis and Staph. capitis (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1991) as the most predominant C-NS in goats' milk. Staph. simulans has been found experimentally to be pathogenic for the mammary gland of meat ewes (Fthenakis &amp; Jones, 1990), but little is known about the prevalence of this species in ewes' milk collected from cases of naturally occurring subclinical mastitis (SCM). The aim of the present investigation was the identification of the commonest C-NS species in ewes' milk collected from field cases of SCM or predominating in the ewes' environment.",M2
9431919,"Comparison of ATB <e>staph</e>, rapid ATB staph, Vitek, and E-test methods for detection of oxacillin heteroresistance in staphylococci possessing mecA.The performance characteristics of the E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), the ATB Staph, the Rapid ATB Staph, and the Vitek GPS-503 card (bioMérieux, La Balme Les Grottes, France) methods for the detection of oxacillin resistance in a collection of staphylococci with a high proportion of troublesome strains were evaluated. Sixty-four Staphylococcus aureus strains and 76 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were tested. All strains were mecA positive and were characterized by the oxacillin agar screen plate test; 75 (53.6%) were found to be heterogeneous by a large-inoculum oxacillin disk diffusion assay, and oxacillin MICs for 89 (63.6%) were &lt; or = 32 microg/ml. Three (4.7%) S. aureus strains and 25 (32.9%) coagulase-negative strains were classified as susceptible by the E-test, as defined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) oxacillin breakpoint (MIC &lt; or = 2 microg/ml). The ATB Staph method failed to detect oxacillin resistance in 7 (11%) S. aureus isolates and 32 (42.1%) coagulase-negative isolates. The MICs for all but six of these discrepant isolates were &lt; or = 16 microg/ml. The Rapid ATB Staph method was tested against S. aureus strains only and yielded 15 (23.4%) false-susceptible results for strains for which the MICs were &lt; or = 32 microg/ml. The Vitek system was the best-performing system, since it failed to detect oxacillin resistance in only 3 (4.7%) S. aureus strains and 15 (19.7%) coagulase-negative strains, the MICs for all of which were &lt; or = 2 microg/ml. These data indicate that (i) the performance of the two ATB Staph systems can be limited when the prevalence of borderline-heteroresistant staphylococci is high and (ii) the unreliability of the E-test and the Vitek methods for detecting resistant coagulase-negative strains might be reduced by the potential revision of the oxacillin breakpoint currently recommended by the NCCLS.",M2
9406074,"Accuracy of methods using somatic cell count and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in milk to assess the bacteriological cure of bovine clinical mastitis.This study examined the capability of milk somatic cell count (SCC) and NAGase activity to discriminate between quarters that had been cured versus those that had not been cured at 4 wk after antimicrobial therapy for clinical mastitis. The distribution of microorganisms that were isolated before therapy from 630 quarters with mastitis was as follows: 225 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 96 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 152 strains of streptococci (Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis), and 157 strains of coliform bacteria. Bacteriological cure rates were 35% for mastitis caused by <e>Staph</e>. aureus, 75% for mastitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, 66% for mastitis caused by streptococci, and 72% for mastitis caused by coliforms. Diagnostic accuracy of milk SCC and NAGase and their interquarter ratios for predicting bacteriological status of the control samples was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy and by means of receiver operating characteristic analysis. The efficiency of milk SCC and NAGase for predicting bacteriological cure was greatest for cows that had been infected with Staph. aureus. The main problem in detecting coagulase-negative staphylococci was low sensitivity, and the main problem in detecting streptococci and coliforms was low specificity. Receiver operating characteristic analysis is not completely suitable for the detection of mastitis because reference method bacteriology and indirect tests can never fully agree. To assess the recovery of cows from mastitis caused by Staph. aureus, bacteriology should be supplemented with an examination of milk SCC or NAGase activity at threshold values such as those presented here.",M2
9313367,"Characterization of the most frequently encountered Staphylococcus sp. in the rumen of deer.The total enumeration and biotyping of staphylococci isolated from the rumen content of deer is presented in this study. The total counts of staphylococcal isolates from deer reached 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml. Of 960 colonies, 904 were taxonomically identified. Coagulase-negative staphylococci mainly Staphylococcus simulans and <e>Staph</e>. xylosus were the most frequently isolated species, followed by Staph. warneri, Staph. lentus, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. hominis. Moreover, the atypical species were isolated, such as Staph. chromogenes, Staph. capitis, Staph. caseolyticus and Staph. auricularis. Except Staph. aureus, no coagulase-positive staphylococci were found. The strain identified showed high resistance to vancomycin (61.2%) and to chloramphenicol (41.9%). The resistance to erythromycin and bacitracin was demonstrated in 16.1% and 35.5% of isolates. On the other hand, 99% of isolates were sensitive to gentamycin, 96% to linkomycin, 93% to methicilin and 87% of isolates were sensitive to bacitracin and virginiamycin. The mean value of lactic acid production was 0.446 +/- 0.026 mol/l. The majority of strains belonged to ureolytic bacteria with low urease production. However, eight different species showed urease activity higher than 30 nkat/ml. No bacteriocin active strain was detected by indicator organisms used. Although the percentage of nonidentifiable strains was high (64.7%), the detection of different species improved and confirmed species variability in the rumen microbial ecosystem of deer as well as in total. Moreover, additional tests are under way, especially those regarding bacteriocin production.",M2
9058273,"Comparison of success of antibiotic therapy during lactation and results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bovine mastitis.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on a variety of mastitis pathogens. The infected quarters were subsequently treated during lactation with a commercially available product containing penicillin and novobiocin that was designed for lactating cows. Cows were treated as per the recommendations of the product manufacturer, and cures were determined by the absence of bacteria in both sets of duplicate quarter milk samples that were collected at 28 d posttreatment. Comparisons were made between the susceptibility of the bacteria and the therapeutic success or failure. All isolates tested were considered to be susceptible to the penicillin and novobiocin combination. Bacteriologic cure rates for newly acquired Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection (IMI) (&lt; 2 wk in duration) at 28 d posttreatment were 70%. Cure rates for chronic <e>Staph</e>. aureus IMI (&gt; 4 wk duration) were much lower (35%), reaffirming previous reports of the intractable nature of chronic Staph. aureus IMI. Cure rates for subclinical IMI caused by other organisms were 90% for Streptococcus agalactiae, 91% for Streptococcus uberis, 90% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 77% for other Streptococcus spp., and 71% for Staphylococcus spp. other than Staph. aureus. In vitro testing was considered to be a predictor of therapy outcome for IMI caused by Staphylococcus spp., newly acquired Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. agalactiae, but was not considered to be a useful predictor of efficacy for chronic IMI caused by Staph. aureus.",M2
9058272,"Prevalence and duration of intramammary infection in Danish heifers during the peripartum period.Milk samples were collected from 180 heifers from 20 herds around parturition to study the prevalence and persistence of intramammary infection (IMI). A total of 3382 quarter milk samples was collected each week from 4 wk before parturition to 4 wk after parturition. Staphylococcus chromogenes, the most commonly found bacterial species before parturition, was isolated from 15% of all quarters. However, IMI with <e>Staph</e>. chromogenes decreased shortly after parturition to around 1% of quarters. Infectious with Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in 1 to 3% of quarters both before and after parturition. Infections with Staph. simulans persisted in the same quarter for several weeks, but IMI with Staph. epidermidis were transient. Streptococcus dysgalactiae was isolated from 4 to 6% of quarters before and immediately after parturition, but the prevalence of IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae decreased. A strong association existed between IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae before parturition and IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae after parturition, and, using DNA typing, the persistence of 9 IMI was confirmed. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus rarely occurred before parturition, but the rate of IMI with Staph. aureus greatly increased during the 1st wk after parturition. No association was found between bacterial status before parturition and IMI with Staph. aureus after parturition. Overall, the presence of bacterial IMI in a quarter before parturition increased the risk of IMI for the lactating cow. This study demonstrated that variability in prevalence and duration of IMI according to bacterial species occurred around first parturition.",M2
8880319,"Identification and ribotyping of Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus equorum strains isolated from goat milk and cheese.Twenty-five strains of staphylococci isolated from goat milk and cheese were identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus xylosus/equorum group using the ID 32 <e>Staph</e> system (bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France). This system, however, was not able to discriminate between these two species for 19 of the strains tested. Ribotyping was performed on these 25 strains, as well as on three reference strains of each of these two species. Hybridization membranes were scanned and analyzed using the Taxotron software package (Taxolab, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). A dendrogram representation showed that ribotypes were distributed in two clear-cut clusters corresponding to S. equorum (21 strains) and S. xylosus (four strains).",M2
8737140,"Choice of a routine method for detecting methicillin-resistance in staphylococci.Four methods were compared for their abilities to detect methicillin-resistance of Staphylococcus strains using mecA gene PCR analysis in 6 h as the gold standard. 57 Staphylococcus aureus and 100 coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were evaluated by the oxacillin disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer), the automated API (ATB-plus) system (bioMérieux, La Balme les Grottes, France) in 24 h, the rapid BBL Crystal MRSA ID system (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.), the oxillin MICs using the NCCLS agar dilution method in 24 h, and the mecA gene PCR analysis. For S. aureus, the correlation was excellent between the BBL Crystal MRSA ID system and mecA gene PCR analysis (positive predictive value = 100%; negative predictive value = 97%) and oxacillin MIC (positive predictive value = 96%; negative predictive value = 96%). The correlation between BBL Crystal MRSA ID and mecA gene PCR was not reliable for CNS (negative predictive value = 68%). For CNS, the slower routine susceptibility methods to identify intrinsic methicillin-resistance were better: API ATB <e>Staph</e> has a positive predictive value = 94% and a negative predictive value = 82%, and the disc diffusion test has a positive predictive value = 95% and a negative predictive value = 74%. However, BBL Crystal MRSA ID was as reliable as some of the other methods tested for CNS after 6 h incubation when the inoculum was increased: positive predictive value = 94% and a negative predictive value = 77%. These results emphasize that genotypic detection of methicillin-resistance will undoubtedly become important to detect rapidly methicillin-resistance, especially for CNS.",M2
9005789,"[Chronic osteitis--modern therapy]The results of the clinical trials with ofloxacin in the treatment of osteitis are presented. The drug was used according to 3 regimens: 200 mg thrice a day, 200 mg twice a day and 400 mg once a day for 6 to 24 months. The disease diagnosis was based on the bacteriological investigation of the biopsy specimens and hemocultures. The isolates were shown to be susceptible to ofloxacin. The majority of the patients (78 per cent) was treated with ofloxacin after the preliminary surgical operations. The treatment was started with the ofloxacin intravenous administration in a dose of 400 mg followed by the drug oral use in the same dose once a day for at least 14 days. The most frequent causative agents were: Staphylococcus aureus (52 per cent of the cases) and <e>Staph</e>.epidermidis (13.7 per cent of the cases) which were eradicated in 91.7 and 93.9 per cent of the cases respectively when the ofloxacin MICs were 0.26 and 0.22 mg/l respectively. The number of the gram-negative isolates on the whole amounted to 72.56 per cent and that of the gram-negative isolates amounted to 27.46 per cent of all the pathogens. As for the latter Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. were the most frequent (11.14 and 5.4 per cent respectively). The eradication of the pathogens amounted to 80.6 and 94.43 per cent respectively when the drug MICs were 1.78 and 0.42 mg/l respectively. The regimen with the drug oral use in a dose of 400 mg once a day proved to be the most expedient. It provided the complete therapeutic effect, minimum cost and maximum comfort for the patients.",M2
8747728,"Microbial colonization of large wounds.This study determines the nature of microbial wound colonization in 28 patients with large burns admitted to the Burn Centre, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen. Altogether, 748 swabs were taken in 141 sampling procedures. A total of 414 microbial isolates were detected and their resistance patterns to a variety of systemic antimicrobial agents determined. The most frequent isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (21.5 per cent) and Staphylococcus aureus (14 per cent), followed by Enterococcus species (11.3 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9 per cent) and Candida species (9.7 per cent). Forty-one per cent of the enterococci and 36 per cent of the coagulase-negative staphylococci were resistant to the aminoglycosides routinely given in conjunction with surgery in our ward. Only four of the 89 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci were insensitive to methicillin, and no <e>Staph</e>. aureus were methicillin resistant. The time-related changes of burn wound colonization showed that on admission and during the first week, staphylococci and alpha-haemolytic streptococci were dominant. During the next weeks, these bacteria were gradually superceded by enterococci, gram-negative opportunists (mainly Pseud. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli) and Candida species. The nature of microbial wound colonization and how the flora changes with time should be taken into consideration by those treating thermally injured patients.",M2

No identification could be obtained for 34 strains with API Staph. Of the remaining 858 strains, identical identification was obtained with 842 (98.1%). All 707 strains identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus hominis by the API Staph system were found to be desferrioxamine susceptible, and all but 5 (3.3%) of 151 strains identified as other staphylococcal species were found to be resistant, yielding an identification correlation of 99.4% for desferrioxamine. The five additional strains which were susceptible to desferrioxamine were identified as Staphylococcus capitis (2 strains), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (2 strains), and Staphylococcus warneri (1 strain) by API Staph, and as Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 strain), Staphylococcus hominis (3 strains), and one other staphylococcal species by the experimental system.",M2

7592118,"Polar lipids of Staphylococcus strains analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.This study used fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB MS) to obtain detailed information on polar lipids of Staphylococcus by examining 23 isolates. Eighteen major anions were found in the range m/z 199-297, consistent with the presence of carboxylate anions. A further 21 major anions were found in the higher mass regions of m/z 609-805, consistent with the presence of phospholipid anions. In <e>Staph</e>. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. hominis, the most intense peaks putatively assigned as carboxylate ions were consistent with presence of C15:0, followed by C17:0 except in the case of Staph. epidermidis. The major phospholipid anions were consistent with the presence of PG(30:0), PG(32:0) and PG(33:0). It is concluded that Staphylococcus has a characteristic polar lipid profile and that qualitative and quantitative differences may be seen between Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis.",M2
7593859,"Antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from the mammary glands of dairy heifers.Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined with 1494 microorganisms isolated from the mammary glands of dairy heifers. The antimicrobial agents tested were penicillin, cloxacillin, cephapirin, ceftiofur, novobiocin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, and pirlimycin. All minimum inhibitory concentrations were expressed as micrograms per milliliter. The isolates tested included 135 Staphylococcus aureus, 1222 Staphylococcus sp., 42 Streptococcus sp., 15 Enterococcus sp., 60 enteric species, and 20 miscellaneous organisms. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates for the various antimicrobial agents with <e>Staph</e>. aureus were as follows: penicillin, .13; cloxacillin, .5; cephapirin, .5; ceftiofur, 1; novobiocin, .5; enrofloxacin, .5; erythromycin, .5, and pirlimycin, .5. In comparison, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates for the Staphylococcus sp. were 1, 1, .5, 1, .5, .5, 1, and .5 for penicillin, cloxacillin, cephapirin, ceftiofur, novobiocin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, and pirlimycin, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates for the Streptococcus sp. were 2, 32, 2, 2, 8, 1, 64, and 32 for the respective antimicrobial agents; the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates were 4, 64, 32, 64, 4, 1, 4, and 4 for the enterococci. Against the Gram-negative enteric bacilli, only ceftiofur and enrofloxacin were active; minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates were 1 microgram/ml for ceftiofur and .25 microgram/ml for enrofloxacin. Results indicated that the majority of staphylococcal strains were susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested but that antimicrobial susceptibility varied for Streptococcus sp.

The study compared the results from 1,106 cultures (500 eye cultures, 217 strains submitted for reference identification, and 389 known stock strains) representing 21 species of the family Micrococcaceae. The overall agreement of genus and species identifications was 81.1%.

7833006,"Comparison of genotypic and phenotypic methods for species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from blood cultures.Coagulase-negative staphylococci are often isolated from blood cultures. Simple methods are needed for correct identification of those species most frequently found. In this study, PCR methods were developed for the identification of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, based on DNA sequences in their 16S rDNA. The results obtained by these methods were compared with those obtained using a number of phenotypic methods, including two commercial kits API <e>Staph</e> and Staphzyme. Fifteen type collection strains and 133 blood culture isolates were tested. The sensitivity of the PCR for identification of S. epidermidis was 99% compared with API Staph, but the specificity was lower, 94%, because of positive results also for S. capitis. The results by the PCR for identification of S. haemolyticus correlated closely with the Staphzyme results, 13 isolates being identified by Staphzyme and 16 by the PCR. API Staph, however, identified only four clinical isolates as S. haemolyticus, probably too few. Among the individual phenotypic tests performed, a trehalose-mannitol agar method and a desferrioxamine disc diffusion test for the identification of S. epidermidis were found to be very accurate. Anaerobic growth after overnight incubation could be used to distinguish S. epidermidis from S. hominis.

Staphylococcus (<e>Staph</e>) species bacteria were selectively sampled by a plate-contact technique using mannitol salt medium-coated film. Staph species were isolated from the film after the number of colonies was counted, and the species were determined by the API-Staph system and coagulase test. Large numbers of S. aureus were isolated in the samples from the facial skin of patients with severe dermatitis, as previously reported. The number of S. aureus colonies in the samples from the forearm skin of the patients was significantly greater than from the healthy subjects; the mean and standard deviation of colony forming units per 10 cm2, expressed as log10 value, were 1.64 +/- 0.96 for patients and 0.02 +/- 0.07 for healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.01). One hundred and seventeen strains were isolated, and their sensitivities to ten antibiotics were tested. Ten of the strains were resistant to some antibiotics; all of these were isolated from patients. Penicillin type antibiotics had weak effects, but cephem type had strong effects. The number of S. aureus colonies isolated in this study was compared with the number isolated during the winter, in our previous study, in order to identify seasonal variations. The only significant seasonal difference was on the forearm skin of the AD patients, which had significantly more S. aureus colonies (p &lt; 0.01) in this study.

Forty-seven clinical and reference strains of Staphylococcus were tested in duplicate with each system. The <e>Staph</e>-Ident profile of test results changed for 20 strains on repeat testing, the Staph-Trac profile changed for 10 strains, and the Vitek GPI profile changed for 14 strains. The component tests of each system that were responsible for these profile changes were identified.",M2
8004048,"In vitro inhibition of some gram-positive bacteria by Staphylococci and Aerococcus viridans of porcine origin.Nine coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Aerococcus viridans were tested for bacterial antagonism. Seven of the nine of the coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Aerococcus viridans inhibited the growth of four <e>Staph</e>. hyicus, three Staph. aureus strains and some other Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus group A and D, Corynebacteria, but none of the Gram-negative and yeast was inhibited on agar media. There was also production of inhibitory substances in different types of liquid media but no antagonistic activity was observed on Millipore membrane. The inhibition was not due to the pH change of media in which the producers were grown, but due to production of inhibitory substances tentatively classed as antibiotics.",M2
7683195,"A Staphylococcus aureus-specific oligonucleotide probe derived from 16S rRNA gene sequences.Genes encoding 16S rRNA were sequenced from 16 species of Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis highlighted a potential <e>Staph</e>. aureus-specific region and a complementary oligonucleotide probe was synthesized and its specificity tested. Northern blotting indicated molecular specificity, and dot blots to RNA from Staph. aureus, Staph. capitis, Staph. caprae, Staph. carnosus, Staph. caseolyticus, Staph. cohnii, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. gallinarum, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. hominis, Staph. hyicus, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. sciuri, Staph. simulans, Staph. warneri and Staph. xylosus indicated species-specificity.",M2
1399914,"Microbiological events during commercial meat fermentations.Microbiological developments during industrial meat fermentations (salami), made with and without commercial starter cultures, were followed at two factories in Germany and Italy. In the German product microbial growth was evident only for the first 48 h, followed by a gradual decline in numbers of most micro-organisms. The pH fell from 5.8 to 4.8 in the 28 d required for production. In Italy a similar situation was seen, except that a second period of bacterial growth began around 15 d, coincident with the appearance of intentional surface mould growth which reversed the pH fall, the final pH being 6.2. The German starter culture was a mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus carnosus, whereas in Italy only <e>Staph</e>. carnosus was used. The strain of Lact. plantarum used did not grow in the German product whereas the Staph. carnosus grew well in both products to form a substantial proportion of the final microflora.",M2
1357001,"Usefulness of the ID32 <e>staph</e> system and a method based on rRNA gene restriction site polymorphism analysis for species and subspecies identification of staphylococcal clinical isolates.The usefulness of the ID32 Staph System and a method based on rRNA gene restriction site polymorphism was evaluated by the study of 42 staphylococcal clinical isolates phenotypically difficult to identify. The ID32 Staph micromethod and the genomic method are adapted for recognition of 27 and 31 staphylococcal taxa, respectively. The genomic method is based on a Dice analysis of the hybridization patterns obtained by cutting the cellular DNA either with EcoRI or with HindIII and by probing with pBA2, containing the Bacillus subtilis gene encoding 16S rRNA, labeled either with [alpha-32P]dCTP or with acetylaminofluorene. This study showed that the nonradioactive labeling provided a better resolution of the hybridizing bands than radioactive labeling. Of the 42 isolates selected, only 22 could be assigned to a staphylococcal species by the ID32 Staph System, whereas 35 could be identified by the genomic method. This latter method also enabled the screening of three unclassified isolates having hybridization patterns more closely related to each other than to any of the 31 staphylococcal taxa investigated. These three isolates could belong to a staphylococcal taxon not yet described.",M2
1516555,"[The effect of bacterial interference phenomena in experimental Staphylococcus hyicus infections of gnotobiotic piglets]The prevention of exudative epidermitis could be confirmed in experimental investigations with gnotobiotic piglets when the skin first was colonized with avirulent strains of Staphylococcus (<e>Staph</e>.) hyicus and subsequently exposed to virulent strains of Staph. hyicus. However, locally restricted cutaneous lesions in the area of application corresponding to exudative epidermitis were seen in five of nine piglets. Using the strain Staph. sciuri the spread of virulent Staph. hyicus could not be suppressed. Such infected two piglets developed generalized exudative epidermitis. In another experiment with four piglets it could be shown, that the relative protective mechanism correlating to bacterial interference on the one hand can be influenced by the virulence of causative organisms. On the other hand it even can be abolished when skin lesions are involved. For that reason probably the utilization of bacterial interference in prevention of exudative epidermitis under field conditions is considerably limited.",M2
1613781,"Ribotyping of coagulase-negative staphylococci.The discriminative capacity of ribotyping was initially assessed without knowledge of results obtained for the same isolates by use of more established typing methods. Forty-eight isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) from peritoneal fluids were studied. They were collected prospectively during 31 consecutive episodes of infection associated with peritoneal dialysis in 17 patients. DNA was digested by the restriction endonucleases EcoRI or HindIII and ribotyped by means of a biotinylated cDNA probe to 16S + 23S staphylococcal ribosomal RNA gene sequences. These methods in combination produced a total of 27 types which compared well with numbers of groups distinguished by other typing methods: limited biotype-antibiotic resistogram (ARB; 28), antibiotic resistogram alone (25), API-<e>Staph</e> (12), phage typing (9) and plasmid analysis (22). Ribotyping was highly reproducible and typed all isolates, including those that were not phage-typable (35) or did not contain plasmids (4). When used in a hierarchical manner with ARB, ribotyping results produced 13 additional types in comparison with the other three methods. When used hierarchically with all other typing systems, a further five types were found among isolates from two patients. However, some of the differences observed as a result of ribotyping could have been due to subtle changes produced by mutation, lysogenisation or gene transposition. Since the method requires additional time, expense and technical expertise, it is likely to be useful only when answers to specific epidemiological problems are required or as an initial screen before using other methods of genetic analysis.",M2
1618716,"Synthetic DNA probes for detection of genes for enterotoxins A, B, C, D, E and for TSST-1 in staphylococcal strains.A dot blot hybridization technique with oligonucleotide probes was developed for the specific detection of the TSST-1 gene and the staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes A, B, C, D and E. For each toxin gene a probe sequence was chosen from the previously determined sequence. A total of 145 staphylococcal strains (133 Staphylococcus aureus and 12 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were studied by this genotypic method and by two phenotypic assays (gel immunodiffusion and ELISA). An excellent correlation (96%) was observed between the genotypic and phenotypic assays. DNA from two CNS strains hybridized with a probe without detection of the corresponding toxin (SEB for one strain and SEC for the other strain). One <e>Staph</e>. aureus strain was shown to be an SEC producer, but was not detected by the corresponding probe. Gene probe and immunological assays seem to be complementary methods for studies of staphylococcal strains producing (or potentially producing) TSST-1 or enterotoxins.",M2
1960110,"Conversion of biological and immunological properties during a process of decapsulation in a strain of Staphylococcus hyicus.Repeated subculture at 42 degrees C of Staphylococcus hyicus strain ST67P, which exhibits streaming-type growth in a soft-agar medium, yielded three variants, ST67L, ST67S and ST67C, which had different colonial morphologies; small compact colonies possessing long and short tails and perfect compact colonies. The parent strain and ST67L respectively gave strong and weak positive intensity when stained by rabbit antisera prepared by capsular type I and II strains of <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Variant ST67L gave a positive result with antiserum prepared by capsular type I strain and no staining was observed with variants ST67S and ST67C against these antisera preparations. Strain ST67C had the lowest virulence although no remarkable difference was shown between the parent strain and variants ST67L and ST67S. The cell volume index of the parent strain was 1.35, 2.43 and 3.71 times larger than those of ST67L, ST67S and ST67C, respectively. The converting activity of rabbit anti-ST67P strain serum absorbed by strain ST67C required four times more of the organisms than strain ST67P, changing the colonial morphology of the strain from diffuse to compact type by the addition of antiserum to soft agar medium. Positive coagulase and false positive clumping factor reaction were shown in variants ST67C, but no remarkable alteration was observed with 19 biochemical properties determined by a conventional identification kit. In ulta-thin sections of the parent strain labelled with rabbit anti-strain ST67P serum conjugated with ferritin, large capsule surrounded by ferritin granules were demonstrated by electron microscopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
2055791,"In-vitro bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by oral streptococci against human carrier strains of staphylococci.All strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sanguis and Strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. Inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of <e>Staph</e>. aureus and Staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. Nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. Sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (P less than 0.001, chi 2 test and P less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. The sensitivity of nasal over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and of oral Staph. epidermidis over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. The evaluation of variability of inhibitory patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.",M2
2030097,"Expression of glycocalyx by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species isolated from bovine milk.Two hundred and six strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were assessed for expression of glycocalyx on serum soft agar, india ink and adherence techniques. The organisms were maintained on trypticase soy agar plates at 4 degrees C for 30 d (120 strains) or stored at -80 degrees C in skim milk for 90 d (60 strains). Additionally, 26 milk samples from cows known to have excreted coagulase-negative staphylococci were used to inoculate serum soft agar directly. Nine of 26 direct culture samples and 43 of 180 strains maintained for an extended period had diffuse-type growth on serum soft agar. The proportion that exhibited an unstained halo by india ink was similar regardless of storage time. Slime production determined by in vitro adherence revealed a higher proportion of positive strains than had been predicted by serum soft agar or india ink techniques. More strains of Staphylococcus chromogenes, <e>Staph</e>. epidermidis, Staph. hominis, Staph. simulans and Staph. warneri expressed glycocalyx than other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. These results suggest that most coagulase-negative staphylococci produce slime rather than a capsule. However, evidence for classical encapsulation was demonstrated in several strains by india ink. The finding that Staphylococcus species other than Staph. aureus isolated from bovine milk are capable of glycocalyx production may be of importance in investigations on the relationship between staphylococci and host defence mechanisms.",M2
1674249,"Streptomycin and tetracycline resistance plasmids in Staphylococcus hyicus and other staphylococci.Plasmids associated with resistance to streptomycin, to streptomycin plus chloramphenicol or to tetracycline in Staphylococcus hyicus isolated from the skin of pigs have been compared, by restriction endonuclease digest patterns, with similar staphylococci from human sources and with published DNA base sequences. Several plasmids from <e>Staph</e>. hyicus have proved to have a very similar structure to those described from Staph. aureus but others appeared very dissimilar. This confirms the opinion that staphylococci from animal skin share a pool of plasmids with those from human skin but may also possess some of quite different structure.",M2
1993192,"Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannitol phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli: overexpression, purification, and characterization of the enzymatically active C-terminal domain of enzyme IImtl equivalent to enzyme IIImtl.The extreme C-terminus (Ser-490 to Lys-637) of the Escherichia coli EIImtl was subcloned to test structural and mechanistic proposals about the existence of an EIII-like domain in this enzyme. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to produce a unique NcoI restriction site and, at the same time, to change Ser-490 into methionine in a flexible region in front of the proposed EIII-like domain. The 16-kDa C-terminal domain (CI) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and analyzed in vitro for catalytic activity in the presence of an EIImtl mutated at its first phosphorylation site, His-554 (EII-H554A). The results presented show that this domain can be expressed as a structurally stable, enzymatically active entity which is able to restore the PEP-dependent phosphorylation activity of the mutant EIImtl-H554A to 25% of wild-type levels. To demonstrate the EIII activity of the CI domain in a more direct way, we also substituted it for EIIImtl in the Staphylococcus carnosus system. The CI domain was active in transferring the phosphoryl group to <e>Staph</e>. carnosus EII; however, it was 6.5 times less active compared to Staph. carnosus EIIImtl itself. EIIImtl from Staph. carnosus, on the other hand, was able to substitute for the isolated C-terminal domain in the E. coli mannitol phosphorylation assay; however, it appeared to be 2 or 3 times less effective.",M2
2013835,"Adherence of coagulase-negative staphylococci onto polyethylene catheters in vitro and in vivo: a study on the influence of various plasma proteins.Bacterial adherence on PE catheters inserted into the carotid artery of rabbits was assessed at 5, 30, and 240 min after injection with bacteria of five coagulase-negative staphylococci (CN <e>Staph</e>). These studies revealed that CN Staph adhere onto PE catheters 5 min after injection with bacteria. At 240 min after injection with bacteria almost all catheters were sterile, indicating that initially adherent bacteria on PE catheters disappear with time. EM studies revealed high numbers of platelets and leukocytes and many fibrin deposits on the surface of the PE catheter. In addition, the adherence of the five test strains on PE catheters was determined in vitro. In these in vitro studies the bacteria and catheters were pretreated with either fibrinogen, fibronectin, albumin or citrated whole plasma or the liquid adherence medium was supplemented with these proteins or the adherence assay was done in citrated whole plasma. The presence of proteins in the adherence medium or pretreatment of the catheter or bacteria with either fibronectin, albumin or whole citrated plasma markedly inhibited bacterial adherence. In contrast, pretreatment of bacteria or both bacteria and catheters with fibrinogen enhanced bacterial adherence suggesting the presence of ligands for fibrinogen on the cell surface of CN Staph.",M2
1943543,"A rapid test to detect the most clinically significant Staphylococcus species.A new two-hour test system (RAPIDEC <e>staph</e>) to detect the main staphylococci was evaluated. Of 124 reference strains tested, 83 represented species most often found in clinical specimens, the remaining 41 strains representing five species primarily of animal origin. RAPIDEC staph detected all Staph, aureus, Staph. epidermidis and seven of eight Staph. saprophyticus strains. Of the animal species, all Staphylococcus intermedius strains were assigned to the correct category, the remainder were misidentified as Staph. epidermidis. With 121 catalase-positive Gram-positive cocci isolated from urines the test system correctly detected all Staph. aureus strains, 39 of 41 Staph. epidermidis, and 34 of 36 Staph. saprophyticus. Of 25 atypical Staph. aureus strains which were either slide or tube coagulase negative the test system correctly detected all 17 slide coagulase negative strains but failed to detect eight which were tube coagulase negative. There were no false positives. RAPIDEC staph is a rapid, accurate system for the detection of the three main clinically important species of staphylococci.",M2
1745563,"Susceptibility of urine isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus to antimicrobial agents.The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 10 antimicrobial agents for 96 urinary isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus cultured from symptomatic females in the Western Australian general community are reported. All antimicrobial agents tested showed good activity, with the exceptions of norfloxacin (MIC90 8 mg/L) and ampicillin (MIC90 0.5 mg/L). Eighty-three of 96 isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. One isolate was resistant to both tetracycline and trimethoprim. The remainder were resistant to a single antimicrobial agent; 10 to tetracycline and 2 to trimethoprim. None of the isolates exhibited any detectable beta-lactamase activity when tested by the chromogenic cephalosporin method.
