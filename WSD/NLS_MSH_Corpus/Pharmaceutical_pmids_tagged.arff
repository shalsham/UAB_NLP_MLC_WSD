Chromatographic separation of the two drugs was performed on a Purospher BDS C18 column (25 cm x 4.6 mm id, 5 microm particle size). The mobile phase methanol-0.01 M phosphate buffer (75 + 25, v/v), adjusted to pH 3 with glacial acetic acid, was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was performed at 227 nm. Separation was completed within 10 min. Calibration curves were linear with R2 between 0.99 to 1.0 over a concentration range of 2-10 microg/mL for cefixime trihydrate and 5-25 micromL for dicloxacillin sodium. The RSD for intraday and interday precision was &lt; 2.0%.",M1
20412630,"Lean Raman imaging for rapid assessment of homogeneity in <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulations.Solid dispersion formulations and drug in polymer matrices are increasingly being used by the pharmaceutical industry to enhance the solubility, or bio-availability, of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The degree of solubility or bio-availability enhancement, as well as properties such as chemical stability and physical characteristics, will be dependent on the homogeneity of the drug in polymer matrix. The use of Raman spectroscopy to assess homogeneity has traditionally been limited by the time required to acquire images from a statistically representative sample area. This may be overcome by employing a more rapid one-dimensional Raman line-mapping approach and using a statistical analysis to extract the critical information. This approach has been termed  lean  Raman imaging and allows a large area of sample to be probed in a relatively short space of time. This paper discusses the use of  lean  Raman imaging to assess two performance-indicating parameters of a drug in polymer formulation, sedimentation of the API within a capsule formulation and phase separation of the individual components. The development of a screening method, using Raman line mapping to allow rapid measurement of sedimentation of the API, is discussed. This method requires less than half an hour per capsule for data collection and processing. In addition, the development of a  lean  Raman mapping technique, using single line scans to assess drug and polymer domain sizes, is detailed. This technique employs a simple peak ratio approach coupled with statistical analysis to provide a measure of the degree of drug and polymer segregation without the need for acquisition of high pixel density images or multivariate analysis. The Raman mapping data is compared with both the dissolution profiles and processing parameters of the samples tested and a strong correlation is shown between formulation homogeneity and dissolution behavior.",M1
20383936,"Electrochemical study of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel and its determination using differential pulse voltammetry in bulk form and <e>pharmaceutical</e> preparations with a glassy carbon electrode.In the present study, the electroanalytical behaviour of clopidogrel (CLP) bisulfate, an antithrombotic drug, was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The anodic oxidation of clopidogrel bisulfate was investigated with a GCE to determine the oxidation conditions. The voltammograms of solutions having various concentrations of clopidogrel were recorded in order to obtain the optimum oxidation conditions of this drug on a GCE. To determine the effects of the nature of the supporting electrolyte, pH and scan rate on the anodic oxidation reactions, the experiments were performed in 0.2 M sulphuric acid, and in Britton-Robinson (BR) (pH 2-5) and acetate (pH 3.5-5.63) buffers with a 10-400 mVs(-1) scan rate interval. The oxidation of clopidogrel bisulfate was found to be diffusion-controlled over a concentration range of 0.08 mM-1.0 mM in pH 3.7 acetate buffer by an optimized DPV technique. The voltammetric method developed was applied to the tablet form of pharmaceutical preparation of this compound and the accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, repeatibility within and between days and reproducibility of the proposed method was investigated statistically. The results were compared with the spectrophotometric and HPLC methods developed in our laboratory and found to be in good agreement. No interference was observed from common pharmaceutical adjuvants.",M1
20338098,"Drug-carrying albumin film for blood-contacting biomaterials.Surface-induced thrombosis is a major complication in the development of blood-contacting medical devices. Serum albumin has the ability to bind to a wide variety of compounds, including drugs, and neither cells nor proteins adsorb to an albumin-coated surface. These properties of albumin are useful for improving the blood compatibility of biomaterial surfaces. In the present study, we prepared a water-insoluble film by cross-linking <e>pharmaceutical</e> grade recombinant human serum albumin aiming to the clinical applications, and loaded the film with a synthetic antiplatelet drug, cilostazol. The resultant film possessed native albumin characteristics such as drug binding ability and resistance to cell adhesion. Mouse fibroblast L929 cells did not adhere on the albumin film, just as they did not adhere on native albumin-coated surfaces. Furthermore, when the albumin film carrying cilostazol was placed in PBS containing Tween-80, the release of cilostazol was sustained over 144 h. The results indicate that the surface coating with thus prepared albumin film can confer the biomaterials with antithrombogenic surface by virtue of its non-adhesiveness to cells and its release of cilostazol.",M1
20188955,"Carbon paste and PVC electrodes for the flow injection potentiometric determination of dextromethorphan.The construction and performance characteristics of dextromethorphan (DXM) carbon paste (CPEs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) electrodes are described. Different modes for electrode modification, including incorporation of ion pairs (IPs), ion pairing agent or soaking the plain electrode in IPs suspension, have been used.

20152446,"Quantitative determination of oxybutynin hydrochloride by spectrophotometry, chemometry and HPTLC in presence of its degradation product and additives in different <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms.Simple, accurate, sensitive and validated UV spectrophotometric, chemometric and HPTLC-densitometric methods were developed for determination of oxybutynin hydrochloride (OX) in presence of its degradation product and additives in its pharmaceutical formulations. Method A is the first derivative of ratio spectra (DD(1)) which allows the determination of OX in presence of its degradate in pure form and tablets by measuring the peaks amplitude at 216 nm. Method B and C are principal component regression (PCR) and partial least-squares (PLS) for determination of OX in presence of its degradate in pure form, tablets and syrup. While, the developed high performance thin layer chromatography HPTLC-densitometric method was based on the separation of OX from its degradation product, methylparaben and propylparaben followed by densitometric measurement at 220 nm which allows the determination of OX in pure form, tablets and syrup. The separation was achieved using HPTLC silica gel F(254) plates and chloroform:methanol:ammonia solution:triethylamine (100:3:0.5:0.2, v/v/v/v) as the developing system. The accuracy, precision and linearity ranges of the developed methods were determined. The results obtained were statistically compared with each other and to that of a reported HPLC method, and there was no significant difference between the proposed methods and the reported method regarding both accuracy and precision.",M1
20091828,"Microstructure and elution of tetracycline from block copolymer coatings.A critical metrology issue for <e>pharmaceutical</e> industries is the application of analytical techniques for the characterization of drug delivery systems to address interrelationships between processing, structure, and drug release. In this study, cast coatings were formed from solutions of poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) (SIBS) and tetracycline in tetrahydrofuran (THF). These coatings were characterized by several imaging modalities, including time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) for chemical imaging and analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM) for determination of surface structure and morphology, and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), which was used to characterize the three-dimensional structure beneath the surface. The results showed phase separation between the drug and copolymer regions. The size of the tetracycline phase in the polymer matrix ranged from hundreds of nanometers to tens of microns, depending on coating composition. The mass of drug released was not found to be proportional to drug loading, because the size and spatial distribution of the drug phase varied with drug loading and solvent evaporation rate, which in turn affected the amount of drug released.",M1
20091823,"Varenicline L-tartrate crystal forms: characterization through crystallography, spectroscopy, and thermodynamics.This research utilized crystallographic, spectroscopic, and thermal analysis data to assess the thermodynamic stability relationship between the three known crystal forms of Varenicline L-tartrate. Of the two anhydrous forms (Forms A and B), Form B was determined to be the stable form at 0 K based on its calculated true density, hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice, and application of the IR rule. Form A has a higher melting point and higher solubility at room temperature as compared to Form B, indicating that these forms are enantiotropically related. Application of the eutectic-melting method enabled accurate determination of the transition temperature (63 degrees C), with Form B as the stable anhydrous form at room temperature. The stability relationships between the anhydrous polymorphs and the monohydrate (Form C) were assessed through exposure of the anhydrous forms to a range of water vapor pressures at room temperature. A phase boundary was identified, with the monohydrate being the thermodynamically stable form above critical water activity values of 0.85 and 0.94 for Forms A and B, respectively. These results provide a better understanding of the form stability as it relates to normal manufacturing and storage conditions for the active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient and drug product.",M1

The method employed thin-layer chromatography (TLC) aluminium sheets precoated with silica gel G 60 F(254) as the stationary phase. The solvent system consists of ethyl acetate-methanol-water with different ratios for all studied drugs (R(f) values of 0.40-0.60). The separated spots were visualized as blue to violet color after spraying with ninhydrin reagent. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots of all studied drugs produced a good linear relationship with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9990 to 0.9996 and coefficients of determination ranging from 0.9986 to 0.9992 over the concentration range 2-10 microg/spot. The limits of detection and quantitation for all studied drugs ranged from 0.09 to 0.23 and from 0.27 to 0.84 microg/spot, respectively. The developed method was applied successfully for the determination of the studied drugs in their <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms with good precision and accuracy.

20056035,"Stability-indicating HPTLC determination of ambroxol hydrochloride in bulk drug and <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage form.A simple, selective, precise, and stability-indicating high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method for the analysis of ambroxol hydrochloride both as a bulk drug and in formulations was developed and validated. The method employed HPTLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60F-254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consisted of methanol-triethylamine (4:6 v/v). The system was found to give a compact spot for ambroxol hydrochloride (R(f) value of 0.53 +/- 0.02). Densitometric analysis of ambroxol hydrochloride was carried out in the absorbance mode at 254 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r(2) = 0.9966 +/- 0.0013 with respect to peak area in the concentration range 100-1000 ng/spot. The mean value +/- standard deviation of slope and intercept were 164.85 +/- 0.72 and 1168.3 +/- 8.26 with respect to peak area. The method was validated for precision, recovery, and robustness. The limits of detection and quantitation were 10 and 30 ng/spot, respectively. Ambroxol hydrochloride was subjected to oxidation and thermal degradation. The drug undergoes degradation under oxidation and heat conditions. This indicates that the drug is susceptible to oxidation and heat. Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable, selective, and accurate for the estimation of said drug. Stability indicating of new chemical entities is an important part for the drug development of ambroxol hydrochloride and for its estimation in plasma and other biological fluids; the novel Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable and selective for the analysis of ambroxol hydrochloride as bulk drug and in pharmaceutical formulations.

20045970,"A novel analytical method for <e>pharmaceutical</e> polymorphs by terahertz spectroscopy and the optimization of crystal form at the discovery stage.A novel analytical method for the determination of pharmaceutical polymorphs was developed using terahertz spectroscopy. It was found out that each polymorph of a substance showed a specific terahertz absorption spectrum. In particular, analysis of the second derivative spectrum was enormously beneficial in the discrimination of closely related polymorphs that were difficult to discern by powder X-ray diffractometry. Crystal forms that were obtained by crystallization from various solvents and stored under various conditions were specifically characterized by the second derivative of each terahertz spectrum. Fractional polymorphic transformation for substances stored under stressed conditions was also identified by terahertz spectroscopy during solid-state stability test, but could not be detected by powder X-ray diffractometry. Since polymorphs could be characterized clearly by terahertz spectroscopy, further physicochemical studies could be conducted in a timely manner. The development form of compound examined was determined by the results of comprehensive physicochemical studies that included thermodynamic relationships, as well as chemical and physicochemical stability. In conclusion, terahertz spectroscopy, which has unique power in the elucidation of molecular interaction within a crystal lattice, can play more important role in physicochemical research. Terahertz spectroscopy has a great potential as a tool for polymorphic determination, particularly since the second derivative of the terahertz spectrum possesses high sensitivity for pharmaceutical polymorphs.",M1
20043858,"Attitude and use of herbal medicines among pregnant women in Nigeria.BACKGROUND: The use of herbal medicines among pregnant women in Nigeria has not been widely studied. METHODS: Opinion of 595 pregnant women in three geopolitical zones in Nigeria on the use of herbal medicines, safety on usage, knowledge of potential effects of herbal remedies on the fetus and potential benefits or harms that may be derived from combining herbal remedies with conventional therapies were obtained using a structured questionnaire between September 2007 and March 2008. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests were used at 95% confidence level to evaluate the data obtained. Level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: More than two-third of respondents [67.5%] had used herbal medicines in crude forms or as <e>pharmaceutical</e> prepackaged dosage forms, with 74.3% preferring self-prepared formulations. Almost 30% who were using herbal medicine at the time of the study believed that the use of herbal medicines during pregnancy is safe. Respondents' reasons for taking herbal medications were varied and included reasons such as herbs having better efficacy than conventional medicines [22.4%], herbs being natural, are safer to use during pregnancy than conventional medicines [21.1%], low efficacy of conventional medicines [19.7%], easier access to herbal medicines [11.2%], traditional and cultural belief in herbal medicines to cure many illnesses [12.5%], and comparatively low cost of herbal medicines [5.9%]. Over half the respondents, 56.6% did not support combining herbal medicines with conventional drugs to forestall drug-herb interaction. About 33.4% respondents believed herbal medicines possess no adverse effects while 181 [30.4%] were of the opinion that adverse/side effects of some herbal medicines could be dangerous. Marital status, geopolitical zones, and educational qualification of respondents had statistically significant effects on respondents views on side effects of herbal medicines [p&lt;0.05)] while only geopolitical zones and educational qualifications seemed to have influence on respondents' opinion on the harmful effects of herbal medicines to the fetus [p&lt;0.05]. CONCLUSION: The study emphasized the wide spread use of herbal medicines by pregnant women in Nigeria highlighting an urgent need for health care practitioners and other health care givers to be aware of this practice and make efforts in obtaining information about herb use during ante-natal care. This will help forestall possible interaction between herbal and conventional medicines.",M1
20039391,"The solubility-permeability interplay in using cyclodextrins as <e>pharmaceutical</e> solubilizers: mechanistic modeling and application to progesterone.A quasi-equilibrium mass transport analysis has been developed to quantitatively explain the solubility-permeability interplay that exists when using cyclodextrins as pharmaceutical solubilizers. The model considers the effects of cyclodextrins on the membrane permeability (P(m)) as well as the unstirred water layer (UWL) permeability (P(aq)), to predict the overall effective permeability (P(eff)) dependence on cyclodextrin concentration (C(CD)). The analysis reveals that: (1) UWL permeability markedly increases with increasing C(CD) since the effective UWL thickness quickly decreases with increasing C(CD); (2) membrane permeability decreases with increasing C(CD), as a result of the decrease in the free fraction of drug; and (3) since P(aq) increases and P(m) decreases with increasing C(CD), the UWL is effectively eliminated and the overall P(eff) tends toward membrane control, that is, P(eff) approximately P(m) above a critical C(CD). Application of this transport model enabled excellent quantitative prediction of progesterone P(eff) as a function of HP beta CD concentrations in PAMPA assay, Caco-2 transepithelial studies, and in situ rat jejunal-perfusion model. This work demonstrates that when using cyclodextrins as pharmaceutical solubilizers, a trade-off exists between solubility increase and permeability decrease that must not be overlooked; the transport model presented here can aid in striking the appropriate solubility-permeability balance in order to achieve optimal overall absorption.",M1
20024534,"Phthalates determination in <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulae used in parenteral nutrition by LC-ES-MS: importance in public health.A method for determining a group of phthalate esters in pharmaceutical formulae used in parenteral nutrition samples (with and without vitamins) has been developed. The phthalic acid esters (PAEs) studied were dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and dioctyl phthalate. This group of phthalates was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, working in positive ion mode. The phthalates analyzed were extracted from the sample using hexane and sodium hydroxide. The hexane was then evaporated, and the compounds were redissolved in acetonitrile. The compounds were separated by HPLC working in gradient mode with acetonitrile-ultrapure water starting from 5% to 75% acetonitrile in 5 min, followed by isocratic elution for 27 min. Standard calibration curves were linear for all the analytes over the concentration range 10-250 microg L(-1). The method was precise (with RSD from 3.3% to 12.9%) and sensitive. The proposed analytical method has been applied to the analysis of these compounds in different pharmaceutical formulae (with different compositions) for parenteral nutrition samples in order to check the presence of phthalates and determine their concentration.",M1
19929211,"Development and characterization of a transdermal patch and an emulgel containing kanamycin intended to be used in the treatment of mycetoma caused by Actinomadura madurae.BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic, degenerative, and incapacitating infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. AIM: This study focuses on developing a kanamycin-based auxiliary system intended to be used in the treatment of mycetoma caused by Actinomadura madurae. METHODS: Transdermal patches (with two different formulations: one with free kanamycin [K] and the other one with kanamycin adsorbed in silica [K-SG]) and an emulgel were developed. Both patches were prepared by the casting-evaporation technique. To characterize them, differential scanning calorimetry, bioadhesion, post-moisture detachment, strength and rupture distance, gas exchange, water uptake, and dissolution studies were carried out. The emulgel (containing 0.57% of kanamycin) was prepared from an oil-in-water emulsion, which was then incorporated to a gel. RESULTS: the patches with the best characteristics contained 22.9% of silica and 14.6% of kanamycin. Dissolution studies indicated that 8.8% of kanamycin released from K and 3.2% from K-SG at 24h. The emulgel containing 0.57% of kanamycin showed good technological characteristics for its application to the skin (viscosity, 44.9 +/- 1.4 poises; pH, 6.9 +/- 0.4; and penetrability, 52.7 +/- 5.1). CONCLUSIONS: The optimal patches were those containing 15.9% of freely dispersed kanamycin (K) and 14.6% of kanamycin adsorbed in silica (K-SG), which corresponds to the batch 2-0.8. The assessments performed to both <e>pharmaceutical</e> forms (patches and emulgel) show that they have the adequate technological characteristics for being used as an auxiliary in the treatment of actinomycetoma caused by A. madurae.",M1
19926421,"RP-HPLC method for simultaneous estimation of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide in tablet formulation.A simple, precise and stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide in <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage form. The method involves the use of easily available inexpensive laboratory reagents. The separation was achieved on an Inertsil ODS 3V (25cmx4.6mm) 5microm column with isocratic flow. The mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0mLmin(-1), consisted of 0.1M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). The UV detection was carried out at 228nm. A linear response was observed over the concentration range 2.5-50microgmL(-1) of bisoprolol fumarate and the concentration range 6.25-125microgmL(-1) of hydrochlorothiazide. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for bisoprolol fumarate were 0.01 and 0.03microgmL(-1), respectively and for hydrochlorothiazide were 0.01 and 0.05microgmL(-1), respectively. The method was successfully validated in accordance to ICH guidelines acceptance criteria for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, ruggedness and system suitability. Individual drugs (bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide), their combinations and the tablets were exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic and oxidative stress conditions. The resultant stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. The method gave high resolution among the degradation products and the analytes. The peak purity of analyte peaks in the stressed samples was confirmed by photodiode array detector. The method was used for accelerated stability study on marketed and in-house formulations. The analysis concluded that the method was selective for simultaneous estimation of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide and was stability-indicating.",M1
19903371,"Evaluation of molecular <e>pharmaceutical</e> and in-vivo properties of spray-dried isolated andrographolide-PVP.OBJECTIVES: Andrographolide, a natural lipophilic molecule, has a wide range of pharmacological actions. However, due to low aqueous solubility, it has low oral bioavailability. The purpose of the study was to increase the solubility and dissolution rate of isolated andrographolide by formulating its solid dispersion. METHOD: Solid dispersions were obtained by a spray-drying technique using different ratios of drug to polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP K-30). Solid dispersions in compression with isolated drug and corresponding physical mixtures were characterized for various molecular pharmaceutical properties and subjected to stability study for up to 3 months. KEY FINDINGS: A five-fold increase in saturation solubility of andrographolide with higher values of Q(5 min) (cumulative percentage release in 5 min) and lower values of t(75%) (time required for 75% w/w drug release) for solid dispersion was observed in different dissolution mediums. This was attributed to the formation of amorphous nature and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between drug and PVP K-30. The stability study showed there to be no significant change in molecular pharmaceutical properties and dissolution profile over the period of 3 months. Moreover, the in-vivo study in Wistar albino rats also justified improvement in the therapeutic efficacy of andrographolide after solid dispersion. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of solid dispersion to improve primary and secondary pharmaceutical properties of andrographolide using PVP K-30 as a carrier.",M1
19832631,"Investigation of RFID tag readability for <e>pharmaceutical</e> products at item level.BACKGROUND: The applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology carry a tremendous potential for pharmaceutical industry. There is a pressing need to analyze the performance of RFID tags attached to various pharmaceutical dosage forms. METHOD: The readability of RFID-tagged pharmaceutical products is, for the first time, systematically investigated by experiments. Factors considered include dosage forms, ion concentration in solution, angle of rotation, and distance between the RFID tag and the interrogator. RESULTS: Compared with empty container, the filling of any representative dosage forms causes deteriorated readability for the tag attached to container. Analysis of variance reveals that the effects of dosage forms, angle of rotation, and their interaction are statistically significant. In addition, an increase in distance (equivalent to higher RF attenuation level) and higher ion concentration in solution beyond a certain level have detrimental effect on tag readability. CONCLUSION: The analysis shows that the RFID tag readability is strongly dependent on the factors that are experimented with. The level of the factors for optimum RFID system performance should be adjusted based on the particular application.",M1
19807679,"Recent advances in developing ophthalmic formulations: a patent review.In an effort to improve the drug solubility, stability and/or ocular bioavailability of ophthalmic formulations,various approaches have been explored in the recent past. Additionally, different formulations have been investigated in order to seek those preservative systems that are more tolerable to the ocular tissue. Over the past ten years, inventions in ophthalmic formulations directed toward front-of-eye instillations have concentrated in the areas of new excipients' applications, novel and combined use of conventional excipients, and developments of novel dosage forms. Among these areas, applications of polymeric excipients, cyclodextrins and stabilized chloride dioxide (SCD) have been the most actively studied fields. In addition, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions have been becoming more popular as an ophthalmic dosage form due to the potentials in increasing drug solubility, stabilizing active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredients (APIs), improving ocular tolerance, and providing palliative effects.

19798752,"Biowaiver monographs for immediate release solid oral dosage forms: Doxycycline hyclate.Literature data relevant to the decision to allow a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence (BE) testing for the approval of immediate release (IR) solid oral dosage forms containing doxycycline hyclate are reviewed. According to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), doxycycline hyclate can be assigned to BCS Class I. No problems with BE of IR doxycycline formulations containing different excipients and produced by different manufacturing methods have been reported and hence the risk of bioinequivalence caused by these factors appears to be low. Doxycycline has a wide therapeutic index. Further, BCS-based dissolution methods have been shown to be capable of identifying formulations which may dissolve too slowly to generate therapeutic levels. It is concluded that a biowaiver is appropriate for IR solid oral dosage forms containing doxycycline hyclate as the single Active <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Ingredient (API) provided that (a) the test product contains only excipients present in doxycycline hyclate IR solid oral drug products approved in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) or associated countries; and (b) the comparator and the test products comply with the BCS criteria for  very rapidly dissolving  or, alternatively, when similarity of the dissolution profiles can be demonstrated and the two products are  rapidly dissolving. .",M1
19765804,"Lead and cadmium levels of commonly administered pediatric syrups in Nigeria: a public health concern?Fifty different pediatric syrups were randomly sampled from patent medicine stores and <e>pharmaceutical</e> shops within Awka, in Anambra State between November 2007 and May 2008. Syrups were ashed before digestion using conc. aqua regia, HCl:HNO(3) (3:1) and lead and cadmium were assayed with AAS 205A. Results revealed that 60 and 98% of the sample size had lead and cadmium respectively. The lead levels ranged from 0.01 in chloroquine to 1.08 mg/l in magcid suspension. The highest level of cadmium was seen in magcid suspension with concentration of 2.45 mg/l while lowest concentration of 0.01 in emzolyn and colipan. About 41.2% of the locally made syrup had none detectable levels of lead while all the syrup had detectable levels of cadmium. Lead levels ranged from 0.01 mg/l in cadiphen manufactured in Dholka, India to 0.09 in maxiquine made in England. About 68.8% of the imported syrups of the imported syrups had non detectable levels of lead. Chloramphenicol and zentel albendazole syrups had 0.60 and 0.88 mg/l of cadmium respectively. Bellis cough syrup showed the lowest level (0.01 mg/l) of cadmium. Only erythromycin suspension representing 6.3% had non detectable level of cadmium of the imported syrups. Due to the Cd and Pb levels found, we suggest that the behaviour scenario (here, self administration without medical assistance) should be properly taken under control. Along with this, contamination sources or vulnerable practices during syrups preparation should be also assessed in a tiered approach, towards the minimization of noxious presence in syrups and the promotion of quality of Nigerian-made products.",M1

Poly-medication 90.6 % (96 % institutionalized vs. 90.5 % non institutionalized; p = 0.019). 31.1 % of patients used ETS whose use was associated with stroke (OR = 2.7), neuropathy (OR = 2.4; p &lt; 0.001) and urinary incontinence. Institutionalized patients consumption of paracetamol, tramadol and aceclofenac was higher (54.3 %, 19 % and 7.6 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of OA was high, particularly in institutionalized patients. NSAIDs use was higher than expected compared to opioids that were lower than expected. The use of ETS analgesics was lower than expected given the reduced swallowing capacity of elderly patients.",M1
19681106,"Fusion processing of itraconazole solid dispersions by kinetisol dispersing: a comparative study to hot melt extrusion.KinetiSol Dispersing (KSD) is a novel high energy manufacturing process investigated here for the production of <e>pharmaceutical</e> solid dispersions. Solid dispersions of itraconazole (ITZ) and hypromellose were produced by KSD and compared to identical formulations produced by hot melt extrusion (HME). Materials were characterized for solid state properties by modulated differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Dissolution behavior was studied under supersaturated conditions. Oral bioavailability was determined using a Sprague-Dawley rat model. Results showed that KSD was able to produce amorphous solid dispersions in under 15 s while production by HME required over 300 s. Dispersions produced by KSD exhibited single phase solid state behavior indicated by a single glass transition temperature (T(g)) whereas compositions produced by HME exhibited two T(g)s. Increased dissolution rates for compositions manufactured by KSD were also observed compared to HME processed material. Near complete supersaturation was observed for solid dispersions produced by either manufacturing processes. Oral bioavailability from both processes showed enhanced AUC compared to crystalline ITZ. Based on the results presented from this study, KSD was shown to be a viable manufacturing process for the production of pharmaceutical solid dispersions, providing benefits over conventional techniques including: enhanced mixing for improved homogeneity and reduced processing times.",M1
19666117,"Insulin: a new era for an old hormone.All forms of diabetes have been treatable since insulin became medically available in 1921. While insulin alone produces a substantial reduction in blood-glucose levels and is thus the mainstay of treating type-1 diabetes, today's peroral agents used in treating type-2 diabetes struggle to achieve satisfactory clinical results in the absence of endogenous or exogeneous insulin. Emerging evidence suggests that insulin may not only produce symptomatic effects; recent data suggest that insulin may stimulate beta-cell recovery. In fact, short-term insulin therapy appears to result in long-term improvement in blood-glucose control, especially when administered in early stages of type-2 diabetes. During the last decade the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry has largely failed to introduce new agents that can fundamentally improve the course of diabetes and the safety of artificial insulin analogs is undergoing thorough investigation. In contrast, new delivery approaches that present natural recombinant insulin to the enterohepatic circulation holds the promise of radically improving the treatment of type-2 diabetes.",M1
19663629,"Formulating protein therapeutics into particulate forms.This review is aimed at providing critical comments on selected approaches to formulating protein drugs into particulate forms feasible as practical <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms. From a practical point of view, the need to formulate protein therapeutics into particulate forms includes inhalation and sustained-release delivery proteins, stabilizing and incorporating proteins into tissue engineering scaffolds and medical devices, as well as protecting and targeting protein therapeutics in an in vivo environment. For either of the applications, a common challenge is that proteins are easily denatured during particle-forming processes in which water-oil or water-air interfaces, multivalent ions or polyelectrolytes, strong shear stress and/or reactive crosslinking agents are often involved. Moreover, methods to protect proteins during the particle-forming processes must not compromise their pharmaceutical objectives, such as encapsulation efficiency, burst-free controlled release and storage convenience. Although numerous methods have been reported to formulate proteins into particulate systems, few of them meet the criteria above. To stimulate critical and interactive readings of the vast and booming information, the authors also provide their analysis regarding the feasibility of the formulation strategies summarized in this review.",M1
19610076,"Current status of amorphous formulation and other special dosage forms as formulations for early clinical phases.Although most chemists in the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry have a good understanding on favorable physicochemical properties for drug candidates, formulators must still deal with many challenging candidates. On the other hand, formulators are not allowed to spend much time on formulation development for early phases of the clinical studies. Thus, it is basically difficult to apply special dosage form technologies to the candidates for the first-in-human formulations. Despite the availability of numerous reviews on oral special dosage forms, information on their applicability as the early phase formulation has been limited. This article describes quick review on the oral special dosage forms that may be applied to the early clinical formulations, followed by discussion focused on the amorphous formulations, which still has relatively many issues to be proved for the general use. The major problems that inhibit the use of the amorphous formulation are difficulty in the manufacturing and the poor chemical/physical stability. Notably, the poor physical stability can be critical, because of not the poor stability itself but the difficulty in the timely evaluation in the preclinical developmental timeframes. Research directions of the amorphous formulations are suggested to utilize this promising technology without disturbing the preclinical developmental timelines.",M1
19596428,"Understanding the effect of lactose particle size on the properties of DPI formulations using experimental design.Medicines for delivering therapeutic agents to the lung as dry powders primarily consist of a carrier and a micronised active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient (API). The performance of an inhaled formulation will depend on a number of factors amongst which the particle size distribution (PSD) plays a key role. It is suggested that increasing the number of fine particles in the carrier can improve the aerosolisation of the API. In addition the effect of PSD upon a bulk powder is also broadly understood in terms of powder flow. Other aspects of functionality that different size fractions of the carrier affect are not clearly understood; for example, it is not yet clearly known how different size fractions contribute to the different functionalities of the carrier. It is the purpose of this investigation to examine the effects of different lactose size fractions on fine particle dose, formulation stability and the ability to process and fill the material in the preferred device. In order to understand the true impact of the size fractions of lactose on the performance of dry powder inhaled (DPI) products, a statistically designed study has been conducted. The study comprised various DPI blend formulations prepared using lactose monohydrate carrier systems consisting of mixtures of four size fractions. Interactive mixtures were prepared containing 1% (w/w) salbutamol sulphate. The experimental design enabled the evaluation of the effect of lactose size fractions on processing and performance attributes of the formulation. Furthermore, the results of the study demonstrate that an experimental design approach can be used successfully to support dry powder formulation development.",M1
19593787,"Dielectric relaxation studies and dissolution behavior of amorphous verapamil hydrochloride.Verapamil hydrochloride (VH) is a very popular calcium channel blocker. Solubility of its crystalline form in the blood reaches only 10-20%. Thus, it seems to be very important to improve its bioavailability. In this article, we show that the preparation of the amorphous form of VH enhance its dissolution rate. In addition we performed dielectric measurements to describe molecular dynamics of this active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient (API). Since examined sample is typical ionically conducting material, to gain information about structural relaxation we employed the dielectric modulus formalism. The temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time can be described over the entire measured range by a single Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation. From the VFT fits the glass transition temperature was estimated as T(g) = 320.1 K. Below glass transition temperature one clearly visible secondary relaxation, with activation energy E(a) = 37.8 kJ/mol, was reported. Deviations of experimental data from KWW fits on high-frequency flank of alpha-peak indicate the presence of an excess wing in tested sample. Based on Kia Ngai's coupling model we identified the excess wing as true Johari-Goldstein process.",M1
19526681,"[Difficulties encountered during formulation of a parenteral dosage form containing a poorly soluble drug]Poor water solubility and consequently the difficulties in formulating a liquid dosage form is a great concern in <e>pharmaceutical</e> development. The importance of this issue is underlined by the fact that 10-30% of marketed drugs and 60-70% of drugs coming from early development stage have solubility problems. In this paper we summarize the existing solubility enhancing techniques that are applicable in parenteral dosage forms for overcoming the issue. We address the problem of choosing the most adequate solubility enhancing technique and present the considerations that should be kept in mind during formulating the solvent systems. Such questions are for example the possible haemolysing effect of the excipients, pH of the composition and its compatibility with various sterilizing methods. We also focus on the probable technological issues, which may arise in each solubility enhancing method, we present examples for every one of them and where possible the solution to the problem is also proposed.",M1
19485196,"Application of a stability-indicating thin-layer chromatographic method to the determination of tenatoprazole in <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms.A sensitive, selective, precise, and stability-indicating thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) method was developed and validated for the determination of tenatoprazole both as a bulk drug and in formulation. The method uses TLC aluminum plates precoated with Silica Gel 60F-254 as the stationary phase and the solvent system toluene-ethyl acetate-methanol (6 + 4 + 1, v/v/v). This system gave compact spots for tenatoprazole (Rf value of 0.34 +/- 0.02). Tenatoprazole was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, and photodegradation. The peaks of the degradation products were well-resolved from that of the pure drug and had significantly different Rf values. Densitometric analysis of tenatoprazole was performed in the absorbance mode at 306 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship over the concentration range of 100-1500 ng/spot. The mean values of the correlation coefficient, slope, and intercept were 0.9989 +/- 1.42, 10.27 +/- 0.965, and 4894.2 +/- 1.24, respectively. The method was validated for precision, robustness, and recovery. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 50 and 100 ng/spot, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the method is repeatable and selective for estimation of tenatoprazole. Because the method can separate the drug from its degradation products, it can be used to monitor stability.",M1

The method is based upon a kinetic investigation of the reaction of the drug with oxidized quercetin reagent at room temperature for a fixed time of 30 min. The decrease in absorbance after the addition of the drug was measured at 510 nm. The absorbance concentration plot was rectilinear over the range 80-400 microg mL(-1) for all studied drugs. The concentration of the studied drugs was calculated using the corresponding calibration equation for the fixed time method. The determination of the studied drugs by initial rate, variable time and rate-constant methods was feasible with the calibration equations obtained but the fixed time method has been found to be more applicable. The analytical performance of the method, in terms of accuracy and precision, was statistically validated; the results were satisfactory. The method has been successfully applied to the determination of the studied drugs in commercial pharmaceutical formulations. Statistical comparison of the results with a well established reported method showed excellent agreement and proved that there is no significant difference in the accuracy and precision.",M1
19482083,"<e>Pharmaceutical</e> applications of AC biosusceptometry.AC Biosusceptometry offers an alternative to investigate noninvasively and without ionizing radiation the behavior of solid dosage forms in vitro and in the human gastrointestinal tract. This versatility allowed applying this technique in a wide field ranging from characterization of the disintegration process to elucidation of how the physiological parameters can interfere with pharmaceutical processes. It is increasingly important to understand how oral solid dosage forms behave in the human gastrointestinal tract. Once labelled, magnetic dosage forms provide an excellent opportunity to investigate complexes' interactions between dosage form and gastrointestinal physiology. In this paper, basic principles of this biomagnetic instrumentation and of the quantification based on magnetic images are reviewed.

19459034,"Preparation and <e>pharmaceutical</e>/pharmacodynamic evaluation of topical brucine-loaded liposomal hydrogel.To reduce the toxicity and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of brucine, a traditional Chinese medicine for relieving arthritic and traumatic pain, in this study, a novel brucine-loaded liposomal hydrogel (BLH) formulation, suitable for topical application, was developed. Spherical liposomes composed of lecithin and cholesterol, with brucine, was prepared by a modified ethanol-dripping method. High percentage (over 80%) of encapsulated brucine in liposomes was obtained. Topical liposomal hydrogel formulations were prepared by further incorporation of the prepared liposomes into structured carbopol 940 hydrogels with the concentration of carbopol 1.0%, the ratio of glycerol to carbopol 8:1 and the brucine content 0.1%. The liposomal hydrogel formulations provided an obvious promotion for skin permeation of bruicne while for the free brucine in hydrogels (BH), there was no detectable drug permeation through the skin. The safety evaluation showed that the prepared BLH were no irritation to both the broken and integrity skin. Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that the BLH showed a better therapeutic efficacy than that of the BH. So, it can be concluded that the BLH developed here could represent a safe, effective and promising transdermal formulation for local treatment of analgesic and anti-inflammatory disease.",M1
19446824,"New method for the quantification of dequalinium cations in <e>pharmaceutical</e> samples by absorption and fluorescence diode array thin-layer chromatography.A diode array HPTLC method for dequalinium chloride in pharmaceutical preparations is presented. For separation a Nano TLC silica gel plate (Merck) is used with the mobile phase methanol-7.8% aqueous NH(4)(+)CH(3)COO(-) (17:3, v/v) over a distance of 6 cm. Dequalinium chloride shows an R(F) value of 0.58. Pure dequalinium chloride is measured in the wavelength range from 200 to 500 nm and shows several by-products, contour plot visualized in absorption, fluorescence and using the Kubelka-Munk transformation. Scanning of a single track in absorption and fluorescence measuring 600 spectra in the range from 200 to 1100 nm takes 30s. As a sample pre-treatment of an ointment it is simply dissolved in methanol and can be quantified in absorption from 315 to 340 nm. The same separation can also be quantified using fluorescence spectrometry in the range from 355 to 370 nm. A new staining method for dequalinium chloride, using sodium tetraphenyl borate/HCl in water allows a fluorescence quantification in the range from 445 to 485 nm. The linearity range of absorption and fluorescence measurements is from 10 to 2000 ng. Sugar-containing preparations like liquids or lozenges with a reduced sample pre-treatment can be reliably quantified only in fluorescence. The total for the quantification of an ointment sample (measuring four standards and five samples), including all sample pre-treatment steps takes less than 45 min!",M1

The separation was optimized on a macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotic chiral stationary phase (CSP) based on teicoplanin aglycone, chirobiotic (TAG), using a mobile phase system containing ethanol-water (80:20, v/v), at a flow rate of 0.4ml/min and UV detection set at 210nm. The stability of vigabatrin enantiomers under different degrees of temperature was also studied. The enantiomers of vigabatrin were separated from each other. The calibration curves were linear over a range of 100-1600microg/ml (r=0.999) for both enantiomers. The overall recoveries of R-(-)- and S-(+)-vigabatrin enantiomers from pharmaceutical products were in the range of 98.3-99.8% with %RSD ranged from 0.48 to 0.52%.

19427474,"The use of net analyte signal (NAS) in near infrared spectroscopy <e>pharmaceutical</e> applications: interpretability and figures of merit.Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been extensively used as an analytical method for quality control of solid dosage forms for the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical formulations can be extremely complex, containing typically one or more active product ingredients (API) and various excipients, yielding very complex near infrared (NIR) spectra. The NIR spectra interpretability can be improved using the concept of net analyte signal (NAS). NAS is defined as the part of the spectrum unique to the analyte of interest. The objective of this work was to compare two different methods to estimate the API's NAS vector of different pharmaceutical formulations. The main difference between the methods is the knowledge of API free formulations NIR spectra. The comparison between the two methods was assessed in a qualitative and quantitative way. Results showed that both methods produced good results in terms of the similarity between the NAS vector and the pure API spectrum, as well as in the ability to predict the API concentration of unknown samples. Moreover, figures of merit such as sensitivity, selectivity, and limit of detection were estimated in a straightforward manner.",M1
19426791,"Non-destructive determination of anisotropic mechanical properties of <e>pharmaceutical</e> solid dosage forms.The mechanical property anisotropy of compacts made from four commercially available pharmaceutical excipient powders (microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, ascorbic acid, and aspartame) was evaluated. The speed of pressure (longitudinal) waves in the uni-axially compressed cubic compacts of each excipient in the three principle directions was determined using a contact ultrasonic method. Average Young's moduli of each compact in the axial (x) and radial (y and z) directions were characterized. The contact ultrasonic measurements revealed that average Young's modulus values vary with different testing orientations which indicate Young's modulus anisotropy in the compacts. The extent of Young's modulus anisotropy was quantified by using a dimensionless ratio and was found to be significantly different for each material (microcrystalline cellulose&gt;lactose&gt;aspartame&gt;ascorbic acid). It is also observed that using the presented contact method, compacts at high solid fraction (0.857-0.859) could be differentiated than those at the solid fraction of 0.85 in their groups. The presented contact ultrasonic method is an attractive tool since it has the advantages of being sensitive to solid fraction ratio, non-destructive, requiring small amount of material and rapid. It is noteworthy that, since the approach provides insight into the performance of common pharmaceutical materials and fosters increased process knowledge, it can be applied to broaden the understanding of the effect of the mechanical properties on the performance (e.g., disintegration profiles) of solid oral dosage forms.",M1

The method was based on the reaction of N-vinylpiprazine formed from the interaction of the mono-substituted piprazinyl group in NOR and acetaldehyde with 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone to give colored N-vinylpiprazino-substituted benzoquinone derivative. The formation of the colored product was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 625 nm. The factors affecting the reaction was studied and optimized. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined and the reaction pathway was postulated. The activation energy of the reaction was calculated and found to be 5.072 kJ mol(-1). The initial rate and fixed time (at 5min) methods were utilized for constructing the calibration graphs. The graphs were linear in concentration ranges of 20-150 and 10-180 microg mL(-1) with limits of detection of 8.4 and 3.2 microg mL(-1) for the initial rate and fixed time methods, respectively. The analytical performance of both methods was fully validated, and the results were satisfactory. No interferences were observed from the excipients that are commonly present in the pharmaceutical formulations, as well as from tinidazole that is co-formulated with NOR in some of its formulations. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of NOR in its commercial pharmaceutical formulations. The label claim percentages were 98.4-100.4+/-0.52-1.04%.

Of special concern for biowaiving is that many reports of failure of IR solid oral dosage forms of rifampicin to meet BE have been published and the reasons for these failures are yet insufficiently understood. Moreover, no reports were identified in which in vitro dissolution was shown to be predictive of nonequivalence among products. Therefore, a biowaiver based approval of rifampicin containing IR solid oral dosage forms cannot be recommended for either new multisource drug products or for major scale-up and postapproval changes (variations) to existing drug products.",M1

19135409,"Spectrophotometric study for the reaction between fluvoxamine and 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulphonate: Kinetic, mechanism and use for determination of fluvoxamine in its dosage forms.Spectrophotometric study was carried out, for the first time, to investigate the reaction between the antidepressant fluvoxamine (FXM) and 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulphonate (NQS) reagent. In alkaline medium (pH 9), an orange-colored product exhibiting maximum absorption peak (lambda(max)) at 470nm was produced. The kinetics of the reaction was investigated and its activation energy was found to be 2.65kcalmol(-1). Because of this low activation energy, the reaction proceeded easily. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined and the reaction mechanism was postulated. This color-developing reaction was successfully employed in the development of simple and rapid spectrophotometric method for determination of FXM in its <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms. Under the optimized reaction conditions, Beer's law correlating the absorbance (A) with FXM concentration (C) was obeyed in the range of 0.6-8microgml(-1). The regression equation for the calibration data was A=0.0086+0.1348C, with good correlation coefficient (0.9996). The molar absorptivity (epsilon) was 5.9x10(4)lmol(-1)cm(-1). The limits of detection and quantification were 0.2 and 0.6microgml(-1), respectively. The precision of the method was satisfactory; the values of relative standard deviations did not exceed 2%.

The <e>pharmaceutical</e> development of pDERMATT necessitated the availability of an assay for the quantification and purity determination of pDERMATT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the produced bulk drug and its pharmaceutical dosage form. An anion-exchange liquid chromatographic method (AEX-LC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection was developed, which is based on separation on a non porous anion-exchange (NPR AEX) column with a mobile phase gradient of 0.45-0.53M NaCl in 20mM Tris-HCl 10% isopropanol (IPA) pH 9 and UV detection at 260 and 280nm. The method was found to be precise, accurate and linear over a concentration range of 5-150microg/ml. The supercoiled topoisoform of pDERMATT was well separated from the linear and open-circular form, the main degradation products formed during stress testing, confirming its stability-indicating capability. The use of photo diode array (PDA) detection enabled us to confirm all visible peaks to contain DNA. Additionally capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) showed the same peak profile as the developed HPLC method.

19108798,"Dosage form design and development.BACKGROUND: Drugs must be properly formulated for administration to patients, regardless of age. Pediatric patients provide some additional challenges to the formulator in terms of compliance and therapeutic efficacy. Due to the lack of sufficient drug products for the pediatric population, the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry and compounding pharmacies must develop and provide appropriate medications designed for children. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to review the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of drug substances and pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in preparing a drug product. In addition, stability, appearance, palatability, flavoring, sweetening, coloring, preservation, packaging, and storage are discussed. METHODS: Information for the current article was gathered from a literature review; from presentations at professional and technical meetings; and from lectures, books, and publications of the author, as well as from his professional experience. Professional society meetings and standards-setting bodies were also used as a resource. RESULTS: The proper design and formulation of a dosage form requires consideration of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of all of the drug substances and pharmaceutical ingredients (excipients) to be used in fabricating the product. The drug and pharmaceutical materials utilized must be compatible and produce a drug product that is stable, efficacious, palatable, easy to administer, and well tolerated. Preformulation factors include physical properties such as particle size, crystalline structure, melting point, solubility, partition coefficient, dissolution, membrane permeability, dissociation constants, and drug stability. CONCLUSIONS: Successful development of a formulation includes multiple considerations involving the drug, excipients, compliance, storage, packaging, and stability, as well as patient considerations of taste, appearance, and palatability.",M1
19108797,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Pediatric Formulation Initiative: selected reports from working groups.BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) is a project of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The PFI was established to address the issue of the lack of appropriate formulations in children and to use this activity as a means to improve pediatric formulations, as mandated by the Best <e>Pharmaceuticals</e> for Children Act of 2002 and 2007. The PFI began in 2005 with the formation of 3 working groups-Scientific, Economics, and Taste and Flavor. These groups began the process of identifying issues, gathering needed information, and considering possible ways to overcome barriers to the development of pediatric drug formulations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this supplement was to provide details of the working groups' activities through presentation of full-length articles. Also presented is an article that discusses the 2007 European Union (EU) regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use. METHODS: Information for this article was gathered from the proceedings of a PFI workshop, sponsored by the NICHD, that was held in Bethesda, Maryland, on December 6 and 7, 2005, as well as postworkshop discussions of the different working groups. RESULTS: The increased awareness that the majority of medications used today have not been labeled for use in children, and have not been tested to define safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosing, has led to the passage of legislation in the United States and in the EU to create incentives to stimulate the testing of drugs in this special population. It is imperative that the problems associated with the compounding and use of extemporaneous formulations as described in this supplement be addressed. Regulatory barriers to the availability of commercially developed pediatric formulations in different countries will need to be minimized or removed. New drug delivery systems will need to be tested and made available to pediatric patients. Further research in the mediators of bitter taste and study of taste blockers, as well as newer methods for taste testing in pediatrics, should be encouraged. An overarching goal for the future is addressing the economic barriers to develop appropriate pediatric dosage forms for drugs with limited market penetration. The lack of appropriate formulations is part of a larger problem that includes limited development and manufacture of medicines tailored for pediatric patients (particularly those affected by neglected diseases), insufficient investment in drug trials, and limited research on drug disposition in various pediatric populations worldwide. CONCLUSION: The solution to these issues will require alignment of vision and commitment as a global priority of policy makers, regulators, scientists, pharmaceutical sponsors, academic institutions, governments, and research foundations.",M1
19103564,"Development and validation of spectrophotometric methods for determination of ceftazidime in <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms.Two spectrophotometric methods for the determination of ceftazidime (CFZM) in either pure form or in its pharmaceutical formulations are described. The first method is based on the reaction of 3-methylbenzothiazolin-2-one hydrazone (MBTH) with ceftazidime in the presence of ferric chloride in acidic medium. The resulting blue complex absorbs at lambdamax 628 nm. The second method describes the reaction between the diazotized drug and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDA) to yield a purple colored product with lambdamax at 567 nm. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain maximum color intensity. The absorbance was found to increase linearly with increasing the concentration of CFZM; the systems obeyed the Beer's law in the range 2-10 and 10-50 microg mL-1 for MBTH and NEDA methods, resp. LOD, LOQ and correlation coefficient values were 0.15, 0.79 and 0.50, 2.61. No interference was observed from common excipients present in pharmaceutical formulations. The proposed methods are simple, sensitive, accurate and suitable for quality control applications.",M1
19100684,"Appraisal of potential environmental risks associated with human antibiotic consumption in Turkey.A comprehensive analysis of Turkish antibiotic data was conducted to evaluate potential environmental risks associated with antibiotic consumption in Turkey for year 2007. Antibiotics were defined for systemic use or group J01 of the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Total emissions and prescriptions for each ATC group were classified separately into 17 different J01 categories and three forms of medication (capsule/tablets, injectables and suspensions). Capsules and tablets were found as the most emitted form of medication in year 2007, with a total emission rate of about 585.5 tons/year (76%). Total antibiotic emission rates including all forms of medications were determined to be about 664.2 tons/year (86%) and 110.1 tons/year (14%) for adult and pediatric patients, respectively. An environmental risk assessment of 8 human antibiotics was conducted according to the EU draft guidance (CEC/III/5504/94, draft 6, version 4) and the risk was indicated by the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for the aquatic environment. Available acute and chronic toxicity data were collected from the open peer-reviewed literature to derive PNEC. Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were then calculated for 8 <e>pharmaceutical</e> substances. PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded 1.0 for beta-lactams (cephalosporins and penicillins), fluoroquinolones, macrolides and aminoglycosides. The findings of this study concluded that the release of these compounds from wastewater treatment plants may potentially be of an important environmental concern based on today's use of antibiotics in Turkey.",M1
19086628,"[Preparation and in vitro evaluation of gastroretentive dosage form containing puerarin-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex]OBJECTIVE: To prepare a novel floating micropellets containing hydroxy propyl-beta-oyclodextrin(puerarin-HP-beta-CD) for gastroretentive dosage form and evaluate its <e>pharmaceutical</e> characteristics in vitro. METHOD: The puerarin HP-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was prepared by freeze-drying method. Puerarin and its HP-beta-CD inclusion complex were incorporated into alginate beads, respectively. The effect of methyl cellulose (MC), Mg-Stearate and chitosan on buoyancy and cumulative release rate of puerarin were investigated in simulated gastric fluid. RESULT: The spectrums of FTIR and profiles of X-ray powder diffraction of samples proved the formation of inclusion complex between puerarin and HP-beta-CD. Magnesium stearate had a significant effect on the buoyancy of micropellets, and satisfied results were gained by the content with 2%. The solubility of puerarin was increased 65.6-fold by the formation of inclusion complex, the dissolution rate and cumulative release percentage also improved significantly although with the burst release phenomena. The micropellets showed sustained release properties by using puerarin-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex mixed with puerarin (1:1) and treated thoroughly under homogenizer. CONCLUSION: The solubility and release rate of puerarin are increased by the formation of inclusion complex with HP-beta-CD and its gastroretentive dosage forms displayed satisfied floating and sustained release characteristics.",M1
19085090,"Quantitative image analysis for evaluating the coating thickness and pore distribution in coated small particles.PURPOSE: This study aims to develop a characterization method for coating structure based on image analysis, which is particularly promising for the rational design of coated particles in the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry. METHODS: The method applies the MATLAB image processing toolbox to images of coated particles taken with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CSLM). The coating thicknesses have been determined along the particle perimeter, from which a statistical analysis could be performed to obtain relevant thickness properties, e.g. the minimum coating thickness and the span of the thickness distribution. The characterization of the pore structure involved a proper segmentation of pores from the coating and a granulometry operation. RESULTS: The presented method facilitates the quantification of porosity, thickness and pore size distribution of a coating. These parameters are considered the important coating properties, which are critical to coating functionality. Additionally, the effect of the coating process variations on coating quality can straight-forwardly be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Enabling a good characterization of the coating qualities, the presented method can be used as a fast and effective tool to predict coating functionality. This approach also enables the influence of different process conditions on coating properties to be effectively monitored, which latterly leads to process tailoring.",M1
19084658,"Development and validation of a HPLC method for the determination of buprenorphine hydrochloride, naloxone hydrochloride and noroxymorphone in a tablet formulation.A simple isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method (RP-HPLC) was developed for the simultaneous determination of buprenorphine hydrochloride, naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate and its major impurity, noroxymorphone, in <e>pharmaceutical</e> tablets. The chromatographic separation was achieved with 10 mmol L(-1) potassium phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 6.0 with orthophosphoric acid and acetonitrile (17:83, v/v) as mobile phase, a C-18 column, Perfectsil Target ODS3 (150 mm x 4.6mm i.d., 5 microm) kept at 35 degrees C and UV detection at 210 nm. The compounds were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1). The average retention times for naloxone, noroxymorphone and buprenorphine were 2.4, 3.8 and 8.1 min, respectively. The method was validated according to the ICH guidelines. The validation characteristics included accuracy, precision, linearity, range, specificity, limit of quantitation and robustness. The calibration curves were linear (r&gt;0.996) over the concentration range 0.22-220 microg mL(-1) for buprenorphine hydrochloride and 0.1-100 microg mL(-1) for naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate and noroxymorphone. The recoveries for all three compounds were above 96%. No spectral or chromatographic interferences from the tablet excipients were found. This method is rapid and simple, does not require any sample preparation and is suitable for routine quality control analyses.",M1
19066862,"Analytical study proving alprazolam degradation to its main impurity triazolaminoquinoleine through Maillard reaction.Triazolaminoquinoleine is rapidly formed in formulations of alprazolam tablets in presence of excipients, and its generation is speeded up with increasing temperature and humidity. The present paper deals with detailed quantitative and qualitative studies into the nonactive constituents of the formulation in order to determine the excipient (or the mixture) responsible for the degradation. Our studies have demonstrated that reducing carbohydrate excipients play a fundamental role in the generation of triazolaminoquinoleine, with lactose as the main one responsible, through a Maillard reaction. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed degradation mechanism, p-nitrobenzaldehyde has been employed as a model of reaction of the nucleophylic attack of amino-opened structure of alprazolam to an aldehyde to generate the first intermediate involved in Maillard reaction, a Schiff base. This model enables the identification of all the intermediates by mass spectrometry and/or nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, with the outcome of this experiment leading to a full understanding of the generation pathway. Calcium carbonate has been proposed as a possible tablet diluent replacing lactose in the <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulation.",M1
19031008,"Study on the use of drugs in patients with enteral feeding tubes.OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of drugs in patients using Enteral Feeding Tubes (EFT) at a University Hospital in southern Brazil. METHOD: A total of 315 medical charts of patients that had used EFT were analyzed. Variables of interest were: days the tube was used, number and frequency of drugs administered by the tube, <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms and the number of tube exchanges per patients. RESULTS: The mean of age of the patients was 59 years (SD = 21) and 59% were male. A mean number of drugs prescribed per patient with tube administration were five. Almost all patients (95%) used some drugs in solid pharmaceutical preparations, mostly tablets (72%). About 158 different drugs were prescribed; for 23% of these, the prescription of liquid dosage forms was possible. The chance of changing the enteral tube was greater for patients that used more than five drugs enterally (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 2.8-8.2) and that had more than 13 drug administrations per day (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 3.1-9.3). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that patients using more drugs enterally have a greater chance of having their enteral tube exchanged. Furthermore, it suggests a lack of knowledge of the health team with regard to the appropriateness of pharmaceutical preparations for this administration.",M1
19027256,"Real-time on-line blend uniformity monitoring using near-infrared reflectance spectrometry: a noninvasive off-line calibration approach.A robust, noninvasive, real-time, on-line near-infrared (NIR) quantitative method is described for blend uniformity monitoring of a <e>pharmaceutical</e> solid dosage form containing 29.4% (w/w) drug load with three major excipients (crospovidone, lactose, and microcrystalline cellulose). A set of 21 off-line, static calibration samples were used to develop a multivariate partial least-squares (PLS) calibration model for on-line prediction of the API content during the blending process. The concentrations of the API and the three major excipients were varied randomly to minimize correlations between the components. A micro electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) based portable, battery operated NIR spectrometer was used for this study. To minimize spectral differences between the static and dynamic measurement modes, the acquired NIR spectra were preprocessed using standard normal variate (SNV) followed by second derivative Savitzky-Golay using 21 points. The performance of the off-line PLS calibration model were evaluated in real-time on 16 laboratory scale (30 L bin size) blend experiments conducted over 3 months. To challenge the robustness of the off-line calibration model, several blend experiments were conducted using a different bin size, faster revolution speed and variations in the potency of the API. Employing the PLS calibration model developed using the off-line calibration approach, the real-time API NIR (%) predictions for all experiments were all within 90-110%. These results were confirmed using the conventional thief sampling of the final blend followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Further confirmation was established through content uniformity by HPLC of manufactured tablets. Finally, the optimized off-line PLS method was successfully transferred to a production site which involved using a secondary NIR instrument with a 15-fold scale-up in bin size from development.",M1
18956142,"Equivalence-by-design: targeting in vivo drug delivery profile.In the United States (U.S.), drug products are considered therapeutically equivalent if they meet regulatory criteria of <e>pharmaceutical</e> equivalence and bioequivalence. These requirements can be traced back to 1977 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the regulations on bioavailability and bioequivalence. Over the years, to keep up with the advancement in science and technology, the FDA has been constantly updating the regulatory approaches to assessing and ensuring equivalence. In view of the recent growth in novel pharmaceutical dosage forms and delivery systems, this paper examines the current framework for documentation of therapeutic equivalence and explores the opportunities of further advancing equivalence methods for complex drug products. It is proposed that equivalence may be established by matching the in vivo drug delivery profile (iDDP) between drug products in comparison. This can be achieved by characterizing the iDDP of the reference formulation with application of an equivalence-by-design approach for pharmaceutical development. Critical variables can be identified to serve as in vitro markers or biomarkers for mapping the desired drug delivery profile in vivo. A multidisciplinary approach may be necessary to develop these markers for characterization of iDDPs.",M1
18946842,"Selecting and controlling API crystal form for <e>pharmaceutical</e> development--strategies and processes.The success of designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing oral dosage forms of pharmaceutical products into the market relies on many steps, processes, stages and usually three phases of clinical trials. One key process is selecting an appropriate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) crystal or amorphous form for the final dosage product: the ultimate goal of this selection process is to ensure that the manufactured product contains a stable and bioavailable active ingredient. A thorough knowledge of the solid-state chemistry of the API, the related excipients and the processes to make the product are critical in meeting this goal. Through recently published literature and the authors' experiences, this review describes the concepts and approaches that are used in the development of a truly knowledge-based crystalline API form selection process and highlights the appropriate studies which fit the Quality by Design (QbD) framework for pharmaceutical development activities. This review also discusses the potential API crystal form transformations in the API crystallization, post-crystallization and formulation stages, which are demonstrated by case study examples.",M1

The quantification was carried out using Inertsil ODS (250 +/- 4.6 mm, 5 micro) column and mobile phase comprised of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate (pH 4.5; 20mM) in proportion of 60:40 (v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the effluent was monitored at 230 nm. The retention time of pioglitazone and glimepiride were 7.0+/-0.1 and 10.2+/-0.1 min respectively. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, and specificity, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. Linearity of pioglitazone and glimepiride were in the range of 2.0 to 200.0 microg/ ml and 0.5-50microg/ ml respectively. The percentage recoveries of both the drugs were 99.85% and 102.06% for pioglitazone and glimepiride respectively from the tablet formulation. The proposed method is suitable for simultaneous determination of pioglitazone and glimepiride in pharmaceutical dosage form and bulk drug.",M1
18930126,"Benchtop-NMR and MRI--a new analytical tool in drug delivery research.During the last years, NMR spectroscopy and NMR imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) have been increasingly used to monitor drug delivery systems in vitro and in vivo. However, high installation and running costs of the commonly used superconducting magnet technology limits the application range and prevents the further spread of this non-invasive technology. Benchtop-NMR (BT-NMR) relaxometry uses permanent magnets and is much less cost intensive. BT-NMR relaxometry is commonly used in the food and chemical industry, but so far scarcely used in the <e>pharmaceutical</e> field. The paper shows on several examples that the application field of BT-NMR relaxometry can be extended into the field of drug delivery, including the characterisation of emulsions and lipid ingredients (e.g. the amount and physicochemical state of the lipid) and the monitoring of adsorption characteristics (e.g. oil binding of porous ingredients). The most exciting possibilities of BT-NMR technology are linked with the new development of BT-instruments with imaging capability. BT-MRI examples on the monitoring of hydration and swelling of HPMC-based monolayer and double-layer tablets are shown. BT-MRI opens new MRI opportunities for the non-invasive monitoring of drug delivery processes.",M1
18804769,"Phytochemical analysis of traditional Chinese medicine using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is commonly considered to operate due to the synergistic effects of all the major and minor components in the medicines. Hence sensitive and comprehensive analytical techniques are needed to acquire a better understanding of the pharmacological basis of the herb and to enhance the product quality control. The present review mainly focuses on the phytochemical analysis of TCMs using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) are the two commonly used ion sources. Triple quadrupole, ion trap (IT), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers are used as on-line analyzer. The relationship between structural features and fragmentation patterns should be investigated as thoroughly as possible and hence be applied in the on-line analysis to deduce the structures of detected peaks. Characteristic fragmentation behaviors of the reference standards, as well as information regarding polarity obtained from retention time data, on-line UV spectra, data from the literature and bio-sources of the compounds allowed the identification of the phytochemical constituents in the crude extracts. Although a mass spectrometer is not a universal detector, high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with multistage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) technique was still proved to be a rapid and sensitive method to analyze the majority of the many constituents in herbal medicines, particularly for the detection of those present in minor or trace amounts. The methods established using HPLC-MS techniques facilitate the convenient and rapid quality control of traditional medicines and their <e>pharmaceutical</e> preparations. However, the quantitative analysis is not the topic of this review.",M1
18785041,"A validated HPLC method for separation and determination of promethazine enantiomers in <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulations.A simple, rapid, and validated method for separation and determination of promethazine enantiomers was developed. Promethazine was separated and quantitated on a Vancomycin Chirobiotic V column (250 x 4.6 mm), using a mixture of methanol, acetic acid, and triethylamine (100:0.1:0.1%, by volume) as a mobile phase at 20 degrees C and at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The UV-detector was set to 254 nm. Acetyl salicylic acid (Aspirin) was used as an internal standard. The applied HPLC method allowed separation and quantification of promethazine enantiomers with good linearity (r &gt; .999) in the studied range. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were 0.29 and 0.36 for the promethazine enantiomers with accuracy of 100.06 and 100.08. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of promethazine enantiomers were found to be 0.04 and 0.07 microg/mL, respectively. The method was validated through the parameters of linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness.

18774667,"Near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) on <e>pharmaceutical</e> solid dosage forms-comparing common calibration approaches.Near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) is the fusion of near-infrared spectroscopy and image analysis. It can be used to visualize the spatial distribution of the chemical compounds in a sample (providing a chemical image). Each sample measurement generates a hyperspectral data cube containing thousands of spectra. An important part of a NIR-CI analysis is the data processing of the hyperspectral data cube. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of different commonly used calibration methods to generate accurate chemical images. Three common calibration approaches were compared: (1) using single wavenumber, (2) using classical least squares regression (CLS) and (3) using partial least squares regression (PLS1). Each method was evaluated using two different preprocessing methods. A calibration data set of tablets with five constituents was used for analysis. Chemical images of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the two major excipients cellulose and lactose in the formulation were made. The accuracy of the generated chemical images was evaluated by the concentration prediction ability. The most accurate predictions for all three compounds were generated by PLS1. The drawback of PLS1 is that it requires a calibration data set and CLS, which does not require a calibration data set, therefore proved to be an excellent alternative. CLS also generated accurate predictions and only requires the pure compound spectrum of each constituent in the sample. All three calibration approaches were found applicable for hyperspectral image analysis but their relevance of use depends on the purpose of analysis and type of data set. As expected, the single wavenumber method was primarily found useful for compounds with a distinct spectral band that was not overlapped by bands of other constituents. This paper also provides guidance for hyperspectral image (or NIR-CI) analysis describing each of the typical steps involved.",M1
18715549,"Solid form screening--a review.Solid form screening, the activity of generating and analysing different solid forms of an active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient (API), has become an essential part of drug development. The multi-step screening process needs to be designed, performed and evaluated carefully, since the decisions made based on the screening may have consequences on the whole lifecycle of a pharmaceutical product. The selection of the form for development is made after solid form screening. The selection criteria include not only pharmaceutically relevant properties, such as therapeutic efficacy and processing characteristics, but also intellectual property (IP) issues. In this paper, basic principles of solid form screening are reviewed, including the methods used in experimental screening (generation, characterisation and analysis of solid forms, data mining tools, and high-throughput screening technologies) as well as basics of computational methods. Differences between solid form screening strategies of branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers are also discussed.",M1
18661535,"Factors influencing the gastric residence of dosage forms in dogs.An appreciation of the variables influencing canine gastric transit time is of interest both because of the push to develop <e>pharmaceutical</e> products that meet the therapeutic needs of the veterinary patient and because of efforts to improve our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses associated with the use of the dog as a preclinical model to support human product development. The gastric transit time of monogastric species is influenced by many factors. Physiological variables include the time of dosing relative to the phase of the interdigestive migrating myoelectric current (IMMC), the sieving properties of the pylorus, the presence or absence of food, and the inherent crushing force of the stomach. Pharmacological factors include particle size, shape and density, drug solubility, and the hardness of the tablet. Despite the importance of understanding the factors influencing gastric residence time in dogs, an in-depth examination of currently available information on this topic has not as yet been published. Therefore, this review provides an examination of each of these factors and their potential impact on canine oral drug absorption characteristics.",M1
18620051,"Contamination of semi-solid dosage forms by leachables from aluminium tubes.The objective of this study was to determine to what extent bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and its derivatives are extractable from epoxy-based coatings of aluminium tubes for <e>pharmaceutical</e> use and to monitor their leaching into different kinds of semi-solid dosage forms. Migration increasing factors should be evaluated. Extraction tests using acetonitrile for 10 days at 40 degrees C turned out to be suitable to estimate the maximum amount of extractables. A plain variability in the nature and amount of extractables among tubes of different vendors (n=7) could be demonstrated. Leaching of the remnants into various semi-solid drug products (ointment, cream, gel) during storage (30 degrees C/40 degrees C) was verifiable. Leachable profiles were, apart from storage time and temperature, decisively influenced by the matrix. In particular, matrix polarity seemed to play a crucial role. Thus, the highest amount of leachables was found in isopropanol-based carbomer gel. Furthermore, in-use conditions (mechanical stress) enhanced migration significantly. In order to ensure quality and safety of semi-solid formulae, interactions between the coating material and the drug product should be thoroughly evaluated.",M1

18608795,"Development of a novel nanocapsule formulation by emulsion-diffusion combined with high hydrostatic pressure.A common method used to prepare polymeric nanoparticles in <e>pharmaceutical</e> technology is emulsion-diffusion. However, this method has several disadvantages due to the long duration of the process. At the diffusion step of conventional emulsion-diffusion, high pressure treatment could replace the addition of great quantities of water resulting in diffusion of the solvents from the internal phase to the external phase. The objective of the present study was to develop a novel method for nanoparticle formulation by combining high pressure treatment with the emulsion-diffusion method to avoid an additional diffusion step in the aqueous phase. After emulsification at 11,000 rpm, the emulsions were pressurized at 100, 200 and 300 Mpa, each for 300, 600, 900 or 1200 s. The mean size and morphology of the nanoparticles were analysed by Mastersizer, TEM and SEM. The mean size of pressurized emulsion nanoparticles was the same at 100 MPa for holding times up to 600 s. Also, the pressurized emulsion nanoparticle size increased and the peak and width of the size distribution curve was higher and slightly narrower depending on the pressure and the holding time. This study shows that pressure treatment can produce polymer membranes surrounding the oil surface owing to the precipitation of PCL, inducing the diffusion of solvent from the interior to the exterior based on TEM images. From these results, it is believed that high pressure treatment should be considered as a successful alternative for preparing nanoparticles.",M1
18592450,"[Medical problems and risks of switching drugs according to legal requirements of drug discount contracts in Germany]INTRODUCTION: Since 2007 German health insurance funds may conclude discount contracts with <e>pharmaceutical</e> companies for individual drugs. According to German legislation pharmacies are liable to preferentially dispense these drugs to patients of the respective funds if the prescribed drug is identical regarding active ingredient, strength, package size, and route of administration, and is approved for the same indication. We aimed to assess the number and nature of clinically relevant differences between prescribed drug and its legal alternatives. METHODS: Using databases and expert systems of the drug information system AiD KLINIK we evaluated all 258 412 exchangeable drug pairs of the German market currently regulated by discount contracts. RESULTS: 15,7 % of the drug pairs differed in dosage, in one quarter each colour or shape was significantly different, and in roughly 3 % the size of the substituted drug differed by more than 50 %. In 9,43 % splitting characteristics of solid oral doses differed and in 1,87 % the substituted drug contained additives with allergenic potential not present in the primarily selected drug. On average 0,44 clinically relevant differences could be calculated in each substitution. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that current legal provision ignore important medical criteria of the substitution process including individual risks (e. g. allergies). Patients will have to change the drug application process and will therefore need appropriate information and training. All these differences between substitutional drug pairs should already be known when prescribing so as to maintain patient safety in the face of this merely cost-saving measure.",M1

18540840,"Strategies and therapeutic opportunities for the delivery of drugs to the esophagus.Targeting of drugs and therapies locally to the esophagus is an important objective in the development of new and more effective dosage forms. Therapies that are retained within the oral cavity for both local and systemic action have been utilized for many years, although delivery to the esophagus has been far less reported. Esophageal disease states, including infections, motility disorders, gastric reflux, and cancers, would all benefit from localized drug delivery. Therefore, research in this area provides significant opportunities. The key limitation to effective drug delivery within the esophagus is sufficient retention at this site coupled with activity profiles to correspond with these retention times; therefore, a suitable formulation needs to provide the drug in a ready-to-work form at the site of action during the rapid transit through this organ. A successfully designed esophageal-targeted system can overcome these obstacles. This review presents a range of dosage form approaches for targeting the esophagus, including bioadhesive liquids and orally retained lozenges, chewing gums, gels, and films, as well as endoscopically delivered therapeutics. The techniques used to measure efficacy both in vitro and in vivo are also discussed. Drug delivery is a growing driver within the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry and offers benefits both in terms of clinical efficacy, as well as in market positioning, as a means of extending a drug's exclusivity and profitability. Emerging systems that can be used to target the esophagus are reported within this review, as well as the potential of alternative formulations that offer benefits in this exciting area.",M1
18520056,"Long-term pharmacokinetic efficacy and safety of low-dose ritonavir as a booster and atazanavir <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulation based on solid dispersion system in rats.Atazanavir (ATV) is clinically coadministered with low-dose ritonavir (RTV), which boosts the oral bioavailability (BA) of ATV by inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) via the same metabolic pathway; however, it is well known that in the chronic phase, the inhibition effect of RTV on Pgp and CYP3A becomes an induction effect. In this study, we investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of RTV-boosted ATV in rats with a clinical relevant dosage of ATV and RTV, 7 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively, and drew a direct comparison with RTV-boosted ATV and the previously reported ATV pharmaceutical formulation based on a solid dispersion system (ATV-SLS SD+G). Rats received RTV-boosted ATV or ATV-SLS SD+G for 14 d in the pharmacokinetic study. In addition, after 14-d repeated administration of each formulation, cyclosporine A (CyA) was administered to rats and Western blot analysis of Pgp and CYP3A was performed to investigate the impact on pharmacokinetic interaction of each ATV formulation. After repeated administration of both formulations, there was no significant difference between ATV pharmacokinetic parameters on day 1 and 14; therefore, it was considered that the long-term efficacy of both ATV formulations was maintained. However, after treatment with RTV-boosted ATV, the Cmax and AUC0-infinity of the following CyA significantly decreased to 49% and 47% in comparison to the control, respectively, and the Pgp expression in the small intestine by Western blot analysis was approximately 2-fold higher than the control, whereas after treatment with ATV pharmaceutical formulation, neither significant alteration of CyA nor notable change in the expression of intestinal Pgp and hepatic CYP3A was observed. Therefore, it was considered that the BA of CyA after treatment with RTV-boosted ATV would decrease by the induction effect of RTV in chronic phase as described above. The results of this study revealed that the chronic use of low-dose RTV as a booster has great potential to compromise drug-drug interactions; therefore, it is recommended that the BA of protease inhibitors be improved by a pharmaceutical approach without pharmacokinetic interaction by RTV.",M1

The differences in the retention times (Delta t R) of diastereomers due to the five chiral reagents were compared. The maximum and minimum difference in retention times between separated diastereomers was for FDNP-L-Leu-NH2 and FDNP-L-Pro-NH2, respectively. The effect of flow rate, acetonitrile content and TFA concentration on resolution was studied. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, limit of detection and limit of quantification.",M1
18495552,"Voltammetric determination of coenzyme Q10 in <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms.A simple and rapid voltammetric method has been developed for the quantitative determination of coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) in pharmaceutical preparations. Studies with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were carried out using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in a mixed solvent containing 80 vol.% acetic acid and 20 vol.% acetonitrile. A well-defined reduction peak of CoQ(10) was obtained at -20 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The voltammetric technique applied provides a precise determination of CoQ(10) using the multiple standard addition method. The statistical parameters and the recovery study data clearly indicate good reproducibility and accuracy of the method. The accuracy of the results assessed by recovery trials was observed to be within the range of 101.1% to 102.5%. The detection and quantification limits were found to be 0.014 mM (12 mg L(-1)) and 0.046 mM (40 mg L(-1)), respectively. An analysis of real samples containing CoQ(10) showed no interferences with common additives and excipients, such as unsaturated fatty acids and soya lecithin. The method proposed does not require any pretreatment of the pharmaceutical dosage forms. A spectrophotometric determination of CoQ(10) in real samples diluted in mixtures containing ethanol and n-hexane was also performed for comparison.",M1
18479881,"Improved solid-state NMR quantifications of active principles in <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulations.The facility of implementation reached by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy makes this technique increasingly popular in pharmaceutical sciences, and more specifically for the dosage of active principles in pharmaceutical formulations, since about 80% of the formulations currently available on the market are present in the solid form. In this case, analysis by MAS NMR allows faster and simplified protocols, as a solubilization step is not required. However, the specificity of the ssNMR experiments should be explicitly taken into account when designing an accurate measurement procedure. In this work we show that, by using a combination of external concentration referencing and a properly designed sample preparation optimized for quantitative determinations, quantification of active principles in pharmaceutical formulations can be performed with both speed and precision. The method is illustrated by reinvestigating the dosage of Meprobamate, an anxiolytic agent typically prescribed in case of anxiety or muscular soreness, present in a commercial formulation (Equanil). Specifically, with respect to previously proposed analytical protocols, the procedure outlined here allows fast quantification with excellent precision.",M1
18467045,"Dry coating, a novel coating technology for solid <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms.Dry coating is a coating technology for solid pharmaceutical dosage forms derived from powder coating of metals. In this technology, powdered coating materials are directly coated onto solid dosage forms without using any solvent, and then heated and cured to form a coat. As a result, this technology can overcome such disadvantages caused by solvents in conventional liquid coating as serious air pollution, high time- and energy-consumption and expensive operation cost encountered by liquid coating. Several dry coating technologies, including plasticizer-dry-coating, electrostatic-dry-coating, heat-dry-coating and plasticizer-electrostatic-heat-dry-coating have been developed and extensively reported. This mini-review summarized the fundamental principles and coating processes of various dry coating technologies, and thoroughly analyzed their advantages and disadvantages as well as commercialization potentials.",M1
18462734,"Clinical efficacy of novel unidirectional buccoadhesive vs. vaginoadhesive bromocriptine mesylate discs for treating pathologic hyperprolactinemia.OBJECTIVE: To test the clinical effectiveness of new bioadhesive unidirectional buccal and vaginal bromocriptine methylate discs in hyperprolactinemic patients. DESIGN: A preliminary randomized comparative study. SETTING: A <e>pharmaceutical</e> phase at the departments of Pharmaceutics, Faculties of Pharmacy, Assiut and El-Minea universities and a clinical phase at the Infertility Out-patient Clinic of Women's Health University Center, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. PATIENT(S): A total of 42 patients with pathologic hyperprolactinemia. INTERVENTION(S): Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A comprised 21 patients who used unidirectional buccoadhesive bromocriptine methylate discs once daily for 1 month. Group B included 21 patients who used vaginoadhesive bromocriptine methylate discs once daily for 1 month. Serum prolactin (PRL) was measured before and after therapy in all cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Decline of serum PRL level after 1 month of therapy. RESULT(S): Pharmaceutically, tests for swelling, surface pH, in vitro and in vivo bioadhesion and in vitro release expressed satisfactory results. The in vitro release of vaginal bromocriptine from the discs is increased in pH 4.5 media. Both groups showed a highly statistically significant reduction of serum PRL levels after 1 month of therapy without any significant difference between both groups. The decline of serum PRL was not correlated with age, parity, or indication of entering into this study. CONCLUSION(S): Both buccoadhesive and vaginoadhesive discs containing bromocriptine are of equal efficacy for treating pathologic hyperprolactinemia. Buccoadhesive discs have the advantages of being gender nonspecific (i.e., could be used by men), avoiding manipulating the vagina, which could be inconvenient to some patients, such as virgins; not being dependent on cyclic estrogen (E) levels; and could be easily used during menstruation.",M1
18451628,"[Questionnaire survey of patients comparing the usability of brand-name and generic ketoprofen tapes]Since patients who used brand-name and generic ketoprofen (KP) tapes dispensed in the Fukuoka City <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Association Pharmacy complained of a difference in feeling between the two products, we conducted a questionnaire survey in patients using KP tapes to determine the usability of brand-name and generic tapes. Patients receiving the brand-name KP tape (product A) and/or a generic KP tape (product B) in our pharmacy were interviewed concerning 20 items including 1) dosage regimen, 2) outer package, 3) liner, 4) the tape itself, and 5) condition of application sites. A significant difference in usability between products A and B was observed in 4 of the 20 items evaluated, i.e., 1) easiness of opening of the outer pouch, 2) easiness of removing the liner film, 3) condition of the application site after removal of the tape, and 4) relief of pain in the target lesion after application. As suggested by patients who had complained of a difference in usability between products A and B, the participants in the survey tended to prefer the brand-name KP tape to the generic product. The findings of the survey indicate that when a brand-name product is switched to generic products, pharmacists should evaluate the usability of such products carefully to select those that will ensure proper drug use by patients.",M1
18420396,"Thermodynamic behavior of glassy state of structurally related compounds.Thermodynamic properties of amorphous <e>pharmaceutical</e> forms are responsible for enhanced solubility as well as poor physical stability. The present study was designed to investigate the differences in thermodynamic parameters arising out of disparate molecular structures and associations for four structurally related pharmaceutical compounds--celecoxib, valdecoxib, rofecoxib, and etoricoxib. Conventional and modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry were employed to study glass forming ability and thermodynamic behavior of the glassy state of model compounds. Glass transition temperature of four glassy compounds was in a close range of 327.6-331.8 K, however, other thermodynamic parameters varied considerably. Kauzmann temperature, strength parameter and fragility parameter showed rofecoxib glass to be most fragile of the four compounds. Glass forming ability of the compounds fared similar in the critical cooling rate experiments, suggesting that different factors were determining the glass forming ability and subsequent behavior of the compounds in glassy state. A comprehensive understanding of such thermodynamic facets of amorphous form would help in rationalizing the approaches towards development of stable glassy pharmaceuticals.",M1
18393808,"Use of microwave in processing of drug delivery systems.Microwave has received a widespread application in <e>pharmaceuticals</e> and food processing, microbial sterilization, biomedical therapy, scientific and biomedical analysis, as well as, drug synthesis. This paper reviews the basis of application of microwave to prepare pharmaceutical dosage forms such as agglomerates, gel beads, microspheres, nanomatrix, solid dispersion, tablets and film coat. The microwave could induce drying, polymeric crosslinkages as well as drug-polymer interaction, and modify the structure of drug crystallites via its effects of heating and/or electromagnetic field on the dosage forms. The use of microwave opens a new approach to control the physicochemical properties and drug delivery profiles of pharmaceutical dosage forms without the need for excessive heat, lengthy process or toxic reactants. Alternatively, the microwave can be utilized to process excipients prior to their use in the formulation of drug delivery systems. The intended release characteristics of drugs in dosage forms can be met through modifying the physicochemical properties of excipients using the microwave.",M1
18390440,"Formulation development and optimization of Ibuprofen tablets by direct compression method.Ibuprofen is widely used as a prescription and non-prescription medicine. The aim of study is to prepare Ibuprofen tablets (200mg) using direct compression technique which is now days considered a cost effective and simple method of manufacturing. It is considered as an appropriate method for hygroscopic and thermolabile substances. In order to obtain the best, optimized product, nine different formulations were developed. Diluent (X1), disintegrant (X2) and lubricant (X3) were taken as independent variables. Weight variation (Y1), thickness (Y2), length and width (Y3), hardness (Y4), friability (Y5), disintegration (Y6), dissolution (Y7) and <e>pharmaceutical</e> assay (Y8) were studied as response variables. The results of all nine formulations were found within the acceptable limits conforming to those given in official compendia. However, F-6 was selected as an optimized product on the basis of high dissolution (99.05%) and Assay (100.04%). The variation of weight among the tablets of F-6 was least which showed best ratio of excipients in the formulation. Optimization has proven as an effective tool in product development. This is because no clear relationship exists between the variables.",M1
18387769,"Detection of Lipitor counterfeits: a comparison of NIR and Raman spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics.Research has been carried on the feasibility of near infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy as rapid screening methods to discriminate between genuine and counterfeits of the cholesterol-lowering medicine Lipitor. Classification, based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models, appears to be successful for both spectroscopic techniques, irrespective of whether atorvastatine or lovastatine has been used as the active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient (API). The discriminative power of the NIR model, in particular, largely relies on the spectral differences of the tablet matrix. This is due to the relative large sample volume that is probed with NIR and the strong spectroscopic activity of the excipients. PLS-DA models based on NIR or Raman spectra can also be applied to distinguish between atorvastatine and lovastatine as the API used in the counterfeits tested in this study. A disadvantage of Raman microscopy for this type of analysis is that it is primarily a surface technique. As a consequence spectra of the coating and the tablet core might differ. Besides, spectra may change with the position of the laser in case the sample is inhomogeneous. However, the robustness of the PLS-DA models turned out to be sufficiently large to allow a reliable discrimination. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the spectra revealed that the conditions, at which tablets have been stored, affect the NIR data. This effect is attributed to the adsorption of water from the atmosphere after unpacking from the blister. It implies that storage conditions should be taken into account when the NIR technique is used for discriminating purposes. However, in this study both models based on NIR spectra and Raman data enabled reliable discrimination between genuine and counterfeited Lipitor tablets, regardless of their storage conditions.",M1
18337210,"A sensitive spectrophotometric method for the determination of H2-receptor antagonists by means of N-bromosuccinimide and p-aminophenol.A simple, accurate and sensitive spectrophotometric method for determination of H2-receptor antagonists: cimetidine (CIM), famotidine (FAM), nizatidine (NIZ), and ranitidine hydrochloride (RAN) has been fully developed and validated. The method was based on the reaction of these drugs with NBS and subsequent measurement of the excess N-bromosuccinimide by its reaction with p-aminophenol to give a violet colored product (lambda max at 552 nm). Decrease in the absorption intensity (Delta A) of the colored product, due to the presence of the drug, was correlated with its concentration in the sample solution. Different variables affecting the reaction were carefully studied and optimized. Under optimal conditions, linear relationships with good correlation coefficients (0.9988-0.9998) were found between Delta A values and the corresponding concentrations of the drugs in a concentration range of 8-30, 6-22, 6-25, and 4-20 microg mL(-1) for CIM, FAM, NIZ, and RAN, respectively. Limits of detection were 1.22, 1.01, 1.08, and 0.74 microg mL(-1) for CIM, FAM, NIZ, and RAN, respectively. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, ruggedness, and robustness; the results were satisfactory. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of the above mentioned drugs in bulk substance and in <e>pharmaceutical</e> dosage forms; percent recoveries ranged from 98.5 +/- 0.9 to 102.4 +/- 0.8% without interference from the common excipients.

18298125,"Difficulties in the production of identical drug products from a <e>pharmaceutical</e> technology viewpoint.Generic products reduce healthcare expenditure and create market competition, and it is broadly assumed that these drugs are identical to the original branded reference drug product. In practice, despite legislation demanding demonstration of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence, thereby ensuring the safety and efficacy of the product, generic products can differ significantly from the reference drug and amongst themselves, particularly in terms of pharmacokinetic properties. These differences most often relate to pharmaceutical technical differences in production of the active principle ingredient (e.g. different crystalline forms or particle size), to use of excipients (such as sugars) or to the manufacturing process itself (such as tablet manufacture). Furthermore, from the patient's perspective, changing from branded to generic drugs can give rise to concerns about switching. Although sufficient safeguards exist to ensure patient safety and generic drug efficacy, it should not be assumed that all generics are entirely identical.",M1

The method involved the alkaline hydrolysis of the studied drugs by warming with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution then dilution with distilled water for NX or 2-propanol for NT and NZ. The formed fluorophores were measured at 465 nm (lambda (Ex) 265 nm), 458 nm (lambda (Ex) 245 nm) and 445 nm (lambda (Ex) 245 nm) for NX, NT and NZ, respectively. The reaction pathway was discussed and the structures of the fluorescent products were proposed. The different experimental parameters were studied and optimized. Regression analysis showed good correlation between fluorescence intensity and concentration over the ranges 0.08-1.00, 0.02-0.24 and 0.004-0.050 microg ml(-1) for NX, NT and NZ, respectively. The limits of detection of the method were 8.0, 1.9 and 0.3 ng ml(-1) for NX, NT and NZ, respectively.

18239377,"[Some problems for dosage form based on questionnaire surveying compliance in patients taking tamsulosin hydrochloride]After the dosage form of tamsulosin hydrochloride was changed from a capsule to on orally disintegrating tablet (ODT, Harnal D), we often received patient complaints and noted an increase in noncompliance with medication regimens. The change in dosage form appeared to cause poor compliance by patients who had become accustomed to the light pink/white capsule over many years. Therefore, we carried out a questionnaire survey of patients taking the ODT form to determine the effects of changing the dosage form and the usefulness of the ODT. Most (92%) of respondents took the ODT with water. In addition, 16% missed taking the medicine after the change in dosage form. ODT is a dosage form that is easy to take for patient with dysphagia, or those on restricted water intake. However, it appears that elderly men and patients with visual disorders cannot distinguish the ODT from other medicines and this affects patient compliance. In conclusion, all <e>pharmaceutical</e> companies should consider the design of medications in terms of coloration, indications, or shape in anticipation of the aging society in future, so that patients can distinguish them. Furthermore, sufficient pharmaceutical care is needed to improve both compliance and safety management for the elderly.",M1
18236775,"Development of an analytical method for the evaluation of N,N-dimethylformamide in dosage form design.N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a well-known chemical entity that is extensively used for <e>pharmaceutical</e>, biomedical and chemical applications. Previous research identified the need for the development of an effective dosage form for the systemic delivery of DMF due to its unique antiviral properties. For purposes of quality control and evaluation during pharmaceutical product development, development of an analytical method was required. A gas chromatographic (GC) method was developed with a flame-ionization detector (FID) on a carbowax packed glass column. 2-Methoxyethanol was used as internal standard. The analytical method proved to be capable of separating DMF and 2-methoxyethanol adequately within a relatively short runtime of 2.5 min. The analytical method described was primarily developed for use in dissolution studies of DMF containing delivery systems. Various physicochemical properties of candidate internal standard materials were correlated with the observed retention times of these compounds. The best correlation (r2 = 0.8077) was obtained between the boiling point and the retention time of the compounds for the current application. The boiling point of an internal standard candidate material may thereforebe useful in predicting the retention time of that compound under similar conditions.",M1

To confirm the validity of the vane rheological technique used, and facilitate intuitive understanding of the data, similar data were collected for a commercial shaving foam. Of the physico-chemical parameters that were evaluated, rheological properties were distinct among hydroethanolic, emulsion, and aqueous aerosol foam types.

18185986,"<e>Pharmaceutical</e> quality by design: product and process development, understanding, and control.PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the pharmaceutical Quality by Design (QbD) and describe how it can be used to ensure pharmaceutical quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The QbD was described and some of its elements identified. Process parameters and quality attributes were identified for each unit operation during manufacture of solid oral dosage forms. The use of QbD was contrasted with the evaluation of product quality by testing alone. RESULTS: The QbD is a systemic approach to pharmaceutical development. It means designing and developing formulations and manufacturing processes to ensure predefined product quality. Some of the QbD elements include: Defining target product quality profile; Designing product and manufacturing processes; Identifying critical quality attributes, process parameters, and sources of variability; Controlling manufacturing processes to produce consistent quality over time. CONCLUSIONS: Using QbD, pharmaceutical quality is assured by understanding and controlling formulation and manufacturing variables. Product testing confirms the product quality. Implementation of QbD will enable transformation of the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) review of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) into a science-based pharmaceutical quality assessment.",M1
18181555,"Properties of pellets manufactured by wet extrusion/spheronization process using kappa-carrageenan: effect of process parameters.The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pelletization process parameters of kappa-carrageenan-containing formulations. The study dealt with the effect of 4 process parameters--screw speed, number of die holes, friction plate speed, and spheronizer temperature--on the pellet properties of shape, size, size distribution, tensile strength, and drug release. These parameters were varied systematically in a 2(4) full factorial design. In addition, 4 drugs--phenacetin, chloramphenicol, dimenhydrinate, and lidocaine hydrochloride--were investigated under constant process conditions. The most spherical pellets were achieved in a high yield by using a large number of die holes and a high spheronizer speed. There was no relevant influence of the investigated process parameters on the size distribution, mechanical stability, and drug release. The poorly soluble drugs, phenacetin and chloramphenicol, resulted in pellets with adequate shape, size, and tensile strength and a fast drug release. The salts of dimenhydrinate and lidocaine affected pellet shape, mechanical stability, and the drug release properties using an aqueous solution of pH 3 as a granulation liquid. In the case of dimenhydrinate, this was attributed to the ionic interactions with kappa-carrageenan, resulting in a stable matrix during dissolution that did not disintegrate. The effect of lidocaine is comparable to the effect of sodium ions, which suppress the gelling of carrageenan, resulting in pellets with fast disintegration and drug release characteristics. The pellet properties are affected by the process parameters and the active <e>pharmaceutical</e> ingredient used.",M1

The qualification of the newly developed sensor was performed by drying placebo granules under experimental conditions and the validation using drug loaded granules under real process conditions. The results of the investigations show good correlations between water content of the granules determined by the microwave resonance sensor and both reference methods, loss on drying by infrared light exposure and Karl Fischer titration.

Various approaches have been adopted to address this including preparation of solid dispersions and solid solutions. Hot-melt extrusion is an efficient technology for producing solid molecular dispersions with considerable advantages over solvent-based processes such as spray drying and co-precipitation. Hot-melt extrusion has been demonstrated to provide sustained, modified, and targeted drug delivery. Improvements in bioavailability utilizing the hot-melt extrusion technique demonstrate the value of the technology as a potential drug delivery processing tool. The interest in hot-melt extrusion technology for pharmaceutical applications is evident from the increasing number of patents and publications in the scientific literature. Part II of this article reviews the myriad of hot-melt extrusion applications for pharmaceutical dosage forms including granules, pellets, tablets, implants, transmucosal, and transdermal systems.",M1

Additionally, methods to measure diffusion in gels, bioadhesives, and for monitoring microenvironmental pH change within dosage forms have been utilised. CLSM has also been used in the study of the physical interaction of dosage forms with biological barriers such as the eye, skin and intestinal epithelia, and in particular, to determine the effectiveness of a plethora of pharmaceutical systems to deliver drugs through these barriers.

19230311,"[Mineral water as a cure]The treatment of diseases with mineral spring water belongs to the oldest medical therapies. The  remedy  mineral water is therefore of importance also within the pharmacy. The present pharmacy historical work examines the impact of the use of mineral waters, as well as of their dried components, as therapeutic agents in the 19th and early 20th centuries, i.e. from approx. 1810 to 1930, as well as the contributions given by pharmacists in the development and analysis of mineral water springs. Beside these aspects, the aim here is also to describe the role played by pharmacists in the production of artificial mineral water as well as in the sale and wholesale of natural and artificial mineral water. In the first part of this work the situation in Switzerland and its surrounding countries, such as Germany, France, Italy and Austria, is discussed. The second part contains a case-study of the particular situation in the Canton Tessin. It is known from the scientific literature published at that time that information on mineral water was frequently reported. Starting from the beginning of the 19th century the number of such publications increased tremendously. The major part of them were publications in scientific journals or contributions to medical and <e>pharmaceutical</e> manuals and reference books. In particular the spa-related literature, such as spa-guides, was of growing interest to a broad public. The inclusion of monographs into the Swiss, the Cantonal as well the foreign pharmacopoeias granted a legal frame for the mineral waters and their dried components. These works are of major importance from a pharmacy historical standpoint and represent a unique proof of historical evidence of the old medicinal drug heritage. The most frequently used therapies based on mineral waters were drinking and bath cures. Several diseases, particularly those of a chronic character, were treated with mineral waters. The positive influence of these cures on the recovery of the patients was to attribute, on the one hand to the physico-chemical properties of the water and on the other hand to the climatic, nutritional and social factors characterising the selected health resort. All over Europe, pharmacists were dealing with mineral waters, among them even very famous names such as Klaproth, Trommsdorf, Lampadius and Fresenius. They were on one side involved in the development and analysis of the waters, while on the other side they were interested in their artificial production. Their knowledge and findings in the area of the mineral water source chemistry gave a crucial impetus to the future evolution of analytic chemistry. Following the improvements in the precision of analysis and classification of the composition of the mineral waters, the imitation of artificial mineral waters increased significantly. Certain pharmacists tried to copy well-known mineral waters in their properly furnished laboratories. At the same time, pharmacies were important sales points: natural and artificial mineral waters as well as their dried components were either sold there, or delivered upon prescription. In the second part of this work, specifically concerning the situation in the Canton Tessin, the most important local sources and spa resorts are described, as well as the analyses performed and the researchers involved. Moreover, the types of therapies used at that time are mentioned. The integration of the local mineral waters into the pharmacopoeia of the Canton Tessin, the Farmacopea Ticinese, is also discussed. Of particular interest are the delivery and the sale of mineral waters and their dried components by a local pharmacy. In the Canton Tessin, the five most frequented spa resorts were Acquarossa, Brissago, Craveggia, Rovio and Stabio. Craveggia spa resort is of course based in Italy; it has however been included in the present work due to its proximity to Switzerland and to a connected historical Substantial differences existed among the individual health resorts mentioned, especially regarding the quality and quantity aspects of the performed mineral water analyses, as well as in the reported written evidence and publications on the success of the therapies. Differences were also to be found in the conditions of the health resort facilities and in the medical support given. The therapy opportunities included mainly drinking and bath cures, which could occur alone or in combination. In the mentioned health resorts different clinical disease symptoms were treated. The most important baths were located in Acquarossa and Stabio, which were specialized in selected therapeutical domains, because of their particular water compositions. Numerous personalities from science and politics were concerned by the local springs and accepted to contribute to the promotion of these structures. Their engagement led to the integration of the native springs in the Farmacopea Ticinese. Since at that time it was extremely difficult to find experienced mineral water analysts in the region, the analyses of local native sources were assigned to qualified experts mainly coming from Italy. This scientific co-operation between the southern part of Switzerland and the northern part of Italy was, already at that time, active also in other work domains. The evaluation of the historical documentation available from the Farmacia Vantussi shows that this pharmacy supplied a considerable assortment of national and foreign spring waters, as well as foreign dried components. Of commercial interest was, to be noted, the free sale of the waters to hospitals, institutions, hotels, restaurants as well as to private households. The sales of waters and of their dried components upon prescription, however, constituted only the minor part. The introduction of the industrial bottling occurring in the first decades of the 20th century, led to a lowering price trend, through which the product 'mineral water' became accessible to a broader public. Henceforth its importance as welfare and medicinal water decreased and the product was considered purely as table water and as a foodstuff. As a consequence this new function brought the sales of mineral waters into the hands of depots and wholesalers, and later on also to retailers, while concomitantly pharmacies turned away from this kind of business.",M2

The goal of the project was to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of our approaches in meeting &lt;797&gt; requirements. METHODS: USP &lt;797&gt; standards, radiation safety concerns, and work-flow patterns were the focal points in our assessment of 4 laboratories: 2 nuclear pharmacy laboratories that engage in preparing sterile (low-, medium-, and high-risk levels), nonsterile, or possible hazardous radioactive drugs and 2 other laboratories in which only low-risk-level preparations are involved. RESULTS: Each laboratory was constructed with a physically separated International Organization for Standardization Class 7 anteroom and clean room to allow us to maintain an appropriate air quality, a consistent operation, and a desirable flexibility. An isolated area within the laboratory was designated for preparing nonsterile products. Higher air change per hour was used in the areas with higher traffic or smaller space. Lead-lined biological safety cabinets (BSCs) were segregated and used depending on the risk category of the preparations. In 1 laboratory, the exhaust flow for the BSC was too great, and a lead-lined compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI) was installed. Air in the BSC and CACI was 100% exhausted to the atmosphere. 99Mo/99mTc generators were placed in the negative-pressure clean room to ensure a more efficient operation and cleaner air environment. Clean-room equipment (i.e., keyboards, printers, and telephones) was installed, and refrigerators or freezers and the central-processing unit of each computer were placed outside clean room. CONCLUSION: Our wide-range preparations of sterile, nonsterile, or potential hazardous radiopharmaceuticals, coupled with the limited space of each laboratory and existing antiquated mechanical systems, presented a challenge. Nevertheless, we successfully remodeled each nuclear pharmacy laboratory to meet USP &lt;797&gt; requirements for facility design and environmental controls.",M2

METHODS: Relevant journals were accessed from PubMed, International <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Abstracts, EMBASE, and the Pharmacology and Pharmacy category of Thomson Scientific Journal Citation Reports. Criteria were established to select journals that satisfied the definition of pharmacy focused. Journals were assessed based on accessibility, copyright transfer requirements, and restrictions. If tracked, the journal's impact factor (IF) was identified according to classification, and medians were calculated for each journal category. RESULTS: A total of 317 pharmacy-focused journals were identified. The majority of pharmacy-focused journals identified were traditional/non-OA (n = 240). A smaller number of journals were freely accessible/ non-OA (n = 37), freely accessible/non-OA with content restrictions (n = 20), or freely available/non-OA with date restrictions (n = 18). The fewest number of journals were completely OA (n = 2). The median IF for the 185 journals whose IF was tracked was 2.029.

This potentially inappropriate co-prescribing practice is a Quality Use of Medicine issue. This study aimed to quantify the extent of co-prescribing of topical and systemic beta-blockers in Australian clinical practice. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of de-identified billing data for supply (surrogate marker for prescribing) of topical and systemic beta-blockers from the <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Benefits Scheme (1999-2004) to concessional patients supplied either topical or systemic beta-blockers. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients supplied systemic beta-blockers within the patient population supplied topical beta-blockers. This percentage was calculated for each financial year (July 1999-June 2004), age group (&lt;65 years; 65-74 years; 75-84 years; &gt; or =85 years) and sex. RESULTS: Approximately 20% of patients supplied topical beta-blockers (representing Australian glaucoma patients) were also supplied systemic beta-blockers, equating to more than 20 000 patients per year. This percentage varied with age, but not with year or sex. The percentage of patients co-supplied topical and systemic beta-blockers was the lowest (13%) for patients &lt;65 years and the highest (23%) for patients 75-84 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme supply data shows that the potentially inappropriate practice of co-prescribing topical and systemic beta-blockers affects more than 20 000 concessional patients in Australia each year, particularly the elderly. This Quality Use of Medicine issue has now been quantified; doctors, pharmacists and patients must be made aware of the reduced efficacy and potential for more side-effects from this co-prescribing practice.",M2
17993176,"[Apollinaire Bouchardat and his Formulaire magistral]The anniversary of Bouchardat two centuries ago (1806) is a opportunity to reanalyse his book Nouveau Formulaire Magistral, published during more than 90 years (1840-1932), and to emphasize its interest for historians. This book, addressed to physicians and pharmacists, is a huge source of information on health care during the XIXth century. One can find data on Paris' hospitals, as well as usual <e>pharmaceutical</e> formulas or information on spa. Bouchardat and its formulary reflect also the main opinions during this century where pharmaceutical specialties are not well accepted by health care professionals who considered that it was a way for the patients to take care of their diseases without the control of a physician. Bouchardat is also a precursor if one consider that a number of similar books were published after the late phase of the XIXth century to help doctors to prescribe properly the drugs. Some of them will be published on several years, as for the Bouchardat's formulary. Finally, Bouchardat appears as an encyclopaedist of pharmacy and medicine. He succeeded to give a unique synthesis of state of the art information for his time, using his double training of pharmacist and physician. It is probably why this book survived more than 40 years after the death of the initial author.",M2

Without pharmaceutical skills, pharmacists cannot apply the essence of drug therapies for patients in the most urgent 24 hours treatment. To cope with these drug therapies, we have developed search methods which easily identify the diachronic change of protein binding and the factors in serum (=a new pharmaceutical distribution diagnostic method). This method can speculate diachronic change factors in serum, by monitoring diachronically binding capacities of drug binding sites on human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) molecules in patient sera (add each site probe to each patient serum, and measure the free level of each probe by using TDX/FLX analyzer and HPLC detector), and considering the binding capacities and values of HSA, AGP, free fatty acids, bilirubin (Bil) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) associating with the amounts of uremic toxins laboratory tests. In addition, the diagnostic method could attempt effective administration by using the protein binding displacement of drugs that have a high protein binding capacity and small distribution volume, or high targeting (=the pharmaceutical skill of protein binding displacement). We have practiced pain control of patients with rheumatoid arthritis by the pharmaceutical skill. It is important for pharmacists to master the pharmaceutical skill in pharmacotherapy.",M2

METHODS: A questionnaire study of current postgraduate year 1 and postgraduate year 2 pharmacy residents was conducted. Questions were adapted from instruments used in studies of medical student or physician attitudes regarding the pharmaceutical industry. The questionnaire requested demographic information about the resident, information regarding the resident's exposure to specific types of pharmaceutical company-related activities, and the resident's perception of whether the residency program or department had policies or guidelines regarding interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. Questions investigated the attitudes toward pharmaceutical industry promotion and the perceived influence of pharmaceutical industry promotion on the professional knowledge and behavior of the residents. RESULTS: Responses were received from 496 pharmacy residents. Nearly all (89%) residents agreed that pharmaceutical company-sponsored educational events enhance knowledge. Almost half (43%) of the respondents reported that information from educational events influences therapeutic recommendations. One quarter (26%) of the pharmacy residents indicated prior training regarding pharmacist-industry interactions, and most (60%) residents indicated that their institution's residencies or departments have policies regarding interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. CONCLUSION: Most surveyed pharmacy residents believed that educational events sponsored by pharmaceutical companies enhance knowledge.

Overview of key concepts in multicultural health care.Pharmacists are caring for more individuals of diverse age, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, sexual orientation, and health beliefs than in previous decades. Not all residents of the United States equally experience long life spans and good health. Health disparities in various cultures have been documented. One critical aspect of reducing health disparities is moving health care providers, staff, administrators, and practices toward increased cultural competence and proficiency. Effective delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate service in cross-cultural settings is identified as cultural competence. Culture is a dynamic process, with people moving in and out of various cultures throughout their lives. The failure to understand and respect individuals and their cultures could impede <e>pharmaceutical</e> care. Incongruent beliefs and expectations between the patient and pharmacist could lead to misunderstandings, confusion, and ultimately to drug misadventures. Models and frameworks have been developed that provide descriptions of the process by which individuals, practice settings, and organizations can become culturally competent and proficient. This article, the first in a five-part series, presents an overview of issues related to cultural competence in health care with an emphasis on the pharmacy profession.

METHODS: A 35-item, electronic questionnaire was developed to obtain data on the type of residency program or geographic setting and the RPD's practice setting, job title, faculty rank, education and training, length of practice, length of time served as an RPD, and certifications obtained. RESULTS: Of 717 surveys, 327 were completed. More than one third of all RPDs were currently BPS certified compared with a 30% RPD certification rate according to the BPS directory. A higher percentage of PGY2 RPDs were BPS certified overall compared with PGY1 RPDs. Eighty-two RPDs had completed an ASHP-accredited specialized residency program and were more likely to be BPS certified. CONCLUSION: In a survey of RPDs, more than one third of the respondents were BPS certified; professional and personal development was the most common motivation to earn certification. New pharmacy residency accreditation standards did not appear to be an important motivator for certification. Of the RPDs who will require board certification with the new standards, 71% already met the requirement. RPDs who practiced in academia or focused on critical care were more likely to be certified than those with training or positions in community practice or practice management.",M2

METHOD AND SETTING: Data was collected using pre-tested semi-structured interview guides. A total of 15 pharmacists from nine African countries were interviewed. The analysis used a phenomenographic approach where categorisation with regard to differences in expressed perceptions of the pharmacist's role was made. MAIN OUTCOME: Perceptions on pharmacy practice in Africa as expressed by pharmacists from nine African countries. RESULTS: Four qualitatively different ways of perceiving the pharmacist's role were identified and sorted into subcategories under the two main categories A and B as follows A. <e>Pharmaceutical</e> information provider with the sub-categories: A1. The satisfied dispenser, and A2. The dissatisfied dispenser; and B. Health care provider, with the sub-categories: B1. The health care team member, and B2. The lifesaver. In category A, the pharmacist is described foremost as a provider of pharmaceuticals and information with a distinction being made with regard to whether the interviewees expressed dissatisfaction with their situation or not. In category B, the pharmacist was described as a provider of health care and two different approaches to this were found. CONCLUSION: The study describes different ways of perceiving the role of the pharmacist in nine African countries.

Some category labels describe drugs from multiple perspectives (e.g., both structure and function). The National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF RT) is a drug information source that augments a  legacy  categorization system with a formal reference model specifying Chemical Structure, Cellular or Sub-Cellular Mechanism of Action, Organ- or System-Level Physiological Effect, and Therapeutic Intent categories. We examined drug category names from three sources to better understand their information content and evaluate NDF RT's semantic coverage. On average, category names contain more than 1.5 attributes. NDF RT's reference model covers more than 76% of the information identified in drug category labels. A new NDF RT reference axis of drug formulations could improve NDF RT's coverage to 85%. The distinction between Physiological Effect and Therapeutic Intent, prompted many questions among category reviewers, suggesting that further clarification of these reference concepts is required.

For this reason, we have set up pharmaceutical counselling for hospitalized patients treated with OA. The object of this article is to describe this therapeutic education program and to present the level of knowledge that patients have of their OA treatment.

17077256,"Revisiting pharmacists' refusals to dispense emergency contraception.Pharmacists' refusals to fill prescriptions for emergency contraceptives for reasons of conscience have contributed to a national debate regarding the permissibility of such actions. Some in the medical community assert that pharmacists ought not to refuse to dispense emergency contraceptives on this basis. Three lines of argument have become prominent in defense of that position: 1) the professional status of pharmacists does not allow for refusal to dispense legitimately written prescriptions, 2) the medical facts regarding the mechanism of action of emergency contraception are often misunderstood, misrepresented, or both, and 3) refusals by pharmacists to fill legitimate prescriptions undermine patient care. In this commentary, these arguments are rejected as missing the central point of the issue, which is that pharmacists are autonomous, moral agents who are accountable for their choices and entitled-within limits-to decide in which activities they will participate. Pharmacists' professionalism is defended, their responsibilities in the provision of drug therapy are set forth in the context of <e>pharmaceutical</e> care, and these lead to the conclusion that pharmacists' refusals may be ethically justified. There are important limits on how pharmacists may respond when they are being asked to participate in actions they find morally objectionable.

Both census surveys aimed to gather empirical data on the employment profile of pharmacists to aid the workforce planning process. The aim of this paper is to compare the work profile and employment destination of two graduate cohorts of pharmacists to explore what changes take place in employment practices and how quickly they occur. SETTING: GB-based pharmacists. METHODS: A two-page postal questionnaire was sent to 38,000 GB-registered pharmacists in August 2003, to provide various data on employment patterns, intentions to work abroad, and desire to practise pharmacy. The pharmacists were contacted using addresses stored on the <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Register, a statutory record of all pharmacists and pharmacy premises held by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB). A sub-set of this large data set--pharmacists who qualified in 1992 and those who qualified in 1997--was selected for comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sector of employment and strength of desire to practice. RESULTS: A response rate of 75% was achieved for the overall census, while the response rate from the two graduation cohorts was 62% and 58%. Larger proportions of women compared with men, even after only 5 years of working as a pharmacist, are either not working or work part-time. Among the women, these patterns increase significantly for those with a greater number of years on the Pharmaceutical Register. There is evidence that pharmacists move out of the two main sectors of practice (hospital and community) with increasing years on the Register, and some gender differences in job mobility are observed. The School of Pharmacy from which pharmacists graduate appears to have some effect on practice patterns although more research is needed to explore this further. Desire to practise pharmacy is weaker among those practitioners who work in the community sector of practice, and younger pharmacists are more likely to intend working abroad. CONCLUSIONS: Part-time work patterns are implemented fairly quickly after qualifying, particularly among the women pharmacists. Given that female students account for over 60% of all intake onto pharmacy courses current supply problems will continue if work patterns continue along this trajectory. The ability of the profession to meet current, never mind extended roles, is thus called into question.",M2

The professions have access to knowledge of improved therapies that cover a large selection of diagnoses. This state of affairs is a successful result of the long and purposeful co-operation between science and technology, theory and practice. The therapies have changed but their delivery to the patient remains the same. During the recent international recession and the continuous cost containment programmes the question of availability has risen to the fore. Availability is a question of means. That is usually interpreted as equal to saving and cost cutting. At times of affluence it could mean allowance but that seems far in the past. Availability also concerns the physical distribution of the therapies such as pharmaceuticals. So far, advances in the science have not affected either the distribution or availability of pharmaceutical products. With the rise in patient awareness, pressure is rising to make full use of the research results. This is a natural, albeit unmet, demand and represents an opportunity for the pharmacy institutions with their well trained personnel, modern outlets and the unique as well as traditional position in direct contact with the patients. This role could gain added weight through the progress of the technologies that allow ambulatory therapies instead of cost consuming institutionalisation.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Medline, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts), associations/health care organizations Web sites, outside reports, and clinical pharmacists involved in certification processes. STUDY SELECTION: Studies and reports that addressed the value of specialty certification were selected by the authors. DATA EXTRACTION: By the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmacists with specialty certification report enhanced feelings of self-worth, improved competence, and greater marketability. Other values of certification include increased acceptance by health care professionals, salary increases, and job promotions. Employers have acknowledged board-certified pharmacists through public recognition, increase in responsibility, and some types of monetary compensation. In some governmental organizations, certified pharmacists receive salary raises and are granted prescribing authority. However, the overall value of specialty certification in pharmacy as perceived by the public or payers lags behind when compared with the status of specialty certification in medicine. CONCLUSION: Board-certified pharmacists appreciate the value of pharmacy specialty certification, and in a number of organizations and practice settings, board-certified pharmacists are perceived as valuable. Still, unlike board-certified physicians, board-certified pharmacists are not widely recognized outside or even within the pharmacy profession.

15260471,"Lack of awareness of need to clean CFC-free metered-dose inhalers.BACKGROUND: Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) were introduced into Australia in 1999. Device care instructions were modified (e.g., CFC-free salbutamol inhalers to be washed weekly), but this information was not communicated directly to health care professionals. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to assess the level of awareness of device care protocols for CFC-free MDIs by patients and their pharmacists. SETTING AND DESIGN: Purchasers of CFC-free MDIs were recruited from four community pharmacies. They were interviewed regarding information sources, knowledge of propellant change, and awareness of and adherence to device care protocols. The dispensing pharmacists were interviewed for knowledge of CFC-free device care. The primary outcome variable was awareness of the relevant device care protocol. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were interviewed. Most patients (77%) were aware of the change to CFC-free propellant. Only nine patients (23%) were aware of the need to wash the device holder, and four patients (10% of total) complied with the specified protocol. One of the ten dispensing pharmacists could describe correct device care protocols for the CFC-free MDIs. CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients are aware that MDIs are now CFC-free, there is a low level of awareness of the device care required for these inhalers, and a very low rate of compliance with recommended practice. Although the clinical impact of failing to wash the device holder is unclear, this added instruction may have substantial implications for patient satisfaction and medication delivery. <e>Pharmaceutical</e> manufacturers need to highlight to health care professionals any clinically important changes in device care instructions, so that appropriate information may be passed on to patients.",M2

Targeting an outcome that matters.The shift in emphasis of healthcare from dealing only with disease and death to also managing illness, meant that healthcare providers started to realise the importance of assessing the quality of the patient's life as a new therapeutic outcome. This is equally true in the evolving concept of pharmaceutical care, the ultimate target of which is improving the patient's quality of life (QoL) through a cooperative alliance between the pharmacist and the patient.

15199191,"Statistics in the pharmacy literature.BACKGROUND: Research in statistical methods is essential for maintenance of high quality of the published literature. OBJECTIVE: To update previous reports of the types and frequencies of statistical terms and procedures in research studies of selected professional pharmacy journals. METHODS: We obtained all research articles published in 2001 in 6 journals: American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, The Annals of Pharmacotherapy, Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, Formulary, Hospital Pharmacy, and Journal of the American <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Association. Two independent reviewers identified and recorded descriptive and inferential statistical terms/procedures found in the methods, results, and discussion sections of each article. Results were determined by tallying the total number of times, as well as the percentage, that each statistical term or procedure appeared in the articles. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four articles were included. Ninety-eight percent employed descriptive statistics; of these, 28% used only descriptive statistics. The most common descriptive statistical terms were percentage (90%), mean (74%), standard deviation (58%), and range (46%). Sixty-nine percent of the articles used inferential statistics, the most frequent being chi(2) (33%), Student's t-test (26%), Pearson's correlation coefficient r (18%), ANOVA (14%), and logistic regression (11%). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical terms and procedures were found in nearly all of the research articles published in pharmacy journals. Thus, pharmacy education should aim to provide current and future pharmacists with an understanding of the common statistical terms and procedures identified to facilitate the appropriate appraisal and consequential utilization of the information available in research articles.",M2
15191245,"Pharmacist care plans and documentation of follow-up before the Iowa <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Case Management program.OBJECTIVES: To document drug therapy problems and their causes and assess pharmacist follow-up of patients with identified drug therapy problems. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Iowa. PARTICIPANTS: 160 pharmacists who submitted 754 pharmaceutical care plans in an effort to qualify for participation in the Iowa Pharmaceutical Case Management program. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Care plans were assessed for drug therapy problems and causes and for documentation of pharmacist follow-up (actual, none, or intent to follow up). RESULTS: Pharmacists documented a wide variety of drug therapy problems and causes, including adverse drug reactions (20.1% of care plans), need for additional drug therapy (18.9%), lack of patient adherence to therapy (16.3%), incorrect medication being prescribed (14.1%), and drug dose too high (10.0%). Pharmacist follow-up with patients was not optimal, with 31% of care plans providing documentation of actual follow-up. Another 42.2% of plans indicated that the pharmacist intended to contact the patient for follow-up but either did not do so or did not record the intervention. No actual follow-up or intent to follow up was recorded in 26.8% of care plans. Pharmacists practicing in independent pharmacies followed up with patients more frequently than those in other settings (36.4% of care plans, compared with 22.7%, 23.2%, and 28.4% for chain, clinic, and franchise pharmacies). Pharmacists were more likely to follow up when the identified problem involved drug safety rather than effectiveness (36.2% versus 28.3% of care plans). CONCLUSION: Documentation of pharmacist follow-up with patients was less than optimal. In addition to identifying drug therapy problems and causes, pharmacists must complete the care continuum through documentation of patient monitoring and follow-up to transform the philosophy and vision of the pharmaceutical care concept into a practice of pharmacy recognized and rewarded by patients and payers.",M2

RESPECT (Randomised Evaluation of Shared Prescribing for Elderly people in the Community over Time) [ISRCTN16932128].BACKGROUND: This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost implications of 'pharmaceutical care' provided by community pharmacists to elderly patients in the community. As the UK government has proposed that by 2004 pharmaceutical care services should extend nationwide, this provides an opportunity to evaluate the effect of pharmaceutical care for the elderly. DESIGN: The trial design is a randomised multiple interrupted time series. We aim to recruit 700 patients from about 20 general practices, each associated with about three community pharmacies, from each of the five Primary Care Trusts in North and East Yorkshire. We shall randomise the five resulting groups of practices, pharmacies and patients to begin pharmaceutical care in five successive phases. All five will act as controls until they receive the intervention in a random sequence. Until they receive training community pharmacists will provide their usual dispensing services and so act as controls. The community pharmacists and general practitioners will receive training in pharmaceutical care for the elderly. Once trained, community pharmacists will meet recruited patients, either in their pharmacies (in a consultation room or dispensary to preserve confidentiality) or at home. They will identify drug-related issues/problems, and design a pharmaceutical care plan in conjunction with both the GP and the patient. They will implement, monitor, and update this plan monthly. The primary outcome measure is the 'Medication Appropriateness Index'. Secondary measures include adverse events, quality of life, and patient knowledge and compliance. We shall also investigate the cost of pharmaceutical care to the NHS, to patients and to society as a whole.",M2

Because of the limited resources of these countries, mainly generic or brand generic products were licensed. The number of the patented drugs on the market could be used as measure of the market attractiveness to the R&amp;D producers. The study shows the analysis of the innovativeness of the Bulgarian drug market comparing the registration and the patient activity of the producers. The number of the authorized products for five years period (1990-2000) and share of the patented products were investigated. During the observed period the number of newly authorized pharmaceuticals increased almost seven times from 800 (650 INN) to 6000 (2000 INN) dosage forms. The prevailing part of the newly registered drugs was found to be brand generics and possess only trade name protection. The share of drugs that are patented is less than five percent of all newly registered medicines, and among the fifty most commonly prescribed and sold medicines between 1996-2000, only 0.5 percent of drugs were patented. Obviously the Bulgarian pharmaceutical market is very competitive but not that attractive for most of the R&amp;D producers. In general the registration of the patent protected products is increasing during the years and especially after harmonization of the related legislation with the EU requirements. The patent activity of the pharmaceutical companies regarding newly authorized drugs is influenced by the structure of morbidity and population. During the last two years the patent activity is increasing and is oriented mainly towards the protection of newly authorized drugs or pharmaceutical forms and obligatory registration of trademarks for the privatized Bulgarian pharmaceutical manufacturers.",M2

When preparing this work archive documents, the publications of the magazine  <e>Pharmaceutical</e> News  and other periodical press was investigated. In the independent Republic of Lithuania (1918-1940) four professional pharmaceutical organizations were active. The most influential one was the Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists, established on September 18, 1922, where only owners of pharmacies could become its real members. This organization united about 80% of owners of pharmacies in all the country. The main directions of the activity of the Society were the following: active participation in the creation of a legitimate basis of pharmacy, concern for the interests and ethics of its members, publication, participation in an international activity. The Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists belonged to the International Pharmaceutical Federation (IPF), and established the Society of Baltic Pharmacists together with societies of Latvian and Estonian pharmacists in 1938. The Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists paid great attention to the problems of professional ethics and it used to fight with the so called  soiled competition . The Court of Honour was established for this purpose which tried the violations of ethics by the members of the society. The magazine  Pharmaceutical News  was being published in common with the Union of Lithuanian Pharmacists in 1923-1940. It was the main professional pharmaceutical magazine in Lithuania which reflected pharmaceutical problems of that time, was concerned with the ways to solve them and the activity of organizations. The Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists became stronger and stronger gradually, gained bigger and bigger authority and extended the directions of its activity. Moreover, it started to take care of the heritage of pharmaceutical history and charity as well. In particular, the Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists established the museum of an ancient Lithuanian pharmacy, financially supported the Society of Lithuanian Pharmacy Students and other organizations. When Lithuanian was occupied by the Soviet Union, the activity of all societies was ceased, societies of Lithuanian pharmacists stopped functioning on September 13, 1940 as well.",M2
14617879,"[Influence of <e>pharmaceutical</e> law on the formation of the monopoly of pharmacists in Kaunas province in the 19th century]The aim of this work is to estimate the influence of pharmaceutical law on the development of pharmacy in Kaunas province in the 19th century. In czarist Russia of the 19th century (which covered the majority of Lithuania) the trade of medicines was regulated severely. A statute of pharmacy issued in 1836 claimed that whenever giving a permission to establish a new pharmacy, the agreement of the owners of the nearest pharmacies should have been got beforehand. In such a way the law gave an indirect right for pharmacists to influence the establishment of new pharmacies. It also became an obstacle for a natural formation of the network of pharmacies and, thus, stimulated a creation of the monopoly of pharmacists. After the proclamation of the statute, i. e. from 1836 till 1840, only two new pharmacies were opened in Kaunas province, and later, during a thirteen-year period, (1841-1853) not a single pharmacy was founded there. Pharmacists, due to the avoidance of competition and fear to lose the monopoly of the trade of medicines in a region, tried to prevent other people from the establishment of pharmacies. They used to establish pharmacies in neighbouring towns themselves, to create the branches of their pharmacies or the networks of pharmacies of their family. In fact, the unfounded decrees of the government institutions of czarist Russia ampered the formation of a sufficient network of pharmacies and the development of the care of public health in the provinces of czarist Russia.",M2

12611195,"[Social pharmacology: a new topic in clinical pharmacology]Social Pharmacology, a new field in Clinical Pharmacology, describes the relationships between Society and Drugs. Topics of Social Pharmacology are first, the social consequences of populations' exposure to drugs and, secondly, the social factors explaining drug use behind clinical or rational explanations. Social Pharmacology also investigates the reasons for prescription, delivery, consumption and self-medication of drugs (behind clinical or rational factors). The paper discusses the role of the different players of Social Pharmacology in the field of drug development, evaluation, prescription and consumption. For example, the <e>pharmaceutical</e> industry should play an important role in the discovery of new medically and socially  desirable  drugs. Drug companies are also involved in this field for drug information to doctors but also patients. Regulatory agencies are concerned by social factors involved in drug approval, regulation of the maximal level of drug use, application and transferability of clinical trials to daily clinical practice. Social Pharmacologists also investigate the factors (others than clinical or rational) regulating drug use. Drug consumption varies according to social characteristics of physicians (sub-speciality, medical education, cultural origin, etc) or patients (gender, age, education, country, kind of work, social status etc). Relationships between drugs and religion make up a large chapter of Social Pharmacology. Other topics in Social Pharmacology involving other health professionals (pharmacists), lawyers and the media are also discussed. Finally, drugs should be considered as important social markers of population behaviour. The role of the Social Pharmacologist is to identify these social and irrational factors governing drug use in order to adapt and rationalize drug utilization in daily clinical practice.",M2

In the XIXth century a rapid development of the science of pharmacy influenced a need for scientific collaboration. Thus, in 1819 Department of Pharmacy of Vilnius Medical Society was founded by Vilnius chemists. The main directions of the activity of the members of this department were the following: scientific investigations, solution of practical tasks, spreading of pharmaceutical information, popularization of the knowledge of pharmaceutical science. However, a progressive dynamic development of pharmacy was hindered by unfavorable political and economic factors. In 1917, Lithuanians working in Russia united in a  Society of Lithuanian Pharmacists . The operation of the society was concerned with nationality, which was the main and the only direction of activity. There were four pharmaceutical organizations acting in the Independent Republic of Lithuania (1918-1940). In 1940, after Lithuania's annexation to the USSR, all pharmaceutical professional associations were eliminated. In 1948, Lithuanian Scientific Society of Pharmacists was founded. Despite its professional tasks it had also to proclaim ideological aims. CONCLUSION: Professional activity was influenced by unfavorable political conditions in the country. Independence of social professional associations was limited by czarist Russia, as well as by Soviet authorities. Department of Pharmacy of Vilnius Medical Society had a great influence upon the progress of pharmacy of that time. Associations acting in the Independent Republic of Lithuania were able to defend their business interests, participate in international activity, deal with the affairs of science, the heritage of the pharmacy, and representation of their profession.",M2

The great man, 80, was authorised to practice in France. His wife Mélanie always assisted him in writing prescriptions, and in recruiting patients. When he died in 1843, she was continuing to practise assisted or not by a physician, Deleau or Croserio. A young pharmacist, Charles LeThiére, lived close to her as her adoptive son, grandson of the famous painter Guillaume Guillon-LeThière who was the director of the French Academy of Fine Arts of Rome at the Villa Medici, grandson as well of the Roman pharmacist Giuseppe Meli. Early Charles remained orphan and was educated by Mélanie. In 1844, he obtained his <e>pharmaceutical</e> graduation at the Ecole supérieure de Pharmacie de Paris. In 1847, she was accused of illegal practising of medicine and pharmacy. She claimed that she held the degree of doctor in homeopathy granted to her by the Academy of Pennsylvania. The court condemned her on the medical side considering that she earned money without legal certification in medicine. But as the drugs were prepared by a pharmacist, and delivered free of charge to the patients, no sentence was pronounced against her neither against LeThière. However, the court tempted to object that LeTière did not meet all the legal requirements for practising his pharmaceutical activity, especially aruging that he did not own an open shop of pharmacy, and that he did not declare his activity to the authorities in Paris. This point underline the fact that during the XIXth century the French law (21 germinal An XI- 1803), obliged the starting drug industry to be in dependence of the shops of pharmacy opened to the public, owned by a graduated pharmacist. As defender Mrs. Hahnemann chose the quite known solicitor Chaix d'Estange. Many testimonies came for justifying her capability of medical prescribing from artists, officers, writers and several aristocrats. From abroad came the supports of American doctors, Hempel, Hering and Hull. But the core question motivating her sentence came from the medical lobby acting in Paris led by the professor Orfila. Among the adepts of the homeopathy themselves, raised division and rivalry, but all considering that Mélanie Hahnemann's behavior was criticable. The court fined her for hundred francs that she paid.

In other words, pharmaceutical people in Japan should have much more pharmaceutical philosophy. The late Professor Komei Miyaki, founder Editor-in-Chief of FARUMASHIA, the monthly membership magazine of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, under whom I worked as one of editorial board members, taught me that scientists should have their own philosophy of their sciences. Such a pharmaceutical philosophy as mentioned above should be established on the basis of complete separation of medical profession between doctors and pharmacists, which form the most important and necessary issue in safety assurance for patients with the complete zero defect (ZD action), as there is a long history for that in Europe since the separation was completed by King Friedrich II in 1240. Therefore, we have to learn the social status of European/American pharmacist practitioners who are the great No. 1 among all the professions. European pharmacists guarantee the safety of every chemical used for human body and pets, such as medicines, cosmetics, foods, tooth stuffs and so on. Regarding the pharmaceutical sciences in Japan also there seems to be a lack of pharmaceutical philosophy, as pharmaceutical scientists have no identity in research object that may be similar to basic scientists who are non-pharmacy graduates. Japanese sciences generally have developed along the lines of the Western model, reaching the current high level. We now not only should receive profits from the outside but also should embark on a mission to support pharmaceutical sciences throughout the world, especially Asian courtiers. At the present, we do not seem to be fulfilling our mission to do that, even though general activity includes significant international exchange. We have to make much more effort for international contribution/participation. For that, the most important and necessary issue is to make change in fundamental sense in Japanese pharmaceutical community, though an internationalization of technological issues is usually taken into consideration. In this connection, regarding the new drug development, we must have a change in the sense to establish pharmaceutical philosophy and jump up in conception from the existing one. Based on the above mentioned pharmaceutical philosophy, seven star pharmacists should be educated as described in 2000 FIP Statement of Policy: Good Pharmacy Education Practice, who could be a (1) care giver; (2) decision maker; (3) communicator; (4) leader; (5) manager; (6) life-long learner; (7) teacher.",M2
12659093,"Suitable and remunerative employment: the feminization of hospital dispensing in late nineteenth-century England.This article looks at the contingent developments that led to the feminization of hospital dispensing at the end of the nineteenth century in England. In the 1870s, as a result of the campaign of the Women's Movement to open medicine to women, the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women found it possible to place some of its protégées in the dispensaries of hospitals founded by members of the Movement. Coincidentally, a radical member of the Council of the <e>Pharmaceutical</e> Society smoothed the way for them to take the Society's examinations, thus setting up an expectation that these women should be qualified. By the 1880s, the practice of employing female dispensers had spread to Birmingham, and the women here adopted a less difficult and expensive qualification, the Apothcaries' Assistant's Certificate, as the qualification of choice. The 1890s also saw increasing pressure on mainstream hospital dispensaries to replace the untrained assistants in their dispensaries, customarily employed on the Babbage Principle to save money, with qualified ones. In consequence, hospital managements sought a new means of containing costs and, turning to the kind of women already shown to be competent in Women's Movement hospitals, found the solution in a vertical gender-segregation, where the lesser qualification of women dispensers made them 'unpromotable' to head dispenser, thus preserving the career ladder for more highly-qualified male dispensers.",M2
