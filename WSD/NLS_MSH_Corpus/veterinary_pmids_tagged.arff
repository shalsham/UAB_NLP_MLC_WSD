20210961,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in personnel attending a <e>veterinary</e> surgery conference.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in veterinary personnel. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Conference attendees (n=341) at the 2008 American College of Veterinary Surgeons Symposium in San Diego California. METHODS: Nasal swabs were collected and tested using selective culture for MRSA. Isolates were typed and risk factors were evaluated using questionnaire data. RESULTS: 17.3% of subjects (17% veterinarians and 18% technicians) were MRSA positive. Colonized individuals originated from 5 different countries, predominantly the United States and Canada. Contact with small ruminants in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio [OR] 2.2), living with a person diagnosed with MRSA in the preceding year (OR 19.8) and working in a clinic where there is a specific person in charge of the infection control program (OR 2.2) were associated with colonization using multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: The high rate of colonization identified here provides more evidence that MRSA exposure is likely an occupational risk for veterinary personnel. The equal rates in small animal and large animal personnel were surprising and contradict earlier studies indicating greater rates among equine personnel. The association of MRSA and small ruminant contact has not been reported previously. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MRSA is an important emerging pathogen in veterinary medicine and is a concern for both patients and veterinary personnel. The high colonization rate indicates the need to understand and control the spread of MRSA in veterinary clinics.",M1
19951098,"Labor market characteristics of <e>veterinary</e> technician specialists in 2007.OBJECTIVE: To determine labor market characteristics of veterinary technician specialists (VTSs) during 2007 and identify characteristics significantly related to pay. DESIGN: Survey. SAMPLE POPULATION: 163 VTSs. PROCEDURES: A 21-question, multiple-choice survey was sent in early May 2008 to all individuals (n = 345) who had been certified as VTSs and for whom an e-mail address could be identified. RESULTS: Weighted mean pay rate for respondents was $23.48/h. Pay rate was significantly associated with practice type, whether the respondent had a supervisory or management position, duration of experience as a VTS, duration of experience as a veterinary technician, and duration of employment with the current employer. Pay rate was not significantly associated with age, gender, highest academic degree, geographic region, area of practice (ie, urban vs suburban vs rural), or academy of which the respondent was a member. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional human capital variables such as work experience and job tenure were significantly related to pay rate for VTSs.",M1
19769666,"The efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate in canine skin preparation - practice survey and clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: To determine the use in practice and efficacy of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate for canine pre-operative skin preparation. METHODS: Questionnaires were used to establish which antiseptics and techniques were used for patients undergoing elective neutering. In a clinical study, five different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate - 0 per cent (tap water, as a control) 1, 2, 3 and 4 per cent - were tested on 50 dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomies and orchidectomies. RESULTS: A variety of preparation practices occurred but only 21 per cent of the <e>veterinary</e> nurses surveyed were aware of the concentration and contact time they used whilst preparing animals. The clinical study revealed there was a significant difference (P&lt;0.001) between the different concentrations used. All concentrations of chlorhexidine were significantly more effective than the control tap water. There was a tendency towards increasing efficacy as concentration increased from 1 to 4 per cent but this was not statistically significant. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of significant differences in efficacy between the different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate means that current practices may be adequate, although if the chlorhexidine gluconate concentrations and contact times used are unknown, they may be lower than those tested here and, possibly, ineffective, especially if contact times are short.",M1
19625675,"Demographics and employment destinations of a new group of <e>veterinary</e> technologists in Australia.This article provides a descriptive analysis of the demographics and employment destinations of the first three cohorts (2003-2005) of graduates (N=69) from a program that is unique in Australia: the Bachelor of Applied Science (Veterinary Technology) at the University of Queensland. Data for this study were collected in February 2006 via e-mail, telephone, or personal communication with graduates, and from university records. Ninety-three percent (64/69) of the graduates were female. The mean age was 23 years, and 58% (40/69) had entered university directly from high school. Employment destinations were determined for 96% of the graduates (N=66). Of those, 52% (34/66) were employed in veterinary practices. Government agencies and allied animal industries accounted for 15% (10/66). Another 14% (9/66) had enrolled in further undergraduate study. Three percent (2/66) had enrolled in a research honors year or a doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree program at the School of Veterinary Science. Eight percent (5/66) were employed in wildlife parks, zoos, or universities, and the remaining 9% (6/66) were traveling overseas, seeking employment, or employed outside the field. The study revealed that graduates were employed in diverse veterinary and allied animal health occupations. There appears to be a niche for Australian veterinary technology graduates educated in a university environment that complements the role of the veterinary profession in the twenty-first century. This reflects trends emerging in other countries, most notably the United States and the United Kingdom.",M1
19625672,"<e>Veterinary</e> professional associates: does the profession's foresight include a mid-tier professional similar to physician assistants?The projected shortage of veterinarians has created a need to explore alternatives designed to meet society's future demands. A veterinary professional health care provider, similar to the human medical profession's physician assistant (PA), is one such alternative. To explore this option, this paper provides background information on the development of PAs, including the motivations behind the initiative and the history of the role's development. Rather than aiming for a persuasive appeal, the authors have written this article with the intent of fostering discussion. It is suggested that perhaps veterinary professional associates, modeled after PAs, could be employed to handle routine veterinary care and thereby allow veterinarians additional time to focus on the more demanding and challenging aspects of veterinary medicine. Perhaps a team approach, similar to the physician/PA team, could help the field of veterinary medicine to better serve both clients and patients. As veterinary medicine directs its attention toward the new challenges on the horizon, creative solutions will be needed. Perhaps some variation of a veterinary professional associate is worthy of future discussion.",M1
19320810,"Prevalence and distribution of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within the environment and staff of a university <e>veterinary</e> clinic.OBJECTIVES: To characterise the distribution of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within the environment of a university small animal hospital and compare this with the distribution among staff. METHODS: Samples were collected from 140 environmental sites and the anterior nares of 64 staff members at the University of Glasgow Small Animal Hospital on a single day (d1). Sixty of the environmental sites were resampled 14 days later (d14). RESULTS: Meticillin-resistant S aureus was isolated from two of 140 (1.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 1.7 to 5.1) environmental sites on d1 and one of 60 (1.7 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 0.4 to 8.9) on d14. Two of the 64 staff sampled were positive for meticillin-resistant S aureus (3.1 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 0.4 to 8.4). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A lower prevalence of meticillin-resistant S aureus was observed in the environment than previously reported. The location, relatedness between isolates and the presence of Panton-Valentine leucocidin indicates that the source of the environmental meticillin-resistant S aureus was most likely to have been human rather than animal in these cases. This study presents important information regarding the potential source and distribution of meticillin-resistant S aureus within veterinary hospital environments and highlights potential variability of prevalence of meticillin-resistant S aureus within and between veterinary institutions.",M1

The demographic characteristics, readiness for independent and online learning, learning styles, and academic locus of control of a group of distance-education and on-campus veterinary technology students were examined. Distance-education students preferred independent learning and were more internally motivated to learn. Distance-education students with greater degrees of independence and internal motivation participated more fully, were more satisfied with their learning, and achieved higher grades. Students who preferred problem solving and active experimentation were particularly successful in distance education. These findings could have important implications for advising students interested in distance-education programs.",M1

The infections were caused by different MRSA clones (ST1, ST254, and ST398). In the same time, nasal colonization of veterinarians, veterinary personnel, and students was observed indicating transmission to humans.",M1
18836505,"Clinically overt infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in animals in New Zealand: a pilot study.AIM: To describe clinically overt infections with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animals in New Zealand, characterise clinical isolates, and track their sources. METHODS: MRSA isolates identified in 2005 and 2006 by a <e>veterinary</e> diagnostic laboratory were referred to Massey University for confirmation and characterisation. Clinical information was extracted from the laboratory records or obtained from referring clinicians. RESULTS: Seven MRSA isolates from animals and contact persons were characterised. All the isolates belonged to the British epidemic MRSA 15 strain (EMRSA-15). Three EMRSA-15 were isolated from post-operative infections in two dogs. An EMRSA-15 indistinguishable from the isolate recovered from one dog was isolated from the anterior nares of a healthy hospital staff member involved in the care of the animal, suggesting nosocomial transmission. Other EMRSA-15 isolates of uncertain clinical significance were isolated from the femoral head of a cat, and from a sample of cow's milk. AlleMRSA-15 isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and four were resistant to erythromycin; the latter four isolates also exhibited inducible resistance to clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA can cause clinically overt and difficult-to-treat infections in animals in New Zealand. The rapid emergence of EMRSA-15 as the dominant MRSA strain in humans has resulted in infection spill over to animals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Little is known about the incidence of clinically overt infections with MRSA in animals. The cases described here illustrate the complexities involved in the pharmacological management of EMRSA-15 infections, which is compounded by the universal resistance to beta-lactams, and by the strain's fluoroquinolone resistance and frequent inducible resistance to clindamycin. Such complexities indicate there is a need to develop specific empirical antimicrobial treatment strategies and antibiotic susceptibility testing protocols in countries where EMRSA-15 is dominant.",M1
18792530,"Seroprevalence study on the diffusion of the West Nile virus among blood donors, healthcare workers, jockeys, grooms and fowlers, <e>veterinary</e> surgeons and hunters in Messina (Italy).INTRODUCTION: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus widely distributed in Africa, Middle East, Asia, Southern Europe and in 1999 was first identified in the United States as a cause of disease in New York City. It mainly circulates among birds, but can infect many species of mammals. Epidemics can occur in rural as well as urban areas. METHODS: 1,280 sera were collected during 2006 from 80 stable workers, as jockey and grooms, 100 fowlers, 500 blood donors, 600 healthcare workers, 100 veterinary surgeons and 100 hunters in the Messina province to evaluate the prevalence of the WNV infection, by ELISA test, in relation to risk exposure or not. RESULTS: None of the 1280 subjects examined has shown positive for antibodies anti WN virus. CONCLUSION: Among the strategies of control and surveillance, finally, in our opinion, are and will be indispensable the programs of continuous antibody survey in all the risk categories and in the general population in order to succeed to preview which effects could have the presence of infections from WNV, also imported from other zones where the virus is constantly present, in future and which it could be the impact of geographic factors on the epidemic spread of the disease.",M1

Our investigation included active contact surveillance, exposure-related interviews, and a <e>veterinary</e> facility cohort study. We identified 19 confirmed, 5 probable, and 3 suspected cases. Rash, headache, sweats, and fever were reported by &gt; 80% of patients. Occupationally transmitted infections occurred in 12 veterinary staff, 2 pet store employees, and 2 animal distributors. The following were associated with illness: working directly with animal care (p = 0.002), being involved in prairie dog examination, caring for an animal within 6 feet of an ill prairie dog (p = 0.03), feeding an ill prairie dog (p = 0.002), and using an antihistamine (p = 0.04). Having never handled an ill prairie dog (p = 0.004) was protective. Veterinary staff used personal protective equipment sporadically. Our findings underscore the importance of standard veterinary infection-control guidelines.",M1
17644718,"Chlamydophila psittaci genotype E/B transmission from African grey parrots to humans.Thirty-six birds from a parrot relief and breeding centre, as well as the manager, were examined for the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci. In the relief unit, 5 of 20 African grey parrots showed depression, ruffled feathers, loss of weight and mild dyspnoea. The birds received no antibiotic treatment. Birds of the breeding unit, 14 blue and gold macaws and 2 green-winged macaws, were healthy. They received doxycycline at the start of each breeding season. The manager complained of shortness of breath but took no medication. Using a nested PCR enzyme immunoassay (EIA), Cp. psittaci was detected in the faeces of all five sick birds, as well as in a nasal and pharyngeal swab from the manager. The veterinarian and her assistant became infected while sampling the parrots, as pharyngeal and nasal swabs from both were positive by nested PCR/EIA after visiting the parrot relief and breeding centre, but they showed no clinical signs of infection. Bacteria could be isolated from three of five nested PCR/EIA-positive birds, the manager and the veterinarian, but not from the <e>veterinary</e> assistant. Using an ompA genotype-specific real-time PCR, Cp. psittaci genotype E/B was identified as the transmitted strain. All breeding birds tested negative for Cp. psittaci. This is believed to be the first report on Cp. psittaci genotype E/B transmission from parrots to humans. In contradiction to genotype A strains, which are thought to be highly virulent to both birds and men, the currently described genotype E/B strain apparently caused no severe clinical symptoms in either parrots or humans.",M1
17578228,"[Aggressive clients in Dutch <e>veterinary</e> practice]Aggressive clients seem to be becoming more common. This article describes a study in which questionnaires on client behaviour were sent to veterinary assistants and veterinarians in randomly selected practices in the Netherlands. Results showed that 26.4% of the veterinarians and 29.3% of the assistants had experienced aggressive clients in the last year. Age, experience, and sex of the veterinarian or assistant did not influence the frequency with which aggressive clients were encountered. The same was true for the type of veterinary practice (companion animals, farm animals, horses, etc). The risk of encountering aggressive clients was higher among practices in large towns and in practices with a small turnover Of the veterinarians who had encountered aggressive clients at least once in their career, 31% has taken some kind of action after the aggressive encounter Nearly a quarter (24.9%) of veterinary practices have adopted a Risk Inventarization and Evaluation (RI&amp;E) approach to preventing client aggression and 26.6% of practices have adopted another approach. While veterinarians tend not to consider aggression a big problem, they are often open to the suggestion that more attention should be paid to aggression in veterinary practice.",M1

Sensitive electronic dosimeters were worn by the personnel and the doses they received during the administration of the radiopharmaceutical and during the period of image acquisition were recorded at intervals. On average, 90 per cent of the total doses were received during the period of image acquisition. There was no significant difference between the total dose received by the person who drew up and injected the radiopharmaceutical, and the person restraining the horse during its administration. However, the person holding the horse received approximately twice the dose received by the person operating the equipment during the period of image acquisition.",M1

During the six-week collection period, a total of 541 questionnaires were returned, of which 24 (4.25 per cent) were discounted due to completion errors. Overall, the pain scores for procedures involving dogs were higher than those for cats; the veterinary nurses' pain scores were higher for all procedures than those of veterinary surgeons in a previous study. Both veterinary nurses and veterinary surgeons were primarily involved with monitoring pain postoperatively, and 96 per cent of veterinary nurses felt that their knowledge of pain management could be enhanced; 8.1 per cent of the practices used a formal pain scoring system, with the simple descriptive scale most commonly used; 80.3 per cent of the veterinary nurses agreed that a pain scale was a useful clinical tool.",M1
17420532,"Training strategies for animal care technicians and <e>veterinary</e> technical staff.An institutional training program for animal care and veterinary technicians should be planned and implemented to provide these individuals with knowledge and skills for performing their duties within a laboratory animal care and use program. The complexity in the regulatory and scientific features of the animal research environment necessitates a strong training program on diverse topics according to staff duties. Orientation training should include ethics and compliance with relevant laws, policies, and guidelines. Depending on specific staff responsibilities, training may be general or in depth on topics of species-specific biology and behavior, animal facility equipment and operations, animal health procedures, animal research policies, occupational health and safety equipment and practices, computer usage, training, and management. Staff training should be an ongoing mission for incorporating new equipment, practices, and procedures in the laboratory animal program; for providing periodic refresher training to maintain a high level of staff qualifications; and for retraining when skills or knowledge are found deficient. Large institutions often have a dedicated training staff to implement the institutional training program.",M1

16642762,"The use of community-based animal health workers to strengthen disease surveillance systems in Tanzania.An 18 month trial was conducted in three districts of Arusha region, northern Tanzania, to assess the use of community-based animal health workers (CAHWs) in an official disease surveillance system. Disease reports provided by CAHWs were assessed using six indicators for effective disease surveillance, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity and acceptability. To assess sustainability issues and determine the incentives required by CAHWs to report disease, three different incentive models were tested in the trial. None of the incentive models involved direct payments to CAHWs. Before involving CAHWs in disease surveillance in the three trial districts, disease case reports as a proportion of cattle population were 0.13%, 0.20% and 0.12%. During the trial, disease case reports as a proportion of cattle population increased to 5.0%, 5.6% and 6.3%. The CAHWs also improved the spatial and temporal coverage of the disease surveillance system and provided timely reports. During the trial, national-level disease reporting in Tanzania increased by 17% owing to the sensitisation and support activities of the Pan African Programme for the Control of Epizootics in Tanzania. In Arusha region, disease reporting increased by 118%, and 49% of this improvement was attributable to increased reporting in the three trial districts. Reporting from these districts far exceeded that from any other district in Tanzania. Veterinarians confirmed the CAHWs' clinical diagnosis in 88% of the 170 clinical cases examined. The increase in disease reporting resulting from CAHW activities was sufficient to enable the national epidemiology unit to achieve its target in relation to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines. The authors conclude that the use of CAHWs should be promoted in the national strategy for disease reporting. Additionally, CAHWs must be brought under the control of the Tanzanian <e>veterinary</e> authorities, a process that will include appropriate legislative reform.",M1
16641017,"Cat-scratch disease in <e>veterinary</e>-associated populations and in its cat reservoir in Taiwan.In Taiwan, the first human case of cat-scratch disease (CSD) was diagnosed by a serologic test in 1998. Since then, no studies have been conducted to understand the epidemiology of the infection in Taiwan. Therefore, this study is the first epidemiologic survey of CSD in cats and humans in this country. Using veterinary-associated individuals as the study population, it was identified that 1.7% of them were seropositive for B. henselae, and residence was the only factor associated with seropositivity. Bartonella species were successfully isolated from 25 (19.1%) of the 131 cats tested. Only B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae were obtained from bacteremic cats. Furthermore, 9.2% of 131 cats were dually-infected with genotypes I and II of B. henselae. It is the highest prevalence of co-infection that has ever been reported worldwide. In cats, the seroprevalence was 23.7% by indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay with B. henselae Houston-1 (type I) as the antigen. When 12 bacteremic but seronegative cats were re-tested by IFA slides coated with B. henselae U-4 antigen (type II), 9 cats were identified to be seropositive. Our study further suggested that using only direct PCR of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic region or the combination of the PCR method and indirect immuno-fluorescence test will be useful to diagnose Bartonella-free cats.",M1

Half the sample perceived animal death--particularly euthanasia--as one of the least desirable jobs. Of the sample, 11% reported experiencing moderate levels of traumatic symptoms. The study found lower levels of euthanasia-related stress were associated with increased satisfaction with social support and length of time working with animals. Those who reported high levels of concern about animal death reported higher levels of euthanasia-related stress. The study found occupational context was not associated with different levels of euthanasia-related stress symptoms--even though reasons for administering euthanasia differed significantly between occupations.",M1
16141276,"Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among staff and pets in a small animal referral hospital in the UK.OBJECTIVES: The occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the possible relatedness between human and animal isolates were investigated among <e>veterinary</e> staff and hospitalized animals in a referral small animal hospital in the UK. METHODS: A total of 300 swab samples were taken from nasal and oral mucosae of 78 veterinary staff, 45 dogs, 12 cats and from 30 environmental surfaces. Staphylococci were isolated by selective enrichment and characterized by biochemical tests and antimicrobial disc susceptibility testing. MRSA isolates were genotypically confirmed by PCR and typed by PFGE. RESULTS: MRSA was isolated from 14 staff (17.9%), four dogs (9%), and three environmental sites (10%) yielding a total of 28 MRSA isolates. PFGE analysis revealed that most MRSA isolates were indistinguishable (56%) or closely related (26%) to EMRSA-15, one of the two epidemic MRSA strains dominant in UK hospitals. Like EMRSA-15, the predominant strain isolated from staff, dogs and environmental sites was resistant to fluoroquinolones in addition to all beta-lactams. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of EMRSA-15 mucosal carriage in veterinary staff and hospitalized dogs, with the risk of MRSA carriage in veterinary staff being significantly higher than reported for the UK healthy community. EMRSA-15 was predominant in the hospital environment, including humans, dogs, and inanimate objects, but the mode by which the strain was introduced and spread remains uncertain.",M1

This paper documents the recovery of MRSA from animals with respiratory, urinary tract or wound infection and from animals subjected to surgical procedures following treatment in one veterinary hospital and 16 private veterinary clinics in different geographical locations throughout Ireland. MRSA was recovered from 25 animals comprising 14 dogs, eight horses, one cat, one rabbit and a seal, and also from 10 attendant veterinary personnel. Clinical susceptibility testing suggested that the 35 isolates fell into two different groups. One group of isolates (Group 1) was resistant to one or more of the following classes of antimicrobials: macrolides, lincosamines, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones. The second group (Group 2) was resistant to macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and variably resistant to fluoroquinolones, lincosamines and rifampicin. One isolate in Group 2 was susceptible to trimethoprim. Epidemiological typing by antibiogram-resistogram (AR) typing, biotyping and by chromosomal DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using SmaI digestion followed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), confirmed these two major clusters. PFGE analysis showed that most isolates from non-equine animals were indistinguishable from each other and from the isolates from personnel caring for these animals. MRSA was isolated from eight horses which attended six different veterinary practices before referral to an equine veterinary hospital. Isolates from the eight horses and from their attendant personnel had PFGE patterns that were indistinguishable and were unlike the patterns obtained from the other isolates. Comparison of PFGE patterns of isolates from veterinary sources with patterns from MRSA recovered in human hospitals showed that the most frequently occurring pattern of MRSA from non-equine animals was indistinguishable from the predominant pattern obtained from the most prevalent MRSA strain in the human population in Ireland. However, the patterns of the isolates from horses were unlike any patterns previously reported in Irish studies of human isolates. This study shows that transmission of two strains of MRSA is occurring in veterinary practices in Ireland and that one strain may have arisen from human hospitals. The source of the second strain remains to be determined.",M1

15776262,"Work-related accidents and occupational diseases in veterinarians and their staff.OBJECTIVES: We assessed the occupational hazards in <e>veterinary</e> practice by analysing accident insurance data in order to stimulate strategies to prevent occupational accidents and diseases in veterinarians and their staff. METHODS: Approximately 10,000 veterinary practices comprising about 27,500 veterinarians and their staff are covered by the Institution of Statutory Accident Insurance of the Health and Welfare Service (BGW). Each year about 2,000 accident and occupational disease claims are filed by these veterinarians and their staff. The claims for the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002 are analysed in this paper. RESULTS: For 2002, the incidence rate for accidents in the workplace was 105.4 per 1,000 full-time workers, a rate 2.9-times higher than for general practitioners of human medicine. When only severe accidents resulting in a loss of work time of more than 3 days were analysed, the relative risk increased to 9.2. Approximately 66% of the reported accidents are due to scratches, bites, or kicks from animals. Claims of occupational disease are filed 2.7-times more often by veterinarians and their staff than by general practitioners and their staff. The occupational diseases filed most often concern the skin (39%), followed by allergic respiratory diseases (30.5%), and infectious diseases (19.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Prevention strategies for veterinarians should focus on accidents caused by animals. The prevention of occupational diseases should focus on skin diseases, respiratory disease, and infections.",M1

Seventy-nine horses and 27 persons colonized or infected with MRSA were identified from October 2000 to November 2002; most isolations occurred in a 3-month period in 2002. Twenty-seven (34%) of the equine isolates were from the veterinary hospital, while 41 (51%) were from 1 thoroughbred farm in Ontario. Seventeen (63%) of 27 human isolates were from the veterinary hospital, and 8 (30%) were from the thoroughbred farm. Thirteen (16%) horses and 1 (4%) person were clinically infected. Ninety-six percent of equine and 93% of human isolates were subtypes of Canadian epidemic MRSA-5, spa type 7 and possessed SCCmecIV. All tested isolates from clinical infections were negative for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. Equine MRSA infection may be an important emerging zoonotic and veterinary disease.",M1

METHODS AND MATERIALS: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all attendees of the International Veterinary Nurses' Conference 2003, Brisbane, Australia (N=147 respondents among 215 surveyed). RESULTS: The prevalence of exposure to X-radiation (97%), anaesthetics (96%), disinfectants (96%) and vaccines (85%) was high. More than 70% of the nurses were exposed to formaldehyde (76%) and pesticides/insecticides (71%). For all exposures except vaccines, about 50% of the nurses exposed were worried about negative health consequences. Acute injuries were common with 98% of the nurses experiencing dog/cat bites/scratches, 71% experiencing needle stick injuries and 43% experiencing lacerations. More than half of the nurses (52%) suffered from chronic back/neck pain and 39% reported having allergy or hay fever. Sixteen cases (11%) of Cat Scratch Fever were reported. Job related affective well-being was similar to a large sample of workers in comparable level jobs. CONCLUSION: Among attendees of a veterinary nurses conference, the proportion of this group of nurses exposed to hazards in their work environment was high and acute and chronic injuries were common. Considering that nurses account for more than 40% of total employment in the veterinary service industry, the results of this study show that the occupational health hazards of this professional group require further study.",M1

DESIGN: Unmatched case-control study. STUDY POPULATION: 207 animal caregivers. PROCEDURE: Case subjects (n = 75) were any caregiver that reported being bitten by a dog or cat. Control subjects (n = 132) were randomly selected from a list of all caregivers interacting with dogs or cats. Information on the characteristics of the caregivers, characteristics of the dogs and cats, and the nature of the interaction between the dog or cat and the caregiver was obtained by use of self-administered questionnaires. RESULTS: Caregivers were more likely to be bitten by dogs or cats that had warning signs on their cages indicating the potential to bite or that were considered difficult to handle. Caregivers interacting with cats or with older dogs and cats were more likely to be bitten. Only 37 to 55% of dogs and cats that had characteristics traditionally associated with biting or were considered likely to bite were muzzled. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Muzzling dogs and cats should be considered more frequently. Dogs and cats considered to have the propensity to bite frequently do bite, and precautions, such as muzzling, should be taken if the medical condition or conformation of the dog or cat is amenable to this type of restraint.",M1

11451389,"Handheld digital equipment for weight composite distress paradigms: new considerations and for rapid documentation and intervention of rodent populations.Animal care in the third millennium will require a melding of scientific and humane interests to achieve optimal care of genetically engineered mice and to expedite scientific and medical advances by using these mammals. Undoubtedly, rodent patients present certain difficulties for those who wish to assess their daily well-being and to contribute to efficient and successful scientific discovery. High-density housing, large experimental groups, and low-lux room lighting makes the application of large-animal care standards to rodents seem daunting to researchers and <e>veterinary</e> care programs. In addition, great variability in training and experience among those responsible for the direct application of humane care to rodents exists. Most of the direct animal care in small animal facilities occurs in decentralized locales by personnel who have completed obligatory but relatively minimal animal care training. Examples of personnel in this category include postdoctoral fellows, junior-level scientists, summer students, and assistant laboratory animal technologists. Some programs even use the husbandry staff to perform health checks of high-risk populations on a daily basis. For this reason, the extrapolation of performance-based intervention in rodent care is difficult to apply practically. Early efforts to enhance humane outcome in rodents have been published by scientists and veterinarians and are largely directed at singular endpoints, such as weight loss and declining temperatures, in specific models. Scientists often are reluctant to accept such standards because of concern about premature intervention or variability between scorers and to reservations regarding a lack of procedural likeness with their proposed study. This paper highlights a digital method for melding current advanced animal scoring standards using palm pilot user-friendly methods that account for composite weight scoring, behavioral or physiologic attributes, and interventions. Information is rapidly downloaded and results in quick storage of large rodent population monitoring. This minimizes interpretative variability between caregivers and greater standardization of procedures. These considerations facilitate the rapid diagnosis of outliers and make possible intervention that streamlines the delivery of humane care to large experimental populations.",M1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. STUDY POPULATION: At-risk <e>veterinary</e> medical association (VMA) members, their staff members, and animal shelter and wildlife rehabilitation center personnel located in a California county. PROCEDURE: A questionnaire was mailed to VMA members and managers of animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centers. Respondents were requested to provide data on vaccination history and potential factors associated with vaccination status for themselves and their at-risk staff members. Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared by use of univariate and logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with vaccination status. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent (79/137) of persons who received questionnaires responded; 74 were eligible for the study. Respondents provided data for 47.6% (219/460) of their staff members. The vaccination rate was greater among respondents (85.1 %) than among their staff members (17.5%). Among staff members, age and duration of employment were significantly associated with vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A large proportion of at-risk staff members working in veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and wildlife rehabilitation centers in the study area did not receive rabies preexposure vaccination per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's published recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The cost of the preexposure vaccine series may be a barrier, particularly for young employees who are commonly short-term, part-time, or volunteer workers.

DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all of the 160 registered <e>veterinary</e> practices in Western Australia. RESULTS: Injuries accounted for most workers' compensation claims over a 12-month period with 31% of respondents losing a total of 360 work days with a mean of 13.3 days whereas non-occupational diseases such as influenza accounted for 408 work days lost. Over a 10-year period, 71% of respondents had been injured. The major physical injuries were dog and cat bites, cat scratches, scalpel blade cuts and back injuries from lifting heavy animals. Exposure to chemicals such as flea rinses, formalin, glutaraldehyde, x-ray developers and gaseous anaesthetics were reported to cause headache, nausea and allergies. Thirty percent of respondents did not have extractor fans for scavenging waste anaesthetic gases. The study showed high use of radiography (94%) for diagnostic purposes with 24% of respondents believing radiation exposure is a major occupational health and safety issue. Stress, drug abuse, suicide and burglary were also reported. Despite a high awareness of zoonotic diseases, there were very few reports of these. CONCLUSION: Injuries and other occupational hazards reported together with work days lost demonstrate a need for improving the working environment of veterinarians and their staff and the development of comprehensive health and safety programs.",M1

DESIGN: Unlinked voluntary cross-sectional epidemiologic survey. SAMPLE POPULATION: 204 veterinarians, laboratory scientists, and other occupationally exposed individuals who attended a veterinary conference on feline geriatric medicine. PROCEDURE: Blood was collected from participants who also completed a 13-question survey requesting demographic, occupational, exposure, and health information. Blood specimens were fractionated into plasma and mononuclear cell components. Plasma was tested for antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline foamy virus (FeFV), as well as p27 antigen of FeLV. Mononuclear cell lysates were tested for FeLV provirus. RESULTS: Subjects reported extensive duration of work with cats (mean, 17.3 years) and multiple high-risk exposures (eg, cat bites, scratches, and injuries with sharp instruments) per year. However, neither serologic nor molecular evidence of zoonosis with any of the 3 feline retroviruses was detected. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Veterinarians encounter occupational exposures to animal material that place them at high risk for zoonoses. For feline retroviruses, the risk of zoonosis among healthy adult humans appears to be extremely small. However, potential for retroviral zoonosis, especially for viruses such as FeLV and FeFV that can replicate in human cells, cannot be eliminated, and universal precautions to reduce potential exposures should be used when handling sick cats.",M1

Two hundred and sixty-four (82%) returned the questionnaire. Pain perception was defined as the average of pain rankings for dogs and cats (on a scale of 1 to 10) following abdominal surgery, or the value for dogs or cats if the AHT worked with only 1 of the 2 species. Maximum concern about the risks associated with the postoperative use of morphine or oxymorphone was defined as the highest rating assigned to any of the 6 risks evaluated in either dogs or cats. Animal health technologists reported significantly higher pain perception scores than did veterinarians who completed a similar survey 2 years previously. Higher pain perception scores were associated with decreased satisfaction with the adequacy of analgesic therapy in their practice, higher pain control goals, and attendance at continuing education within the previous 12 months. The majority of AHTs (55%) agreed that one or more risks associated with the use of morphine or oxymorphone outweighed the benefits. The 3 issues that were perceived to pose the greatest risk were respiratory depression, bradycardia, and sedation and excitement, for dogs and cats, respectively. Most AHTs (68%) considered their knowledge related to the recognition and control of pain to be adequate, compared with 24% of veterinarians who responded to a similar previous survey. As for veterinarians, experience gained while in practice was ranked as the most important source of knowledge, while the technical program attended was ranked as least important. Over 88% of the AHTs provided nursing care during the postoperative period, monitored animals for side effects of postoperative analgesic therapy, informed veterinarians when animals were in pain, recommended analgesic therapy when they believed it was warranted, reported that animals received analgesics when they believed it was warranted, administered analgesics under the instruction of a veterinarian, and believed they were part of a team working to provide adequate postoperative pain control.",M1

To investigate such injuries, we retrospectively reviewed injury records at one regional primate research center and distributed a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire to at-risk personnel at two centers. Records of bite, animal-inflicted scratch, needlestick, cut, and mucous membrane exposure injuries were reviewed at one center for the 5-year period 1988 to 1993 to determine incidence and frequency of injuries and to identify possible risk factors. A total of 261 injuries were reported during this period, with an annual incidence for all injuries combined ranging from 43.5 to 65.5 injuries per 100,000 person workdays (pwd) at risk. For specific injuries the highest incidence was observed for animal-inflicted scratches and bites, with a rate of 82 and 81 per 100,000 pwd respectively. The job category <e>Veterinary</e> Resident was found to have the highest incidence for needlestick injuries (547 per 100,000 pwd), scratches (239 per 100,000 pwd), and cuts (171 per 100,000 pwd). The highest rates for bites were observed in the job categories Animal Health Technician and Animal Technician, with 171 and 150 per 100,000 pwd respectively; the category Staff Veterinarian had the highest rate of mucous membrane exposures (71 per 100,000 pwd). The frequency of all injuries was greatest in personnel employed &lt; or = 2 years. Questionnaire responses indicated that having &gt; 20 h per week of contact with nonhuman primates or contact with more than 50 nonhuman primates per week was associated with a significantly increased risk of bites, animal-inflicted scratches, needlesticks, and mucous membrane exposures. In addition, data analysis indicated that under-reporting of work-related injuries was high; 59% of scratches, 50% of mucous membrane exposures, 45% of cuts, 37% of bites, and 20% of needlestick injuries went unreported.

Lay perceptions of health and illness are of interest to medical sociologists, providing important information to medical practitioners, but have infrequently been applied in <e>veterinary</e> research. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate how lay epidemiology can be applied within veterinary research by exploring the lay perceptions regarding the causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour in horses. METHODS: Informants were recruited from professional and amateur horse owners who had or had not owned/cared for a horse that exhibited crib-biting/windsucking behaviour. In-depth interviews were used to examine perceptions about the development of this behaviour within each group until a 'saturation' of themes emerged. RESULTS: The main themes that emerged as causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour were 'boredom', 'stress' and 'habit/addiction'. In the group of owners/carers who did not have direct experience of this type of behaviour, 'copying' from other horses emerged as a strong theme and they stated that they would not wish to own a crib-biting/windsucking horse. In contrast, those who had direct experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour did not believe copying was a cause based on their own observations and would not be put off purchasing or caring for another horse displaying this behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions about what causes crib-biting/windsucking was influenced by whether or not informants had personal experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour. The three main themes that emerged have some justification based on current research and highlight the need for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiology of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour.

The first phase of the PDSR project emphasized the detection and control of HPAI by separate PDS and participatory disease response teams primarily in sector 4 poultry at the household level. Lessons learned during the first phase were taken into account in the design of the second phase of the project, which has sought to further strengthen management of disease prevention and control activities by improving technical approaches, increasing active participation of key stakeholders, including local and central governments, and focusing on the village level. The ongoing evolution of the PDSR program aims to establish a sustainable community-based program within provincial and district livestock services that enhances the prevention and control of not only HPAI, but also other zoonotic and priority animal diseases.",M2

The circulation and re-emergence of high-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses of H5N1 subtype are still major concerns because of potential effects on human health, on the profitability of poultry industries, and on the livelihood of the rural environment. Significant improvements toward the management of these outbreaks have occurred worldwide, including new legislative tools, intervention strategies, and investments in capacity building in both developed and developing countries. This has led to a greater understanding of certain aspects of this infection and of its pandemic potential, although we are still far from certainties and from resolving the situation. Given that genetic analysis of the viruses causing human pandemics since the beginning of the 20th century have indicated that at least the hemagglutinin gene was donated from an avian progenitor virus, it would seem reasonable to exploit the information we have from an animal health perspective to support public health policies. Possibly the biggest challenge we have is to find novel ways to maximize the use of the information that is generated as a result of the improved networking and diagnostic capacities. In the era of globalization, emerging and re-emerging diseases of public health relevance are a concern to developing and developed countries and are a real threat because of the interdependence of the global economy. Communication and analysis systems currently available should be tailored to meet global health priorities, and used to develop and constantly improve novel systems for the exploitation of information to generate knowledge. Another fundamental task the veterinary community needs to deliver on is that of bringing relevant information to international discussion tables at which international control and prevention are presented and optimized. The veterinary community has knowledge and areas of expertise that should undoubtedly be part of strategic decisions and are essential to manage the human and animal health implications of avian influenza infections.",M2

Overall, 45% of questionnaires were returned. The response rate varied from 25% in Africa to 69% in Europe. Eighty-seven percent of respondent countries indicated that there was a competent national <e>veterinary</e> authority for animal welfare legislation in their country. In many countries, the authority responsible for the operational implementation of animal welfare legislation appears to be the same as the authority responsible for creating the legislation. Forty-nine (66%) respondents identified a veterinary authority as being responsible for the implementation of animal welfare legislation at a state or provincial level. Most respondent countries indicated that they had legislation covering animal transport (83%), the slaughter of animals for human consumption (91%), the killing of animals for disease control (86%) and dog control (61%). Training courses on animal welfare were available for official veterinarians, private veterinarians, producers and processors in 73%, 44%, 57% and 51% of respondent countries, respectively. Eighty-two percent of respondent countries exported live animals to other countries and 56% of respondent countries indicated that personnel handling animals during transport were aware of OIE standards on animal welfare or other standards. Many European countries require transporters to be trained and certified according to European Union regulations. It was mandatory to stun livestock prior to slaughter in 31% of countries, but in 57% religious exceptions were allowed, and in 8% stunning was not mandatory. The most commonly used method of stunning was mechanical but electrical stunning was also common. It was mandatory to stun livestock prior to killing for disease control in 44% of countries but it was not mandatory in 43%. There was legislation on humane killing in 74% of countries, but in 25% of countries there was no such legislation. The national veterinary authority was responsible for these regulations in most (71%) respondent countries. In 73% of respondent countries the personnel who conducted killing for disease control were generally aware of the domestic legislation for animal welfare. Of all the problems considered, the problem of stray dog management was ranked as 'major' or 'severe' more often than any of the other issues. Killing for disease control was mentioned as a problem by one respondent, but only if services were overwhelmed. In the animal transport section of the questionnaire, long-distance transport was the major issue. Many respondents had no problems with any of these issues.",M2

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Veterinarians from the United States who no longer worked in RVP. PROCEDURES: Veterinarians in any area of practice were solicited to participate in an online survey through invitation letters sent to various veterinary associations. Those who indicated that they had left RVP were asked to rank the importance of various potential factors in their decision to leave RVP. RESULTS: 805 responses were obtained from veterinarians who had worked in RVP, of which 246 (30.6%) had left RVP. Most (231/246 [93.9%]) of those who reported leaving RVP had been in practice &gt; 5 years, and 75.2% (185/246) had been in practice &gt; 12 years. Eighty-three (33.7%) who left RVP pursued careers in urban areas, 72 (29.3%) entered academia, and 7 (2.8%) retired. Reasons for leaving RVP ranked by the highest proportions of respondents as being of high importance were emergency duty, time off, salary, practice atmosphere, and family concerns. Women ranked factors such as time off, mentorship, practice atmosphere, conflict with staff, and gender issues as being of high importance more often than men did. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that the perceived shortage of veterinarians in RVP may be in part influenced by a lack of retention, particularly among experienced veterinarians. Targeted efforts to tackle issues related to emergency duty, time off, salary, practice atmosphere, and family issues could help alleviate the efflux from RVP.",M2

Malassezia spp are normal commensal and occasional pathogens of the skin of many veterinary species. Malassezia pachydermatis is a very common cause of otitis and pruritic dermatitis in dogs but is of less importance in other veterinary species. Dermatophytosis, and Malassezia otitis and dermatitis, represent the superficial mycoses of greatest significance in companion and farm animal health. Although the dermatophytes and Malassezia spp both exist in the stratum corneum of mammalian skin, there are important differences in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of infection. Dermatophytes are significant due to their zoonotic potential, the economic consequences of infection in farm animal and fur production systems, and the concern for owners of pets with inflammatory skin disease that is sometimes severe. Malassezia spp are normal commensals and occasional pathogens of the skin for many veterinary species, and M pachydermatis is a very common cause of otitis and pruritic dermatitis in dogs.

Primate lentiviruses require two molecules (CD4 and chemokine receptors such as CXCR4) as receptors. Likewise, feline immunodeficiency virus also requires two molecules, i.e., CD134 (an activation marker of CD4 T cells) and CXCR4 in infection. Gammaretroviruses utilize multi-spanning transmembrane proteins, most of which are transporters of amino acids, vitamins and inorganic ions. Betaretroviruses and alpharetroviruses utilize transmembrane and/or GPI-anchored proteins as receptors. In this review, I overviewed receptors for animal retroviruses in veterinary field.",M2
20199669,"A survey of castration methods and associated livestock management practices performed by bovine veterinarians in the United States.BACKGROUND: Castration of male calves destined for beef production is a common management practice performed in the United States amounting to approximately 15 million procedures per year. Societal concern about the moral and ethical treatment of animals is increasing. Therefore, production agriculture is faced with the challenge of formulating animal welfare policies relating to routine management practices such as castration. To enable the livestock industry to effectively respond to these challenges there is a need for more data on management practices that are commonly used in cattle production systems. The objective of this survey was to describe castration methods, adverse events and husbandry procedures performed by U.S. veterinarians at the time of castration. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to email addresses of 1,669 members of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and 303 members of the Academy of <e>Veterinary</e> Consultants. RESULTS: After partially completed surveys and missing data were omitted, 189 responses were included in the analysis. Surgical castration with a scalpel followed by testicular removal by twisting (calves &lt;90 kg) or an emasculator (calves &gt;90 kg) was the most common method of castration used. The potential risk of injury to the operator, size of the calf, handling facilities and experience with the technique were the most important considerations used to determine the method of castration used. Swelling, stiffness and increased lying time were the most prevalent adverse events observed following castration. One in five practitioners report using an analgesic or local anesthetic at the time of castration. Approximately 90% of respondents indicated that they vaccinate and dehorn calves at the time of castration. Over half the respondents use disinfectants, prophylactic antimicrobials and tetanus toxoid to reduce complications following castration. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey describe current methods of castration and associated management practices employed by bovine veterinarians in the U.S. Such data are needed to guide future animal well-being research, the outcomes of which can be used to develop industry-relevant welfare guidelines.",M2

Veterinary practices felt that 3% of cases could be attributed to dog specific factors and 97% to human specific factors such as diet, exercise and owner attitudes. Management strategies included reducing food intake, reduced treat feeding and changing diet before recommending more intensive options such as obesity clinics. Of the surveyed veterinary practices, 43% ran obesity clinics and 79% of those believed they were a valuable management tool. Of veterinary practices that did not run obesity clinics, only 46% believed them to be a valuable management tool. Dog owners preferred to try to reduce dog weight through diet manipulation, increasing exercise and elimination of treats prior to consulting the veterinary practice.

A retrospective record search from four U.S. university veterinary teaching hospitals was used to calculate crude disease rates. Our objectives were to evaluate the utility of the database for disease surveillance purposes by comparing the utility of two methodologies for creating disease categories, and to evaluate the database for evidence of referral bias. Summaries of the medical records from November 2006 to October 2007 for 9577 dogs and 4445 cats were retrieved from VMDB for all canines and felines treated at Kansas State University, Colorado State University, Purdue University and Ohio State University. Disease frequency, computed as apparent period-prevalence and as the percentage of veterinary visits, was compiled for 30 disease categories that were formulated by one of two methods. To assess the possible impact of referral bias, disease rates were compared between animals residing in zip codes within 5 miles of the hospitals (zone 1) and those animals living at more distant locations (zone 2). When compared to zone 1 animals, disease conditions commonly associated with primary veterinary care were reduced by 29-76% within zone 2, and selected diseases generally associated with more specialized care were increased from 46 to 80% among zone 2 animals. The major differences in disease prevalence seen between zones suggests that substantial referral bias may exist, and that adjustment on the basis of geographical proximity to the university teaching hospitals may be useful in reducing this type of selection bias in the VMDB, thereby improve the accuracy of prevalence estimates and enhancing the utility of this database for purposes of disease surveillance.",M2

Part two: instilled values.This is the second of two papers that the authors have written on this subject, and together they describe the results of the first major study of the outcomes of the two general approaches to the clinical training of veterinary students. One approach provides students with a broad experience with multiple species and the other provides them with an in-depth experience with just the species that they intend to work with in practice upon graduation (the latter is termed 'tracking', i.e. students follow a course of study along a particular specialised 'track'). This study obtained extensive feedback from the graduates of two schools, each of which was representative of one of the two approaches to clinical education. A total of 1,714 students took part in a survey in which they were asked to provide information about their career paths, their professional satisfaction, and their assessment of their training, especially in comparative veterinary medicine. They were also asked to say whether or not they would have preferred a different kind of training and who they would be most likely to hire as an associate: a tracking graduate or one who had received a broad-based education. The studies show that the several concerns that have been verbalised about tracking appear to be invalid. Upon graduation more than 90% of veterinary practitioners practice in quite a narrow area of veterinary medicine. We must, therefore, consider what benefits are gained from providing the typical very general preclinical education and offering students clinical training in animals with which they do not intend to practice upon graduation.",M2

Within the veterinary medicine curriculum, veterinary public health has undergone a similar development. At first, it was mainly concerned with slaughterhouse-based courses but in time it included the teaching of such subjects as epidemiology, the control of communicable (zoonotic) diseases and emergency preparedness. Veterinary medical faculties in Europe have adjusted their curricula over the past few years to reflect these changes in the subject and to meet the need for specialisation.

The challenge for veterinary schools in the United Kingdom is to attract a broader range of applicants to the veterinary degree courses: applicants who have made a positive choice to become veterinarians because of the opportunities a veterinary qualification can offer for work in areas such as public health, food safety, conservation and global disease control and prevention in an era of climate change. This requires proactive recruitment, with careers materials aimed at students who may not traditionally have been attracted to the profession. This article describes the work that is being undertaken to develop such materials and widen access to the profession.",M2
20128480,"Can curriculum innovations create incentives for young veterinarians to practise in remote rural areas?Research on the problem of decreasing numbers of rural veterinarians has identified that rural practice employment periods following graduation are getting shorter and replacing the graduates who leave is becoming increasingly difficult. One way of addressing these problems would be to develop a Bachelor of <e>Veterinary</e> Science (BVSc) curriculum that motivates young graduates to seek work in rural and remote communities and ensures they are more 'practice-ready' as soon as they leave university and start working. Developments in a series of curriculum initiatives to address this strategy are discussed, including: encouraging deeper learning in livestock health and production, provision of extramural rotations in rural locations in the final year, offering opportunities to study abroad and emphasising the global impact of farm animal medicine, developing rural support enhancements for students on rural placements, and adjusting admission requirements to increase access for rural students.",M2

When a large-scale emergency or disaster does strike, the consequences can be dire for the domestic and wild animals of the region and for the humans within the vicinity of seriously and painfully injured animals. The authors argue that emergency preparedness is essential for the veterinary profession to meet its obligations to both animals and humans.

These expectations provide a powerful argument for the need to teach animal welfare. The objective of this paper is to share the experiences of animal welfare teaching in South America, examining which topics seem relevant and why. It builds upon the core international literature on teaching animal welfare to veterinary students, highlights priorities learned through direct experience of teaching this topic in South America, and has benefited from the experiences of other South American animal welfare professors. In addition, the authors discuss major challenges in the animal welfare field and propose the perceived best strategies. The overall conclusion of the authors is that it is not possible to work as a veterinarian and make a valuable contribution to society unless the main concepts and issues of animal welfare are thoroughly understood and incorporated into practice.",M2
20128471,"Essential <e>veterinary</e> education in the welfare of food production animals.The primary responsibility of veterinarians is to the animals in their care, so veterinary students need to be aware of important issues and factual information relevantto animal welfare. Veterinarians have tended to concentrate on physical aspects of welfare, but also need to take account of mental aspects (including pain) and naturalness. A crucial first step in animal welfare education is to encourage students to examine the interactions between welfare science, ethics and policy. Scientific measures of welfare include physiological, immunological, behavioural, disease and productivity. Welfare ethics includes consideration of different ethical theories and of professional ethics. Understanding of policy involves awareness of legislation, codes of practice and farm assurance programmes. As well as utilising their education in their clinical practice, veterinarians may expectto have an important role in influencing policy and standards in the wider world. It is recommended that animal welfare should be taught as a clearly defined academic subject within the curriculum.",M2

Further postgraduate training is required to be an effective zoo or wildlife veterinarian. However, whether or not students choose to specialise in this field at a later date, the veterinary curriculum should cover several issues that are related to wildlife and zoo animals, including conservation biology, zoology, behaviour, physiology and conservation medicine. These subjects are essential, as we are preparing students to work in a world in which there is a global trade in wild animals, an increasing number of emerging infectious diseases and numerous environmental threats (habitat fragmentation, climate change) linked to anthropogenic change.

Therefore, training of veterinary students worldwide needs to face the new challenges posed by emerging infections, both from wildlife and domestic animals, as well as risks from bio/agroterrorism. New courses emphasising recognition, response, recovery and prevention must be developed to respond to natural or intentionally induced emerging diseases and zoonoses. Training programmes in applied epidemiology, zoonoses and foreign animal diseases are crucial for the development of a strong workforce to deal with microbial threats. Students should learn the reporting pathways for reportable diseases in their countries or states. Knowledge of the principles of ecology and ecosystems should be acquired during pre-veterinary studies. Elective classes on wildlife diseases, emphasising wildlife zoonotic diseases, should be offered during the veterinary curriculum, as well as a course on risk communication, since veterinarians are frequently in the position of having to convey complex information under adverse circumstances.",M2

The OIE mandate has broadened since then, but the prevention and control of infectious and parasitic diseases are still at the heart of OIE activities. To plan and implement effective disease control strategies the Veterinary Services of OIE Member Countries need well-educated veterinarians who have extensive knowledge of how and why outbreaks of infectious animal diseases occur and spread and how they can be prevented and controlled.

The original aim of the Organisation was to control the international spread of infectious animal diseases, but this aim has expanded over the years and now the OIE has a global mandate to 'improve animal health worldwide' for both terrestrial and aquatic animals. A vital factor in successfully fulfilling this mandate is the quality and performance of both the public and private components of national Veterinary Services, which are increasingly working at the interface between human, animal and environmental health. The OIE considers global veterinary education to be key in maintaining and improving the quality of these Veterinary Services. Consequently, the competencies and continuing education of veterinarians are a priority in the assessment tool that the Organisation has developed to evaluate the performance of Veterinary Services (PVS). Evaluating the abilities and training of veterinarians is an important part of a PVS evaluation, as well-educated veterinarians with appropriate training are essential in improving Veterinary Services worldwide and in helping the OIE to fulfil its mandate.",M2

The responsibility is primarily that of educators, although vision and foresight require a co-ordinated approach involving national and international veterinary organisations. Once it is accepted by all parties that change is essential, the implementation will fail unless there is a unified programme involving the schools and colleges, the accrediting agencies, the licensing authorities, governments, the professional organisations and corporate veterinary medicine.

Today veterinarians are part of a world that is exquisitely interconnected culturally, economically, socially, and professionally. As a consequence, societal needs and expectations of the profession are more demanding, critical and far-reaching. Veterinarians must play important roles in five intersecting domains of work: public health, bio-medical research, global food safety and security, ecosystem health and the more traditional role of caring for animals. To be successful in this broad and complex range of services and activities, veterinarians must possess an expanded knowledge base, acquire new skills, and develop a new mindset that will ensure their success and excellence in all these domains. The veterinary profession is becoming more fragmented and specialised, and it needs to be brought back together by a single sphere of knowledge or discipline that can serve as an intellectual foundation. The concept of One World of Veterinary Medicine can do just that. With this mindset veterinarians will become better connected to the world around and gain new public recognition and esteem. To achieve this, a special commitment by academic veterinary medicine is, of course, essential. Veterinary schools must lead an educational transformation that reaffirms the social contract of veterinarians and works to align diverse sectors, build a global community, find a common purpose and expand the 21st Century veterinary portfolio of services, activities, and new possibilities.",M2

20123486,"AAFP-AAHA: feline life stage guidelines.BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Cats have become the most popular pet in the United States, yet statistics about <e>veterinary</e> care for cats remain troubling. Although most owners consider their cats to be family members, cats are substantially underserved, compared with dogs. In 2006, owners took their dogs to veterinarians more than twice as often as cats, averaging 2.3 times/year, compared with 1.1 times/year for cats, and significantly more dogs (58%) than cats (28%) were seen by a veterinarian one or more times/year. Cat owners often express a belief that cats 'do not need medical care'. Two reasons for this misconception are that signs of illness are often difficult to detect, and cats are perceived to be self-sufficient.(2) One role of the veterinarian is to develop a partnership with cat owners that will pave the way for a lifelong health care plan. These guidelines aim to outline an evidence-based life stage wellness program to aid the veterinary medical team in delivering the best comprehensive care for cats. Specific goals are to provide: *Recommendations for optimal health care for cats throughout the different life stages. *Practical suggestions and tools to facilitate improved veterinary visits and to enhance the client-veterinarian clinical encounter. *A foundation from which to access sources of additional information. LIFE STAGE CLASSIFICATION: Distinct life stages (age groups) in cats are not well defined, in part because individual animals and body systems age at different rates, a process that is influenced by many factors. These guidelines follow one convenient classification (see box below). These age designations help to focus attention on the physical and behavioral changes that occur at different stages (eg, congenital defects in kittens, obesity prevention in the junior cat). It must be recognized, however, that any age groupings are inevitably arbitrary demarcations along a spectrum, and not absolutes. EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH CARE: Supporting references for specific recommendations are supplied where possible, and any previously published guidelines on particular topics are referred to where relevant. Readers should note, however, that the guidelines panel was hampered in its efforts by the relative paucity of disease incidence data by age group that is available, and there is an urgent need for research to guide the future of evidence-based feline health care.",M2

During that period state employed entomologists and veterinary scientists discovered that ticks were responsible for transmitting a number of livestock diseases in South Africa. Diseases such as heartwater, redwater and gallsickness were endemic to the country. They had a detrimental effect on pastoral output, which was a mainstay of the national economy. Then in 1902 the decimating cattle disease East Coast fever arrived making the search for cures or preventatives all the more urgent. Vaccine technologies against tick-borne diseases remained elusive overall and on the basis of scientific knowledge, the South African state recommended regularly dipping animals in chemical solutions to destroy the ticks. Dipping along with quarantines and culls resulted in the eradication of East Coast fever from South Africa in the early 1950s. However, from the 1930s some ticks evolved a resistance to the chemical dips meaning that diseases like redwater were unlikely to be eliminated by that means. Scientists toiled to improve upon existing dipping technologies and also carried out ecological surveys to enhance their ability to predict outbreaks. Over the longer term dipping was not a panacea and ticks continue to present a major challenge to pastoral farming.",M2
