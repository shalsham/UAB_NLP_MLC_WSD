20110049,"Cost-effectiveness of pentostatin compared with cladribine in the management of hairy cell leukemia in the United Kingdom.OBJECTIVE: This article assesses the cost-effectiveness of pentostatin compared with cladribine in the management of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A systematic literature search for papers on HCL was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and the Cochrane computerized database. Search terms were HCL plus 1 of the following: incidence, prevalence, epidemiology, cladribine, interferon, pentostatin, rituximab, splenectomy, utility, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, resource utilization, economic, or cost. Published clinical outcomes and estimates of health care resource use obtained from 10 consultant hematologists across the United Kingdom were used to construct a 5-year Markov model depicting the current management of HCL in the United Kingdom. Utilities for health states in the model were obtained from the general public using standard gamble, time tradeoff, and visual analog scale techniques. The model was used to consider the decision by a clinician to initially treat an HCL patient with either pentostatin or cladribine and to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of pentostatin over 5 years (at 2007/2008 prices) from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS: According to the model, 64% of all pentostatin-treated patients are expected to be in relapse-free remission at 5 years compared with 49% of cladribine-treated patients (P = 0.04). Repeat treatment of initial partial responders, nonresponders, and those who relapse during the 5 years is expected to result in complete remission in 92% of pentostatintreated patients and 90% of cladribine-treated patients at 5 years. Using pentostatin instead of cladribine is expected to lead to a minimal cost increase (from 21,325 pounds to 21,609 pounds) and an improvement in health status (from 3.64 to 3.77 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over 5 years. Hence, the cost per QALY gained from using pentostatin is expected to be 5000 pounds. Moreover, pentostatin has a 0.90 probability of being cost-effective for a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Accordingly, using pentostatin as a first-line treatment for patients with HCL is an effective use of NHS resources. CONCLUSION: Based on current practice, this model predicts that pentostatin is a cost-effective treatment compared with cladribine in the management of HCL from the perspective of the UK's NHS.",M1
20056789,"Very long-term eradication of minimal residual disease in patients with hairy cell leukemia after a single course of cladribine.Cladribine induces protracted remissions in patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). However, many long-term responders ultimately relapse. We sought to determine whether long-term complete responders subsequent to a single 7-day course of cladribine were without minimal residual disease (MRD) and potentially cured of HCL. From the 358-person Scripps Clinic cladribine database, we identified 19 patients in continuous and complete hematologic response (median age, 75 years; median time from diagnosis, 18 years; and median time from cladribine, 16 years). Nine of 19 (47%) patient samples had no evidence of residual disease; 7 of 19 (37%) samples had MRD; and 3 of 19 (16%) had morphologic evidence of HCL in hematoxylin and eosin-stained bone marrow sections. These results indicate that HCL is potentially curable after cladribine treatment. In addition, patients with MRD and even gross morphologic disease can live many years without manifesting hematologic relapses.",M1
20051682,"Which role for rituximab in hairy cell leukemia? Reflections on six cases.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare, chronic, B-cell, lymphoproliferative disorder. Treatment has been revolutionized by the advent of interferon (IFN)-alpha and purine analogs (PA). First-line therapy with PA yields complete response rates of 75-100%, with many long-lasting remissions. In the event of profound neutropenia and/or infectious complications, a short sequence of IFN-alpha may precede PA treatment. Because of the excellent results achieved with PA therapy, the potential role of rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is highly effective against most B-cell lymphomas) in HCL has yet to be elucidated. Six HCL cases treated with rituximab are reported herein with a view to elucidating the potential role of the drug in HCL. The indications essentially consist of relapsing or refractory disease, avoiding the cumulative toxicity of PA, consolidation therapy in order to eradicate minimal residual disease, and first-line therapy for patients with contraindications to PA and IFN-alpha.",M1
20001754,"Inherent and iatrogenic immune defects in hairy cell leukemia: revisited.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: T- and NK-cell abnormalities, decreased number and function of monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells, decreased production of certain cytokines and increased incidence of certain autoimmune conditions have been identified in untreated hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) patients. These alterations are responsible for an increased rate of infections and additional malignancies in HCL. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The authors offer a focused review of the most relevant preclinical and clinical studies exploring the immune abnormalities in both untreated and treated HCL. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The use of potent immunosuppressive agents such as cladribine and pentostatin in HCL therapeutics has generated increasing concerns about the likelihood of additional immune impairments in these patients. While the NK cells, monocytes and neutrophils were shown to recover shortly after complete responses are achieved with these agents, the CD4(+) T-cell counts may require in excess of 2 - 3 years in order to re-enter the normal range. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Given the advent of new molecular, genetic and immunologic techniques, a comprehensive characterization of the immune abnormalities in untreated and treated HCL represents a reachable goal and could translate into improved outcomes in clinical practice.",M1
20001428,"Risk of additional cancers in untreated and treated hairy cell leukemia patients.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: One of the feared events encountered in hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) survivors is the subsequent development of a malignant neoplasm. The increased incidence of second cancers in HCL has been documented in large epidemiologic studies conducted in various locations on the globe. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The authors explore the current clinico-epidemiologic evidence, as well as the immune alterations, that link HCL and its therapies to the development of second cancers. Most relevant publications have been identified through the PubMed/Medline database search. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Although HCL patients could develop both HCL and secondary malignancies because of a shared genetic predisposition, a common environmental carcinogen, or not yet identified infectious agents, multiple immune defects documented in HCL might play an important role in second carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the 'gold standards' of HCL therapy - cladribine and pentostatin - are associated with profound and prolonged suppression of the CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts, often in excess of 2 - 3 years. And while there is no clear-cut evidence that pentostatin or interferon-alpha play an established role in generation of an excess of second cancers in HCL, the safety of cladribine, the preferred agent by a majority of clinicians worldwide, in this regard is a still largely unsettled issue. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Therefore, it remains to be seen if the immune deficiencies induced by the HCL therapies and their consequences can be offset by the benefit conferred by controlling the leukemic process.",M1
19814696,"Approach to the patient after relapse of hairy cell leukemia.The current hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) treatment is excellent, but evidence of cure with purine analogs cladribine and pentostatin, is lacking. Significant long-term immune suppression, particularly to CD4+ T-cells, and declining complete remission rates with each course, make the identification of new therapies an important goal. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Mab) rituximab displays significant activity, and, while causing prolonged normal B-cell depletion, spares T-cells. Recombinant immunotoxins, containing an Fv fragment of a Mab fused to truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, have shown efficacy in HCL resistant to both purine analogs and rituximab. LMB-2 targets CD25 and can induce remission providing the HCL cells are CD25+. All HCL cells display CD22. Recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin BL22, targeting CD22, has shown significant efficacy in phase I and II testing, and avoids prolonged suppression of both normal B- and T-cells. An improved high-affinity version of BL22, termed HA22, is currently undergoing phase I testing.",M1
19814695,"Importance of minimal residual disease in hairy cell leukemia: monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic strategy.With the use of nucleoside analogs as frontline therapy, the prognosis of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) has improved dramatically. Unfortunately, disease recurrence remains problematic. Eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) persisting after therapy may further improve outcome. The evolution of available techniques used to assess MRD, and the potential incorporation of novel agents such as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) into the treatment armamentarium for HCL mandate that MRD analyses be performed concurrently with routine assessments of disease status. Herein, the available data regarding the prevalence and clinical relevance of MRD after therapy for HCL is reviewed.",M1
19814694,"Long-term follow-up studies in hairy cell leukemia.Enormous progress has been made in the management of patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) over the past 50 years since this disease was initially described in 1958. The introduction of the two commonly used purine nucleoside analogs (pentostatin and cladribine, respectively) has independently changed the natural history of this rare malignancy. Both agents are equivalent in terms of response and long-term results. Advances in therapy are being further pursued with inclusion of monoclonal antibodies (e.g. rituximab) and other immunotherapeutic approaches. Patients with this disease now can live a near normal life expectancy, but the disease has not yet been cured. Clinical trials must continue to address the remaining unanswered questions.",M1
19814693,"Combination therapies to improve the long-term outcome in hairy cell leukemia.Since its first description in 1958, hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) had a long period of different unsatisfactory treatments till the early 1980s, when interferon-alfa and subsequently purine analogs (PAs) pentostatin or cladribine, or pentostatin were described to determine durable responses. However, second lines of treatments are very often needed in the life span of patients with HCL and a small minority of patients are refractory and with poor prognosis. These disadvantages have led to test the efficacy of additional compounds, mainly monoclonal antibodies, combined with PAs. The objective of this presentation is to review the current knowledge of combination treatments in HCL. Combination treatments have been used or proposed for different purposes in HCL: to reduce acute toxicity, to improve complete remission (CR) rate, to overcome resistance/refractoriness, to prolong disease-free survival, or to prolong overall survival. The type of patients to be selected for the combinations and the perspectives of combinations of PAs with monoclonal antibodies will also be discussed.",M1
19814692,"Cladribine in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia: initial and subsequent results.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder associated with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and recurrent infections. Although interferon alpha and pentostatin were initially found to be effective in this disease, cladribine has emerged as the preferred initial therapy. Cladribine given as a single continuous intravenous seven-day infusion is the dosing schedule with the most durable complete remissions and evaluated in the greatest number of patients with HCL. Patients who relapse after purine analogue therapy, whether it be cladribine or pentostatin, can be successfully retreated with cladribine. Patients with HCL may develop complications of recurrent infection and second malignancies. Although both complications are postulated to be related to therapy, they may also be due to the duration and burden of the disease. Minimal residual disease detected on bone marrow biopsy is thought to predict for future relapse. We will review the initial and subsequent results of cladribine in the management of HCL.",M1
19814691,"The biology of hairy cell leukemia.As in all malignancies, the biology of <e>HCL</e> reflects both the behaviour of the malignant cells (hairy cells) themselves and their two-way interaction with the microenvironment. However, the tissue interactions of HCs are particularly striking and involve extensive remodelling of bone marrow, spleen and liver, with relative sparing of lymph nodes. The mechanistic basis of this remodelling is now largely understood and is described herein. Regarding HCs themselves, they are late clonal B cells which have often undergone heavy-chain-isotype class switching and whose VH genes are usually mutated. HCs are highly activated cells in which a number of signalling pathways are constitutively active. This activation determines many of the specific features of HCs, but its cause remains unknown.",M1
19814690,"Historical aspects and milestones in the development of effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, but is gratifying to treat for both physicians and patients. During the 50 years since its initial description as a clinical entity, hematologists have been fascinated by the bizarre appearance of the malignant cell with its hair-like projections. Therapeutic strategies have evolved from splenectomy to interfere to the purine analogues which have become the treatments of-choice and are very effective. Immunoconjugate Therapy with BL22 (anti-CD22 [corrected] antibody linked to truncated to Pseudomonas exotoxin) represents the newest milestone in the development of effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia.",M1
19826898,"Hairy cell leukemia responsive to anti-thymocyte globulin used as immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is occasionally misdiagnosed as aplastic anemia when only a few leukemic cells are present in the circulation. Here, we describe a patient with HCL who initially presented with pancytopenia and received a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporine A and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). No blood cell transfusion was required for approximately 3 years after ATG therapy. She was referred to our hospital because of an abdominal mass and requiring periodic blood transfusions. A bone marrow biopsy at this time revealed proliferation of lymphocytes with a fried egg appearance and an increase in reticulin fibers that are typical findings of HCL. It is notable that our patient with a presumably long history of HCL and an increase in marrow reticulin fibers showed good recovery of hematopoiesis after cladribine therapy. Some HCL patients may receive an initial diagnosis of aplastic anemia and may show a good response to ATG masking the underlying HCL.",M1
19778849,"Hairy cell leukemia.Progress in the treatment of patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) has led to a significant change in the natural history of the disease. With current regimens, the majority of patients achieve a complete remission, and their survival curves are similar to those for appropriate age-matched individuals without the disease. At the same time, new technologies are allowing better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of this and other indolent lymphoid neoplasms. Several studies using modern techniques with different sensitivities have demonstrated the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy with nucleoside analogues in majority of patients. However, it is not clear whether such MRD would invariably lead to leukemia recurrence or what level of MRD can predict relapse. The role of monoclonal antibodies, naked or conjugated with toxins, in the management of HCL and their ability to eradicate MRD is under investigation. Whether such strategies of chemoimmunotherapy would lead to further improvements in the outcome of patients with HCL needs to be further investigated.",M1
19757302,"T-box-expressed-in-T-cells (T-bet) expression by the tumor cells of hairy-cell leukemia correlates with interferon-gamma production.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is an uncommon B-cell malignancy with unknown pathogenesis. In an earlier study, we demonstrated that HCL cells highly express the transcription factor T-box-expressed-in-T-cells (T-bet). T-bet is the master regulator of the T-helper (Th)1 cell response regulating interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and also plays a central role in the T-cell independent Th1-like B-cell response. Here, we demonstrate by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis that neoplastic cells from the peripheral blood of five patients with HCL showed an enhanced expression of IFN-gamma after stimulation. Additionally, a comparison with 55 healthy individuals revealed a significant elevation of IFN-gamma in the sera of patients with HCL. Based on our recent findings that a non-neoplastic B-cell subset, the monocytoid B-cells, are T-bet positive and produce IFN-gamma, we propose that monocytoid and hairy B-cells have a similar function and that the T-bet-IFN-gamma axis is involved in the pathogenesis of HCL.",M1
19745070,"VH4-34+ hairy cell leukemia, a new variant with poor prognosis despite standard therapy.Hairy cell leukemia variant (HCLv) presents with high disease burden, lack of typical antigens like CD25, and poor response to standard treatments like cladribine. Occasionally, patients with classic <e>HCL</e> respond poorly. Clinical and molecular features of HCL and HCLv has not been compared. Rearrangements expressing immunoglobulin VH chain were sequenced, including 22 from 20 patients with HCLv and 63 from 62 patients with classic HCL. Most patients were seeking relapsed/refractory trials, representing a poor-prognosis population. VH4-34, a gene commonly used in autoimmune disorders, was observed in 8 (40%) HCLv and 6 (10%) classic (P = .004) HCL patients. Compared with 71 VH4-34(-) rearrangements, 14 VH4-34(+) rearrangements were more frequently (P &lt; .001) unmutated, defined as greater than 98% homologous to germline sequence. VH4-34(+) patients had greater white blood cell counts at diagnosis (P = .002), lower response rate (P &lt; .001) and progression-free survival (P = .007) after initial cladribine, and shorter overall survival from diagnosis (P &lt; .001). Response and survival were more closely related to VH4-34 status than to whether or not patients had HCLv. VH4-34(+) HCL is an important disorder that only partly overlaps with the previously described HCLv. Response to initial single-agent cladribine therapy is suboptimal; these patients should be considered for alternative approaches, including antibody-related therapy.",M1
19682064,"Characterisation of hairy cell leukaemia by tiling resolution array-based comparative genome hybridisation: a series of 13 cases and review of the literature.Little is known about the cytogenetic features and molecular mechanisms behind hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>), despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, we used high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to characterise copy number alterations (CNAs) in DNA from 13 cases of HCL. We also summarise CNAs and cytogenetic features in 109 HCL cases comprising our 13 cases and 96 cases from the literature. Genomic array-CGH revealed imbalances in two out of 13 cases in addition to previously described copy number variants (CNVs) found in healthy individuals. In one case, a 700 kb deletion of 20q11.22 was detected encompassing ten characterised genes, among them the TP53INP2, DNCL2A and ITCH genes. In the second case, trisomy 5, and a deletion of 5p15.2 encompassing a non-characterised gene AY328033 was found. Altogether only 20/81 (25%) of all cases studied by CGH or gene dose array revealed CNAs. The most common recurrent deletions and breakpoints were 14q22-32 (33%), 6q25 (16%), 2p12 (10%), 22q11 (10%), 17p11-13 (10%), 7q32-36 (9%), 18q11-13 (7%), 1q32-44 (6%), 8p22-23 (6%) and 7q11 (6%). Trisomy 5 occurred in 15%. In addition, several other recurrent breakpoints were identified. Although a number of genomic imbalances were identified in the HCL samples, the genome appeared remarkably stable.",M1
19667403,"Hairy cell leukemias with unmutated IGHV genes define the minor subset refractory to single-agent cladribine and with more aggressive behavior.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is generally responsive to single-agent cladribine, and only a minority of patients are refractory and with poor prognosis. HCLs generally express mutated (M) and, in a minority, unmutated (UM) IGHV. In a multicenter clinical trial in newly diagnosed HCL, we prospectively investigated clinical and molecular parameters predicting response and event-free survival after single-agent cladribine. Of 58 HCLs, 6 expressed UM-IGHV (UM-HCL) and 52 M-IGHV (M-HCL). Beneficial responses were obtained in 53 of 58 patients (91%), whereas treatment failures were observed in 5 of 58 patients (9%). Failures were associated significantly with UM-IGHV (5 of 5 failures vs 1 of 53 beneficial responses had UM-IGHV, P &lt; .001), leukocytosis (3 of 5 vs 3 of 53, P = .006), and bulky spleen (4 of 5 vs 4 of 53, P &lt; .001). The UM-HCL not benefiting from cladribine characteristically had bulky spleen (4 of 5, 80%), leukocytosis (3 of 5, 60%), and TP53 defects (2 of 5, 40%), and progressed rapidly after first treatment (median event-free survival, 7.5 months). Our data suggest that UM-HCLs identify the minor subgroup failing cladribine treatment and with more aggressive disease. High incidence of TP53 dysfunction indicates a potential mechanism of resistance to cladribine in the UM-HCL group. Overall, our data provide new molecular elements relevant for treatment concerns in HCL.",M1
19414673,"Phase II trial of recombinant immunotoxin RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22) in patients with hairy cell leukemia.PURPOSE: To conduct a phase II trial in chemoresistant hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) with BL22, a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin which showed phase I activity in HCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory HCL and needed treatment based on blood counts. Patients were stratified into three groups: response to cladribine less than 1 year, those with a response lasting 1 to 4 years, or no response and uncontrolled infection. Patients received BL22 40 microg/kg every other day for three doses on cycle 1. Those achieving hematologic remission (HR), defined as neutrophils &gt; or = 1,500/mm(3), hemoglobin &gt; or = 11 g/dL, and platelets &gt; or = 100,000/mm(3), were observed. Patients without HR were re-treated at 30 microg/kg every other day for three doses every 4 weeks beginning at least 8 weeks after cycle 1. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled including 26, nine, and one in groups 1 to 3. The response after one cycle (CR, 25%; PR, 25%) improved when 56% were re-treated (CR, 47%; PR, 25%). CR rate was similar in groups 1 and 2 (P = .7). Twenty-two with baseline spleen height lower than 200 mm had higher CR (64% v 21%; P = .019) and OR rates (95% v 36%; P = .0002) compared to 14 with spleens either absent or higher than 200 mm. The only serious toxicity was reversible grade 3 hemolytic uremic syndrome, not requiring plasmapheresis, in two patients (6%). High neutralizing antibodies were observed in four patients (11%) and prevented re-treatment. CONCLUSION: BL22 activity in HCL is confirmed. Best responses to BL22 after cladribine failure are achieved before the patients develop massive splenomegaly or undergo splenectomy.",M1
19344416,"Long-term follow-up of 233 patients with hairy cell leukaemia, treated initially with pentostatin or cladribine, at a median of 16 years from diagnosis.Hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) was first described 50 years ago. Median survival was then 4 years. The purine analogues, introduced in the 1980s, transformed this prognosis. We reviewed data retrospectively from 233 patients, treated with pentostatin (n = 188) or cladribine (n = 45), to investigate the current long-term outlook. Median follow-up was 16 years. There were no significant differences in outcome between the two agents. Overall, the complete response (CR) rate was 80% and median relapse-free survival was 16 years. After relapse (n = 79) or non-response (n = 5), 26 patients received pentostatin and 58 cladribine; 69% achieved CR and median relapse-free survival was 11 years. After third-line therapy (n = 23), 50% achieved CR and median relapse-free survival was 6.5 years. However, CRs were equally durable, whether after first, second or third-line therapy. Complete responders and those with both haemoglobin &gt;100 g/l and platelet count &gt;100 x 10(9)/l before treatment had the longest relapse-free survival (P &lt; 0.0001). Patients still in CR at 5 years had only a 25% risk of relapse by 15 years. Outcomes for patients with recurrent disease improved with the monoclonal antibody rituximab, combined with either purine analogue. Overall only eight patients died of HCL-related causes. Patients achieving a CR can expect a normal lifespan.",M1
19302557,"Risk factors for severe infection in patients with hairy cell leukemia: a long-term study of 73 patients.Although the survival of patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) has been improved by the therapeutic introduction of interferon alpha and purine analogs, it is still worsened by complications such as severe infections. In this long-term study, we identified factors influencing patient outcomes in 73 patients with HCL. Median age at diagnosis was 53 yr and the gender ratio (M/F) was 2.3. At the time of HCL diagnosis, 60 patients (82%) were symptomatic and 22 of these had an infection. After a median follow-up of 13 yr, eight patients had died of secondary cancer (n = 2), HCL progression (n = 1) and age-related complications (n = 5). The 10-yr overall survival (OS), progression-free survival and relapse rates were 91 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 5% and 87 +/- 5%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, age &gt;53 yr was the only factor adversely influencing OS and secondary cancer incidence, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 9.30 (95%CI, 1.15-76.6; P = 0.037) and 2.80 (95%CI, 1.05-7.71; P = 0.04), respectively. Eleven patients developed severe infections. Absolute lymphocyte count (&lt;1 x 10(9)/L) at diagnosis was the only factor influencing the occurrence of severe infections, with an adjusted HR of 4.01 (P = 0.007). Strikingly, we did not observe any significant correlation between neutrophil or monocyte counts and the incidence of infection. We confirmed long-term survival in HCL but found a high incidence of infection - even late in the course of the disease. The absolute lymphocyte count at diagnosis is a risk factor for the occurrence of severe infections. In addition to careful monitoring of infections, prompt initiation of anti-HCL treatment should be considered in patients with low lymphocyte counts.",M1
19301150,"Hairy cell leukemia-related disorders consistently show low CD27 expression.In Japan, typical hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is rare, and HCL-Japanese variant (HCL-JV) is more common. Hairy B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (HBLD) is another unusual disorder of polyclonal B-lymphocytosis of hairy cell appearance. In the present study, we analyzed the clinical features of 3 patients with HCL, 3 with HCL-JV, and 3 with HBLD. All HBLD patients had the DRB1*04 allele. As compared with other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, CD27 expression on B cells was significantly lower in all patients, ranging from 0.3% to 23.4%. Our results suggest that low CD27 expression may be a distinct feature of these HCL-related disorders.",M1
19289595,"Immunophenotypic analysis of CD103+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders: hairy cell leukemia and its mimics.CD103 is characteristically expressed in hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), a B-lymphoproliferative disorder highly responsive to treatment with purine analogs. Other CD103+ diseases are rare and do not respond well to the same therapy, including HCL variant (HCLv) and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (SMZL) variants. We analyzed 215 cases of CD103+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders to further delineate their immunophenotypic features. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 78.6% of all cases expressed CD25 and CD103, characteristic of classical HCL. Cases analyzed immunohistochemically were also invariably positive for annexin-A1; a subset coexpressed CD10 (33/169 [19.5%]) or BCL1 (26/65 [36.9%]). In contrast, 21.4% of cases lacked CD25, a subset of which was analyzed and was invariably negative for annexin-A1, CD10, and BCL1. The CD25- cases had variable morphologic features ranging from HCLv and SMZL to prolymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Clinically, patients with CD25- disease tended to be older (P= .001), typically had leukocytosis (P= .014), and did not respond well to cladribine or pentostatin. We suggest categorizing CD103+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders into 2 groups. While HCL coexpresses CD25 and annexin-A1, diseases lacking CD25 and annexin-A1 behave clinically differently and can be separated from HCL on diagnosis.",M1
19259059,"Rituximab in the treatment of the variant of hairy cell leukaemia: a case report.Hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) is an uncommon, low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. HCL-variant describes an entity of HCL that is important from the point of view of requiring differential diagnosis from HCL, and for requiring careful consideration of the treatment approach. HCL-variant differs from the classic form with respect to the lack of monocytopaenia, its elevated WBC and unique morphology and immunophenotype. Indeed, there is currently no adequate standard treatment for this condition - HCL-variant is generally resistant to interferon-alpha, and complete remission is rarely achieved with either pentostatin or cladribine. We report a 57-year-old female patient who presented at our institution in November 2004 with high white blood counts and splenomegaly. Based on her blood morphology, bone marrow and spleen histology, immunophenotype and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed as having HCL-variant, with blastoid variant transformation. The patient had advanced-stage disease. She was initially treated with spleenctomy, which resulted in short-term normalization of blood counts. One month later the blood counts deteriorated, she developed peripheral and abdominal lymphadenopathy and had poor performance status. One cycle of cladribine combined with rituximab was immediately administered. We started with rituximab 375 mg/m(2), which resulted in a remarkable recovery of blood counts, followed by cladribine 0.1 mg/kg for 7 days. However, the patient's general condition worsened, and she subsequently died from heart failure. Our experience from this case suggests that rituximab is a promising therapy for patients with HCL-variant, particularly when combined with cladribine. However, further clinical study is required before rituximab can be considered as a front-line therapy for this form of malignancy.",M1
19253258,"Visual disturbance as initial presentation of hairy cell leukemia.PURPOSE: Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare disorder that occasionally has visual symptoms after diagnosis. The authors present a case of HCL in which bilateral visual symptoms led to the initial diagnosis. METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: Bilateral decreased vision to 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left due to intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages with no other systemic signs or symptoms prompted a hematologic evaluation in which HCL was found to be the causative disorder in a previously healthy 41-year-old man. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present a rare case in which bilateral visual complaints led to the diagnosis of HCL. Thus, though uncommon, HCL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of otherwise unexplained retinal hemorrhages.",M1
19227908,"[Hairy cell leukemia in young patients]AIM: To characterize clinical symptoms, course, immediate and long-term treatment results in young patients with hair cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data on 41 HCL patients were analysed. The diagnosis was made by standard diagnostic protocol for HCL detection. RESULTS: The analysis of the age of 160 HCL patients studied demonstrated high (26%) incidence of HCL at young age. Young patients with HCL had special clinical manifestations and specific long-term outcomes of treatment with standard schemes. CONCLUSION: Differences in occurrence of recurrences after standard therapy make it necessary to consider young HCL patients as a separate group who need adjuvant treatment to prolong remission.",M1
19097393,"Paraneoplastic vasculitis associated with hairy cell leukemia.Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, accounting for about 2-3% of all leukemias in adults. The skin lesions were described in about 10-12% of patients. Vasculitis in lymphoproliferative disease is relatively uncommon and may predate the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease. A 54-year old female with one month history of general symptoms and sudden onset of maculopapular exanthema on the skin, suffered from anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Examination of the skin biopsy revealed lymphocytic vasculitis. Immunophenotyping of the skin biopsy revealed cell population with CD45RO, and small groups with CD20, partly DBA44 positivity. Bone marrow trepanobiopsy showed 50% infiltration with medium-sized lymphoid cells with clear cytoplasm and immunophenotypic coexpression of CD20 and DBA-44 antigens. The diagnosis of HCL was confirmed by flow cytometry of the bone marrow and of the peripheral blood cells that revealed pathological cell population with expression of CD11c, CD19, CD25, CD103. The patient was successfully treated with a single dose of cladribrine. The patient with acute vasculitis should be screened and monitored for possible lymphoproliferative diseases. Skin manifestation of acute vasculitis accompanied with hairy cells may be the first manifestation of HCL. Purine nucleoside analogue cladribrine is considered as the first line of therapy for HCL and induces a total response in more than 80% of cases with HCL.",M1
19077050,"Long-term follow-up of interferon-alpha induction and low-dose maintenance therapy in hairy cell leukemia.OBJECTIVE: Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) was the first effective pharmacologic treatment of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). Since 1990 purine analogs replaced IFNalpha because of higher rates of complete remission and an invariable disease recurrence after cessation of IFNalpha. However, there are only limited data about long-term maintenance treatment with IFNalpha and none about dose finding in this phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients treated at our institution for HCL are included in this retrospective analysis. Forty (77%) patients received IFNalpha and 35 patients continue on long-term IFNalpha maintenance therapy. The initial dose of IFNalpha was 3 Mio IU three times per week and was tapered 6 months after initiation to doses as low as 3 Mio IU/12 wk. Dose adaptation was performed by repeated measurement of soluble Interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2R) together with peripheral blood values. RESULTS: The median follow-up of patients in the long-term IFNalpha group was 13.6 +/- 7.5 yr. Long-term IFNalpha was in general well tolerated and only in six (17%) patients the treatment had to be changed to purine analogs in the long-term IFNalpha group because of side effects. There are no deaths directly related to HCL. CONCLUSIONS: IFNalpha is still an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option. By repeated measurements of sIL2R together with the peripheral blood values, IFNalpha doses can be tapered to the minimal effective dose. The advantages and disadvantage of IFNalpha in regards to the standard treatment in HCL patients are discussed.",M1
19046317,"A case of Mollitias and Fragilitas Ossium - unusual presentation of hairy cell leukaemia followed by the diagnosis of nonsecretory myeloma.Hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a B-cell malignancy with a late developmental arrest. This report describes a patient that presented with leucocytosis and splenomegaly. The abnormal leucocytes showed typical morphology and expressed CD103, CD11c, CD19 and CD20 but not CD25 by immunophenotyping. The patient failed to respond to splenectomy and then developed lytic bone lesions and pathological fractures, which progressed despite a single course of cladribine chemotherapy. Review of the pathology of the bone reamings showed nonsecretory myeloma of the same kappa-light chain isotype. He went on to receive induction chemotherapy in preparation for an autologous stem-cell transplant but failed to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells. He has had two localized relapses with bony lesions, one within 6 weeks of stopping chemotherapy for which he received localized radiotherapy and thalidomide consolidation. Sequential myeloma has been described in HCL. There is controversy whether this represents clonal evolution or a secondary malignancy. An increased rate of secondary malignancies has been reported by some, but not other, authors in long-term survivors of HCL. This case illustrates the value of a repeat pathological review in case of unexpected complications.",M1
19017688,"Occupational exposure to pesticides and lymphoid neoplasms among men: results of a French case-control study.OBJECTIVES: Investigating the relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and the risk of lymphoid neoplasms (LNs) in men. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in six centres in France between 2000 and 2004. The cases were incident cases with a diagnosis of LN aged 18-75 years. During the same period, controls of the same age and sex as the cases were recruited in the same hospital, mainly in the orthopaedic and rheumatological departments. Exposures to pesticides were evaluated through specific interviews and case-by-case expert reviews. Four hundred and ninety-one cases (244 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 87 of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 104 of lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPSs) and 56 of multiple myeloma (MM) cases) and 456 controls were included in the analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI were estimated using unconditional logistic regressions. RESULTS: Positive associations between HL and occupational exposure to triazole fungicides and urea herbicides were observed (OR = 8.4 (2.2 to 32.4), 10.8 (2.4 to 48.1), respectively). Exposure to insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were linked to a threefold increase in MM risk (OR = 2.8 (1.2 to 6.5), 3.2 (1.4 to 7.2), 2.9 (1.3 to 6.5)). For LPS subtypes, associations restricted to hairy-cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) were evidenced for exposure to organochlorine insecticides, phenoxy herbicides and triazine herbicides (OR = 4.9 (1.1 to 21.2), 4.1 (1.1 to 15.5), 5.1 (1.4 to 19.3)), although based on small numbers. Lastly, despite the increased ORs for organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, carbamate fungicides and triazine herbicides, no significant associations were evidenced for NHL. CONCLUSIONS: The results, based on case-by-case expert review of occupation-specific questionnaires, support the hypothesis that occupational pesticide exposures may be involved in HL, MM and HCL and do not rule out a role in NHL. The analyses identified specific pesticides that deserve further investigation and the findings were consistent with those of previous studies.",M1
18939925,"Extranodal hairy cell leukemia presenting in the lumbar spine.The authors report on a 54-year-old man who presented with a lumbar vertebral body lesion and an adjacent epidural lesion that was found to be hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). The patient presented with gradual onset of back pain and intermittent lower-extremity radicular symptoms. He did not have splenomegaly or peripheral blood count abnormalities. Admission MR imaging revealed an L-5 vertebral body lesion and a lumbar epidural lesion extending from L-3 to S-2. An [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET study showed numerous sites of osseous involvement. The patient underwent minimally invasive surgical biopsy sampling of the epidural lesion. Histopathological examination revealed extranodal HCL. After treatment with a 5-day course of cladribine, the patient's symptoms resolved, and at the 16-week follow-up visit there was no radiographic or metabolic evidence of disease. Hairy cell leukemia rarely involves neurological structures, but this patient responded well to standard treatment. This case demonstrates the value of tissue biopsy procedures instead of aggressive resection and the use of minimally invasive techniques to treat an HCL spinal lesion.",M1
18809981,"Defective interferon-gamma production in patients with hairy cell leukaemia.BACKGROUND: Patients with hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) have an increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria and Listeria. Although several abnormalities of T-cell populations have been described in HCL, the effector mechanism responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections is not known. METHODS: Blood was collected from 11 patients with HCL and 22 age- and gender-matched volunteers. Proinflammatory cytokine production by freshly isolated mononuclear cells was stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or various heat-killed microorganisms. Cytokine concentrations were assessed by specific ELISAs. RESULTS: We demonstrate that mononuclear cells harvested from HCL patients have a specific defect of IFNgamma production when stimulated with a broad panel of bacterial stimuli. In contrast, the production of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6, did not differ between HCL patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The specific defect in IFNgamma production may play a role in the susceptibility of patients with hairy cell leukaemia towards intracellular pathogens.",M1
18798533,"Therapeutic advances in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome over the past 40 years.Major therapeutic progress has been accomplished in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) over the past 40 years, which may not be fully appreciated by the larger medical community. The objective of this review was to briefly highlight the treatment breakthroughs in leukemia and MDS. Therapeutic progress happened through better understanding of disease pathophysiologies and rational development of targeted agents, like imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and through astute, empirical discoveries in the clinic, like all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and chlorodeoxyadenosine in hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). Today, the 5- to 10-year survival rates in patients with APL and HCL exceed 80%. In patients with CML, imatinib therapy has been associated with estimated 5- to 7-year survival rates from 85% to 90%. In patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, modern intensive regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates from 20% up to 40%. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemoimmunotherapy recently produced high rates of quality responses and improved long-term outcome. In younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 5-year survival rates range from 40% to 50%, although elderly AML remains a therapeutic challenge. In patients with MDS, it was recently demonstrated that epigenetic therapy with hypomethylating agents improved survival. Much therapeutic progress has been witnessed in leukemia and MDS, and much more is expected to occur soon.",M1
18798068,"Hairy cell leukemia: current concepts.Hairy cell Leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that was characterized in the late 1950s. HCL is defined, according to the WHO classification, as a mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasm (1). HCL accounts for between 2-3% of all leukemia cases, with about 600 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year (1). HCL occurs more commonly in males, with an overall male to female ratio of approximately 4:1. The median age of onset is 52 years. This disease is seen more commonly in Caucasians and appears to be especially frequent in Ashkenazi Jewish males, with rare occurrence in persons of Asian and African descents (1). Hairy cells are distinct, clonal B cells arrested at a late stage of maturation. They are small B lymphoid cells that possess oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm with characteristic micro-filamentous ( hairy ) projections. They strongly express CD103, CD22, and CD11c (2). These cells typically infiltrate the bone marrow, the spleen, and to a lesser extent the liver, lymph nodes, and skin. Many patients present with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Other clinical manifestations include recurrent opportunistic infections and vasculitis. Historically, HCL was considered uniformly fatal (2). However, recent treatment advances, using purine analogues such as Cladribine and Pentostatin, led to a significant improvement in prognosis with achievement of high response rates and durable remissions (2).",M1
18626146,"Hairy cell leukemia: clinical, pathological and ultrastructural findings in Asian-Indians.BACKGROUND: Hairy-cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), lymphoproliferative disease of older age, is characterized by projections from surface of abnormal cells. AIM: The aim was to study the clinical presentation and ultrastructural changes in hairy cells (HCs) following cladribine treatment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Clinical presentation, peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy of HCL cases diagnosed over a period of three years were reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive HCL cases in Hematology clinic of a tertiary care center were enrolled. Tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test was done to detect HCs and electron microscopy was done to demonstrate initial ultrastructural changes and alterations following cladribine therapy. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of HCL, aged 32-57 years (median 47 years) were studied. The clinical presentation included splenomegaly in 15 (100%), fever in 10 (67%), hepatomegaly and pain abdomen in eight (53%), fatigue in nine (60 %) cases. The commonest laboratory features were monocytopenia in 13 (87%), neutropenia in 12 (80%), anemia in 10 (67 %) and pancytopenia in nine (60%). All patients showed symptomatic improvement on cladribine therapy. Electron microscopy after treatment (three months) showed loss of the finger like projections, characteristic bald lymphocytes, loss of ribosomal lamellar complexes, as well as decrease in mitochondria and vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: Indian patients with HCL are younger. Cladribine is an effective therapy for these patients and leads to complete response in most of the patients. There is a significant improvement in the ultrastructural features following cladribine therapy.",M1
18596230,"Soluble CD22 as a tumor marker for hairy cell leukemia.CD22 is an important immunotherapeutic target on B-cell malignancies, particularly hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), but its soluble extracellular domain, sCD22, has not yet been reported in the blood. By immunoaffinity and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques using anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies, we identified the 100-kDa extracellular domain of CD22 and an 80-kDa processed form in serum of patients with HCL. The median sCD22 level measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 18 ng/mL for 93 patients with HCL. sCD22 levels varied from 2.1 to 163 ng/mL and were higher (P &lt; .001) than 23 normal donors (median, 0.6 ng/mL). More than 95% of normal donors had sCD22 levels less than 1.9 ng/mL. sCD22 levels were proportional to concentrations of circulating HCL cells (P = .002), and HCL spleen size (P &lt; .001). sCD22 levels normalized with complete but not partial response to treatment. sCD22 levels up to 300 ng/mL had less than a 2-fold effect on the cytotoxicity of the anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22. sCD22 levels may be useful to follow in patients with HCL and may be more specific than sCD25 in patients with CD22(+)/CD25(-) disease. Trials are listed on www.cancer.gov as NCT00002765, NCT00021983, NCT00074048, NCT00085085, NCT00337311, and NCT00462189.",M1
18580071,"A novel CD11c monoclonal antibody effective in formalin-fixed tissue for the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) and its distinction from other B-cell lymphomas can be difficult in formalin-fixed tissue. This is because the histology is not always classical, and despite having a characteristic phenotype, there are few relevant monoclonal antibodies with sufficient sensitivity and specificity that can be applied to fixed material. In this study, we assessed the utility of a newly developed antibody against a formalin-resistant CD11c epitope (5D11) for the diagnosis and monitoring of HCL in formalin-fixed tissue. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining for CD11c expression in formalin-fixed and also decalcified tissue of 196 small B-cell lymphomas, including 104 cases of HCL showing extensive to minimal infiltrates. RESULTS: The CD11c antibody was both sensitive and specific for HCL, even in cases with minimal infiltration. CONCLUSION: We recommend that this CD11c antibody be added to a panel of antibodies for immunostaining of formalin-fixed material, for differentiation of HCL from other small B-cell lymphomas, and for detection of residual disease following therapy.",M1

As expected, both 2 and 5 years later the disease had progressed and the patient was therefore twice retreated with Cladribin. A bone marrow examination after the last Cladribin course showed complete response with residual disease (CR-RD). The patient received consolidation therapy with Rituximab, achieved complete response (CR) and was still in CR 9 months later.

18559497,"Underexpression of RhoH in Hairy Cell Leukemia.The cause of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is unknown. Current treatments seem effective only for a limited period of time. In addition, a significant proportion of patients remain refractive to all treatment options. These considerations indicate the need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies for HCL. Here, we report that HCL is characterized by underexpression of RhoH. In vitro reconstitution of RhoH expression inhibits the aberrant adhesion and transendothelial migration that drives disease pathogenesis. In an in vivo model of HCL, RhoH reconstitution limits malignant progression and protects against mortality. These findings provide the proof of principle that RhoH reconstitution represents a potential new approach to the treatment of HCL.",M1
18477040,"Hairy cell leukaemia: a heterogeneous disease?The US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program was used to develop aetiological clues for hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>). Descriptive techniques (age-adjusted incidence trends, age-specific incidence rates (IR), and age distributions-at-diagnosis) were supplemented with mathematical models (two-component mixture, generalized linear regression, and age-period-cohort). There were 2856 cases of HCL diagnosed during 1978-2004 (IR 0.32/100,000 person-years). IRs were nearly 4-fold greater among men than women and more than 3-fold higher for Whites than Blacks. Temporal trends were stable over time. Age-specific IRs increased rapidly until approximately 40 years then rose at a slower pace. The age-specific IR curves reflected bimodal early- and late-onset age distributions-at-diagnosis (or density plots), with some variation by gender. Among both men and women, a two-component mixture model fitted the data better than a single density or cancer population. Age-period-cohort models confirmed statistically significant age-related effects after full adjustment for temporal trends (calendar-period and birth-cohort effects). In summary, age incidence patterns (rates and bimodal densities) suggested that HCL is a heterogeneous disease, consisting of at least two underlying subgroups and/or cancer populations by age-at-onset. Distinct early- and late-onset HCL populations may reflect different age-related causal pathways, risk factor profiles, and/or stem cells of origin.",M1
18397341,"High density genome-wide DNA profiling reveals a remarkably stable profile in hairy cell leukaemia.Hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare B-cell neoplasm for which the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. High-density genome-wide DNA profiling was performed with Affymetrix 250K arrays to analyse copy number (CN) changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 16 cases of HCL. Four of 16 cases (25%) demonstrated gross non-recurrent CN deletions. Within the affected regions, we identified genes involved in bone marrow fibrosis (FGF12) and response to treatment (TP53) in individual cases. Large regions (&gt; 5 Mb) of LOH without any concomitant DNA CN changes were identified in 5/16 (31%) HCL and were indicative of uniparental disomy UD. The germline origin of UD was demonstrated in one case for which a matched normal sample was available. Overall analysis of LOH showed that identical loci were recurrently targeted in chromosomes 1, 2 and 6. As a whole, however, HCL showed a remarkably stable genome. This finding adds to several other features that are unique to HCL among mature B-cell tumours.",M1
18295331,"PRAME expression in hairy cell leukemia.PRAME has been proposed as a useful marker for solid tumors and acute B-cell malignancies. Several studies demonstrate expression in CLL. To further examine its B-cell tumor distribution, we studied PRAME in both CLL and hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). While by conventional PCR only 8% of 37 HCL and 27% of 22 CLL patients were positive, nearly all patients and normal donors expressed PRAME by real-time quantitative (TaqMan) PCR. We conclude that HCL and CLL differ in PRAME overexpression, and that basal normal expression of PRAME may limit its usefulness for following patients with minimal residual CLL or HCL.",M1

There is a high sensitivity of combined DBA.44/TRAP-positivity (+) in confirming HCL. A previous study of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma showed DBA.44+ in 10%, TRAP+ in 29%, and DBA.44+/TRAP+ in 5%. OBJECTIVE: We now study nodal MZL (NMZL) and HC-V. DESIGN: Two HCL, 2 HC-V, 3 MZL of bone marrow (BM), 2 MZL versus B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (BCL, NOS) of BM, and 4 NMZL and 5 extranodal MZL (EMZL) were stained with DBA.44 and TRAP and reviewed for staining pattern/intensity. RESULTS: DBA.44 intensely stained all cells in 2/2 HCL, 1/2 HC-V, and 1 EMZL; intensely stained &gt;20% of neoplastic cells (NCs) in 7 MZLs (1 BM, 3 NMZL, and 3 EMZL); and was negative/stained &lt;10% of NCs in 1/2 HC-V, the remaining MZLs (2 BM, 1 NMZL, and 1 EMZL), and 2/2 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM. TRAP intensely stained all cells in 2/2 HCL, the DBA.44+ HC-V, and 1 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM; intensely stained &gt;20% of NCs in 1 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM, 1 MZL-BM, and 1 EMZL; and was negative in the remainder (1 HC-V, 2 MZL-BM, 1 MZL vs. BCL, NOS-BM, the 4 NMZL, 3 EMZL) in which it was able to be performed. There was combined DBA.44+/TRAP+ in 2/2 HCL, 1/2 HCV, 1/3 MZL-BM, and 1/5 EMZL. Only 1 case (MZL vs. BCL, NOS-BM) was TRAP+/DBA.44-. CONCLUSIONS: Although combined intense, diffuse TRAP+/DBA.44+ is highly sensitive for HCL, it is not entirely specific, and may be observed in HC-V and EMZL, further supporting a histogenetic relationship between these entities.",M1
18194897,"Combined treatment with splenectomy and cladribine in hairy cell leukemia in Taiwan: a clinicopathologic study of 5 cases.BACKGROUND: Hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) is a rare B-cell lymphoid malignancy that is characterized by the presence of hairy cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, pancytopenia and various degrees of splenomegaly. Very few reports have explored the clinicopathologic features and treatment outcome of HCL in Taiwan. METHODS: Of 33 patients with malignant lymphoma who underwent splenectomy over a 10-year period (1996-2005), 5 cases of HCL were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: All cases presented with various degrees of splenomegaly. Pancytopenia was noted in 3 cases, and lymphadenopathy in 1. Typical hairy cells with positive tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase stain were noted in 2 cases. Only 3 cases could be diagnosed with HCL based solely on bone marrow findings. In contrast, all spleen specimens had characteristic pathologic features. All patients underwent splenectomy uneventfully, and cladribine was given at a median time of 2 months after splenectomy without significant side effects. Complete remission with durable response was documented in 4 patients (80%) with a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 4-96 months). The last patient experienced partial remission but was only followed up for 4 months. CONCLUSION: For the HCL patients in this study, splenectomy had a role not only in improving cytopenia but in aiding diagnosis. Cladribine is safe and highly effective for Taiwanese patients and should be considered as first-line treatment for HCL.",M1

However, flow cytometric analysis determined that these lymphocytes were of polyclonal B-cell origin, showing CD5-, CD10(-), CD11c(+), CD19(+), CD20(+), CD23(-), CD103(-), FMC7(-), HLA-DR(+) and surface membrane immunoglobulin (smIg) G(+) phenotype. The female patient also showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with bone marrow plasmacytosis. The patient was diagnosed as having hairy B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (HBLD). Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was elevated at the time of diagnosis in this patient, but IL-6 receptor (CD126) was not expressed on the hairy B-cells. Intracellular IL-6 was not detected in these cells either, suggesting that IL-6 did not play an important role in the B-lymphocytosis present in our patient with HBLD.",M1
18186965,"Molecular characterization of complete and incomplete immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements in hairy cell leukemia.PURPOSE: We analyzed patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) to achieve a better understanding of the differentiation stage reached by HCL cells and to define the key role of the diversification of cell surface makers, especially CD25 expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 38 previously untreated patients with HCL to characterize their complete (VDJ(H)) and incomplete (DJ(H)) immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (IgH) rearrangements, including somatic hypermutation pattern and gene segment use. RESULTS: A correlation between immunophenotypic profile and molecular data was seen. All 38 cases showed monoclonal amplifications: VDJ(H) in 97%, DJ(H) in 42%, and both in 39%. Segments from the D(H)3 family were used more in complete compared with incomplete rearrangements (45% vs. 12%; P &lt; .005). Furthermore, comparison between molecular and immunophenotypic characteristics disclosed differences in the expression of CD25 antigen; CD25(-) cases, a phenotype associated with HCL variant, showed complete homology to the germline in 3 of 5 cases (60%), whereas this characteristic was never observed in CD25(+) cases (P &lt; .005). Moreover, V(H)4-34, V(H)1-08, and J(H)3 segments appeared in 2, 1, and 2 CD25(-) cases, respectively, whereas they were absent in all CD25(+) cases. CONCLUSION: These results support that HCL is a heterogeneous entity including subgroups with different molecular characteristics, which reinforces the need for additional studies with a larger number of patients to clarify the real role of gene rearrangements in HCL.",M1

Hairy cells were positive for tartaricresistance acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, CD2, CD11c, CD19, CD20, sIgD, CD25, CD103 and k chain. In addition, abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated splenomegaly and multiple nodular early stains in the spleen. She was diagnosed as having typical hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>). The patient was treated with cladribine infused continuously for 7 days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day, which induced partial remission without severe adverse effects. Purine analogs such as cladribine and pentostatine are considered first-line agents for patients with HCL. Treatment with cladribine achieved a high overall response rate for patients with HCL and was safe even in elderly patients like ours. It is necessary to observe carefully the complications of severe infections, second malignancies and relapse of HCL after treatment with cladribine.",M1

Immunophenotyping is necessary to identify the co expression of CD103, CD25, CD11c associated with a typical B-cell clonally pattern and to make a differential diagnosis from other indolent malignancies. Despite the indolent clinical course, treatment is required to resolve symptoms related to splenomegaly and to reduce the incidence of severe infections that are the major complications and a common cause of death. In the past the treatment was only able to resolve the symptoms. In the revised literature, purine analog have been identified as the treatment of choice for this disease. Cladribrine (2-CdA) is able to induce more than 80% of complete remission and is also effective in relapsed patients. Rituximab after 2-CdA treatment can obtain a molecular response in most cases.

Frequent FCRL1 expression was observed by flow cytometry on 12 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) cell lines and many patient samples: 12 of 14 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 7 of 7 follicular lymphoma (FL), 13 of 17 hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), and 2 of 3 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Two recombinant immunotoxins, E3(Fv)-PE38 and E9(Fv)-PE38, were constructed. Both immunotoxins bound to FCRL1-positive cells with similar affinities (3.4 and 3.2 nM) and were cytotoxic to cell lines, but E9(Fv)-PE38 was 4- to 20-fold more cytotoxic than E3(Fv)-PE38. The concentrations that inhibited response by 50% (IC(50)s) of E9(Fv)-PE38 on 11 different FCRL1-positive cell lines ranged from 1.0 ng/mL to 90 ng/mL and correlated with the FCRL1 expression levels. Our results suggest that anti-FCRL1 immunotoxin E9(Fv)-PE38 exhibits remarkably specific cytotoxicity and merits further evaluation for the treatment of FCRL1-positive malignancies, including CLL, HCL, FL, MCL, and other B-NHL.",M1
17886250,"The role of rituximab in combination with pentostatin or cladribine for the treatment of recurrent/refractory hairy cell leukemia.BACKGROUND: The purine analogs pentostatin and cladribine have revolutionized the treatment of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) with overall responses in greater than 85% of patients and a median progression-free survival of up to 15 years. They continue to be effective at second- and even third-line therapy; however, alternative treatments are needed for patients who are or have become refractory to these agents or whose remissions are shorter with each course of therapy. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 8 patients who received pentostatin or cladribine combined concurrently (n = 6 patients) or sequentially (n = 2 patients) with rituximab at second-line therapy (n = 3 patients) and at subsequent lines of therapy (n = 5 patients). Results from a previously reported database of 219 patients with HCL (73 patients who received second-line therapy and 20 patients who received third-line therapy) were used as a historic control group against which to measure benefit. RESULTS: All 8 patients responded to therapy, with 7 complete responses (CRs) (87.5%) and minimal toxicity. All patients who had CRs were negative for minimal residual disease (MRD). At a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 5-39 months) 1 patient developed recurrent disease, and the estimated 2-year recurrence rate was 20% (0% after second-line therapy and 25% after subsequent lines of therapy). In the historic control group, the CR rates were 70% after second-line therapy and 45% after third-line therapy, and the recurrence rates at 2 years were 15% and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of purine analogs with rituximab was safe and effective for patients with recurrent and/or refractory HCL, and the current results suggested an added benefit compared with standard treatment.",M1

This combination is reported to be extremely rare with no clear demonstration of the clonal relationship between the two conditions. After a previous failure of purine analogue therapy, our patient was successfully treated with rituximab resulting in normalisation of blood cell count cessation of blood transfusion and negative iliac crest biopsy. Unfortunately, the patient developed intense and persistent bone pain during the 1(st) line treatment for HCL. Skeletal X-rays, neck-thorax-abdomen CT scan and repeated bone MRI were unremarkable and bone scintigraphy showed non-specific changes. Laboratory examinations were normal. To better evaluate bone scintigraphy results, we finally performed FDG-PET/CT, which showed multiple foci of intense abnormal radiotracer uptake involving the bone marrow. An FDG-PET/CT guided bone marrow biopsy showed primary bone marrow diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Despite 2(nd) and 3(rd) line treatment, the patient died shortly after for central nervous system involvement by NHD. The role of FDG-PET/CT in identifying bone and bone marrow localization of NHD is reviewed and an earlier use is suggested in poorly understood bone pain.",M1

Few data are available about CD45 expression in the various types of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Low levels of CD45 have been reported in pathologic lymphocytes from typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and higher levels of this antigen have been observed in some cases of atypical CLL and in some cases of other types of NHL. One hundred and seven bone marrow samples of NHL with bone marrow infiltration were investigated: 45 typical CLL, 15 atypical CLL, 9 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 1 MCL with CD23 expression, 18 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), 6 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPL), 6 follicular lymphomas (FL), and 7 hairy cell leukemias (<e>HCL</e>). CD45 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry: pathologic lymphocytes were identified on the basis of specific immunophenotypic profile, CD19/K or CD19/lambda co-expression. Results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) along a 1024 linear scale. CD45 expression was measured also on autologous T-lymphocytes and a  CD45 index  was calculated as the ratio MFI of pathologic B-lymphocytes/MFI of T-lymphocytes, to normalize the results obtained. We found four CD45 expression patterns: very low in typical CLL; relatively low in MCL; intermediate intensity in MZL, LPL, and FL; very high expression in HCL. Among the atypical cases, very high CD45 expression was found in one case of CD23-negative CLL, in CD23-positive MCL, and CLL with atypical morphology. The results indicate different levels of maturation in low-grade NHL and may help to characterize such neoplasias.",M1

17667540,"T-bet transcription factor detection facilitates the diagnosis of minimal hairy cell leukemia infiltrates in bone marrow trephines.Diagnosis of minimal infiltration by hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) cells in bone marrow trephines is challenging as its differentiation from interstitially distributed infiltrates of reactive B cells and small B-cell lymphomas other than HCL is difficult or impossible. The diagnostic utility of DBA.44, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and of the recently propagated Annexin A1 is limited in this diagnostic setting since DBA.44 does not always label all HCL cells, TRAP is frequently weakly expressed whereas the numerous Annexin A1-positive hematopoietic cells interfere with the immunohistochemical recognition of sparse HCL cells. Therefore, we searched for antibodies suitable for the identification of minimal HCL infiltrates in formalin-fixed bone marrow trephines. Among the antibodies tested those directed against the T-cell associated transcription factor T-bet showed the required specificity: (1) T-bet is highly expressed in all 85 cases of HCL including 31 cases showing only minimal infiltrates, and (2) T-bet is exclusively expressed only on a subset of reactive T cells which are rare in bone marrow. Although T-bet is also weakly expressed in a proportion of the tumor cells of some small B-cell lymphomas (n=32/69) other than HCL, a reliable distinction is nevertheless easily possible because (1) T-bet is strongly expressed by all hairy cells of all HCL cases and (2) T-bet is not coexpressed in HCL with markers typical for other small B-cell lymphomas/leukemias (ie, CD23, CD5, CD10, and/or BCL6). Therefore, the immunohistochemical detection of T-bet in infiltrated bone marrow trephines represents an important adjunct for the diagnosis of HCL.",M1

In search of the optimal mode of 2-CdA administration, 132 patients with untreated HCL were randomized to receive either standard 5-day 2-CdA protocol or a novel schedule of 6 weekly 2-CdA infusions suggested to be less toxic. Analysis of treatment response confirmed similar complete remission rates, overall response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in both 2-CdA protocols. However, we did not observe lower toxicity in the weekly schedule. Of special interest, no significant differences were found in the rate of grade 3/4 infections (18% for daily and 26% for weekly protocol, difference -8.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -23.2% to 6.9%; P = .28) and the rate of septic deaths (3% for daily and 2% for weekly protocol, difference 1.4%; 95% CI -4.3% to 7.0%; P = .64).

Our objectives were to study the effect of socio-demographic factors on this rare disease and the risk of second malignancies occurring in HCL patients. METHODS: We measured crude and age-adjusted incidence rates of HCL based on reporting to the Israel Cancer Registry (ICR) 1991-2001. Using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis, we assessed survival by gender, ethnicity and geographic region. We ascertained additional primary tumors reported in this population and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for tumors reported after the diagnosis of HCL. RESULTS: The ICR registered 147 cases of HCL among males and 34 in females between 1991 and 2001. Age-adjusted incidence rates were 1.62/10(6)/yr for women and 7.97/10(6)/yr for men, with rates 1.5 times higher in Jewish than in non-Jewish (mainly Arab) men. Mean overall survival also differed by ethnicity. In a multivariate model, increasing age at diagnosis (P &lt; 0.001), as well as Arab origin (P = 0.008) were associated with poorer survival but gender did not significantly affect the survival after controlling for age and ethnicity. Other primary malignancies were reported in 20 (11%) individuals, with a predominance of genito-urinary tumors (65%) among males. Secondary genito-urinary tumors were significantly increased above the expected population rates (SIR 3.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.39-6.36, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In the Israeli population, age and ethnicity were associated with prognosis of HCL. Variations in disease characteristics, stage of disease at diagnosis or differential access to treatment may contribute to these findings. Patients with HCL appear to be at increased risk for genito-urinary malignancies.",M1

In phase-I testing BL22 was very active in chemoresistant hairy-cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), with 19 (61%) of 31 patients achieving complete remission (CR). The low blood counts (cytopenias) which are characteristic of HCL improved in all complete and partial responders.

16990114,"Hairy cell leukemia: towards a curative strategy.Although not all patients who have <e>HCL</e> require therapy at diagnosis, most eventually need treatment. Historically, splenectomy and interferon-alpha resulted in hematologic responses; however, responses tend to be short. The introduction of purine analogs dramatically changed the prognosis for most patients who hae HCL. It is now considered standard of care to use a purine analog, such as 2-CdA or 2'-DCF, as first-line therapy. This approach results in a high CR rate and prolong DFS. Although both agents yield the same rates of CR and survival, 2-CdA seems easier to administer and my be associated with less toxicity. Despite the excellent results with purine analogs, most patients have MRD detected by sensitive techniques; 30% to 40% of patients eventually relapse and most require further therapy. A repeat course of 2-CdA (or 2'-DCF) will result in CR in approximately 70% of patients. For patients who have relapsed or refractory disease, monoclonal antibody-based therapies are emerging options. Rituximab and BL22 are highly active in this setting. Until BL22 becomes widely available, rituximab is a reasonable choice for salvage therapy; however, the dosing schedule needs to be denied further. The roles of rituximab and BL22 as initial therapy for patients who have previously untreated HCL have not been investigated. Fig. 1 is a suggested algorithm for the treatment of HCL.

An immunotoxin recognizes the target cell, internalizes, and the toxin translocates to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis enzymatically. Immunotoxins that show activity in HCL contain truncated Psedomonas exotoxin fused to the Fv fragments of anti-CD25 or anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies.

Several studies have indicated that patients who are in complete remission have survivals that are comparable to those of normal age-matched controls. HCL-related mortality is distinctly uncommon. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that cladribine treatment of HCL is curative because MRD is common in the bone marrows of complete responders. Response criteria for HCL include clinical, hematologic, and morphologic criteria, but do not include flow cytometry, immunohistochemical analysis, or molecular studies. More sensitive techniques have been used by Filleul and colleagues to detect MRD. The used clonoegenic probes from the hypervariable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene and performed polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) on bone marrow biopsy specimens, All seven patients who were in morphologic complete remission after a single cladribine infusion were PCR positive. These data indicate that cladribine induces protracted remissions but is not necessarily curative. MRD can be detected in most patients when sensitive techniques are used. Persistence of immunohistochemical MRD may predict detected MRD remains to be studied in a large number of patients. Investigators from the University of Pisa in Italy have used a combination of cladribine and rituximab to eradicate MRD in patients who have HCL. Ten patients received treatment with a standard infusion of cladribine. Two patients achieved a complete remission, 6 patients achieved a partial remission, and 2 patients failed to respond. All were PCR positive for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene product at the completion of cladribine treatment. All 10 patients had achieved a complete hematologic response 2 months after the completion of ritximab therapy. The curative nature of this treatment will require long-term follow-up. Cladribine represents a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of HCL. The prognosis of patients who have HCL has improved greatly with cladribine therapy.

As a third of patients treated with DCF do not achieve a complete remission (CR) and many of them tend to relapse, we evaluated the potential role of IFN-alpha, randomly administered after DCF, in increasing the number of patients attaining CR and/or duration of CR. METHODS: From March 1997 to December 2000, 167 previously untreated HCL patients, from 37 Italian institutions, were enrolled in the study. A total of 138 males and 29 females, with a median age of 55 yr were included in the study. All patients received six courses of DCF 4 mg/m(2) i.v. every other week and then two additional courses once a month. Complete and partial responders were randomly assigned to receive or not receive IFN-alpha at a dose of 3 MU s.c. three times a week for 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients enrolled in the study, 145 (86.8%) obtained a CR or a partial remission (PR) and were therefore suitable for randomization. One hundred and thirty-five patients were successively randomized to receive IFN-alpha (63 cases; arm A) or not (72 cases; arm B). Progression of disease was observed in eight (arm A) and 12 (arm B) patients with a median time of 27.8 and 26.9 months, respectively. As far as the improvement in response was concerned, no significant difference in the two subgroups was observed. In fact, five patients in arm A and six patients in arm B showing a good PR at the end of DCF therapy, subsequently attained a late CR.

Treatment of progressive symptomatic HCL includes a variety of pharmacological approaches such as interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), pentostatin (DCF) and cladribine (2-CdA), which have significantly improved the disease prognosis. 2-CdA and DCF seem to induce a similar high response rate and a long overall survival.

HCL variant (HCL-V) is a distinct clinico-pathological entity which seems to be resistant to IFN-alpha and purine nucleoside analogs - DCF and 2-CdA. However, preliminary observations suggest that monoclonal antibodies - rituximab and BL-22 immunotoxin are highly active in this disorder even refractory to 2-CdA. In this review current therapeutic strategies in HCL and HCL-V are presented.",M1
16761764,"Hairy cell leukemia-variant--a case report.Hairy-cell leukemia-variant (<e>HCL</e>-V) is a rare B-cell disorder which accountsfor 10% of HCL cases. The main features are splenomegaly, lymphocytosis and cytopenias without monocytopenia. The circulating cells have a morphology intermediate between prolymphocytes and hairy cells. The immunophenotype shows a mature B-cell phenotype with expression of B-cell antigens CD11c and CD103 but unlike typical hairy cell the cells are negative for CD25. The histology of bone marrow and spleen shows a pattern of infiltration similar to that in HCL. We present a case of HCL-V in a 66-year-old male. The bone marrow findings, immunophenotypic profile and electron microscopic features are described. The patient underwent splenectomy which also revealed infiltration by leukemia. Patients are resistant to alkylating agents and alpha-interferon (á-IFN). Splenectomy may be beneficial for long-lasting partial responses in some of the patients and is a good palliative treatment.",M1

What is the HCL cell of origin? Why does HCL lack the hallmarks of most mature B-cell tumours (for example, chromosomal translocations and consistent lymph node involvement) and show unique features like 'hairy' morphology and bone-marrow fibrosis? Gene-expression profiling and other studies have recently provided new insights into HCL biology and have the potential to affect clinical practice.",M1
16681637,"Somatic hypermutation and VH gene usage in hairy cell leukaemia.To examine the usage and mutational status of VH genes in hairy cell leukaemia (<e>HCL</e>), we analysed 24 immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) sequences expressed in 23 patients. None had premature stop codons. VH3-23 was the most common gene and a VH6 gene was observed for the first time in HCL. Although the mean mutation frequency was 6.1%, slightly higher than in previous HCL series, four patients had 99.6-100% homology to germline sequences, three of whom had high tumour burdens and poor outcomes. Despite the high mutation frequency, only two of 24 rearrangements had clear statistical evidence of antigen-dependent somatic mutation. Our results increase the database of reported functional HCL rearrangements to 94 in 92 patients. Overall, both gene usage and mutation frequency are very similar to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type marginal zone lymphoma. The data are consistent with HCL originating from post-germinal centre marginal zone B cells, although the heterogeneity observed suggests that HCL may originate differently in some patients, and this could have implications for prognosis and treatment.",M1
16681430,"Sandwich ELISAs for soluble immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 2 (IRTA2)/FcRH5 (CD307) proteins in human sera.BACKGROUND: The immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 2 (IRTA2) gene encodes both membrane and secreted forms of the B-cell differentiation antigen (also identified as FcRH5). The membrane form is highly expressed on the surface of hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) cells from patients. This study aimed to develop immunoassays for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 proteins in human serum. METHODS: Two sandwich ELISAs for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 were designed using two pairs of monoclonal antibodies specific to four different epitopes on IRTA2/FcRH5. RESULTS: In both ELISAs, the lower limit of quantitation for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 in human serum was 30 ng/mL. The analytical recovery of 0.3-2.1 ng/mL of IRTA2/FcRH5-Fc used as the standard, from a 100-fold dilution of IRTA2/FcRH5-free sera, was 94-106% for ELISA #1 and 89-97% for ELISA #2. Between-assay coefficients of variance were 7.7-17.6% for ELISA #1 and 7.7-32.7% for ELISA #2. Both ELISAs detected soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 protein in sera from normal donors (median 169 ng/mL in ELISA #1 and 146 ng/mL in ELISA #2, n=123) without correlations to gender or age. A marked increase in soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 levels was observed in samples from patients with HCL (medians 719 ng/mL in ELISA #1 and 754 ng/mL in ELISA #2, n=44). CONCLUSIONS: These ELISAs may be useful for monitoring soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 in HCL and other B-cell malignancies.",M1
16675574,"Minimal residual disease in hairy cell leukemia patients assessed by clone-specific polymerase chain reaction.Cladribine induces long-term complete remission in hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) patients but does not clear minimal residual disease (MRD) according to high-sensitivity PCR assays. To quantify MRD in patients after anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 and other agents, we used a relative quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assay using a primer and probe, both patient specific for the immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement. Using this method, we were able to detect one Bonna 12 HCL cell in either 10(6) Jurkat cells or in 10(6) normal mononuclear cells. We studied 84 samples from 10 patients, taken before or after treatment with BL22 and other agents. Patient-specific RQ-PCR was much more sensitive than flow cytometry, which in turn was (as recently reported) more sensitive than PCR using consensus primers. RQ-PCR was positive in 62 of 62 (100%) flow-positive samples in 10 patients and in 20 of 22 (91%) flow-negative samples in six patients. The relative level of MRD as quantified by RQ-PCR correlated with disease status and remission. Thus, patient-specific RQ-PCR is the most sensitive test for MRD in HCL patients and could be used to determine maximal response in patients obtaining multiple cycles of nonmyelotoxic biological treatment for this disease.",M1

16497968,"Eradication of minimal residual disease in hairy cell leukemia.Although the nucleoside analogs cladribine and pentostatin produce high response rates in patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>), a significant number of patients eventually relapse. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with complete remission (CR) have a longer disease-free survival. Therefore, strategies to improve on the initial response to nucleoside analog therapy are likely to be beneficial, at least for a proportion of patients. We have treated 13 patients with newly diagnosed HCL (n = 11) or after failure of one prior chemotherapy (n = 2) with cladribine (5.6 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours daily for 5 days) followed by 8 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). All patients achieved a CR and minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed by consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or flow cytometry was eradicated in 11 (92%) of 12 and in 12 (92%) of 13 of patients, respectively. There was no decline in the absolute CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte number after rituximab. We conclude that eradication of MRD in HCL is possible. Whether this leads to a reduced risk of relapse would need to be evaluated in a larger number of patients and with longer follow-up. Disease characteristics may potentially be used to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from such additional therapy.",M1

In June 2002, he was treated with pentostatin for progression of thrombocytopenia, but his response was incomplete. In addition, the number of hairy cells (HCs) in his peripheral blood (PB) began gradually to increase. He received treatment with interferon-alpha and cladribine, but he failed to respond completely to these treatments. The HCs in his PB decreased after splenic irradiation in July, 2004. However, he was admitted with acute respiratory distress in November. His white blood cell count was 123.1 X 10(9)/L with 91% HCs. Radiography and computed tomography of his chest revealed ground-glass opacity in both lungs. A bone marrow (BM) aspirate indicated increased cellularity with an 84% HC infiltration level. Based on these findings, we diagnosed pulmonary infiltration by HCs. Rituximab was administered weekly at a dose of 375 mg/m2, and he also received low-dose melphalan in a supportive role. After 8 courses of rituximab therapy, the HCs disappeared in his PB and BM, and his pulmonary infiltrates subsided.

We evaluated 35 HCL cases and identified atypical immunophenotypes in 12 cases (34%), including CD103- in 2 (6%), CD25- in 1 (3%), CD10+ in 5 (14%), and CD23+ in 6 (17%) cases. Among these cases one was CD103-/CD10+ and one was CD10+/CD23+. All available specimens from the 12 cases were reviewed and showed morphologic features characteristic for HCL. The initial clinical information was reviewed and showed no significant differences with that reported for typical HCL. Of the 12 cases, 11 patients received purine analogue therapy and achieved complete remissions. Our study indicates that it is not uncommon for HCL to display an unusual immunophenotype, including negativity for CD103 or CD25.

16311729,"Characterization of T-cell repertoire in hairy cell leukemia patients before and after recombinant immunotoxin BL22 therapy.We previously reported that hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) patients have high percentages of CD56+/CD57+/CD3+ large granular lymphocytes consistent with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), and other investigators have reported skewing of the T-cell repertoire. In previous studies of up to seven HCL patients, many of the 22 established T-cell receptor (TCR) beta variable region (TRBV) families showed mono- or oligoclonal restriction. To determine whether percentages of CTLs are correlated with TRBV clonal excess, we studied 20 HCL patients with flow cytometry, PCR of TCR gamma and TRBV regions, and fractional gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified TRBV CDR3 domains (CDR3 spectratyping). Increased percentages of CD3+/CD8+/CD57+ CTLs correlated with more mono/oligoclonal and fewer polyclonal TRBV families (r=0.53; P=0.016). Age correlated with number of mono/oligoclonal TRBV families (r=0.51; P=0.022). Time since last purine analog therapy correlated with number of polyclonal TRBV families (r=0.46; P=0.040), but treatment with the anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 was not related to clonal excess. We conclude that abnormalities in the T-cell repertoire in HCL patients may represent deficient immunity, and may be exacerbated by purine analogs. Increased CD3+/CD57+ T-cells may be a useful marker of abnormal TRBV repertoire in HCL patients, and might prove useful in deciding whether patients should receive biologic antibody-based treatment rather than repeated courses of purine analog for relapsed disease.",M1

METHODS: We reviewed a series of 219 patients with HCL, with median follow-up from diagnosis of 12.5 years (range 1.0 -34.6 yrs), treated with either pentostatin (n = 185) or cladribine (n = 34), to compare these agents and assess the potential for cure. RESULTS: Overall response to pentostatin was 96% with a complete response (CR) in 81% and a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 15 years. Response to first-line cladribine was 100% with a CR in 82% and DFS of 11+ years. The relapse rates at 5 years and 10 years were 24% and 42%, respectively, with pentostatin, and 33% and 48% with cladribine. Survival at 10 years was respectively 96% and 100%. CR rates decreased with each sequential relapse through 69% to 45% (P &lt; or = 0.001). Patients achieving CR after first-line treatment had a significantly longer DFS (P = 0.00007) than those achieving a partial response; a similar result was seen after second-line therapy (P = 0.00001). DFS also declined with sequential treatment (P = 0.00005). CONCLUSION: We have shown equivalent efficacies for both agents in the treatment of HCL, with DFS showing no plateau. True cure in HCL remains elusive, but the addition of monoclonal antibodies may be beneficial. Our results suggest that achieving CR should remain the main goal of treatment.",M1

Seven patients with classic HCL and 3 with a prolymphocytic HCL variant were administered 2-CdA (0.09 mg/kg per day) by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days. Seven patients responded to this therapy, with 5 patients achieving a complete response (CR).

The median duration of the CR in the CR patients was 953+ days (range, 480+ to 1121+ days). At treatment initiation, most patients had hematologic impairment as a manifestation of HCL. During the early stage after administration, further hematologic impairment occurred, but subsequent peripheral blood counts gradually recovered as 2-CdA treatment showed antitumor activity. Infections occurred at a high incidence at this time, but all cases could be controlled with appropriate treatment. 2-CdA was surmised to represent a useful therapeutic approach for Japanese patients with HCL.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six pretreated patients with CD22+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; n = 4), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 11), and hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>; n = 31) received 265 cycles at 3 to 50 microg/Kg every other day x 3 doses. RESULTS: BL22 was active in HCL, with 19 complete remissions (CRs; 61%) and six partial responses (PRs; 19%) in 31 patients. Of 19 CRs, 11 were achieved after one cycle and eight after two to 14 cycles. All 25 responders benefited clinically with one cycle. The CR rate was 86% in patients enrolled at &gt; or = 40 microg/Kg every other day x 3, and 41% at lower doses (P = .011). The median duration for CR was 36 months (range, 5 to 66 months), and eight patients remain in CR at 45 months (range, 29 to 66 months). Lower but significant activity occurred in CLL. Neutralizing antibodies occurred in 11 (24%) of 46 patients (all HCL). A reversible hemolytic uremic syndrome requiring plasmapheresis was observed in one patient with NHL during cycle 1 and in four patients with HCL during cycle 2 or 3. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) evaluated at cycle 1 was 40 microg/Kg IV. QOD x 3. The most common toxicities at 30 to 50 microg/Kg every other day x 3 included hypoalbuminemia, transaminase elevations, fatigue, and edema. CONCLUSION: BL22 was well tolerated and highly effective in HCL, even after one cycle. Phase II testing is underway to define the efficacy with one cycle and to study safety when additional cycles are needed for optimal response.",M1
16049385,"The use of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) in the treatment of severe sepsis in immunosuppressed patients in the course of hematological diseases.BACKGROUND: Treatment of hemopoietic system neoplasias involves severe complications associated with immunosuppression. We present two cases of treating severe sepsis utilizing recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) in the course of bilateral pneumonia in patients with hairy cell leukemia (<e>HCL</e>) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RhAPC, limited the coagulation cascade by inactivating FVa and FVIIIa, directly and indirectly limiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and improved the fibrinolysis process. These actions break the pathomechanism of sepsis and improve survival. CASE REPORT: Besides intensive, multidirectional treatment of severe sepsis, Xigris (activated drotrecogin alfa) was administered on the second day in both cases. The infusion continued, as recommended, for 96 hours without complications. During treatment the patients' general condition and respiratory efficiency improved, allowing respirator weaning on days 5 and 8 of therapy. These cases of severe sepsis and immunosuppression indicate a high therapeutic efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated). Treatment outcome was uncertain because of the patients' hematological condition, so rapid restoration of respiratory efficiency and no disease progression after discontinuing treatment was a great success, possibly due to implementing Xigris at a relatively early stage of sepsis and the intensive therapy conducted according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Patient survival in severe sepsis directly depends on early diagnosis and institution of treatment. 1. These cases confirm the effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa in severe sepsis as part of multidirectional therapy. 2. Microorganisms causing atypical pneumonia should be considered in diagnosing infections in patients treated with cytostatic agents.",M1

Hodgkin's lymphoma is very rare as a second malignancy and there are only 3 reported cases concerning the association of this lymphoma with HCL. We describe a patient with longstanding HCL in complete remission after cladribine, in whom extranodal Hodgkin's lymphoma appeared 8 years after the diagnosis of HCL. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse intra-osseal neoplastic infiltration of the corpora of the whole spinal column and extra-osseal propagation from the fifth thoracic vertebra into the spinal canal with spinal cord compression. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the extradural tumor, which was completely excised, disclosed nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma with typical Reed-Sternberg cells that were positive for CD30, CD15, bcl-6, Ki67, p53, EBV LPM-1 and IgG, and negative for CD45, CD20, DBA44, kappa, lambda light chains and IgM. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of the bone marrow in 1999 showed infiltration with positivity for IgM and negative for kappa light chains and IgG. These findings (expression of different immunoglobulins and light chains on the cells) suggest an independent origin of these 2 B-cell neoplasms.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characterization of visceral hyperalgesia evoked by esophageal balloon distention and acid perfusion in patients with FH, nonerosive reflux disease, and erosive esophagitis and further characterize the pathophysiologic mechanism of FH. METHODS: A total of 21 FH patients (with esophageal acid exposure &lt;3.1% and a symptom index&lt;50% and nonresponse to a therapeutic trial with proton pump inhibitors, 25 Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) patients (with esophageal acid exposure&gt;4%), 23 erosive esophagitis (EE) patients (LA grade B to D), and 18 healthy controls were recruited in the study. Mechanosensitivity including the initial perception threshold (IPT) and pain threshold (PT) was evaluated by using a Barostat with a double-random staircase distension protocol. Chemosensitivity was graded along a visual analog scale after perfusion of saline and 0.1 N <e>HCl</e>. RESULTS: The baseline IPTs and PTs were all lower in patients with FH, NERD, and EE than in the controls (all P&lt;0.01). In addition, the baseline PT in FH patients was significantly lower than those in NERD (P=0.015) and EE patients (P&lt;0.001). After acid perfusion, the mean symptom intensity scores were significantly greater in patients with FH, NERD, and EE than those in the controls (all P&lt;0.001). The postacid perfusion IPTs in patients with FH, NERD, and EE were all significantly lower than the corresponding baseline values (all P&lt;0.01). The PTs in FH (P=0.026) and EE patients (P&lt;0.001) were significantly lower than the corresponding baseline values. Moreover, the postacid perfusion PT was significantly lower in FH patients than in NERD patients (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FH patients are more sensitive to mechanical or chemical stimuli than NERD patients. Sensitization of esophageal acid-sensitive chemoreceptors may exert a significant influence on the pressure-sensitive mechanoreceptors, and there is the cooperative interaction in the process of esophageal visceral hyperalgesia.",M2

Radicals R1a and R1b were identified as carboxyl-centered radicals from one-electron reduction, (H(2)OOC*)CH (NH(3))(+)(CH(2))(3)NHC(NH(2))(2)(+) in two different conformations arising from the two geometrically distinct molecules of the asymmetric unit in the crystal. Density-Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on cluster models constructed separately for each molecule of the asymmetric unit support the assignments. Radical R2 was identified as the decarboxylation radical, *CH(NH(3))(+)(CH(2))(3)NHC (NH(2))(2)(+). Radical R3, with two proton couplings and one nitrogen coupling, was identified as a radical with the unpaired electron localized on the guanidyl group, (-)(OOC)CH(NH(3))(+)(CH(2))(3)NHC*(NH(2))(2)(+). R3 is a product of one-electron reduction different from radicals R1a and R1b. DFT calculations on a cluster model reproduced the experimental values very well and thus supported the assignment of R3. Geometry optimization indicated that the guanidyl group transformed from planar to pyramidal upon trapping the electron. Radical R4 was identified as a side chain dehydrogenation radical, (-)(OOC)CH(NH(3))(+)(CH(2))(2)*CH NHC(NH(2))(2)(+). It was not possible to collect sufficient data to identify radical R5, although it clearly exhibited hyperfine coupling to one nonexchangeable beta-proton.",M2
20360560,"Simulated atmospheric processing of iron oxyhydroxide minerals at low pH: roles of particle size and acid anion in iron dissolution.A number of recent studies have shown that iron dissolution in Fe-containing dust aerosol can be linked to source material (mineral or anthropogenic), mineralogy, and iron speciation. All of these factors need to be incorporated into atmospheric chemistry models if these models are to accurately predict the impact of Fe-containing dusts into open ocean waters. In this report, we combine dissolution measurements along with spectroscopy and microscopy to focus on nanoscale size effects in the dissolution of Fe-containing minerals in low-pH environments and the importance of acid type, including HNO(3), H(2)SO(4), and <e>HCl</e>, on dissolution. All of these acids are present in the atmosphere, and dust particles have been shown to be associated with nitrate, sulfate, and/or chloride. These measurements are done under light and dark conditions so as to simulate and distinguish between daytime and nighttime atmospheric chemical processing. Both size (nano- versus micron-sized particles) and anion (nitrate, sulfate, and chloride) are found to play significant roles in the dissolution of alpha-FeOOH under both light and dark conditions. The current study highlights these important, yet unconsidered, factors in the atmospheric processing of iron-containing mineral dust aerosol.",M2
20357408,"Swift heavy ion irradiation induced enhancement in the antioxidant activity and biocompatibility of polyaniline nanofibers.Polyaniline (PAni) nanofibers doped with <e>HCl</e> and CSA have been irradiated with 90 MeV O(7+) ions with fluence of 3 x 10(10), 3 x 10(11) and 1 x 10(12) ions cm(-2). TEM micrographs show a decrease in the fiber diameter with increasing irradiation fluence, which has been explained on the basis of the Coulomb explosion model. XRD analysis reveals a decrease in the crystalline domain length and an increase in the strain. The increase in d-spacing for the (100) reflection with increasing irradiation fluence is ascribed to the increase in the tilt angle of the polymer chain, which is also evident from micro-Raman spectra. UV-vis spectra of the PAni nanofibers exhibit blue-shift in the absorption bands attributed to pi-pi* band transitions indicating a reduction in particle size after SHI irradiation; as also observed in TEM micrographs. Micro-Raman spectra also reveal a transition from the benzenoid to quinoid structures in the PAni chain as the fluence is increased. Although the quinoid unit has no hydrogen for DPPH scavenging, the antioxidant activity of PAni nanofibers is found to increase with increasing fluence. This has been attributed to the availability of more reaction sites as a result of fragmentation of the PAni nanofibers which compensates for the benzenoid to quinoid transition after irradiation. The biocompatibility of the PAni nanofibers is also found to increase with increasing irradiation fluence, indicating the possibility of employing swift heavy ion irradiation as an effective technique in order to modify conducting polymer nanostructures for biomedical applications.",M2
20303061,"Analysis of heavy metal contents in gray and white MTA and 2 kinds of Portland cement: a preliminary study.OBJECTIVE: The levels of 10 heavy metals (arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and zinc) in gray Portland cement (GPC), white Portland cement (WPC), gray MTA (GMTA), and white MTA (WMTA) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). STUDY DESIGN: One gram of each material was digested with 80 degrees C  aqua-regia  (7 mL of 60% HNO3 and 21 mL of 35% <e>HCl</e>), filtered, and analyzed by ICP-AES. The analysis was performed 6 times and the data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Arsenic and lead concentrations were the highest in GPC (P &lt; .05). GPC had much more of 7 heavy metals than the other 3 cements (P &lt; .05). GMTA and WMTA had higher purity than GPC and WPC (P &lt; .05), particularly when arsenic content was considered. CONCLUSION: If a clinician is considering using Portland cement versus MTA, the differences in purity may be considered.",M2
20298816,"Differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence study of lactoperoxidase as a function of guanidinium-<e>HCl</e>, urea, and pH.The stability of bovine lactoperoxidase to denaturation by guanidinium-HCl, urea, or high temperature was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tryptophan fluorescence. The calorimetric scans were observed to be dependent on the heating scan rate, indicating that lactoperoxidase stability at temperatures near Tm is controlled by kinetics. The values for the thermal transition, Tm, at slow heating scan rate were 66.8, 61.1, and 47.2 degrees C in the presence of 0.5, 1, and 2 M guanidinium-HCl, respectively. The extrapolated value for Tm in the absence of guanidinium-HCl is 73.7 degrees C, compared with 70.2 degrees C obtained by experiment; a lower experimental value without a denaturant is consistent with distortion of the thermal profile due to aggregation or other irreversible phenomenon. Values for the heat capacity, Cp, at Tm and Ea for the thermal transition decrease under conditions where Tm is lowered. At a given concentration, urea is less effective than guanidinium-HCl in reducing Tm, but urea reduces Cp relatively more. Both fluorescence and DSC indicate that thermally denatured protein is not random coil. A change in fluorescence around 35 degrees C, which was previously reported for EPR and CD measurements (Boscolo et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1774 (2007) 1164-1172), is not seen by calorimetry, suggesting that a local and not a global change in protein conformation produces this fluorescence change.",M2

Seventeen amino acids were quantified using selected reaction monitoring on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. LC-MS/MS results were compared to gravimetric measurements from the preparation of SRM 2389a-a reference material developed at NIST and intended for use in intra-laboratory calibrations and quality control. Quantitative mass spectrometry results and gravimetric values were statistically combined into NIST-certified mass fraction values with associated uncertainty estimates. Coefficients of variation (CV) for the repeatability of the LC-MS/MS measurements among amino acids ranged from 0.33% to 2.7% with an average CV of 1.2%. Average relative expanded uncertainty of the certified values including Types A and B uncertainties was 3.5%. Mean accuracy of the LC-MS/MS measurements with gravimetric preparation values agreed to within |1.1|% for all amino acids. NIST SRM 2389a will be available for characterization of routine methods for amino acid analysis and serves as a standard for higher-order measurement traceability. This is the first time an ID LC-MS/MS methodology has been applied for quantifying amino acids in a NIST SRM material.",M2
20227829,"Selective extraction of chromium (VI) from multicomponent acidic solutions by emulsion liquid membranes using tributhylphosphate as carrier.The facilitated extraction of Cr(VI) through an emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) was investigated, using tributyl phosphate (TBP) as mobile carrier. The emulsion liquid membrane phase consists of kerosene as diluent, TBP as carrier, SPAN 80 as surfactant and (NH(4))(2)CO(3) solution as stripping phase. The extraction of chromium (VI) has been studied under various experimental conditions and have been determined the influences of surfactant concentration, extractant concentration, stripping solution base concentration, mixing speed, phase ratio, treatment ratio, chromium (VI) and <e>HCl</e> concentrations of the feed solution. It was observed that the extraction rate of Cr(VI) was affected by changes of surfactant concentration, extractant concentration, stripping solution base concentration, and mixing speed. The results obtained showed that by appropriate selection of the extraction and stability conditions, nearly all of chromium (VI) ions present in the feed solution were extracted within 2-4 min. The separation factors of chromium (VI) with respect to cobalt, nickel, copper, cadmium and zinc ions, based on initial feed concentration, have experimentally determined.",M2
20188947,"On-line speciation of inorganic and methyl mercury in waters and fish tissues using polyaniline micro-column and flow injection-chemical vapour generation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-CVG-ICPMS).A simple and efficient method for the determination of ultra-trace amounts of inorganic mercury (iHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in waters and fish tissues was developed using a micro-column filled with polyaniline (PANI) coupled online to flow injection-chemical vapour generation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-CVG-ICPMS) system. Preliminary studies indicated that inorganic and methyl mercury species could be separated on PANI column in two different speciation approaches. At pH &lt;3, only iHg could be sorbed and almost no adsorption of MeHg was found (speciation procedure 1). If the sample solution pH is approximately 7, both MeHg and iHg species could be sorbed on the PANI column. Subsequently both the Hg species were selectively eluted with 2% <e>HCl</e> and a mixture of 2% HCl and 0.02% thiourea respectively (speciation procedure 2). The adsorption percentage of iHg on the PANI column was unchanged even with acidity of the sample solution increased to 6 mol L(-1). Therefore, an acidic solution (5 mol L(-1) HCl), used for ultra-sound assisted extraction of the mercury species from biological samples, was used directly to separate MeHg from iHg in the fish tissues (tuna fish ERM-CE 463, ERM-CE 464 and IAEA-350) by PANI column using speciation procedure 1. The determined values were in good agreement with certified values. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) were 2.52 pg and 3.24 pg for iHg and MeHg (as Hg) respectively. The developed method was applied successfully to the direct determination of iHg and MeHg in various waters (tap water, lake water, ground water and sea-water) and the recoveries for the spiked samples were in the range of 96-102% for both the Hg species.",M2
20185231,"Modeling dry-scrubbing of gaseous <e>HCl</e> with hydrated lime in cyclones with and without recirculation.A mathematical model describing the dry-scrubbing of gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) with solid hydrated lime particles (Ca(OH)(2)) was developed and experimentally verified. The model applies to cyclone systems with and without recirculation, where reaction and particle collection occurs in the same processing unit. The Modified Grain Model was selected to describe the behavior of the reaction process and it was assumed that the gas and the solid particles flow in the reactor with a plug flow. In this work, this behavior is approximated by a cascade of N CSTRs in series. Some of the model parameters were estimated by optimization taking into account the experimental results obtained. A good agreement was observed between the experimental results and those predicted by the model, where the main control resistance is the diffusion of the gaseous reactant in the layer of solid product formed.",M2

20121110,"Experimental and theoretical investigation of isotope fractionation of zinc between aqua, chloro, and macrocyclic complexes.This work reports on the chemical isotope fractionation of Zn(II) by a solvent extraction method with the crown ether dicyclohexano-18-crown-6. The (m)Zn/(64)Zn ratios (m = 66, 67, and 68) were analyzed by multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The relative deviations of the (66)Zn/(64)Zn ratios relative to the unprocessed material (delta(66)Zn) was determined to be -0.51 to -0.32 in the acidity region 1.0-6.0 mol dm(-3) (M) <e>HCl</e>. The acidity dependence of delta(m)Zn was explained by the isotope exchange reactions between Zn(II) species (Zn(2+), ZnCl(+), ZnCl(2), ZnCl(3)(-), and ZnCl(4)(2-)) and the mole fractions of them. The magnitude of delta(m)Zn due to the related Zn(II) species estimated by quantum chemical calculations was in agreement with delta(m)Zn experimentally obtained.

Gastroprotective assays were performed in mice using ethanol/<e>HCl</e> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)/bethanechol-induced ulcer models. Chloroformic fraction showed no interesting results. On the other hand, in the ethanol/HCl-induced ulcer model, the treatment using doses of 50, 125, and 250 mg/kg promoted ulcer inhibition of 45.19+/-12.93%, 62.99+/-3.49%, and 67.40+/-4.75% for acetone extract and 43.70+/-5.12%, 64.56+/-5.64%, and 74.49+/-6.13% for methanol fraction. In the model of NSAID/bethanechol-induced ulcer, the ulcer inhibitions in the same doses were 28.12+/-12.45%, 60.16+/-6.58%, and 77.86+/-7.18% for the acetone extract and 46.09+/-6.92%, 67.45+/-4.36%, and 75.00+/-2.92% for the methanol fraction. In view of the antiulcer potential of the acetone extract and its high yield and xanthone content, it was submitted to chromatographic procedures, giving compounds 1-3, which were also evaluated in the ethanol-induced ulcer model. The results showed that at a dose of 50 mg/kg, these compounds reduced the percentage of ulcer by around 71.26+/-9.40%, 81.10+/-5.75%, and 86.22+/-3.42%, for compounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Aspirin-pylorus ligation (Asp 200 mg/kg-7 days + PL-4 hours) and HCl-ethanol (150 mM HCl in 70% ethanol) induction in rat resulted in elevation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and depletion of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione [GSH], glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) with high ulcer scores (p &lt; .01). In Asp + PL model, TP treatment showed mild inhibition on ulcer scores, changes in pH, gastric volume, total and free acidity, and elevation of TBARS and depletion of antioxidants. Compared to the ulcer-untreated rats (HCl-ethanol), the herbomineral drug TP treatment (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg, per oral [p.o.]) attenuated the elevation of TBARS, decrease of antioxidants and nitrite (p &lt; .05). Histopathological examinations were correlated with the antioxidant profile. In conclusion, the prophylactic cytoprotective nature of the herbomineral drug in experimentally induced ulcers could be mediated by its free radical quenching property.",M2
20020473,"An ab initio quantum mechanical charge field molecular dynamics simulation of a dilute aqueous <e>HCl</e> solution.An ab initio quantum mechanical charge field (QMCF) molecular dynamics simulation has been performed to study the structural and dynamical properties of a dilute aqueous HCl solution. The solute molecule HCl and its surrounding water molecules were treated at Hartree-Fock level in conjunction with Dunning double-zeta plus polarization function basis sets. The simulation predicts an average H-Cl bond distance of 1.28 A, which is in good agreement with the experimental value. The H(HCl)...O(w) and Cl(HCl)...H(w) distances of 1.84 and 3.51 A were found for the first hydration shell. At the hydrogen site of HCl, a single water molecule is the most preferred coordination, whereas an average coordination number of 12 water molecules of the full first shell was observed for the chloride site. The hydrogen bonding at the hydrogen site of HCl is weakened by proton transfer reactions and an associated lability of ligand binding. Two proton transfer processes were observed in the QMCF MD simulation, demonstrating acid dissociation of HCl. A weak structure-making/breaking effect of HCl in water is recognized from the mean residence times of 2.1 and 0.8 ps for ligands in the neighborhood of Cl and H sites of HCl, respectively.",M2
20001646,"Acid hypersensitivity in patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis.OBJECTIVE: Painful symptoms are prevalent in patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis but experimental data are sparse. The aim of this study was to compare the pain response to experimental oesophageal stimulation in 14 patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis and 15 healthy volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multimodal probe was placed in the oesophagus. The participants were subjected to mechanical, thermal and electrical pain stimuli followed by perfusion with 0.1 M <e>HCl</e>. Pain scores, referred pain areas and evoked brain potentials to electrical stimulation of the oesophagus were recorded. RESULTS: Patients tolerated significantly less acid perfused in the oesophagus (median 123 versus 200 ml; P = 0.02) and felt the burning sensation evoked by the acid earlier (median 2.0 versus 5.0 min; P = 0.01). Eight patients had coexisting gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Six patients had pure eosinophilic oesophagitis, and this group felt the acid earlier than those with concomitant reflux or the healthy volunteers (median 0.8 versus 2.0 and 5.0 min; P = 0.03). There were no differences between patients and controls in the responses to mechanical or thermal stimulation (P &gt; 0.4). Furthermore, no differences were found for the proxies of central nervous system sensitization (response to electrical stimulations, referred pain areas or evoked brain potentials; P &gt; 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis are hypersensitive to acid perfused in the oesophagus, and pathophysiologic findings are likely confined to the peripheral tissue. Reflux from physiological acid may play a role in the symptoms of eosinophilic oesophagitis.",M2
19964105,"Image-guided thermochemical ablation: theoretical and practical considerations.PURPOSE: To test thermochemical ablation for potential as a new method to coagulate tissue and create a prototype device for administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reactions of either <e>HCl</e> or acetic acid and either NH4OH or NaOH were run in triplicate in a gel phantom as a simple calorimeter. Data were recorded over a period of 5 minutes using concentrations from 1-12 M in the case of HCl and NH4OH. Comparison reactions were run at 11 M using each acid reacted with each base. Two early device prototypes were devised using readily available components. RESULTS: Maximum temperature rise was nearly instantaneous and was observed to peak with the 12 M solutions at 106 degrees C. The maximum temperatures in the 11 M comparisons were seen with the strong acid HCl paired with the strong base NaOH. The lowest temperatures were seen with the weak acid acetic acid paired with the weak base NH4OH. CONCLUSION: Thermochemical ablation reactions can release adequate amounts of heat energy to cause tissue ablation.",M2
19958811,"The role of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 on neural responses to acids by the chorda tympani, glossopharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerves in mice.The transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor acts as a polymodal nociceptor activated by capsaicin, heat, and acid. TRPV1, which is expressed in sensory neurons innervating the oral cavity, is associated with an oral burning sensation in response to spicy food containing capsaicin. However, little is known about the involvement of TRPV1 in responses to acid stimuli in either the gustatory system or the general somatosensory innervation of the oropharynx. To test this possibility, we recorded electrophysiological responses to several acids (acetic acid, citric acid and <e>HCl</e>) and other taste stimuli from the mouse chorda tympani, glossopharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerves, and compared potential effects of iodo-resiniferatoxin (I-RTX), a potent TRPV1 antagonist, on chemical responses of the three nerves. The results indicated that in the chorda tympani nerve, I-RTX (1-100 nM) did not affect responses to acids, sucrose and quinine HCl, but reduced responses to NaCl (I-RTX at concentrations of 10 and 100 nM) and KCl and NH(4)Cl (100 nM). In contrast, in the glossopharyngeal nerve, I-RTX significantly suppressed responses to all acids and salts, but not to sucrose and quinine HCl. Responses to acetic acid were suppressed by I-RTX even at 0.1 nM concentration. The superior laryngeal nerve responded in a concentration-dependent manner to acetic acid, citric acid, HCl, KCl, NH(4)Cl and monosodium l-glutamate. The responses to acetic acid, but not to the other stimuli, were significantly inhibited by I-RTX. These results suggested that TRPV1 may be involved in the mechanism for responses to acids presented to the posterior oral cavity and larynx. This high degree of responsiveness to acetic acid may account for the oral burning sensation, known as a flavor characteristic of vinegar.",M2

19920191,"In benign Barrett's epithelial cells, acid exposure generates reactive oxygen species that cause DNA double-strand breaks.Cells that sustain double-strand breaks (DSB) can develop genomic instability, which contributes to carcinogenesis, and agents that cause DSBs are considered potential carcinogens. We looked for evidence of acid-induced DNA damage, including DSBs, in benign Barrett's epithelial (BAR-T) cell lines in vitro and in patients with Barrett's esophagus in vivo. In BAR-T cells, we also explored the mechanisms underlying acid-induced DNA damage. We exposed BAR-T cells to acid in the presence of a fluorescent probe for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in the presence or absence of disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (which prevents intracellular acidification) and N-acety-l-cysteine (a scavenger of ROS). DSBs were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence for histone H2AX phosphorylation and by CometAssay. During endoscopy in patients with Barrett's esophagus, we took biopsy specimens from the metaplastic mucosa before and after esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N <e>HCl</e> for 3 min and sought DSBs by Western blotting for histone H2AX phosphorylation. In BAR-T cells, acid exposure resulted in ROS production and caused a time-dependent increase in levels of phospho-H2AX that continued for at least 48 h. Pretreatment with disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate or N-acety-l-cysteine prevented the acid-induced increase in phospho-H2AX levels. DSBs also were detected in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia following esophageal acid perfusion in all of 6 patients with Barrett's esophagus. Acid exposure causes DSBs in Barrett's epithelial cells through ROS produced as a consequence of intracellular acidification. These findings suggest that acid can be considered a carcinogen in Barrett's esophagus.",M2
19875352,"Role of the lateral hypothalamus in modulating responses of parabrachial gustatory neurons in the rat.The lateral hypothalamus (LH) receives projections from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) gustatory neurons and sends efferent projections to the PBN. To examine if the LH is involved in modulating activity of gustatory neurons in the PBN, we examined the effects of electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesions of the LH on the response of PBN gustatory neurons, using extracellular recording techniques. Among 45 PBN taste neurons recorded, 60% were affected by LH stimulation and 73% were affected by LH lesions. During LH stimulation, the responses of most affected PBN neurons were inhibited with the magnitude significantly lower than that obtained before stimulation (P&lt;0.05). In contrast, LH lesions facilitated the response. Based on the best-stimulus category, the responses of the NaCl-best neurons to NaCl and <e>HCl</e> and the QHCl-best neurons to HCl and QHCl were significantly suppressed during LH stimulation (P&lt;0.05). After lesions of the LH, however, the response to HCl in NaCl-best PBN neurons was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). Analysis of across-unit patterns indicated that LH stimulation decreased the correlations between NaCl and other stimuli, and increased those between QHCl and other stimuli. After LH lesions, the correlations between NaCl and other tastants were higher than those before lesions. These findings suggest that the LH mediates feeding and taste via modulating the activity and chemical selectivity of PBN gustatory neurons.",M2
19851795,"Hydrogen bonding interactions in PN...HX complexes: DFT and ab initio studies of structure, properties and topology.Spin-restricted DFT (X3LYP and B3LYP) and ab initio (MP2(fc) and CCSD(fc)) calculations in conjunction with the Aug-CC-pVDZ and Aug-CC-pVTZ basis sets were performed on a series of hydrogen bonded complexes PN...HX (X = F, Cl, Br) to examine the variations of their equilibrium gas phase structures, energetic stabilities, electronic properties, and vibrational characteristics in their electronic ground states. In all cases the complexes were predicted to be stable with respect to the constituent monomers. The interaction energy (Delta E) calculated using a super-molecular model is found to be in this order: PN...HF &gt; PN...<e>HCl</e> &gt; PN...HBr in the series examined. Analysis of various physically meaningful contributions arising from the Kitaura-Morokuma (KM) and reduced variational space self-consistent-field (RVS-SCF) energy decomposition procedures shows that the electrostatic energy has significant contribution to the over-all interaction energy. Dipole moment enhancement (Delta mu) was observed in these complexes expected of predominant dipole-dipole electrostatic interaction and was found to follow the trend PN...HF &gt; PN...HCl &gt; PN...HBr at the CCSD level. However, the DFT (X3LYP and B3LYP) and MP2 levels less accurately determined these values (in this order HF &lt; HCl &lt; HBr). Examination of the harmonic vibrational modes reveals that the PN and HX bands exhibit characteristic blue- and red shifts with concomitant bond contraction and elongation, respectively, on hydrogen bond formation. The topological or critical point (CP) analysis using the static quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) of Bader was considered to classify and to gain further insight into the nature of interaction existing in the monomers PN and HX, and between them on H-bond formation. It is found from the analysis of the electron density rho ( c ), the Laplacian of electron charge density nabla(2)rho(c), and the total energy density (H ( c )) at the critical points between the interatomic regions that the interaction N...H is indeed electrostatic in origin (rho(c) &gt; 0, nabla(2)rho(c) &gt; 0 and H(c) &gt; 0 at the BCP) whilst the bonds in PN (rho(c) &gt; 0, nabla(2)rho(c) &gt; 0 and H(c) &lt; 0) and HX ((rho(c) &gt; 0, nabla(2)rho(c) &lt; 0 and H(c) &lt; 0)) are predominantly covalent.

19847701,"Effect of H(2)SO(4) and <e>HCl</e> in the anode purging solution for the electrokinetic-Fenton remediation of soil contaminated with phenanthrene.The Electrokinetic-Fenton (EK-Fenton) process is a powerful technology to remediate organic-contaminated soil. The behavior of salts and acids introduced for the pH control has significant influence on the H(2)O(2) stabilization and destruction of organic contaminants. In this study, the effects of the type and concentration of acids, which were introduced at the anode, were investigated for the treatment of clayey soil contaminated with phenanthrene. In experiments with H(2)SO(4) as the anode solution, H(2)O(2) concentration in the anode reservoir decreased due to reaction between reduced species of sulfate and H(2)O(2), as time elapsed. By contrast, HCl as an electrolyte in the anode reservoir did not decrease the H(2)O(2) concentration in the anode reservoir. The reaction between the reduced species of sulfate and H(2)O(2) hindered the stabilization of H(2)O(2) in the soil and anode reservoir. In experiments with HCl for pH control, Cl(.), and Cl(2)(. -), which could be generated with mineral catalyzed Fenton-like reaction, did not significantly hinder H(2)O(2) stabilization. H(2)O(2) transportation with electro-osmotic flow and mineral catalyzed Fenton-like reaction on the soil surface resulted in the simultaneous transport and degradation of phenanthrene, which are dependent of the advancement rate of the acid front and electro-osmotic flow toward the cathode according to HCl and H(2)SO(4) concentrations in the anode purging solution.",M2
19846104,"Unusual buffer action of free-standing nanoscopically confined water.The acid-base properties of nanoscopic water confined in the black soap films (BSFs), which were prepared from aqueous solutions of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) with the dye neutral red (NR) as a pH probe, were investigated using a combination of UV-vis and FTIR spectroscopy. For the SDS micellar solutions at pH 1.0-9.5 adjusted with <e>HCl</e>/NaOH solutions and at pH 9.4 with ammonium buffered solution, the aqueous core thicknesses in the corresponding BSFs ranged from 2.7 to 6.2 nm, and the nanoscopically confined water exhibits unusual buffer action resistant not only to acidic/alkaline solutions but also to standard buffer solution. In the heavily water-depleted confined zones, it is most likely that charge pairs in proton-transfer reactions could not be formed effectively and proton transfer was prohibited in the absence of sufficient solvating ability. Theoretical analyzes indicated that the buffer action of the nanoscopic water originated from the confinement effect of two charged surfaces of the BSFs. These results might inspire deeper understanding and further studies of biobuffering, enzyme superactivity, acid-catalyzed reactions, and Nafion fuel cell membranes.",M2
19836520,"Statistical mixture design development of digestion methods for Oyster tissue using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for the determination of metallic ions.The quantitative determination of chemical elements in organic or biological samples is an important analytical problem. Normally the elements to be determined in the organic matrix must be transformed into a simple inorganic form. A digestion method by heating on a block digestor has been developed for the determination of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, V and Zn in Oyster tissue by ICP OES. A simplex centroid statistical mixture design has been used to study the effects of changing HNO(3), <e>HCl</e> and H(2)O(2) reagent proportions on the digestion of these samples. Response surface and principal component analyses show that the species Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn have very similar analytical tendencies under this experiment. By means of mixture modeling maximum recoveries for these ions were predicted using 19%, 18% and 63% of the HCl, HNO(3) and H(2)O(2) pseudocomponent mixtures, respectively. This corresponds to 21.4%, 30.8% and 47.8% of the HCl, HNO(3) and H(2)O(2) commercial solutions. Furthermore the As, Co and V ions present large recoveries for these mixtures as well. The Al and Ba ion recoveries are seen to be independent of the mixture proportions. The analysis of Oyster tissue reference material (SRM 1566b - NIST) under optimized conditions at the selected wavelengths resulted in ion recoveries between 90% and 100%.",M2
19835974,"Exogenous surfactant instillation attenuates inflammatory response to acid-induced lung injury in rat.The present study was performed to investigate the role of exogenous surfactant on hydrochloric acid (<e>HCL</e>) - induced lung injury in rats. Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40mg/kg) and HCL (0.1N, 2mL/kg) or normal saline (NS, 2mL/kg) was instilled into the trachea. Thirty minutes after HCL instillation, surfactant at a dose of 60mg (=2mL)/body or NS (2mL) was instilled into the rat lungs. Animals in another experimental group were also treated with the same dose of surfactant supplement 2hours after the first administration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained 5hours after HCL instillation. In BALF, increases in total nuclear cell counts, neutrophil counts, optical density at 412nm as an indicator of pulmonary hemorrhage, neutrophil elastase activity, concentrations of albumin and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) induced by HCL instillation were significantly attenuated by surfactant treatment. The wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio in the lung and partial oxygen tension (P(O2)) were also estimated; surfactant treatment significantly attenuated the W/D ratio and improved deteriorated P(O2) induced by HCL. Additional surfactant supplementation did not show further beneficial effects on HCL-induced lung injury compared with a single treatment. These results suggest that surfactant shows an anti-inflammatory effect on acid lung injury in rats but the beneficial effects may be dose limited.",M2
19832960,"Measuring human skin buffering capacity: an in vitro model.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: It has been thought that skin possesses buffering capacity. This study measured the skin buffering capacity against two model solutions of acid and base at three concentrations with an in vitro system. METHODS: Ten microliters of model base (sodium hydroxide--NaOH) and acid (hydrochloric acid--<e>HCl</e>) solutions at concentrations of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 N was applied to human cadaver skin (3.18 microL/cm(2)) placed onto glass diffusion cells. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a standard buffer solution. Deionized water served as the negative control, whereas untreated skin served as the blank control. Skin pH was read and recorded immediately following dosing (0 time), and at 10 and 30 min of post-dosing. After the 30 min of dosing, each skin, except untreated skin (blank control), was then washed by applying 1 cm(3) of deionized water. The pH on each washed skin was measured immediately following washing, and the pH measurement was repeated at 10 and 30 min of post-washing. Six replicates were conducted. RESULTS: The pH values sharply significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) immediately following dosing with NaOH at all concentrations (the highest concentration, caused the highest pH), and then decreased closely to baselines within 30 min post-application but still remained at significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher values when compared with the blank control (untreated skin). HCl (acid) significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased skin pH immediately following dosing with all concentrations (the highest concentration, caused the lowest pH) and then restored rapidly to baseline. There was no significant difference in post-washing procedures on the skins that were pre-treated with the acid (HCI) solutions. However, with all base solutions (NaOH) pre-treated skin, pH values were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) at all time points post-washing. Furthermore, both PBS and water controls significantly elevated (P&lt;0.05) the pH values following washing. CONCLUSION: Skin pH and its buffering capacity can be measured on human cadaver skin in vitro, which may partially replicate the response of in vivo skin. Dose-response was noted; i.e. the higher concentration caused larger changes in skin pH. In addition, the restoration of skin pH is relatively faster with acid when compared with base treatment. Clinical implications are offered.",M2
19831398,"Investigation of the site-specific accumulation of catechins in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) via vanillin-<e>HCl</e> staining.Histochemical staining using vanillin-HCl is a potential tool to identify the site-specific accumulation of catechins in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze). Using this technique revealed that catechins existed ubiquitously in all inspected tissues in young tea leaf, but the distribution was concentrated in the vascular bundle and palisade tissue, whereas the large parenchyma cells of the main vein contained lower amounts of catechins. At the subcellular level, catechins were located mainly in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells and in the vessel wall. In young stems, catechins could be detected in most cells except the parenchyma cells of the pith and the cortex, whereas, in roots, catechins could be detected only in those cells surrounding the pericycle. Moreover, differing distributions of catechins were found in calluses cultivated in darkness and light. On the basis of HPLC analyses, six main types of catechins were present in tea leaves, stems, calluses, and chloroplasts; however, roots contained only epicatechin.",M2
19817454,"Tunable mechanics of peptide nanofiber gels.The mechanical properties of self-assembled fibrillar networks are influenced by the specific intermolecular interactions that modulate fiber entanglements. We investigate how changing these interactions influences the mechanics of self-assembled nanofiber gels composed of peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules. PAs developed in our laboratory self-assemble into gels of nanofibers after neutralization or salt-mediated screening of the charged residues in their peptide segment. We report here on the gelation, stiffness, and response to deformation of gels formed from a negatively charged PA and <e>HCl</e> or CaCl(2). Scanning electron microscopy of these gels demonstrates a similar morphology, whereas the oscillatory rheological measurements indicate that the calcium-mediated ionic bridges in CaCl(2)-PA gels form stronger intra- and interfiber cross-links than the hydrogen bonds formed by the protonated carboxylic acid residues in HCl-PA gels. As a result, CaCl(2)-PA gels can withstand higher strains than HCl-PA gels. After exposure to a series of strain sweeps with increasing strain amplitude HCl- and CaCl(2)-PA gels both recover 42% of their original stiffness. In contrast, after sustained deformation at 100% strain, HCl-PA gels recover nearly 90% of their original stiffness after 10 min, while the CaCl(2)-PA gels only recover 35%. This result suggests that the hydrogen bonds formed by the protonated acids in the HCl-PA gels allow the gel to relax quickly to its initial state, while the strong calcium cross-links in the CaCl(2)-PA gels lock in the deformed structure and inhibit the gel's ability to recover. We also show that the rheological scaling behaviors of HCl- and CaCl(2)-PA gels are consistent with that of uncross- and cross-linked semiflexible biopolymer networks, respectively. The ability to modify how self-assembled fibrillar networks respond to deformations is important in developing self-assembled gels that can resist and recover from the large deformations that these gels encounter while serving as synthetic cell scaffolds in vivo.",M2
19800168,"Photocatalytic decomposition of 4-t-octylphenol over NaBiO3 driven by visible light: catalytic kinetics and corrosion products characterization.The photocatalytic decomposition of 4-t-octylphenol (4-t-OP) by NaBiO(3) photocatalyst and the catalyst stability in aqueous solution were investigated systematically for the first time. The results showed that some parameters such as catalyst dosage, initial 4-t-OP concentration and pH value of the solution had great effects on the photocatalytic activity. The NaBiO(3) photocatalyst maintained considerable catalytic performance under visible light (lambda&gt;400 nm) irradiation and exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity compared to the commercialized photocatalyst P25. In addition, the corrosion products of NaBiO(3) catalyst under acid condition (<e>HCl</e> aqueous solution contained) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmittance electronic microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis transmittance spectrum analysis. The results showed that NaBiO(3) was unstable under the acidic condition and the catalyst could convert into Bi(3+)-containing compounds such as Bi(2)O(3), etc. The experiment demonstrates that NaBiO(3) can be corroded to nano-sized BiOCl crystal in the presence of hydrogen chloride, the band gap of which was estimated to be 3.28 eV by Tauc's approach.",M2
19799664,"Optimization of gelatin extraction from silver carp skin.Fish skins are a by-product of the fish processing industry that can be successfully processed into gelatin. This study was designed to optimize the extraction process to obtain the highest yield, gel strength, and viscosity for gelatin production from silver carp skin. A fractional factorial design (2 levels, resolution III, 2(9-5)) was chosen to screen 9 parameters to determine the most significant ones. Those found to be significant were optimized to determine the maximum value for 3 dependent variables mentioned above. The hydroxyproline content and hydroxyproline/protein ratio of the skin were 1.7% and 6.5%, respectively. The protein content of the skin was 26%. The hydroxyproline content of the gelatin for the sample giving the highest hydroxyproline/protein ratio was 10.9%. This sample was arbitrarily called pure gelatin and the purity of the remaining samples was between 71.8% and 97%. The highest protein and gelatin recovery was 78.1% and 98.8% of the total available, respectively. The latter, gelatin recovery, is proposed to be used instead of protein yield. Four variables were determined as significant in screening and these variables were studied by a central composite rotatable design (4-factor and 5-level with 6 central points) to model the system and response surface methodology was used for optimization. The optimum extraction conditions were 50 degrees C for the extraction temperature, 0.1 N <e>HCl</e> for the acid concentration, 45 min for the acid pretreatment time, and finally 4 : 1 (v/w) for the water/skin ratio. The predicted responses for these extraction conditions were 630 g gel strength, 6.3 cP viscosity, and 80.8% gelatin recovery. The data suggest that silver carp skin gelatin is similar to those of fish gelatins currently being exploited commercially.",M2
19799439,"Tight-contact ion pairs involving Pt(II) dithiooxamide complexes: the acid-base reactions between hydrohalogenated ion-paired complexes and pyridine.The equilibrium constants relative to <e>HCl</e> exchange between Pt(II)-containing tight contact ion pairs (TCIP) and pyridine have been investigated in chloroform solution at 298 K. The general formulas of the metal species are: {[Pt(H(2)-R(2)-dithiooxamide)(2)](2+), 2Cl(-)} (a-type compounds; R = methyl (1a), ethyl (2a), n-propyl (3a), iso-propyl (4a), n-butyl (5a), cyclohexyl (6a), benzyl (7a), beta-phenyl-ethyl (8a), allyl (9a)) and {[(H-R(2)-dithiooxamidate)Pt(H(2)-R(2)-dithiooxamide)](+), Cl(-)} (b-type compounds; R has the same meanings as before, given rise to 1b-9b species; moreover, the mixed R compound 10b, containing R = benzyl on a DTO (dthiooxamidate/dithiooxamide) ligand and R = ethyl on the other DTO ligand, has also been investigated). Moreover, the parent species [Pt(H-R(2)-dithiooxamidate)(2)] (c-type compounds; 1c-10c) have also been prepared. Out of 29 compounds reported in the paper, 19 compounds are here reported for the first time, and their synthesis and characterization data are also given. Compounds of a-type exhibit two successive equilibrium constants, which are related to successive HCl transfer from the TCIP to pyridine. By comparing the equilibrium constants Kc of the various b-type species, we have been able to (i) obtain information on the relative stability of the TCIP and, by taking advantage of the two equilibrium constants Kc1 and Kc2 found for each a-type species, (ii) gain knowledge on the electronic interaction between the two basic sites of the Pt(II) bis-dithiooxamide complexes, mediated by the metal center. Linear relationships are found between the pKc of the compounds and the sigma-Taft value (Sigma sigma*) of the amine substituents of the DTO ligands. Interestingly, the slope of such linear correlations is much steeper for pKc2 than for pKc1, indicating that the electronic interaction between the basic sites increases with the electron donating ability of the R substituent. A parallel is proposed between the splitting of HCl transfer equilibrium constants in a-type TCIP and oxidation potential splitting in dinuclear, bridge-linked metal complexes.",M2
19797689,"Acid aspiration-induced airways hyperresponsiveness in mice.The role of gastroesophageal reflux and micro-aspiration as a trigger of airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in patients with asthma is controversial. The role of acid reflux and aspiration as a direct cause of AHR in normal subjects is also unclear. We speculated that aspiration of a weak acid with a pH (1.8) equivalent to the upper range of typical gastric contents would lead to AHR in naive mice. We further speculated that modest reductions in aspirate acidity to a level expected during gastric acid suppression therapy (pH 4.0) would impede aspiration-induced AHR. BALB/c female mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and allowed to aspirate 75 microl of saline with <e>HCl</e> (pH 1.8, 4.0, or 7.4) or underwent sham aspiration. Mice were re-anesthetized 2 or 24 h later, underwent tracheostomy, and were coupled to a mechanical ventilator. Forced oscillations were used to periodically measure respiratory impedance (Zrs) following aerosol delivery of saline and increasing doses of methacholine to measure for AHR. Values for elastance (H), airways resistance (R(N)), and tissue damping (G) were derived from Zrs. Aspirate pH of 1.8 led to a significant overall increase in peak R(N), G, and H compared with pH 4.0 and 7.4 at 2 and 24 h. Differences between pH 7.4 and 4.0 were not significant. In mice aspirating pH 1.8 compared with controls, airway lavage fluid contained more neutrophils, higher protein, and demonstrated higher permeability. We conclude that acid aspiration triggers an acute AHR, driven principally by breakdown of epithelial barrier integrity within the airways.",M2
19766480,"Acid hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse for lactic acid production.In order to use sugarcane bagasse as a substrate for lactic acid production, optimum conditions for acid hydrolysis of the bagasse were investigated. After lignin extraction, the conditions were varied in terms of hydrochloric (<e>HCl</e>) or sulfuric (H(2)SO(4)) concentration (0.5-5%, v/v), reaction time (1-5h) and incubation temperature (90-120 degrees C). The maximum catalytic efficiency (E) was 10.85 under the conditions of 0.5% of HCl at 100 degrees C for 5h, which the main components (in gl(-1)) in the hydrolysate were glucose, 1.50; xylose, 22.59; arabinose, 1.29; acetic acid, 0.15 and furfural, 1.19.

19765231,"Apoplastic barriers effectively block oxygen permeability across outer cell layers of rice roots under deoxygenated conditions: roles of apoplastic pores and of respiration.*Despite the importance of the barrier to oxygen losses of the roots of hygrophytes growing in wet environments devoid of oxygen, there are few data available on permeability coefficients for O(2) across outer root cell layers (P(OPR)) and how they may change in response to low O(2). *A gas perfusion technique was used to measure the P(OPR) of rice (Oryza sativa) plants grown in either aerated or deoxygenated solution. The contributions of the apoplast and of living cells to the overall P(OPR) were characterized either by blocking apoplastic pores with precipitates of brown Cu(2)[Fe(CN)(6)] or by killing cells with 0.1 N <e>HCl</e>. *Compared with that of plants from aerated hydroponics, the P(OPR) of plants grown in deoxygenated medium was smaller by an order of magnitude. Precipitates resulting from CuSO(4)/K(4)[Fe(CN)(6)] treatment only formed in plants grown in aerated solution, where they reduced the P(OPR) by 5-20%. Killing of root segments with HCl increased P(OPR) in plants grown in both conditions by 20-55%. *The results indicated that apoplastic barriers effectively restricted radial O(2) loss. The relative role of the respiratory O(2) consumption of root peripheral layers increased as P(OPR) decreased.",M2

HCl; 35%, w/w) as an acid catalyst was developed for preparation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from sterol esters, triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and FFAs for gas-liquid chromatography (GC). An 8% (w/v) solution of HCl in methanol/water (85:15, v/v) was prepared by diluting 9.7 ml of conc. HCl with 41.5 ml of methanol.

19737595,"Surface conditioning of natural enamel caries lesions in deciduous teeth in preparation for resin infiltration.OBJECTIVES: As a conditioning step for resin infiltration into caries lesions, the relatively impermeable surface layer should be removed using hydrochloric acid gel (15%) to achieve improved infiltration, as it could be shown for permanent teeth. It is unclear whether this etching regimen can be transferred to the deciduous dentition, where differences in surface structure have been reported. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of phosphoric and hydrochloric acid gels on the surface layer reduction of natural lesions of primary teeth. METHODS: Thirty-two extracted or exfoliated primary molars with lesions confined to enamel were selected. Paired lesion halves were partially etched with either 37% phosphoric (H(3)PO(4)) or 15% hydrochloric acid gel (<e>HCl</e>) for 30s, 60s, 90s, or 120s, respectively. RESULTS: Etching with H(3)PO(4) resulted in incomplete reduction of the surface layers in all groups [highest percentage reduction (SD) at 120s: 54 (28)%] as observed with confocal microscopy. In contrast, surface layers could be eroded almost completely [99 (3)%] by etching with HCl for 120s. CONCLUSION: An effective erosion of the surface layer of natural enamel caries in deciduous teeth can be achieved by etching with 15% hydrochloric acid gel for 90-120s.",M2
19729500,"Acidification and urine calcium: is it a preanalytical necessity?BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that for the accurate measurement of calcium in urine, samples must be collected into bottles containing acid. Acidification poses risks to both patients and laboratory staff. Here we reappraise whether acidification is a preanalytical necessity. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected from 133 patients into bottles without acid or preservatives. In a subset of 29 patients, 10 mL aliquots were prepared to test the effect on urine calcium of 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0 mol/L hydrochloric acid (<e>HCl</e>). Calcium was then measured immediately after acidification, after 12 h and seven days storage at 4 degrees C. In a separate study, urine calcium concentrations in paired control (non-acidified) and acidified (with 5 mol/L HCl) samples were compared in 133 patients. When available, we recorded the time from start of urine collection to time of analysis. Calcium was measured using the cresolphthalein complexone colorimetric endpoint assay on the Roche Modular system. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the calcium concentration in the 29 cases studied between the varying acid concentrations tested compared with non-acidified urine (P = 0.987). Overall, in 133 patients there was no difference between control and acidified samples (P = 0.888). We found no correlation between basal urine pH and urine calcium at all time points studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the acidification of urine samples is not a preanalytical necessity for the measurement of urine calcium.",M2
19727512,"Dynamics and mass accommodation of <e>HCl</e> molecules on sulfuric acid-water surfaces.A molecular beam technique has been used to study the dynamics and mass accommodation of HCl molecules in collision with sulfuric acid-water surfaces. The experiments were performed by directing a nearly mono-energetic beam of HCl molecules onto a continuously renewed liquid film of 54-76 wt% sulfuric acid at temperatures between 213 K and 243 K. Deuterated sulfuric acid was used to separate sticking but non-reactive collisions from those that involved penetration through the phase boundary followed by dissociation and recombination with D+. The results indicate that the mass accommodation of HCl on sulfuric acid-water surfaces decreases sharply with increasing acidity over the concentration range 54-76 wt%. Using the capillary wave theory of mass accommodation this effect is explained by a change of the surface dynamics. Regarding the temperature dependence it is found that the mass accommodation of HCl increases with increasing temperature and is limited by the bulk phase viscosity and driven by the restoring forces of the surface tension. These findings imply that under atmospheric conditions the uptake of HCl from the gas phase depends crucially on the bulk phase parameters of the sulfuric acid aerosol.",M2
19727492,"IR spectroscopy of physical and chemical transformations in cold hydrogen chloride and ammonia aerosols.Aerosol particles of hydrogen chloride corresponding to three distinct solid phases have been generated in a collisional cooling cell and observed via FTIR spectroscopy. The cubic phase of <e>HCl</e> was observed with cell temperatures of 90-100 K, while the highly ordered orthorhombic phase predominated below this temperature. The previously reported metastable phase was also observed under some conditions. Density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level were performed on HCl clusters with a planar, zig-zag arrangement. Computed IR spectra for chain lengths up to 15 converge to show a band shape that is characteristic of the orthorhombic HCl phase. Injection of water along with HCl was found to have little influence on the formation of HCl particles. The reaction between HCl and NH3 to produce NH4Cl particles was also examined and found to occur over a wide range of temperatures (80-300 K). The formation of homogenous particles of HCl and NH3 competed with this chemical reaction as the cell temperature was lowered and when higher pressures of N2 buffer gas were used.",M2
19723178,"Effect of EDTA, <e>HCl</e>, and citric acid on Ca salt removal from Asian (silver) carp scales prior to gelatin extraction.Pretreatments with different chemicals at different concentrations to remove Ca compounds were studied to determine their effects on gelatin extraction from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) scales. During Ca removal with HCl, citric acid, and EDTA, all 3 chemicals were able to decalcify (&gt;90%) scales; however, protein losses with EDTA were lower than with HCl and citric acid (P &lt; 0.05), and protein losses with citric acid were lower than with HCl (P &lt; 0.05). Ca removal with HCl yielded a solution where 4% to 5% of the protein was Hyp, with estimated gelatin losses from 0.9% to 2.5%. After 0.20 mol/L HCl was used for Ca removal, the extracted gelatin solution was 15.4% of the initial scales weight and gave a gel strength of 128 g. After using 1.2 g/L citric acid for Ca removal, the extracted gelatin solution was only 9% of the scales and the gel strength was 97 g. Using 0.20 mol/L EDTA for Ca removal gave a yield of 22% and a gel strength of 152 g. These data suggest that EDTA at 0.20 mol/L provides the best Ca removal with minimal collagen/gelatin removal (estimated gelatin loss was less than 0.013%) during the Ca removal step, and subsequently gave a high gelatin yield and gel strength. Fish gelatin has generally been extracted from fish skins and occasionally fish bones. This article focuses on removing the Ca compounds in fish scales and then producing fish gelatin with a good gel strength and yield. With further studies, this study may help the fish industry to have a new source of fish gelatin for food and pharmaceutical applications.",M2

Smooth-surface discs of Ti-6Al-4V were used in this study. Sandblasted, dual acid-etched and H(2)O(2)/HCl heat-treated discs were set as test group, and sandblasted, dual acid-etched discs as control group. SEM and XRD analysis revealed a porous anatase gel layer on rough surface in the test group and a rough surface in the control group. Mouse pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells) were cultured on these 2 group discs, and then cell proliferation and differentiation were examined 4 days, 7 days, and 14 days after cell seeding. Cell proliferation was greatly stimulated at all time points when cultured in test group (P &lt; .05). The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OC) production were much higher in the test group compared with the control group at every time point investigated (P &lt; .05). Furthermore, in the test group, the expressions of alkaline phosphatase-2, osteocalcin, and collagen type I alpha 1 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated as compared with those in the control group (P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01).

Carbon was impregnated with <e>HCl</e>, KNO(3), or hexanediol. The activated carbon modified by 7% (mass fraction) HCl could enhance the adsorption purification ability significantly. Raising the reaction temperature or increasing the oxygen content of the gas can improve the purification efficiency. The structure of the materials after modification was determined using nitrogen adsorption. The modification decreased the volume of pores smaller than 2 nm in diameter with the most noticeable change occurring in the micropores ranging from 0.3 nm to 1.5 nm in diameter. Decreases in micropore volume accounted for 87% of the total pore volume change. After the adsorption, the surface areas decreased 28%, 29% of which was due to decreased micropore surface. HCl significantly increased the performance of carbon as a PH(3) adsorbent when HCl impregnation was applied whereas the effects of other materials used in this study were much less pronounced. HCl present in the small pores probably acted as a catalyst for oxygen activation that caused PH(3) oxidation. As a result of this process, H(3)PO(4) and P(4)O(10) were formed, strongly adsorbed, and present in the small pores ranging from 0.3 nm to 1.5 nm. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that CO from industrial off-gas can be purified and used as the raw material for a broader range of products.",M2
19640546,"Recovery of palladium using chemically modified cedar wood powder.Japanese cedar wood powder (CWP) was chemically modified to a tertiary-amine-type adsorbent and studied for the selective recovery of Pd(II) from various industrial waters. Batch adsorption tests performed from 0.1 M to 5 M <e>HCl</e> and HNO3 systems reveal stable performance with better results in HNO3 medium. The maximum loading capacity for Pd(II) was studied in HCl as well as in HNO3. A continuous-flow experiment taking a real industrial solution revealed the feasibility of using modified CWP for the selective uptake and preconcentration of traces of palladium contained in acidic effluents. In addition, stable adsorption performance even on long exposure to gamma-irradiation and selective recovery of palladium from simulated high-level liquid waste (HLW) are important outcomes of the study.",M2
19620710,"Chlorine activation indoors and outdoors via surface-mediated reactions of nitrogen oxides with hydrogen chloride.Gaseous <e>HCl</e> generated from a variety of sources is ubiquitous in both outdoor and indoor air. Oxides of nitrogen (NO(y)) are also globally distributed, because NO formed in combustion processes is oxidized to NO(2), HNO(3), N(2)O(5) and a variety of other nitrogen oxides during transport. Deposition of HCl and NO(y) onto surfaces is commonly regarded as providing permanent removal mechanisms. However, we show here a new surface-mediated coupling of nitrogen oxide and halogen activation cycles in which uptake of gaseous NO(2) or N(2)O(5) on solid substrates generates adsorbed intermediates that react with HCl to generate gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO) and nitryl chloride (ClNO(2)), respectively. These are potentially harmful gases that photolyze to form highly reactive chlorine atoms. The reactions are shown both experimentally and theoretically to be enhanced by water, a surprising result given the availability of competing hydrolysis reaction pathways. Airshed modeling incorporating HCl generated from sea salt shows that in coastal urban regions, this heterogeneous chemistry increases surface-level ozone, a criteria air pollutant, greenhouse gas and source of atmospheric oxidants. In addition, it may contribute to recently measured high levels of ClNO(2) in the polluted coastal marine boundary layer. This work also suggests the potential for chlorine atom chemistry to occur indoors where significant concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and HCl coexist.",M2
19615529,"Reversed flow injection spectrophotometric determination of chlorate.An interfacing has been developed to connect a spectrophotometer with a personal computer and used as a readout system for development of a simple, rapid and sensitive reversed flow injection (rFI) procedure for chlorate determination. The method is based on the oxidation of indigo carmine by chlorate ions in an acidic solution (dil. <e>HCl</e>) leading to the decrease in absorbance at 610 nm. The decrease in absorbance is directly related to the chlorate concentration present in the sample solutions. Optimum conditions for chlorate were examined. A linear calibration graph over the range of 0.1-0.5 mg L(-1) chlorate was established with the regression equation of Y=104.5X+1.0, r(2)=0.9961 (n=6). The detection limit (3 sigma) of 0.03 mg L(-1), the limit of quantitation (10 sigma) of 0.10 mg L(-1) and the RSD of 3.2% for 0.3 mg L(-1) chlorate (n=11) together with a sample throughput of 92 h(-1) were obtained. The recovery of the added chlorate in spiked water samples was 98.5+/-3.1%. Major interferences for chlorate determination were found to be BrO(3)(-), ClO(2)(-), ClO(-) and IO(3)(-) which were overcome by using SO(3)(2-) (as Na(2)SO(3)) as masking agent. The method has been successfully applied for the determination of chlorate in spiked water samples with the minimum reagent consumption of 14.0 mL h(-1). Good agreement between the proposed rFIA and the reference methods was found verified by Student's t-test at 95% confidence level.",M2
19608155,"Influence of fluoride concentration and ethanol pre-treatment on the reduction of the acid susceptibility of enamel.OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between KOH-soluble and structurally bound fluoride uptake and the erosion resistance of enamel, respectively. Additionally, the effect of enamel pre-treatment with ethanol before fluoridation was assessed. METHODS: Sixty bovine incisors (4 specimens/tooth) were randomly allocated to six groups (A-F). Samples 1 and 2 remained untreated, serving as control at baseline. Pre-treatment of the samples was performed for 5 min with 99% ethanol (groups A, B and C) or physiologic saline (groups D, E and F). Samples 3 and 4 were treated either with 0.5% (groups A and D), 1.0% (groups B and E) or 1.5% (groups C and F) fluoride solution. In samples 1 and 3, uptake of KOH-soluble and structurally bound fluoride was determined. Samples 2 and 4 were used for the determination of acid susceptibility by immersion in 1 ml <e>HCl</e> for 30s. Calcium release into HCl was assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Differences between the groups were calculated by unpaired t-tests (p&lt;0.05). RESULTS: Mode of pre-treatment showed no influence on fluoride acquisition. KOH-soluble and structurally fluoride uptake increased with increasing fluoride concentrations. Highest acid resistance was observed after treatment with 1% fluoride solution for both kinds of pre-treatment followed by 1.5% and 0.5% fluoride solution. CONCLUSION: Dose-dependency was observed for enamel fluoride acquisition but not for acid resistance.",M2
19604687,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic municipal wastewater treatment process residuals as feedstocks for the recovery of simple sugars.This study examined the hydrolysis of lignocellulose extracted from municipal wastewater treatment process residuals for the purpose of investigating low-cost feedstocks for ethanol production, while providing an alternative solid waste management strategy. Primary and thickened waste activated sludges and anaerobically digested biosolids underwent various pre-treatments to enhance subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Half of the pre-treated samples were dried and grinded, while the other half were used as is (wet). The wet primary sludge yielded the highest reducing sugar conversions. When wet primary sludge without pre-treatment was hydrolyzed at 40 degrees C and an enzyme loading of 800 U/g substrate, 31.1+/-2.7% was converted to reducing sugars in 24 h. This increased to 54.2+/-4.0% when <e>HCl</e> and KOH pre-treatments were applied. FTIR analyses were used to examine differences in the sludge compositions. These indicated that the cellulose content in the primary sludge was higher than that of the thickened waste activated sludge and biosolids, which was consistent with the higher reducing sugar yields observed in the primary sludge.",M2
19596514,"Development of a combined pyro- and hydro-metallurgical route to treat spent zinc-carbon batteries.The potential of solvent extraction using Cynanex272 for the recovery of zinc from spent zinc carbon batteries after a prior leaching in hydrochloric acid has been investigated. The elemental analysis of the spent material was carried out by ICP-MS. The major metallic elements are: ZnO (41.30%), Fe(2)O(3) (4.38%), MnO(2) (2.69%), Al(2)O(3) (1.01%), CaO (0.36%) and PbO (0.11%). The quantitative leaching by hydrochloric acid showed that the dissolution rates are significantly influenced by temperature and concentration of the acid solutions. The experimental data for the dissolution rates have been analyzed and were found to follow the shrinking core model for mixed control reaction with surface chemical reaction as the rate-determining step. About 90.3% dissolution was achieved with 4M <e>HCl</e> solution at 80 degrees C with 0.050-0.063 mm particle size within 120 min at 360 rpm. Activation energy value of 22.78 kJ/mol and a reaction order of 0.74 with respect to H(+) ion concentration were obtained for the dissolution process. An extraction yield of 94.23% zinc by 0.032M Cyanex272 in kerosene was obtained from initial 10 g/L spent battery leach liquor at 25+/-2 degrees C and at optimal stirring time of 25 min. Iron has been effectively separated by precipitation prior to extraction using ammoniacal solution at pH 3.5, while lead and other trace elements were firstly separated from Zn and Fe by cementation prior to iron removal and zinc extraction. Finally, the stripping study showed that 0.1M HCl led to the stripping of about 95% of zinc from the organic phase.",M2
19588943,"Self-organization pathways and spatial heterogeneity in insulin amyloid fibril formation.At high temperature and low pH, the protein hormone insulin is highly prone to form amyloid fibrils, and for this reason it is widely used as a model system to study fibril formation mechanisms. In this work, we focused on insulin aggregation mechanisms occurring in <e>HCl</e> solutions (pH 1.6) at 60 degrees C. By means of in situ Thioflavin T (ThT) staining, the kinetics profiles were characterized as a function of the protein concentration, and two concurrent aggregation pathways were pointed out, being concentration dependent. In correspondence to these pathways, different morphologies of self-assembled protein molecules were detected by atomic force microscopy images also evidencing the presence of secondary nucleation processes as a peculiar mechanism for insulin fibrillation. Moreover, combining ThT fluorescence and light scattering, the early stages of the process were analyzed in the low concentration regime, pointing out a pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the formation of the first stable fibrils in solution and the onset of the secondary nucleation pathways.",M2
19585225,"Effect of <e>HCl</e> concentrations on apatite-forming ability of NaOH-HCl- and heat-treated titanium metal.Titanium (Ti) metal was treated with water or HCl solutions after 5 M NaOH solution treatment and then subjected to heat treatment at 600 degrees C. The apatite-forming abilities of the treated Ti metals were examined in simulated body fluid. The apatite-forming ability of the Ti metal subjected to NaOH, water and heat treatment was lower than that of just NaOH and heat treatments. Ti metals subjected to NaOH, HCl and heat treatment showed apatite-forming abilities, which increased with increasing HCl concentrations up to the same level as that of NaOH- and heat-treated Ti metal. The former did not show a decrease in its apatite-forming ability, even in a humid environment for a long period, whereas the latter decreased its ability. The increase in the apatite-forming ability with increasing HCl concentrations suggests a different mechanism of apatite formation from that previously proposed.",M2

19583752,"Effects of toothbrushing force on the mineral content and demineralized organic matrix of eroded dentine.Eroded dentine has a complex histological structure, and its organic fraction becomes increasingly exposed as a result of the continual action of acids. The present study sought to investigate the effects of brushing forces up to 4 N on mineralized and organic dentine fractions. The study was a cyclic demineralization and remineralization experiment (carried out over 9 d). Erosion was performed with <e>HCl</e> (6 x 2 min d-1), pH 1.6. Samples exposed to erosion alone served as controls; test samples were eroded and brushed with a powered toothbrush (2 x 15 s d-1), applying forces of 2, 3, or 4 N. Samples were analysed (using profilometry and longitudinal microradiography) before and after the removal of superficial organic material with collagenase. Randomly selected samples were subjected to scanning electron microscopy. Demineralized organic material was present on all samples regardless of brushing force. Loss values (determined using profilometry) after erosion only, and after brushing with forces of 2, 3, and 4 N, were 11.7 +/- 5.1, 13.6 +/- 11.2, 30.7 +/- 19.0, and 25.5 +/- 20.3, respectively, before treatment with collagenase, and 111.7 +/- 11.6, 122.0 +/- 11.8, 121.9 +/- 15.7, and 123.0 +/- 12.0, respectively, after treatment with collagenase. Microradiography confirmed the results. Significant effects of brushing force were only found on the demineralized organic fraction, and mineral loss was unaffected. The notion that eroded dentine is particularly prone to abrasion should be reconsidered.",M2
19577840,"Extraction behavior of As, Pb, and Zn from mine tailings with acid and base solutions.The aim of this study was to investigate the extraction behavior of As, Pb, and Zn from mine tailings for considering the feasibility of soil washing. Extraction of metals was studied for different extractant doses, solid/liquid ratios, and equilibrium times. Generally, high extraction efficiency was achieved with <e>HCl</e>, H(3)PO(4), and H(2)SO(4), while H(2)SO(4) proved to be problematic with respect to Pb. NaOH was found to be favorable in removing As, while it was not effective at extracting Pb and Zn. With optimum conditions, which were a 1:5 solid-liquid ratio and 2h of extraction time, 0.5M of HCl extracted 21.1-72.5%, 9.9-86.5%, and 6.1-74.1% of As, Pb, and Zn, respectively. The power and Elovich function were adequate to describe adsorption kinetics. These results suggest that HCl and NaOH could be used to effectively extract all metals without selectivity and As with selectivity, respectively, in mine tailings and could be used for the design of soil washing process.",M2
19576762,"An accurate and non-labor intensive method for the determination of syringyl to guaiacyl ratio in lignin.The syringyl to guaiacyl (S:G) ratio of hardwood lignin has long been identified as a significant parameter in delignification processes and more recent results have shown that it is also important in determining the amount of ethanol that can be obtained from fermentation of hydrolyzed wood. Acidolysis of Klason or acid insoluble lignin in dioxane/water/<e>HCl</e> was being investigated when syringyl and guaiacyl nuclei with a diketone-containing sidechain were observed as the major products. The area ratio of the two gas chromatogram peaks appeared to be indicative of the S:G ratio. After optimization of the method the relative standard deviation was found to be in the range of 0.3-3.76% for Klason lignin from a wide range of Eucalyptus grandis grown in South Africa. The method was then compared to nitrobenzene oxidation (NBO) using 13 poplars in a double-blind study. The respective S:G ratios were used to calculate percentages of S units and when these values were plotted against each other a linear correlation was obtained with a slope of approximately 1.0 (R(2)=0.86). The largest discrepancy for any poplar was 6.9% (62% vs. 58% S units). Both methods convincingly demonstrated a significant decrease in lignin content with an increase in the S:G ratio. Discussion is presented on a series of reaction that could lead to the formation of the two diketones.",M2
19574036,"Optimized isolation procedure for obtaining strongly actinide binding exopolymeric substances (EPS) from two bacteria (Sagittula stellata and Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar II).Different chemical extractants (NaCl, EDTA, <e>HCl</e> and NaOH) and physical methods (ultrasonication and heating) were examined by their efficacies of extracting  attached  exopolymeric substances (EPS) secreted by marine bacterium Sagittula stellata (SS) and terrestrial bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar II (PF). Extraction by 0.5 N HCl for 3 h was best for SS while extraction by 0.05 N NaCl for 3-5 h was regarded as optimal for PF. Improvements in EPS purification included a pre-diafiltration step to remove the broth material and reduce the solution volume, thus the usage of ethanol, and time. The EPS harvested at the optimal time and purified by the improved method were enriched in polysaccharides, with smaller amounts of proteins, thus having amphiphilic properties. Isoelectric focusing of (234)Th or (240)Pu labeled EPS showed both actinides were strongly bound to macromolecules with low pI, similar to reported marine or soil colloidal natural organic matter (NOM).",M2
19558232,"Physico-chemical characterization in the light of toxicological effects.Toxicological investigations on nanoparticles require a comprehensive physico-chemical characterization to get useful information about the powder as well as the behavior of the suspended nanoparticles in water and physiological media. Therefore, we characterized the often used TiO(2) P25 and developed procedures to get stable, homogeneous, and well-defined nanoparticle suspensions. A titration of the zeta potential as a function of the pH yielded the conclusion that the TiO(2) suspension is stable at a pH of 4 or lower. In this region the zeta potential is higher than 30 mV, which guarantees a high stability of the suspended particles. Hence, a stable TiO(2) initial suspension was prepared in 0.1 mM <e>HCl</e> having a mean particle size of 170 +/- 5 nm, which was determined by dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, the initial suspension was added to different physiological media (0.9% NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], Hanks balanced salt solution [HBSS], Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM]) for studying the agglomeration behavior. As a result, the agglomeration kinetics at the same TiO(2) concentration is independent of the used media. Investigations with PBS containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS revealed that these protein additions inhibit the agglomeration of the particles. Thus, the physiological media contains particles that are stabilized through the steric or electrosteric effect of BSA and of the proteins in FBS, respectively. Consequently, the particles keep their size from the initial suspension. Finally, our procedure demonstrated on TiO(2) P25 results in homogeneously suspended particles in physiological media. This definite status of the particles means an improvement for toxicological testing and understanding.",M2

We tested a possibility that polaprezinc (PZ), an anti-ulcer drug, could induce HO-1 in the gastric mucosa. Male 6-week-old Wistar rats were intragastrically administered PZ. Gastric expression of HO-1 was assessed by real time RT-PCR and western blotting, and localization of HO-1 was observed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The levels of HO-1 mRNA were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of HO-1 mRNA were increased 4-fold by PZ at the dose of 200 mg/kg at 3 h as compared with control levels. The levels of immunoreactive HO-1 were increased 3-fold at 6 h. Signals for HO-1 mRNA and immunoreactivity were detected strongly in the surface gastric mucosal cells and moderately in the gastric macrophages. Treatment with an HO-1 inhibitor, stannous mesoporphyrin (SnMP) significantly worsened the <e>HCl</e>-induced acute gastric mucosal lesions and increased the apoptosis of mucosal cells. Mucosal lesions were decreased by pretreatment with PZ, while they were increased by co-administration with SnMP. These data indicate for the first time that PZ is an effective inducer of HO-1 in the stomach. PZ-induced HO-1 functions as a part of the mucosal protective effects of PZ.",M2
19541517,"Central pain mechanisms following combined acid and capsaicin perfusion of the human oesophagus.Visceral afferents originating from different gut-segments converge at the spinal level. We hypothesized that chemically-induced hyperalgesia in the oesophagus could provoke widespread visceral hypersensitivity and also influence descending modulatory pain pathways. Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 min after randomized perfusion of the distal oesophagus with either saline or 180 ml 0.1M <e>HCl</e>+2mg capsaicin. Electro-stimulation of the oesophagus, 8 cm proximal to the perfusion site, rectosigmoid electrical stimulation and rectal mechanical and heat stimulations were used. Evoked brain potentials were recorded after electrical stimulations before and after oesophageal perfusion. After the perfusion, rectal hyperalgesia to heat (P&lt;0.01, 37%) and mechanical (P=0.01, 11%) stimulations were demonstrated. In contrast, hypoalgesia to electro-stimulation was observed in both the oesophagus (P&lt;0.03, 23%) and the sigmoid colon (P&lt;0.001, 18%). Referred pain areas to electro-stimulation in oesophagus were reduced by 13% after perfusion (P=0.01). Evoked brain potentials to rectosigmoid stimulations showed decreased latencies and amplitudes of P1, N1 and P2 (P&lt;0.05), whereas oesophagus-evoked brain potentials were unaffected after perfusion. In conclusion, modality-specific hyperalgesia was demonstrated in the lower gut following chemical sensitization of the oesophagus, reflecting widespread central hyperexcitability. Conversely, hypoalgesia to electrical stimulation, decreases in referred pain and latencies of evoked brain potentials was seen. This outcome may reflect a counterbalancing activation of descending inhibitory pathways. As these findings are also seen in the clinical setting, the model may be usable for future basic and pharmacological studies.",M2
19531854,"A novel BiOCl film with flowerlike hierarchical structures and its optical properties.A novel BiOCl film with flowerlike hierarchical structures has been fabricated for the first time by dipping Bi film in a mixed solution of H(2)O(2) and <e>HCl</e>. This method presents the advantages of a simple technique, template-free, uniform and controllable morphology, as well as easy mass production. Each flowerlike hierarchical structure is composed of several dozen ultra-thin single-crystal nanopetals which grow along the 110 directions in the tetragonal structure. The layered growth of nanopetals is related to the more marked anion polarization along the c axis and layered stacking of various atoms (Cl-Bi-O-Bi-Cl). The growth mechanism of the BiOCl hierarchical structure is preferred to be a nucleation-dissolution-recrystallization process. A Raman shift originating from laser-induced compressive stress is observed.

19501275,"Davilla elliptica and Davilla nitida: gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory and anti-Helicobacter pylori action.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Davilla elliptica and Davilla nitida are species commonly found in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. AIM OF THE STUDY: Based on ethnopharmacological and phytochemical analyses, methanolic extracts from leaves of Davilla elliptica (EDE) and Davilla nitida (EDN) were evaluated for their anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, immunological and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gastroprotective action of both extracts was evaluated in rodent experimental models (<e>HCl</e>/ethanol, ethanol or NSAID). We also evaluated anti-inflammatory (carrageenin-induced rat hind paw edema), immunomodulatory (murine peritoneal macrophages) and antibacterial action of both extracts against a standard strain of Helicobacter pylori. RESULTS: EDE and EDN (500 mg/kg) were able to protect gastric mucosa against HCl/ethanol solution (EDE 63%; EDN 59%), absolute ethanol (EDE 95%; EDN 88%), and also against injurious effect of NSAID (EDE 77%; EDN 67%). When EDE and EDN were challenged with sulfhydryl depleter compound, the gastroprotective action of both extracts was completely abolished. EDE had gastroprotective effect related to increase of glutathione bioavailability and stimulated higher levels of NO, H2O2 and TNF-alpha production. Otherwise EDN showed better anti-Helicobacter pylori action than EDE. Neither extracts presented anti-inflammatory activity by oral route. CONCLUSION: The phytochemical investigation showed that both extracts possess phenolic acid derivatives, acylglycoflavonoids and condensed tannins with evident quantitative variations that probably influenced the pharmacological differences between extracts.",M2
19497430,"Gastroprotective activity of alkaloid extract and 2-phenylquinoline obtained from the bark of Galipea longiflora Krause (Rutaceae).As part of our continuing search for bioactive natural products from plants, the present study was carried out in order to evaluate the gastroprotective properties of alkaloid extract and 2-phenylquinoline obtained from the bark of Galipea longiflora (Rutaceae). Anti-ulcer assays were performed using the following protocols in mice: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)/bethanecol-induced ulcer, ethanol/<e>HCl</e>-induced ulcer, and stress-induced ulcer. The effects of the extract on gastric content volume, pH and total acidity were also evaluated, using the pylorus ligated model. Treatment using doses of 50, 125 and 250 mg/kg of G. longiflora alkaloid extract and positive controls (omeprazol or cimetidine) significantly diminished the lesion index, total lesion area, and percentage of lesion, in comparison with the negative control groups in all the models evaluated. Regarding the model of gastric secretion, a reduction in volume of gastric juice and total acidity was observed, as well as an increase in gastric pH. The main alkaloid of the plant, 2-phenylquinoline, was also evaluated in the ethanol-induced ulcer model. The results showed that at a dose of 50 mg/kg, it significantly inhibited ulcerative lesions. However, this effect was less than that of the alkaloid extract. All these results taken together show that G. longiflora displays gastroprotective activity, as evidenced by its significant inhibition of the formation of ulcers induced by different models. There are indications that mechanisms involved in anti-ulcer activity are related to a decrease in gastric secretion and an increase in gastric mucus content. Also, there is evidence of involvement of NO in the gastroprotector mechanisms. These effects may be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of some alkaloids, particularly 2-phenylquinoline.",M2
19490646,"Afferent signalling from the acid-challenged rat stomach is inhibited and gastric acid elimination is enhanced by lafutidine.BACKGROUND: Lafutidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, the gastroprotective effect of which is related to its antisecretory activity and its ability to activate a sensory neuron-dependent mechanism of defence. The present study investigated whether intragastric administration of lafutidine (10 and 30 mg/kg) modifies vagal afferent signalling, mucosal injury, intragastric acidity and gastric emptying after gastric acid challenge. METHODS: Adult rats were treated with vehicle, lafutidine (10 - 30 mg/kg) or cimetidine (10 mg/kg), and 30 min later their stomachs were exposed to exogenous <e>HCl</e> (0.25 M). During the period of 2 h post-HCl, intragastric pH, gastric volume, gastric acidity and extent of macroscopic gastric mucosal injury were determined and the activation of neurons in the brainstem was visualized by c-Fos immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Gastric acid challenge enhanced the expression of c-Fos in the nucleus tractus solitarii but caused only minimal damage to the gastric mucosa. Lafutidine reduced the HCl-evoked expression of c-Fos in the NTS and elevated the intragastric pH following intragastric administration of excess HCl. Further analysis showed that the gastroprotective effect of lafutidine against excess acid was delayed and went in parallel with facilitation of gastric emptying, measured indirectly via gastric volume changes, and a reduction of gastric acidity. The H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine had similar but weaker effects. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that lafutidine inhibits the vagal afferent signalling of a gastric acid insult, which may reflect an inhibitory action on acid-induced gastric pain. The ability of lafutidine to decrease intragastric acidity following exposure to excess HCl cannot be explained by its antisecretory activity but appears to reflect dilution and/or emptying of the acid load into the duodenum. This profile of actions emphasizes the notion that H2 receptor antagonists can protect the gastric mucosa from acid injury independently of their ability to suppress gastric acid secretion.",M2
19482330,"Effects of sulfur on PCDD/F formation under stable and transient combustion conditions during MSW incineration.SO(2) levels in the flue gas from a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor combusting artificial municipal solid waste (MSW) were varied (resulting in four different SO(2):<e>HCl</e> ratios 0, 0.2, 0.7 and 2.7 (by mass)) to study the effects of sulfur on the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated dibenzothiophenes (PCDTs). Sampling was performed simultaneously at three fixed points in the post-combustion zone with temperatures of 400, 300 and 200 degrees C, under normal combustion conditions and both during and after transient combustion conditions. The findings indicate that sulfur has a greater inhibitory effect on PCDF formation than on PCDD formation and that the PCDD/PCDF ratio in the flue gas depends on both the SO(2):HCl ratio in the flue gas and memory effects arising from transient combustion conditions. The results also indicate that the relative importance of different pathways shifts in the post-combustion zone; condensation products increasing with reductions in temperature and increases in residence time. However, these changes appear to depend on the SO(2):HCl ratio in the flue gas and combustion conditions. Sulfur seems to inhibit the chlorination of PCDFs. A tendency for increased SO(2) levels in the flue gas to increase levels of PCDTs was also detected, but the increases were much less significant than the reductions in PCDF levels.",M2
19482262,"TiF(4) and NaF at pH 1.2 but not at pH 3.5 are able to reduce dentin erosion.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse and compare the protective effect of buffered (pH 3.5) and native (pH 1.2) TiF(4) in comparison to NaF solutions of same pH on dentin erosion. DESIGN: Bovine samples were pretreated with 1.50% TiF(4) or 2.02% NaF (both 0.48M F) solutions, each with a pH of 1.2 and 3.5. The control group received no fluoride pretreatment. Ten samples in each group were eroded with <e>HCl</e> (pH 2.6) for 10x60s. Erosion was analysed by determination of calcium release into the acid. Additionally, the surface and the elemental surface composition were examined by scanning electron microscopy (two samples in each group) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy in fluoridated but not eroded samples (six samples in each group). Cumulative calcium release (nmol/mm(2)) was statistically analysed by repeated measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA at t=10min. RESULTS: TiF(4) and NaF at pH 1.2 decreased calcium release significantly, while TiF(4) and NaF at pH 3.5 were not effective. Samples treated with TiF(4) at pH 1.2 showed a significant increase of Ti, while NaF pretreatment increased F concentration significantly. TiF(4) at pH 1.2 led to the formation of globular precipitates occluding dentinal tubules, which could not be observed on samples treated with TiF(4) at pH 3.5.

CONCLUSION: Dentin erosion can be significantly reduced by TiF(4) and NaF at pH 1.2, but not at pH 3.5.",M2
19479932,"1-(Alpha-aminobenzyl)-2-naphthol: a new chiral auxiliary for the synthesis of enantiopure alpha-aminophosphonic acids.A new diastereoselective synthesis of alpha-aminophosphonates has been developed, based on the reaction, in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, of trialkyl phosphites with chiral imines derived from (R)- or (S)-1-(alpha-aminobenzyl)-2-naphthol. The reaction proceeds at room temperature in toluene with high diastereoselectivity. The major diastereomer can be separated by crystallization from an appropriate solvent. The relative configuration of both chiral centers of the major diastereomer was determined by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The desired alpha-aminophosphonic acids can be obtained in enantiopure form by treatment of the corresponding diastereomers with <e>HCl</e>.",M2
19467779,"An oilwell cement slurry additivated with bisphenol diglycidil ether/isophoronediamine--kinetic analysis and multivariate modelings at slurry/<e>HCl</e> interfaces.Loss of zonal isolation in oilwell cementing operations leads to safety and environmental problems. The use of new cement slurries can help to solve this problem. In this paper, an epoxy-modified cement slurry was synthesized and characterized. The features of the modified slurries were evaluated in relation to a standard cement slurry (w/c=0.50). A kinetic study of HCl interaction with the slurries was carried out using cubic molds. The Avrami kinetic model appears to be the most efficient in describing kinetic isotherms obtained from 25 to 55 degrees C. Type of slurry, HCl concentration and temperature effects were also evaluated in HCl adsorption onto cement slurries considering a 2(3) full factorial design. From the statistical analysis, it is inferred that the factor  HCl concentration  has shown a profound influence on the numerical values of the Avrami kinetic constants. However, the best statistical fits were found using binary and tertiary interactive effects. It was found that the epoxy-modified cement slurry presents a good potential to be used in environmental-friendly oilwell operations.",M2
19434209,"Antiulcer and gastric antisecretory effects of Landolphia owariensis extracts in rats.Water, methanol and chloroform extracts of Landolphia owarensis were investigated for their effects on gastric acid secretion and ulceration in male albino rats. Two models of gastric lesion induced in experimental Wistar rats-HC1/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and Pylorus ligation-induced gastric lesions-were employed. In both models, the antiulcer activity of LA was compared with that of cimetidine (100 mg kg p.o.). In the <e>HCl</e>/Ethanol model, ulcer index and mucus production was determined. In pylorus ligated rat, ulcer index, mucus production, total volume of gastric juice and gastric acidity level were measured. Pre-treatment of animals with the aqueous extracts (100mg/kg and 200mg/kg) orally once daily for two weeks significantly reduced formation of ulcers induced by HCl/ethanol mixture, the percentage inhibition being 43.8 % and 55.27 % respectively. The chloroform extract afforded the least protection with 23.07 % and 14.77 % inhibition. This was also accompanied by significant increases in gastric mucus production. In pylorus ligated rats, total volume of gastric juice and gastric acidity was significantly decreased as compared to control group, to levels comparable to that produced by cimetidine. The results indicate that the leaf extracts of LO contains antiulcer principles.",M2
19405494,"Unusual hydrophobic interactions in acidic aqueous solutions.Hydrophobic interaction, which is believed to be a primary driving force for many fundamental chemical and biological processes such as nanostructure self-assembly, micelle formation, and protein folding, is different in acidic aqueous solutions compared to salt solutions. In this study, the aggregation/dispersion behavior of nonpolar hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions with varying acid (<e>HCl</e>) concentrations is investigated using novel molecular dynamics simulations and compared to the hydrophobic behavior in corresponding salt (NaCl) solutions. The formation of unusual weakly bound hydrophobe-hydrated proton solvation structures is observed and can be attributed to the unique  amphiphilic  characteristic of hydrated protons. This molecular-level mechanism for the acid-enhanced dissolution of hydrophobic particles also provides a novel interpretation for the apparent anomaly of the hydronium cation in the Hofmeister series.",M2
19400581,"Hierarchically nanostructured rutile arrays: acid vapor oxidation growth and tunable morphologies.A general acid vapor oxidation (AVO) strategy has been developed to grow highly oriented hierarchically structured rutile TiO(2) nanoarrays with tunable morphologies from titanium thin films. This is a simple one-pot synthesis approach involving the reaction of a titanium surface with the vapor generated from a hydrochloric acid solution in a Teflon lined autoclave. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to grow ordered tree-like titania nanoarrays. A possible formation mechanism for the interesting architectures has been proposed based on series of time-dependent experiments. By adjusting the initial <e>HCl</e> concentration, films of different rutile structures including nanotrees, dendritic nanobundles, and nanorods can be selectively obtained. Subsequently, the surface morphologies and wettability can be readily tuned.",M2
19399590,"A gel-forming poly-L: -guluronic acid produced from no guluronate-rich marine algae using new hydrolysis method: test for endovascular embolization.To prepare a gel-forming poly-L-guluronic acid (Poly-G) from no guluronate-rich Laminaria japonica, a new hydrolysis method was employed with a lower <e>HCl</e> concentration (0.025-0.15 M) and a shorter treatment time (5 min). The Poly-Gs were set to measure purity, presence of poly-L-guluronic block, molecular weight distribution, polymer yield, viscosity, and compressive gel strength. Finally, the Poly-G was tested to embolize the renal vascular system by using a rabbit model and angiography. Optimized Poly-G could be selected with respect to wt% concentration, polymer yield, gel-forming stability, viscosity, and gel strength as an endovascular embolizing agent. Overall, 0.4-0.6% of 0.03 M-Poly-G obtained from acid treatment with 0.03 M of HCl had molecular weights greater than 80 kDa, and the best gelling capacity with an injectable viscosity (30-120 cP).

19389802,"<e>HCl</e>-activated neural and epithelial vanilloid receptors (TRPV1) in cat esophageal mucosa.To test whether transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member-1 (TRPV1) mediates acid-induced inflammation in the esophagus, a tubular segment of esophageal mucosa was tied at both ends, forming a sac. The sac was filled with 0.01 N HCl (or Krebs buffer for control) and kept in oxygenated Krebs buffer at 37 degrees C. The medium around the sac (supernatant) was collected after 3 h. Supernatant of the HCl-filled sac abolished contraction of esophageal circular muscle strips in response to electric field stimulation. Contraction was similarly abolished by supernatant of mucosal sac filled with the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (10(-6) M). These effects were reversed by the selective TRPV1 antagonist 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) and by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist CV9388. Substance P and CGRP levels in mucosa and in supernatant increased in response to HCl, and these increases were abolished by IRTX and by tetrodotoxin (TTX) but not affected by CV9388, indicating that substance P and CGRP are neurally released and PAF independent. In contrast, the increase in PAF was blocked by IRTX but not by TTX. Presence of TRPV1 receptor was confirmed by RT-PCR and by Western blot analysis in whole mucosa and in esophageal epithelial cells enzymatically isolated and sorted by flow cytometry or immunoprecipitated with cytokeratin antibodies. In epithelial cells PAF increased in response to HCl, and the increase was abolished by IRTX. We conclude that HCl-induced activation of TRPV1 receptors in esophageal mucosa causes release of substance P and CGRP from neurons and release of PAF from epithelial cells.",M2
19368448,"Direct ab initio dynamics calculations for rates and the kinetic isotope effects of multiproton transfer in ClONO2 + <e>HCl</e> --&gt; HNO3 + Cl2 reactions with water clusters: breakdown of the rule of the geometric mean.We performed high-level quantum mechanical calculations and direct ab initio reaction dynamics calculations for multiple proton transfers in ClONO(2)+HCl--&gt;HNO(3)+Cl(2) with water clusters containing one to two water molecules, which can be used as a model of the reactions occurring on ice surface in stratospheric clouds. The energy barriers of these reactions depend on the number of water molecules involved. Two and three protons in these reactions with one and two water molecules, respectively, were transferred concertedly and asynchronously. The potential energy barrier at the MP2/6-311++(3df,3pd)//MP2/6-31G(d,p) level was 4.8 kcal/mol for the triple proton transfer involving two water molecules with a rate constant of 1.6x10(3) s(-1) at 197 K. The potential energy curve near the saddle points was very flat and the tunneling effect on the proton transfer was negligible. The primary HH/DH kinetic isotope effect for the double proton transfer involving one water molecule was lower than unity due to the enhanced force constant at the transition state. The rule of the geometric mean for the concerted proton transfer does not hold in these reactions because the zero-point energy changes of each proton in flight at the transition state are not the same in the highly asynchronous processes.",M2
19362817,"TG-FTIR study on co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste with biomass.Co-pyrolysis of cotton stalk, a representative agricultural biomass in China, mixed with municipal solid waste (MSW) with high ash content and low calorific value was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) coupled with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in Ar atmosphere. Pyrolysis characteristic and pollutant emission performance from MSW and stalk blends at different mass proportions were studied. The results show that as the mass proportion of stalk added increases, the total weight loss of the blend during pyrolysis increases. The addition of stalk has substantial effects on the N-selectivity to HCN, NH(3) and HNCO. In the presence of stalk, lower concentrations of <e>HCl</e> are detected.",M2
19347919,"Proton transfer in the complex H3N...<e>HCl</e> catalyzed by encapsulation into a C60 cage.We report proton transfer in the complex H(3)N...HCl to form the ion pair NH(4)(+)Cl(-), which is favored inside the C(60) cage according to quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the NH(4)(+)Cl(-)@C(60) is stable with an interaction energy of -2.78 kcal mol(-1). Compared with the complex H(3)N...HCl without proton transfer, it is found that the C(60) cage plays the role of a catalyst for proton transfer. In NH(4)(+)Cl(-)@C(60) a negative charge area in the C(60) cage is near the cation NH(4)(+) whereas a positive charge area is near the anion Cl(-). Also, a confinement effect of the C(60) cage is noticed, as the endohedral structure of NH(4)(+)Cl(-) is more compact than the structure of NH(4)(+)Cl(-) in the gas-phase complex. These findings indicate that the catalysis by the C(60) cage comes from two effects: 1) electrostatic inducement between the C(60) cage and endohedral molecules and 2) the confinement effect that compresses endohedral molecular structures inside the C(60) cage. In the infrared spectrum, it is found that the confinement effect of the cage can cause large blue shifts of the N-H stretching vibrations in NH(4)(+)Cl(-)@C(60) compared with those in the NH(4)(+)Cl(-)...H(2)O complex.",M2
19342804,"Recycle use of magnesium ammonium phosphate to remove ammonium nitrogen from rare-earth wastewater.This paper presents a recycle MAP process (magnesium ammonium phosphate) to remove NH4-N from a typical rare-earth wastewater. The optimum conditions for the MAP precipitation and recycle use of the MAP with a newly-designed process were investigated in laboratory. The results showed that the pH value and dosages of P (phosphate) and Mg reagents have a significant influence on NH4-N removal, with a maximum removal efficiency of 99.4% at the conditions of pH=9 and Mg:N:P molar ratio=1.2:1:1.2. In the process of recycle use of the MAP, adding some <e>HCl</e> to dissolve MAP decomposition residues could effectively enhance NH4-N removal. The NH4-N removal efficiency reached 99.6% by adding an HCl amount of H+:OH- molar ratio=0.8 into the reused MAP decomposition residues, whereas the NH4-N removal efficiency without addition of HCl was only 96.4%. Moreover, the residual PO4-P from the end of reaction was recovered and the optimum recovery efficiency was achieved at a Mg:P molar ratio=6 and pH=10. Under these optimum conditions, the residual NH4-N and PO4-P concentrations in the treated wastewater, through 6 times of the recycling, were less than 15 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively. On the basis of this, an economic evaluation of the recycling MAP was made, and this recycle process could save 48.6% cost used in the chemicals for treating per cubic meter of the rare-earth wastewater, compared to the conventional MAP process.",M2
19326864,"Fenton degradation of 4,6-dinitro-o-cresol with Fe(2+)-substituted ion-exchange resin.The Fenton degradation of 4,6-dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) was studied under different experimental conditions using Amberlyst 15 ion-exchange resin containing ferrous ion. DNOC was found to be effectively degraded under most conditions, and it was observed that, with the addition of <e>HCl</e>, the desorption of ferrous ion from the resin into the solution played a major role in this degradation. The total iron concentration in the reaction solution was found to increase with the addition of HCl, and a pseudo-first-order kinetic model was applied to the desorption of ferrous ion from the resin on the basis of the assumption of a first-order ion-exchange process. The degradation rate of DNOC also increased as a function of HCl. A kinetic model was developed to simulate the degradation of DNOC under different operating conditions, assuming the first-order desorption of ferrous ion. Different cations were compared with H(+), and H(+) was found to be the most efficient at facilitating the degradation reaction at low concentrations, whereas Ca(2+) was found to be most efficient at high concentrations. pH was measured during the reaction, and its effect on degradation was explored. It was found that a lower pH could lead to faster degradation of the target compound. Degradation of DNOC under different delivery rates of H(2)O(2) was studied, and optimal conditions were determined. The results also showed that the delivery rate of H(2)O(2) did not affect the ion-exchange process of the resin.",M2
19324074,"Differential effects of transient receptor vanilloid one (TRPV1) antagonists in acid-induced excitation of esophageal vagal afferent fibers of rats.Gastro-esophageal acid reflux can stimulate esophageal vagal sensory afferents by activating proton-sensitive ion channel transient receptor vanilloid one (TRPV1). The objective of this study was to investigate the response characteristics of vagal afferent fibers of rats to acid (0.1 N <e>HCl</e>) and capsaicin (CAP) following esophagitis and differential effects of two classes of TRPV1 antagonists on responses of vagal afferent fibers. The chronic reflux was induced by ligating the fundus of the stomach and partial constriction of pylorus. Extracellular single fiber recordings were made from the cervical vagal afferent fibers from naive control and fundus-ligated (FL) esophagitis rats. Innervations of fibers were identified to esophageal distension (ED) and subsequently tested to CAP and acid before and after injection of TRPV1 antagonist JYL1421 or AMG9810 (10 micromol/kg i.v.). Seventy-five vagal afferent fibers from 70 rats were identified to ED. Intra-esophageal CAP (0.1 ml of 1 mg/ml) excited 39.5% (17/43, 5/22 from naive and 12/21 from FL rats) fibers. In contrast, i.v. injection of CAP (0.03-0.3 micromol/kg) dose-dependently excited 72% (42/58) fibers. Responses to CAP were significantly greater for fibers from FL rats (n=32) than naive rats (n=25). TRPV1 antagonists JYL1421 and AMG9810 (10 micromol/kg) significantly blocked response to CAP. Intra-esophageal acid infusion stimulated 5/17 (29.4%) fibers from naive rats and 12/28 (42%) from FL rats. Effect of acid was significantly blocked by AMG9810, but not by JYL1421. Results indicate that following esophagitis the number of fibers responsive to CAP and acid is greater than noninflamed esophagus, which may contribute to esophageal hypersensitivity. Acid-induced excitation of vagal sensory afferents can be differentially attenuated by different classes of TRPV1 antagonists. Therefore, TRPV1 antagonists play a key role in attenuation of hypersensitivity following reflux-induced esophagitis. The use of TRPV1 antagonists could be an alternative to the traditional symptoms-based treatment of chronic acid reflux and esophageal hypersensitivity.",M2

The percentage extraction of platinum(IV) and rhodium(III) increased with increase in acid concentration up to 8 mol L(-1). However, at 10 mol L(-1) <e>HCl</e> concentration, the extraction behavior was reversed, indicating the solvation type mechanism during extraction. The quantitative extraction of approximately 98% platinum(IV) and 36% rhodium(III) was achieved with 0.01 mol L(-1) Alamine 308. The highest separation factor (S.F.=184.7) of platinum(IV) and rhodium(III) was achieved with 0.01 mol L(-1) Alamine 308 at 1.0 mol L(-1) of hydrochloric acid concentration. Alkaline metal salts like sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium thiocyanate, lithium chloride, lithium nitrate, potassium chloride and potassium thiocyanate used for the salting-out effect. LiCl proved as best salt for the extraction of platinum(IV). Temperature effect demonstrates that the extraction process is exothermic.

19278768,"Degree of mineral loss in softened human enamel after acid erosion measured by chemical analysis.OBJECTIVES: Erosive attack on enamel leads to a bulk material loss and a partial demineralisation at the lesion body. This zone of softened enamel has a reduced physical stability and large interprismatic porosities. The aim of the current study was to measure the degree of demineralisation with respect to the content of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in softened enamel using ultrasonication and chemical analysis. The erosive demineralisation was to be compared with demineralisation in caries. METHODS: Erosion of 10 polished human enamel samples was performed in 0.3% citric acid adjusted to pH 3.2 at 35 degrees C in a slowly stirred solution, each in a volume of 15 ml. After erosion the softened enamel was removed by ultrasonication in 2 ml of deionised water and enamel crystals were dissolved by adding 220 microl of 1M <e>HCl</e>. Substance loss was measured profilometricaly after erosion and after ultrasonication. Surface size of eroded enamel was measured thus volume loss could be calculated. Calcium and phosphate ion concentration in the solutions were measured after ultrasonication. RESULTS: Citric acid erosion caused a mean substance loss of 16.0 microm (SD 2.5 microm) and further enamel softening of 2.4 microm (SD 1.5 microm). The degree of demineralisation of softened enamel, in comparison the original mineral content, was 62% for calcium and 64% for inorganic phosphorus was calculated. CONCLUSION: The high degree of demineralisation shown in the current study explains the instability of softened enamel even against mild physical impact.",M2
19262391,"Hydrochloric acid aspiration increases right ventricular systolic pressure in rats.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary aspiration of gastric acid is a serious complication during anaesthesia and may cause aspiration pneumonitis and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The development of pulmonary hypertension may aggravate the initial course of the aspiration pneumonitis. The authors hypothesized that acid aspiration induces an acute increase in right ventricular pressure in the rat heart. Additionally, it was hypothesized as a secondary study that endothelin levels would be increased in this rat model. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with sevoflurane, underwent tracheostomy, and catheters were inserted into the carotid and right ventricle. Lung injury was induced by instillation of 0.4 ml kg(-1) 0.1 mol l(-1) <e>HCl</e>; a control group received the same volume of 0.9% NaCl. Rats were then ventilated for 6 hours. p(a)O2, mean arterial blood pressures and right ventricular systolic pressures were documented every 30 minutes, and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline, 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360 min. Wet/dry ratio was performed and additionally endothelin-1 levels were examined before and 180 and 360 min after aspiration. RESULTS: p(a)O2 values were lower, whereas right ventricular systolic pressures were significantly higher in the HCl group. Mortality rate was 50% after HCl aspiration, whereas 100% of the rats survived NaCl aspiration. Wet/dry ratio and endothelin-1 levels showed a significant increase after 180 and 360 min of HCl aspiration. CONCLUSION: Acid aspiration induces a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and endothelin levels, and causes metabolic acidosis in this animal model.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty Ti-6Al-4V implants and 30 Ti-6Al-4V discs were used in this study. The implants and discs were separated into 2 groups: sandblasted and dual acid-etched group (control group) and sandblasted, dual acid-etched and H2O2/HCl heat-treated group (test group). Surface morphology, roughness, and crystal structure of the discs were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and low angle X-ray diffractometry. The implants were inserted into the femurs of 10 adult white rabbits. Animals were injected with fluorescent bone labels at 1, 5, and 7 weeks following surgery to monitor progress of bone formation. Animals were euthanized 8 weeks postsurgery, and block biopsies were prepared for histologic and histometric analysis. RESULTS: Microscopic evaluation showed the surfaces were quite irregular for both techniques; however, the test surface demonstrated consistently smaller surface irregularities. The differences in Sa values were significant (P = .022). No significant differences were found in the maximum peak-to-valley ratio values (P = .258). X-ray diffractometry analysis showed that titanium dioxide was found on the test surface. New bone was formed on both implant surfaces. The bone-implant contact pattern appeared to produce a broad-based direct contact. Test implants demonstrated 7.13% more bone to implant contact (P = .003) and 15.42% more bone to implant contact for 3 consecutive threads (P = .001) than control implants. Test implants demonstrated 37.04% more bone area 500 microm outside of implant threads (P = .004) and 51.97% more bone area within 3 consecutive threads (P = .001) than control implants. No significant differences were found in bone area within all implant threads between the two groups (P = .069). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that implants heat-treated with H2O2/HCl solution enhanced peri-implant bone formation.",M2
19214602,"Impact of storage conditions on profilometry of eroded dental hard tissue.The aim of the present study was to analyze in how far drying of eroded dentin and enamel surfaces influence the results of profilometrical determinations with a stylus profilometer. Each five dentin and enamel samples were eroded with <e>HCl</e> (pH 2.6, 2 min). Surface profiles of the samples were recorded with a stylus profilometer in three series. In series 1, the samples were measured while stored in water and in series 2, under ambient conditions (21 degrees C, 35% humidity). In series 3, samples were completely desiccated and then rewetted. Profilometry was conducted at various time intervals for a period of up to 181 min (series 1 and 2) and 72 h (series 3). Only the dentin samples were affected by the storage conditions. Stable profilometrical readings for the eroded dentin samples were only feasible when the specimens were stored in water during the complete period of the experiment, including the profilometrical measurement. Thus, for erosion experiments using profilometrical analysis with a stylus profilometer, it is advised to store and measure dentin samples under wet conditions.",M2
19191949,"Effect of the fermentation pH on the storage stability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus preparations and suitability of in vitro analyses of cell physiological functions to predict it.AIMS: To investigate how cell physiological functions can predict the stability of freeze-dried probiotics. In addition, the effect of the fermentation pH on the stability of probiotics was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fermenter-grown (pH 5.8 or 5.0) Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells were freeze-dried and their survival was evaluated during storage at 37 degrees C, in apple juice and during acid [hydrochloric acid (<e>HCl</e>) and malic acid] and bile exposure. Cells grown at pH 5.0 were generally coping better with acid-stress than cells grown at pH 5.8. Cells were more sensitive to malic acid compared with HCl. Short-term stability results of Lact. rhamnosus cells in malic acid correlated well with the long-term stability results in apple juice, whereas the results of cell membrane integrity studies were in accordance with bile exposure results. CONCLUSIONS: Malic acid exposure can prove useful in evaluating the long-term stability of probiotic preparations in apple juice. Fermentation at reduced pH may ensure a better performance of Lact. rhamnosus cells during the subsequent acid-stress. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The beneficial effect of lowered fermentation pH to Lact. rhamnosus stability during storage in apple juice and the usefulness of malic acid test in predicting the stability were shown.",M2

19167534,"The effects of laser etching on shear bond strength at the titanium ceramic interface.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The use of titanium has increased for metal ceramic restorations, as well as for use in titanium implants, with developments in CAD/CAM technology. Some surface treatments of titanium have been introduced to enhance the titanium bond strength to low-fusing porcelains; however, a more reliable, easily used dental laboratory method has not been established. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of laser etching as a titanium surface treatment with 3 other surface treatments (machining, airborne-particle abrasion, and acid etching), evaluating their ability to enhance the bond strength between a titanium substrate and porcelain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 64 specimen rods of commercially pure titanium (ASTM grade 2, 20 mm in length and 5.7 mm in diameter) were divided into 4 experimental groups (n=16) to receive different surface treatments: machined with no treatment (MS), airborne-particle abraded with alumina particles (250 microm) (APAS), acid etched with 10% <e>HCl</e> (AES), and laser etched (LES) using a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Nd:Y(3)AL(5)O(12), or Nd/YAG). Low-fusing porcelain (Triceram) was applied (4-mm thickness) to the treated titanium surfaces and fired. Shear bond strength testing was performed in a universal testing machine. All of the data were compared using 1-way ANOVA and the post hoc multiple range Tukey test (alpha=.05). Measurement of roughness (Ra value) and SEM analysis were also performed for 1 specimen of each group before and after the shear bond strength test to evaluate the nature of the fracture surface. RESULTS: Shear bond strength values for the APAS group (22.22 (4.04) MPa) and the LES group (21.22 (3.41) MPa) were significantly greater (P&lt;.05) than for the MS group (13.76 (3.16) MPa) and the AES group (14.98 (3.26) MPa). The SEM image after debonding of MS and AES showed porcelain retained on the surface. However, there was no difference in appearance between the APAS and LES before and after debonding. CONCLUSIONS: Laser etching of titanium surfaces using an Nd/YAG laser was effective in improving bond strength with low-fusing porcelain, as compared to the acid-etching method. However, there was no significant difference between laser etching and airborne-particle-abrasion surface treatment.",M2
19143339,"Biosorption of copper ions from dilute aqueous solutions on base treated rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) leaves powder: kinetics, isotherm, and biosorption mechanisms.The efficiency of sodium hydroxide treated rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) leaves powder (NHBL) for removing copper ions from aqueous solutions has been investigated. The effects of physicochemical parameters on biosorption capacities such as stirring speed, pH, biosorbent dose, initial concentrations of copper, and ionic strength were studied. The biosorption capacities of NHBL increased with increase in pH, stirring speed and copper concentration but decreased with increase in biosorbent dose and ionic strength. The isotherm study indicated that NHBL fitted well with Langmuir model compared to Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The maximum biosorption capacity determined from Langmuir isotherm was 14.97 mg/g at 27 degrees C. The kinetic study revealed that pseudosecond order model fitted well the kinetic data, while Boyd kinetic model indicated that film diffusion was the main rate determining step in biosorption process. Based on surface area analysis, NHBL has low surface area and categorized as macroporous. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses revealed that hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino are the main functional groups involved in the binding of copper ions. Complexation was one of the main mechanisms for the removal of copper ions as indicated by FT-IR spectra. Ion exchange was another possible mechanism since the ratio of adsorbed cations (Cu2+ and H+) to the released cations (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) from NHBL was almost unity. Copper ions bound on NHBL were able to be desorbed at &gt; 99% using 0.05 mol/L <e>HCl</e>, 0.01 mol/L HNO3, and 0.01 mol/L EDTA solutions.",M2

Specimens were randomized to one of two acid treatments (n = 10): 18% hydrochloric acid (<e>HCl</e>) and pumice or 37% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and pumice. Acid treatments were applied using a wooden spatula for 5 seconds for a total of ten applications. Then, specimens were sectioned through the center of the demineralization area to obtain 80 microm thick slices. The wear produced by the microabrasion techniques was evaluated using stereomicroscopy (40 x). The greatest depth (microm) and the total surface area (microm(2)) of demineralization were measured using the Image Tool software (University of Texas Health Science, San Antonio, TX, USA). In addition, three specimens of each group were subjected to SEM analysis at different magnifications. RESULTS: The mean surface roughness was statistically lower for HCl than for H3PO4 (p &lt; 0.001). Deeper demineralization (p &lt; 0.003) and a larger total demineralization area was observed for HCl (p &lt; 0.005). Under SEM analysis H3PO4 showed a selective conditioning etching, while HCl exhibited a non-selective pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Microabrasion using H3PO4 produced greater surface roughness but less demineralization than the microabrasion technique using HCl. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Both microabrasion techniques effectively remove the superficial enamel layer. However, the technique using H3PO4 was less aggressive, safer, and easier to perform.",M2
19137975,"[Nonlinear osmotic effects in the system contained the polymeric membrane and non-homogeneous aqueous ammonia and <e>HCl</e> solutions]In this paper, the results of an experimental study of volume osmotic flows in a single membrane system, which contains horizontal, symmetrical polymeric membrane separating water and binary or ternary electrolyte solutions are presented. As binary solutions, aqueous ammonia or HCl solutions were used, whereas ammonia in 0.2 mol l(-1) or 0.3 mol l(-1) aqueous HCl solution or HCl in 0.25 mol l(-1) or HCl in 0.5 mol l(-1) aqueous ammonia solution were used as ternary solutions. The volume flux in configurations A and B of a single-membrane system in a gravitational field were studied. In configuration A, water was placed in a compartment above the membrane and the solution below the membrane. In configuration B the position of water and solution was reversed. On the basis of experimental results, the effect of amplification of volume osmotic flux of aqueous ammonia and HCl solutions in the single-membrane system was demonstrated. The results were interpreted within the convectional instability category, decreasing the thicknesses of the concentration boundary layers.",M2

The aim of this study was to evaluate dyspeptic symptoms and gastric motility induced by duodenal acidification using transnasal endoscopy. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers (mean age, 32 years) were enrolled. Transnasal endoscopy was performed on all fasting volunteers. Dyspeptic symptoms and antral contractions were evaluated before and after duodenal infusions of pure water (20 ml/min for 5 min) and acid (0.1 N <e>HCl</e>, 20 ml/min for 5 min). The severity of various symptoms was assessed by each subject using a 10-cm visual analog scale every 2 min. The maximum severity scale was calculated as the mean of the individual maximum values. The motility number was defined as the mean number of antral contractions in 1 min. RESULTS: The maximum severity score for a heavy feeling in the stomach and other symptoms significantly increased after the acid infusion compared with after the pure water infusion. During pure water infusion, there were no changes in the motility number. On the other hand, the motility number significantly decreased after duodenal acidification (before vs. after, 2.93 +/- 0.12 times vs. 1.11 +/- 0.23 times, P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal acid exposure induces dyspeptic symptoms and inhibits antral motility. Transnasal endoscopy enabled us to evaluate both dyspeptic symptoms and gastric motility simultaneously.",M2
19167465,"NaCl responsive taste cells in the mouse fungiform taste buds.Previous studies have demonstrated that rodents' chorda tympani (CT) nerve fibers responding to NaCl can be classified according to their sensitivities to the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker amiloride into two groups: amiloride-sensitive (AS) and -insensitive (AI). The AS fibers were shown to respond specifically to NaCl, whereas AI fibers broadly respond to various electrolytes, including NaCl. These data suggest that salt taste transduction in taste cells may be composed of at least two different systems; AS and AI ones. To further address this issue, we investigated the responses to NaCl, KCl and <e>HCl</e> and the amiloride sensitivity of mouse fungiform papilla taste bud cells which are innervated by the CT nerve. Comparable with the CT data, the results indicated that 56 NaCl-responsive cells tested were classified into two groups; 25 cells ( approximately 44%) narrowly responded to NaCl and their NaCl response were inhibited by amiloride (AS cells), whereas the remaining 31 cells ( approximately 56%) responded not only to NaCl, but to KCl and/or HCl and showed no amiloride inhibition of NaCl responses (AI cells). Amiloride applied to the basolateral side of taste cells had no effect on NaCl responses in the AS and AI cells. Single cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments indicated that ENaC subunit mRNA was expressed in a subset of AS cells. These findings suggest that the mouse fungiform taste bud is composed of AS and AI cells that can transmit taste information differently to their corresponding types of CT fibers, and apical ENaCs may be involved in the NaCl responses of AS cells.",M2
19165777,"Acid hydrolysis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the rapid diagnosis of serum protein biomarkers in patients with major depression.We have developed a technique combining acid hydrolysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the rapid study of the changes in the levels of positive and negative acute phase protein biomarkers in the sera of patients suffering from major depression. The serum proteins were first precipitated using an organic solvent; after separation, they were subjected to hydrochloric acid hydrolysis (6 M <e>HCl</e>) for 10 min. The resulting peptides were characterized using MALDI-TOF MS. Short-term treatment of the serum proteins with HCl efficiently removed interference from the abundant protein - albumin - and produced abundant peptide ion signals in the range of m/z 4000-10 000. This approach allowed us to rapidly detect the peptide ions originating from transferrin (a common negative acute phase protein) and fibrinogen (a common positive acute phase protein). The average ratios and (standard deviations) of the ion signals derived from transferrin/fibrinogen were 3.58 (+/-1.93) for the healthy control subjects and 1.02 (+/-0.52) for the patients suffering from major depression. The differences in transferrin/fibrinogen ratios between healthy controls and patients suggest that major depression will induce internal inflammation and cause either an increase in the level of fibrinogen or a decrease in the level of transferrin.",M2
