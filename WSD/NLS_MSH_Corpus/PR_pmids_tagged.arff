20120977,"[The University of Puerto Rico Emergency Medicine Program: 15th anniversary, its history and contribution to health care in Puerto Rico]Emergency medicine is a newly created specialty in Puerto Rico. The first training program began in 1977. Unfortunately this program was decertified by ACGME in 30 July 30 1993. On June 1, 1994 thanks to support of UPR School of Medicine new training program began. The program began using as a main clinical training site the <e>PR</e> Medical Center Emergency Room until 1995. Since that date the Hospital UPR, Dr Federico Trilla became its main clinical training site. Since its inception the program has graduated 116 emergency physicians, with more than 60% working in PR. The department's contribution to health care in Puerto Rico has been and will be based on the achievements of its faculty, residents and alumni. Approximately 25% of emergency rooms directors in PR are graduates. About 27% of graduates have subspecialties. It is also important to note that graduates of the program have helped to improve the quality of health care offered in emergency rooms in the country.",M1
19999240,"Descriptive profile of surgically-confirmed adult central nervous system tumors in Puerto Rico.INTRODUCTION: Published studies regarding the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) are exceedingly rare. The general understanding is that the incidence of these tumors in Puerto Rico is similar to the one found in the United States of America (USA). The objective of this study is to describe the specific profile of all the CNS tumors that are surgically intervened in Puerto Rico, through the creation of a database. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the surgical procedures from January 1, 2002 to May 31, 2006 for adult CNS tumors in Puerto Rico was performed. Each case was evaluated for demographic information, operative procedure, lesion description and official pathological report. Recurrent lesions were excluded. The information was organized to form a database of all the CNS neoplasms. RESULTS: A total of 1,018 procedures for CNS tumors were performed on 1,005 patients. The incidence rate of surgically intervened CNS tumors in Puerto Rico is 6 per 100,000 people. CNS tumors were more common in women than in men (58% vs. 42%), respectively. The mean age was 52.4 years. The most common histological type found was meningioma WHO I (24%), followed by pituitary adenomas (16%), and glioblastoma multiforme (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results reflect a unique histopathological distribution of operated CNS tumors in Puerto Rico. In this series, primary tumors are more common than metastatic tumors. Benign histological tumors were more frequent than more malignant variants. Although this study reflects only the histologically diagnosed tumors, it is headway towards diagnosing the incidence of all CNS tumors in Puerto Rico.",M1
19999237,"Outcome of liver transplantation in a Hispanic population: 100 liver transplants in Puerto Ricans.BACKGROUND: The residents of Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) had limited access to liver transplantation (LTx) prior to 1996. LTx remains locally unavailable and success rates for LTx for patients from PR have never been published. The outcome of the first 100 LTx recipients from PR transplanted at our center is analyzed. METHODS: 100 consecutive patients transplanted between 3/1997 and 1/2005 were evaluated. RESULTS: Hepatitis C was the indication for LTx in 44%. Overall patient survival at 1, 3 and 5 yrs was: 94.0%, 81.4% and 75.7%, respectively, while for hepatitis C, it was 90%, 73% and 73%, respectively. At mean follow up of 44 mo., 80% of patients were alive (66% HCV were alive vs 91% non HCV, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Access to LTx in Puerto Rico has dramatically improved since 1996. The government-sponsored fund has provided access to indigent patients. Decreased survival in this minority population was not observed at 1, 3 and 5 years. Long-term survival was most affected by recurrence of HCV.",M1
19965886,"Epidemic dynamics revealed in dengue evolution.Dengue is an emerging tropical disease infecting tens of millions of people annually. A febrile illness with potentially severe hemorrhagic manifestations, dengue is caused by mosquito-borne viruses (DENV-1 to -4) that are maintained in endemic transmission in large urban centers of the tropics with periodic epidemic cycles at 3- to 5-year intervals. Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>), a major population center in the Caribbean, has experienced increasingly severe epidemics since multiple dengue serotypes were introduced beginning in the late 1970s. We document the phylodynamics of DENV-4 between 1981 and 1998, a period of dramatic ecological expansion during which evolutionary change also occurs. The timescale of viral evolution is sufficiently short that viral transmission dynamics can be elucidated from genetic diversity data. Specifically, by combining virus sequence data with confirmed case counts in PR over these two decades, we show that the pattern of cyclic epidemics is strongly correlated with coalescent estimates of effective population size that have been estimated from sampled virus sequences using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we show that the observed epidemiologic dynamics are correlated with similar fluctuations in diversity, including severe interepidemic reductions in genetic diversity compatible with population bottlenecks that may greatly impact DENV evolutionary dynamics. Mean effective population sizes based on genetic data appear to increase prior to isolation counts, suggesting a potential bias in the latter and justifying more active surveillance of DENV activity. Our analysis explicitly integrates epidemiologic and sequence data in a joint model that could be used to further explore transmission models of infectious disease.",M1
19954094,"Obesity prevalence odds ratios in four Puerto Rican towns: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Obesity is a major public health problem associated with major mortality causes. It is the second leading cause of preventable diseases in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>). The purpose of the study is to estimate the Obesity Prevalence Odds Ratios in Four Puerto Rican Towns. Obesity prevalence in PR has been estimated by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2005 (23%) for both sexes. The obesity estimation of the BRFSS was used in order to relate it with our sample and compare results. METHOD: This is a descriptive-observational cross sectional study, based on a sample of 801 subjects selected from four major Puerto Rican municipalities (Loiza, Rio Grande, Luquillo and Canovanas). A valid questionnaire with main questions to obtain health/nutrition and sociodemographic information were administered. An obesity prevalence odds ratio (OPOR) was calculated. RESULTS: The obesity prevalence of the whole sample under study was higher (mean prevalence rate 42%) than the reported prevalence rate in the 2005 BRFSS. Canóvanas have the highest obesity prevalence (49%) followed by Loiza (41 %), Rio Grande (39 %) and Luquillo (37 %). Luquillo and Canovanas are the areas with higher possibility for obesity taking into consideration waist circumference as a risk factor for obesity (OPOR= 1.49 and 1.36, respectively; 95% CI). CONCLUSIONS: The sample under study has a higher OPOR as related to the BRFSS. These individuals may have a higher risk for chronic diseases associate to obesity. Future studies needs to address lifestyle prevention modifications and socioeconomic disparities in addition to evaluate intervention(s) that modify environmental factors in order to prevent obesity.",M1
19788409,"Prevalence of urinary incontinence and its association with body mass index among women in Puerto Rico.OBJECTIVE: Urinary incontinence (UI) affects the quality of life of millions of women world-wide. Prevalence estimates for UI range from 10% to 40%, but information on young and mid-life women, especially among Hispanics, is limited. This study estimated UI prevalence and its association with body mass index (BMI) in a population-based sample of 276 female residents of Bayamón, Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) aged 21-64 years. METHODS: A cluster sampling design was employed. Women were interviewed to gather data on sociodemographic, clinical, gynecologic, and UI characteristics. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample. Bivariate analyses of factors potentially associated with UI and BMI were conducted using generalized linear models (GLM). Multivariate GLM was used to determine the covariate adjusted association between BMI and UI. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI was 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.4-40.6%). Among women with UI, stress incontinence was most frequent (46.8%), followed by mixed (41.5%) and urge incontinence (11.7%). More than 45% of participants were either overweight (25 kg/m(2) &lt;or= BMI &lt;or= 29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI &gt;or= 30 kg/m(2)). The adjusted analysis revealed that women with a BMI &gt;or= 30 kg/m(2) had 1.96 (p = 0.06) times the probability of having UI compared to women with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: UI is a public health problem among this population, and obesity marginally increases the possibility of having this condition. Public health efforts should focus on reducing obesity in PR, in order to have an impact on UI morbidity.",M1
19672958,"Beliefs and barriers to medication use in parents of Latino children with asthma.OBJECTIVE: Disparities in asthma outcomes exist between Latino and non-Latino white (NLW) children. We examined rates of medication use, medication beliefs, and perceived barriers to obtaining medication in US and island Puerto Rican parents of children with asthma. HYPOTHESES: Island <e>PR</e> parents would report the lowest rates of controller medication use, followed by RI Latino and RI NLW parents; Latino parents would report more medication concerns than NLW parents; and Island PR parents would report the most barriers to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred thirty families of children with persistent asthma participated, including 231 Island PR, 111 RI NLW, and 188 RI Latino. Parents completed survey measures. RESULTS: Group differences were found on reported use of ICS (X(2) = 50.96, P &lt; 0.001), any controller medication (X(2) = 56.49, P &lt; 0.001), and oral steroids (X(2) = 10.87, P &lt; 0.01). Island PR parents reported a greater frequency of barriers to medication use than the other two groups (X(2) = 61.13, P &lt; 0.001). Latino parents in both sites expressed more medication concerns than NLW parents (F = 20.18, P &lt; 0.001). Medication necessity was associated with ICS use in all three groups (all P's &lt; 0.01). Medication concerns were positively associated with ICS use in PR only (OR = 1.64, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in medication beliefs and the ability to obtain medications may explain the reported disparity in controller medication use. Further studies are needed to evaluate these obstacles to medication use.",M1
19530551,"Survival of hepatocellular carcinoma in Puerto Rico.BACKGROUND: Blacks and Hispanics in the United States (US) have the lowest survival rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mainly associated to the presence of advanced disease at diagnosis when intervention is least beneficial. This study compared the survival distribution and relative survival of HCC in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) during 1988-1992 and 1998-2002. METHODS: All HCC cases in the PR Central Cancer Registry database for 1988-1992 (n = 306) and 1998-2002 (n = 333) were identified. Patient characteristics and clinical variables were compared between study periods. Survival by age at diagnosis, sex, tumor stage and treatment was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the Wilcoxon test. A Cox proportional hazards model was employed to assess the effect of period of diagnosis on survival, after adjusting for confounders. One- and three-year survival rates were also calculated. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed during 1998-2002 (median: 3.08 months, 95% CI: 2.30-4.16) had a longer observed survival than those diagnosed from 1988-1992 (median: 1.80 months, 95% CI: 1.44-2.52). A significant interaction was observed between the variables age and period of diagnosis, where only among persons aged &gt; or = 60 years the risk of HCC death was lower (sex-adjusted HR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59-0.88) in patients diagnosed during 1998-2002 as compared to those diagnosed during 1988-1992. The overall one- and three-year relative survival during 1998-2002 was approximately 6% (22.4% vs. 16.6%) and 2% higher (9.0% vs. 6.7%) respectively, as compared to 1988-1992. CONCLUSION: We observed a temporal improvement in the survival of HCC in PR during the last decade. However, this survival is inferior to the one observed in the US population. Further studies are needed to identify factors that explain these disparities.",M1
19402167,"Incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer in Puerto Rico and among Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks in the United States, 1998-2002.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>). In the United States, the incidence and mortality rates of CRC have great variation by sex and race/ethnicity. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of CRC in PR were assessed and compared with the rates among US Hispanics (USH), non-Hispanic whites (NHW), and non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) in the United States for the period from 1998 through 2002. Incidence and mortality trends and relative differences among racial/ethnic groups by sex and age were determined. METHODS: Age-standardized rates using the world standard population (ASR[World]) were based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the PR Central Cancer Registry and from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program using the direct method. The annual percentage changes (APC) and relative risks (RR) were calculated using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: During 1998 through 2002, the APC of CRC incidence and mortality increased for men in PR, whereas descending trends were observed for other racial/ethnic groups. Overall period rates indicated that, in both sexes, Puerto Ricans had CRC incidence and mortality rates similar to those for USH, but their rates were lower than those for NHW and NHB. However, Puerto Rican men and women ages 40 years to 59 years had the greatest risk of incidence and mortality compared with their USH counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Areas of concern include the increasing trends of CRC in PR and the higher burden of the disease among young Puerto Ricans compared with the USH population. The authors concluded that further research should be performed to guide the design and implementation of CRC prevention and education programs in PR.",M1
19400958,"Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of oral and pharyngeal cancer in Puerto Rico and among Non-Hispanics Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics in the USA.BACKGROUND: In the American region, Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) has the highest incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC), but racial/ethnic differences have never been assessed and compared with other groups in the United States of America (USA). We compared the age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates of OPC between PR and among USA Hispanics (USH), Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), and Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) to assess the burden of this cancer in PR. METHODS: Analysis of the age-standardized rates (per 100,000) was performed using the direct method with the world standard population (ASR(World)) from 1998-2002. Annual percent change (APC) and Relative Risks (RR) were calculated using the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: The incidence ASR(World) for men in PR was constant (APC approximately 0.0%), in contrast, a decrease was observed among NHW, NHB, and USH men, although only USH showed statistical significance (APC = -4.9%, p &lt; 0.05). In women, the highest increase in incidence (APC = 5.3%) and the lowest decrease in mortality (APC = -1.4%) was observed in PR. The ratio of the ASR(World) showed that in all racial/ethnic groups, men had approximately 2-4 fold increased incidence and mortality risk of OPC than women (p &lt; 0.05). Men in PR had a higher mortality risk (p &lt; 0.05) of OPC as compared to USH, NHW, and NHB; but among women, PR showed a significant excess of mortality only as compared to USH (est. SRR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.41, 2.33). CONCLUSION: The overall higher incidence of OPC in men in PR as compared to USH, NHB, and NHW could be explained by the effect of gene-environment interactions. Meanwhile, the higher mortality from OPC in PR suggests limitations in the health-care access within this population. Further research is warranted to elucidate these findings.",M1
19343529,"Seroprevalence estimation and management factors associated with high herd seropositivity for Babesia bovis in commercial dairy farms of Puerto Rico.A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine individual cow seroprevalence of Babesia bovis in adult lactating dairy cattle of Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>), to assess the associations of farm management factors on herd seroprevalence, and to document the species of ticks infesting cattle within these farms. Antibody activity against B. bovis was determined using an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Serum samples were obtained from 2,414 adult lactating dairy cattle from 76 randomly selected commercial dairy farms. Herd seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 51% with an overall individual cow seroprevalence for B. bovis of 26%. Ticks were collected from animals on 7 (9%) of the 76 participating commercial dairy farms. All collected ticks (n = 87) were Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Factors associated with high herd seropositivity were dairy farms with calf but not heifer raising facilities (OR = 16, 95% CI = 3.0-86), having more than 4 neighbors with cattle (OR = 17, 95% CI = 1.6-178), same producer owning more than one farm (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 1.6-32), and use of government services to apply amitraz on cattle (OR = 5.5, 95% CI = 1.5-20).",M1
19337849,"Seroprevalence estimation and management factors associated with high herd seropositivity for Anaplasma marginale in commercial dairy farms of Puerto Rico.A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine individual cow seroprevalence of Anaplasma marginale in adult lactating dairy cattle of Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) and to assess the associations of farm management factors on herd seroprevalence. Antibody activity against A. marginale was determined using the MSP-5 competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum samples were obtained from 2,414 adult lactating dairy cattle from 76 randomly selected commercial dairy farms. Herd seroprevalence ranged from 3 to 100% with an overall individual cow seroprevalence for A. marginale of 27.4%. Factors associated with high herd seropositivity were pasture grazing as the main feed source (OR = 6.5, 95% CI = 1.2-34), observed monkeys on the premises (OR = 13, 95% CI = 1.2-138), use of 11% permethrin (OR = 17, 95% CI = 2.2-129), farmers who attended an acaricide certification program (OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.04-0.74), and lack of a fly control program (OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.3-24).",M1
19250772,"A deficit in biopsying potentially premalignant oral lesions in Puerto Rico.BACKGROUND: Intraoral lesions clinically suspicious for cancer/precancer should be biopsied and diagnosed histopathologically. We evaluated whether the frequency of oral cancer (OC) cases diagnosed in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) is disproportionately high relative to the frequency of persons with histopathologic diagnoses that would have appeared clinically suspicious for OC/precancer at biopsy. METHODS: All pathology reports for oral (ICD-O-3 C01-C06) soft tissue biopsies generated during 1/2004-5/2005 by seven PR and two New York City (NYC) pathology laboratories were reviewed. The analysis was restricted to persons diagnosed with invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), epithelial dysplasia, or hyperkeratosis/epithelial hyperplasia (HK/EH), i.e., diagnoses associated with lesions clinically suspicious for OC/precancer. The OC relative frequency measured the percentage of persons diagnosed with OSCC among persons with OSCC, dysplasia, or HK/EH. OC relative frequencies for PR and NYC laboratories were compared. RESULTS: Overall, the OC relative frequency was 67% in PR and 40% and 4% in the NYC general and oral pathology laboratories, respectively (each p&lt;0.001). In PR, the OC relative frequency was highest for males (80%). When OC relative frequencies were stratified by pathology laboratory type (general/oral) and compared across PR and NYC, age/gender-specific OC relative frequencies were always higher in PR; however, differences were consistently statistically significant for males only. CONCLUSION: A disparity in the OC relative frequency exists in PR vs. NYC indicating a shortfall in biopsying potentially precancerous oral lesions in PR. PR residents with intraoral lesions suspicious for oral cancer/precancer are most likely to be biopsied only after developing an invasive OC.",M1
19227709,"Management and outcome of transient ischemic attacks in Ponce, Puerto Rico.BACKGROUND: Approximately 240,000 transient ischemic attacks (TIA's) are diagnosed every year in U.S.A. Recent studies have shown that 4-20% will have a stroke within 90 days after a TIA, half in 2 days. OBJECTIVES: To determine morbidity and assess outcome at 72 hours of patients with TIA's arriving at the Emergency Room (ER) of San Lucas Hospital, Ponce, <e>PR</e>. METHODOLOGY: Medical records of all patients evaluated at ER in 2006 with neurological symptoms for &lt; 24 hours, and outcome for next 72 hrs were reviewed. Anticoagulation given and timeframe between initial symptoms and diagnostic neurologic workup was also recorded. RESULTS: 53/182 records reviewed met inclusion criteria. 45% males, 55% females, median age of 62 years (Range 53-90). All received antithrombotic drugs at ER. Head-CT performed upon arrival in 100%, only 57% of Echocardiograms and Carotid-Doppler done in 24 hrs. CONCLUSION: No patients developed stroke or death related to TIA in 72 hours.",M1
18756648,"University of Puerto Rico Emergency Medicine Program: impact throughout the country.OBJECTIVES: Determine distribution, job description, and board certification status of the University of Puerto Rico Emergency Medicine Program (UPREMP) graduates. METHODS: A telephone survey was performed of all UPREMP graduates from 1995 to 2007, asking for the following information: practitioner or non practitioner, working place, job description (e.g. Fellow, Staff or Emergency Room Directors), and board certification status. In cases in which the person could not be reached by phone, the last information available at the UPREMRP department was used to fill the survey. The board certification was verified using The American Board of Medical Specialties web site. Worksheets were used to organize data and then analyzed statistically with Excel 2003. RESULTS: Of the 102 graduates, 59% are males and 41% are women, 50% are board certified, 30% are not and 20% are pending certification. Of the female graduates, 77% are board certified, while only 60% of male graduates are board certified. Sixty percent (60%) of the graduates stayed in Puerto Rico and 40% moved to the United States. The distribution of graduates among <e>PR</e> senatorial districts (counties) was as follows: San Juan 22%, Bayamón 17%, Arecibo 0%, Mayagüez 5%, Ponce, 23%, Guayama 6%, Humacao 12% and Carolina 20%. The job description among graduates was: 54% full time Emergency Department (ED) Staff, 3% part time ED staff, 23% academic faculty, 10% directors, 5% fellows and 5% other. CONCLUSION: From our study, we can conclude that although the vast majority of UPREMP graduates stay in PR after graduation, most of them practice in four of the eight PR senatorial districts. Further studies are needed to determine: the reasons why graduates have moved to the mainland US and for working mostly in four PR senatorial districts.",M1
18712603,"Understanding the barriers that reduce the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention strategies for Puerto Rican women living in low-income households in Ponce, <e>PR</e>: a qualitative study.BACKGROUND: The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been strongly felt in Hispanic/Latino communities. Estimates of AIDS prevalence among Latinos in the US reveal that just nine States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico account for 89% of the Latinos living with AIDS in 2004. Previous research reveals social and cultural factors play an important role in HIV prevention. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted, with 39 women, ages 21-67, participating in the discussions. The objectives of this research were to assess knowledge regarding HIV transmission among women living in low-income households, to ascertain barriers to safe sex in this population, and to elicit opinions about effective prevention strategies. RESULTS: Our results suggest that participants recognized HIV/AIDS modes of transmission and risk behaviors, as well as their barriers to practicing safe sex. They identified promiscuity, unprotected sex, infidelity, drug and alcohol use, and sharing syringes as behaviors which would place them at risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. They specifically identified lack of negotiating skills, fear of sexual violence, partner refusal to use condoms, and lack of control over their partner's sexual behavior as barriers to practicing safe sex. Finally results also indicate that current HIV/AIDS prevention strategies in Puerto Rico are inadequate for these women. DISCUSSION: To address these issues the authors suggest cultural and social factors to be considered for the development of more effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs.",M1
18646357,"Concerns about HIV and sexually transmitted infection among low-risk and high-risk women, Puerto Rico.In this study, the RESPECT-2, an HIV risk reduction intervention developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was translated into Spanish and culturally adapted to the Puerto Rican population. A new intervention emerged called the RReduC-<e>PR</e> (Risk Reduction Counseling-Puerto Rico). This instrument allows the assessment of sexual behaviors and development of risk reduction plans. Women from three distinct risk behavior groups participated: women recruited from a community-based organization (CBO), which includes street sex workers, crack users, and sexual partners of intravenous drug users; participants from a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic; and participants from a family planning clinic (FPC) in Puerto Rico. As part of the RReduC-PR, participants were provided counseling before and after a rapid HIV test to explore their attitudes about sexual behaviors. At baseline, all participants from the FPC reported having monogamous relationships (100%), as compared with the participants from the STI clinic (70%) and those from the CBO (20%). STI risk-reduction behaviors varied by site. Most of the participants acknowledged risk behaviors that may have exposed them to HIV. They did not use condoms, or used them inconsistently, even though acquiring HIV was a great concern for them. Most regarded a positive HIV diagnosis as a negative event. Their attitudes toward an HIV diagnosis varied by site. The groups varied in the perception of risk behaviors, knowledge, and concerns. These findings provide useful information for future risk-reduction interventions with these women.",M1
18415827,"Latino caregivers' beliefs about asthma: causes, symptoms, and practices.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study examined belief systems of Latino caregivers who have children with asthma from Puerto Rican and Dominican backgrounds who resided on the Island of <e>PR</e> and the Mainland. The goal of this study was to document similarities and differences in beliefs about the causes, symptoms, and treatments of asthma across two sites and two Latino ethnic sub-groups of children who remain the most at risk for asthma morbidity. METHODS: Participants included 100 primary caregivers of a child with asthma; 50 caregivers from Island PR and 50 caregivers from mainland RI were interviewed (at each site; 25 caregivers were from Puerto Rican backgrounds and 25 caregivers were from Dominican backgrounds). The interview included an assessment of demographic information and beliefs about the causes and symptoms of asthma and asthma practices. RESULTS: Results indicated more similarities in beliefs about the causes and symptoms of asthma across site and ethnic group. The majority of differences were among beliefs about asthma practices by site and ethnic group. For example, a higher proportion of caregivers from Island PR, particularly those of Dominican descent, endorsed that a range of home and botanical remedies are effective for treating asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study point to several interesting directions for future research including larger samples of Latino caregivers with children who have asthma. A discussion of the importance of understanding cultural beliefs about asthma and asthma practices is also reviewed.",M1
18400061,"Culture and psychiatric symptoms in Puerto Rican children: longitudinal results from one ethnic group in two contexts.BACKGROUND: The development of youth psychopathology may be associated with direct and continuous contact with a different culture (acculturation) and to distress related to this process (cultural stress). We examine cultural experiences of Puerto Rican families in relation to youth psychiatric symptoms in two different contexts: one in which migrant Puerto Ricans reside on the mainland as an ethnic minority and another in which they reside in their place of origin. METHODS: Sample: Probability samples of 10- to 13-year-old youth of Puerto Rican background living in the South Bronx, New York City (SB) and in the San Juan Metropolitan area in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) (N = 1,271) were followed over time. measures: Three assessments of internalizing psychiatric symptoms (elicited through the DISC-IV) and of antisocial behaviors (ASB) quantified through a six-point index were carried out. Independent variables included scales of adult and child acculturation and cultural stress, and other putative correlates. Data analysis: Within each study site, multilevel linear regression models were examined. RESULTS: Parental acculturation was associated with ASB in youth at both sites, but youth acculturation itself was not related to psychiatric symptoms. At both contexts, cultural stress was a more consistent correlate of youth psychiatric symptoms than acculturation after controlling for nativity, maternal education, child gender, stressful life events and parental psychopathology. However, the strength of the youth cultural stress association decreased over time. CONCLUSION: The association between cultural factors and child psychiatric symptoms is not restricted to contexts where an ethnic group is a minority.",M1
18390162,"[Bacterial diversity in a fluidized bed bioreactor (FBR) treating gasoline-contaminated groundwater]Bacterial diversity in a fluidized bed bioreactor (FBR) treating gasoline-contaminated groundwater. The main objective of this research project was to determine the bacterial diversity during the process of bioremediation of water contaminated with gasoline in a fluidized bed reactor at Mayagüez, <e>PR</e>. Isolation and characterization of bacterial populations from the bioremediation system was performed on R2A medium. Morphological tests included cellular and colonial shape and reaction to Gram coloration. Physiological properties were determined by using carbon utilization profiles (Biolog) and by the ability of axenic cultures to use gasoline as the sole carbon source. Molecular characterization was performed by BOX-PCR and 16S rDNA sequence analysis (ARDRA). From a total of 162 distinctive isolates, 75% were gram-negative bacilli, 19% gram-positive bacilli, 5% gram-negative cocci and 1% gram-positive cocci. The 162 axenic cultures corresponded to 90 different genetic groups; 53% of which included strains with growth in gasoline as sole carbon source. The 86 strains capable of growing in gasoline corresponded to 52 different amplification patterns in BOX-PCR; which were not metabolically related (Biolog system). The high degree of microbial diversity in the FBR allowed efficient and stable hydrocarbon removal throughout the operation of the system.",M1
18224443,"Signal transduction proteins in tumors from Puerto Rican and Caucasian gastric adenocarcinoma patients: expression differences with potential for specific targeted therapies.Overexpression of the HER2/NEU gene is associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis in breast cancer, making the Her2/neu protein a directed-therapy target. Tumors of two Puerto Rican (<e>PR</e>) patients overexpressed Her2/neu and resulting partial clinical responses motivated us to compare Her2/neu expression in PR (n = 101) and Caucasian non-Hispanic (n = 95) patients. Immunohistochemistry of tumors showed overexpression of p-Stat3, Cyclin D1, and Her2/neu, compared to non-neoplastic mucosa. Her2/neu and EGF-R protein levels were statistically significantly different with higher levels of both proteins in the PR group. Importantly, Her2/neu expression was strong and diffuse in tumors with signet-ring morphology, while other histo-pathological subtypes showed higher intra-tumoral Her2/neu heterogeneity than typically observed in breast cancer. Targeted therapies in gastric cancer directed at EGF-R and Hers-2/neu pathways warrant further investigation. These therapies may be especially effective in PR patients and in patients with signet-ring cell morphologies with a dismal prognosis.",M1
17913117,"Willingness of minorities to participate in biomedical studies: confirmatory findings from a follow-up study using the Tuskegee Legacy Project Questionnaire.OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this analysis were to compare the self-reported willingness of blacks, Puerto-Rican Hispanics and whites to participate as research subjects in biomedical studies, and to determine the reliability of the Tuskegee Legacy Project Questionnaire (TLP). METHODS: The TLP Questionnaire, initially used in a four-city study in 1999-2000, was administered in a follow-up study within a random-digit-dial telephone survey to a stratified random sample of adults in three different U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD; New York City; and San Juan, <e>PR</e>. The questionnaire, a 60-item instrument, contains two validated scales: the Likelihood of Participation (LOP) Scale and the Guinea Pig Fear Factor (GPFF) Scale. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, education, income and city, the LOP Scale was not statistically significantly different for the racial/ethnic groups (ANCOVA, p=87). The GPFF Scale was statistically significantly higher for blacks and Hispanics as compared to whites (adjusted ANCOVA, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The of the findings from the current three-city study, as well as from our prior four-city study, are remarkably similar and reinforce the conclusion that blacks and Hispanics self-report that, despite having a higher fear of participation, they are just as likely as whites to participate in biomedical research.",M1
17722428,"Prevalence of hemochromatosis in the Puerto Rico veteran population.BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of iron storage that results in iron overload. It's prevalence in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) is unknown and the condition frequently undiagnosed. PURPOSE: Determine the prevalence of HH in the PR Veteran population. METHODS: Patients attending the San Juan VA Medical Center Laboratory for routine tests were invited to participate. Basic demographic data, symptoms related questionnaire, fasting samples for unbound iron binding capacity (UIBC) and serum iron were obtained. Transferrin saturation (TS) &gt; or =45% was considered as iron overload. Patients with elevated TS had a second test done to confirm iron overload. Genetic testing was performed to patients with sustained elevated TS. RESULTS: Data from 521 of the 559 recruited patients was available for analysis. 59 patients had TS &gt; or =45%. Iron overload was confirmed in eleven patients. Two patients were lost to follow up; one had secondary causes for iron overload. Eight patients underwent genetic testing. Genetic mutations associated with hemochromatosis were found in four patients. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of confirmed iron overload in our population is 2%, similar to one in the United States, while the prevalence of genetic mutations associated to hemochromatosis is 0.76%, which is slightly higher. Both genetic mutations (C282Y, H63D) are equally seen in the evaluated population which is different from reports elsewhere. Physician awareness of the prevalence of HH in PR may result in increased screening and early identification of the condition.",M1
17640160,"Protein and legume intake and prostate cancer mortality in Puerto Rican men.Prostate cancer is the number 1 cancer killer among Puerto Rican (<e>PR</e>) men. Plant foods have been inversely associated with prostate cancer. Legumes play a significant role in the PR diet; consumption of legumes in PR (14 lb/capita) was double that of the United States (7 lb/capita). We examined dietary protein consumption (from baseline 24-h dietary recalls) and prostate cancer mortality in the PR Heart Health Program, a cohort study of 9,824 men aged 35-79 years at baseline (1964) with follow-up until 2005. Total protein intake in the cohort was 85 g/day, and sources of protein were 30% vegetable, 30% dairy, 31% animal, and 8% seafood protein. Legume intake was 2.3 servings/day (1/4 cup each). Legume intake was not associated with prostate cancer mortality [comparing highest quartile to lowest quartile-odds ratio (OR) 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-2.18], P trend 0.17]-nor were total protein, animal, seafood, dairy, or vegetable protein intakes. Consuming 1-2 servings of fruit was inversely associated (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.77), whereas consuming more than 2 servings of fruit was not associated with prostate cancer mortality. Thus, we find no association between legumes or protein intake and prostate cancer mortality in this longitudinal cohort study of PR men.",M1
17534012,"Cancer screening participation: comparative willingness of San Juan Puerto Ricans versus New York City Puerto Ricans.OBJECTIVES: The specific aim of this study was to determine the self-reported likelihood of New York Puerto Ricans (NYPR) and San Juan Puerto Ricans (SJPR) to participate in: 10 site-specific cancer screenings, cancer-screenings conducted by different specific persons/agencies and cancer-screening under specific conditions of what one was asked to do as a part of cancer screening. METHODS: The Cancer Screening Questionnaire (CSQ) was administered via random-digit-dial telephone interviews to 154 adults living in San Juan, <e>PR</e> and 155 in New York, NY. RESULTS: Although the self-reported willingness to participate across the 10 site-specific cancer screening exams was consistently high in both cities, SJPR had higher rates, as compared to NYPR for all 10 site-specific cancer screening exams in the unadjusted analyses. A similar pattern was observed regarding the influence of both  who conducts the cancer-screening exam  and  what one is asked to do in a cancer-screening exam  as factors in the willingness to participate in such exams. Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that the odds of SJPR participating in skin cancer screening as compared to NYPR, were three-fold higher to participate in skin cancer screening and were two-fold higher to participate in a cancer screening where they have to be interviewed about their alcohol habits. These two observed differences might reflect the effect of acculturation in the NYPR.",M1

Over 1,200 Puerto Rican injection drug users (IDUs) and crack smokers were recruited by outreach workers in NY and PR; interview data included questions on mobility (lifetime residences and recent trips). Two-thirds of the NY sample had lived in PR; one-quarter of the PR sample had lived in NY; the most commonly sited reasons for moving were family-related. Fewer than 10% had visited the other location in the prior 3 years. Variables related to risk were number of moves, recent travel, and having used drugs in PR (all with p &lt; 0.05). Implications included the need to enhance risk reduction efforts for IDUs in PR and address sexual risk among mobile drug users.",M1
17061496,"Surface morphology and characteristics of hemocytes of Biomphalaria glabrata (Pulmonata: Planorbidae) from two geographic sources.Biomphalaria glabrata is a fresh water snail of medical importance since it is the intermediate host of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni. The internal defense system of mollusks is mostly represented by circulating elements of the hemolymph (hemocytes). The infectivity of S. mansoni to B. glabrata is determined by genetic factors and evolutionary adaptations. In the present work factors about the parasite/snail relationship were evaluated, especially those related to the morphology and characteristics of the surface of cells present in the hemolymph of two strains of B. glabrata: a strain with high susceptibility to S. mansoni (Puerto Rico, <e>PR</e>) and a strain with medium susceptibility (Caripe, Ca). Hemolymph was collected by cephalopodal puncture; a total and a differential count of hemocytes were done in dyed preparations and through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results from both strains show a high quantitative variability of the total hemocyte count. Hemocytes dyed with May-Grünwald Giemsa showed cells with a basophilic nucleus predominantly in PR (61.7%), dense and strongly basophilic in Ca (71.2%) with significant differences between them. Through SEM round cells with a corrugated surface were observed (6-10microm), hemocytes with an irregular spongy surface (12microm), others with many projections (16microm) and cells not reported in similar to erythrocytes (21microm). Hemocytic cells from both strains confirmed cytoadherence and encapsulation were confirmed in the hemocytic cells from both strains, while no differences associated to the susceptibility of the strains were observed after 2 h of parasite-hemocyte incubation.",M1
17050228,"Childhood asthma prevalence in northern Puerto Rico, the Rio Grande, and Loíza experience.OBJECTIVE: Childhood asthma is highly prevalent in some areas of Puerto Rico. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of asthma in two municipalities of Northern Puerto Rico. METHODS: Children 6 to 7 and 13 to 14 years of age participated in the school-based cross-sectional study. RESULTS: A total of 1,467 elementary school students and 1,334 junior-high school students were included in the survey. A high prevalence of asthma was observed; 46% in elementary schools and 24% in junior-high schools. In elementary schools, family history of asthma (FHA) was associated with ever wheezed (<e>PR</e> = 2.00, 95%CI 1.59, 2.52), wheeze during last year (PR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.54, 2.62), and asthma (PR = 2.33, 95%CI 1.86, 2.92). For junior-high schools FHA was associated with ever wheezed (PR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.56, 2.57), wheeze during previous year (PR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.47, 2.73), and asthma (PR = 2.72, 95%CI 2.06, 3.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of asthma and related symptoms in Northern Puerto Rico. FHA was strongly associated with asthma and its symptoms. Further research is recommended to look at genetics, sensitivity levels, indoor and outdoor pollution, and gene-environment interactions.",M1
16977494,"A comparative study of mortality among Puerto Rican injection drug users in East Harlem, New York, and Bayamon, Puerto Rico.Drug users have been found to be at high risk of mortality but the mortality experience of Hispanic drug users remains understudied. This study assessed mortality among Puerto Rican injection drug users (IDUs) in New York City (NY), and in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>). Study subjects were 637 IDUs from NY and 319 IDUs from PR. Mortality was ascertained using data from the National Death Index. Annual mortality rate of the NY cohort was 1.3 per 100 person years compared to the PR cohort with a rate of 4.8. Compared to the Hispanic population of New York City, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the NY cohort was 4.4. Compared to the population of Puerto Rico, the SMR of the PR cohort was 16.2. The four principal causes of death were: NY-HIV/AIDS (50.0%), drug overdoses (13.3%), cardiovascular conditions (13.3%), and pulmonary conditions (10.0%); PR-HIV/AIDS (37.0%), drug overdoses (24.1%), sepsis (13.0%), and homicide (11.1%). Modeling time to death using Cox proportional hazards regression, the relative risk of mortality of the PR cohort as compared to the NY cohort was 9.2. The other covariates found to be significantly associated with time to death were age, gender, education, social isolation, intoxication with alcohol, and HIV seropositivity. The large disparity in mortality rates found in this study suggests that health disparities research should be expanded to identify intra-group disparities. Furthermore, these results point to an urgent need to reduce excess mortality among IDUs in Puerto Rico.",M1
16929586,"A government sponsored clinic for the evaluation and treatment of chronic hepatitis C in an underinsured population in Puerto Rico.BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major health problem in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>). More than 50% of the population is insured by a government-sponsored managed care system that does not cover treatment for CHC. Lack of access to treatment will result in an increase in end-stage liver disease with its high socioeconomic impact in the future. In an attempt to identify strategies for the treatment of CHC in the publicly insured population, the PR Health Department and the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Gastroenterology (GI) Division have developed a pilot clinic for the evaluation and treatment of CHC. METHODS: UPR and the PR Health Department negotiated a fee per patient to include all medical care and follow-up laboratories. Viral studies were covered by a grant to the Health Department. Medications were bought at a discount price by the government and dispensed at a government pharmacy. The Health Department allocated funds for 200 patients with government insurance. A dedicated clinic was established at the UPR, staffed by an internist under the supervision of the GI faculty. Patients with a positive HCVab were referred to this clinic. The public insurance covered the CBC, liver tests, metabolic panel, TSH, HBsAg, HIV, ultrasound and liver biopsy, which were required prior to evaluation for possible treatment. In the initial visit, patients underwent a medical evaluation, including assessment of suitability for therapy and counseling. Those deemed to be candidates who still needed a liver biopsy had it performed by the GI staff. Genotype and viral titers were ordered after the decision on treatment had been made. The clinic physician prescribed pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which were dispensed by the government pharmacy. Instruction on proper drug administration was given. Clinic visits were scheduled for 1, 3, 6 and 12 months but also allowed on demand. Laboratory tests were done at the clinic and reviewed by the physician expediently to monitor for toxicity. Any medical problems or treatment for complications of therapy were covered by the primary insurer. Viral load was repeated at 12 weeks to discontinue therapy in those unlikely to respond. The budget per patient for medical visits and laboratory tests was dollars 1,500.00, HCV RNA titers plus genotype costs dollars 200.00, and HCV qualitative RNA costs dollars 123.00 RESULTS: 405 patients have been referred between February 2002 and April 2003 (the number was increased at adjust for no-shows and those not treated). 30% are female, the major risk factor is IVDU, and 80% are unemployed. 101 have started treatment and 48 are awaiting biopsy. A support group has been established at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment for CHC in practice is not only costly but also resource consuming. Most gastroenterologists in our community refer these patients for treatment. The establishment of a dedicated clinic with a primary physician supervised by the specialists reduces costs and facilitates caring for a larger number of patients. The volume of services allows for negotiation of medical, laboratory and drug costs. In allocating funds for this project, the PR Health Department recognized the importance in reducing the potential spread in the community by treating infected patients as well as reducing the future medical and socioeconomic burden of end-stage liver disease. Although the outcome of this project is still unseen, we believe that this model may serve to establish other clinics for the treatment of CHC at lower costs with the same effectiveness.",M1
16861181,"A longitudinal study of syringe acquisition by Puerto Rican injection drug users in New York and Puerto Rico: implications for syringe exchange and distribution programs.Increasing access to sterile syringes and new drug preparation materials is an effective means of reducing HIV transmission among injection drug users (IDUs), and a fundamental component of harm reduction ideology. The purpose of this study is to examine changes during a three-year period in syringe acquisition by street-recruited Puerto Rican IDUs characterized by frequent drug injection and high HIV seroprevalence. At baseline (1998-1999) and 36-month follow-up, 103 IDUs recruited in East Harlem, New York (NY), and 135 from Bayamón, Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) were surveyed about syringe sources and HIV risk behaviors in the prior 30 days. A majority of participants in both sites were male (NY 78.6%, PR 84.4%), were born in Puerto Rico (NY 59.2%, PR 87.4%), and had not completed high school (NY 56.3%, PR 51.9%). Compared to PR IDUs at follow-up, NY IDUs injected less (3.4 vs. 7.0 times/day, p &lt; .001), and re-used syringes less (3.1 vs. 8.0 times, p &lt; .001). Between baseline and follow-up, in NY the proportion of syringes from syringe exchange programs (SEPs) increased from 54.2% to 72.9% (p = .001); syringes from pharmacies did not increase significantly (0.2% to 2.5%, p = .095). In PR, the proportions of syringes from major sources did not change significantly: private sellers (50.9% to 50.9%, p = .996); pharmacies (18.6% to 19.0%, p = .867); SEP (12.8% to 14.4%, p = .585). The study indicates that NY SEPs became more dominant, while NY pharmacies remained a minor source even though a law enacted in 2001 legalized syringe purchases without prescription. Private sellers in PR remained the dominant and most expensive source. The only source of free syringes, the SEP, permitted more syringes to be exchanged but the increase was not statistically significant. Implications for syringe exchange and distribution programs are discussed.",M1
16842771,"Toxicity and metal content of organic solvent extracts from airborne particulate matter in Puerto Rico.The importance of airborne particulate matter (PM) in causing increases in morbidity and mortality in humans has been confirmed by numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies. It has been proposed that PM might deliver transition metals to the airways were they react and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators, and cytotoxicity. In Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>), the northern Guaynabo area is a US EPA non-attainment zone for PM10 (PM with a mass median aerodynamic diameter 10 microm), and a previous study found that organic PM10 extracts from this area were cytotoxic. The purpose of this research project is to compare the toxicity between organic PM extracts from Guaynabo (a coastal urban site) and Fajardo (a coastal rural town) based on their polarity, collection season, and geographical location. We will also evaluate if the metal content of such extracts is associated with their biological activity. PM10 filters from both locations were subjected to a sequential Soxhlet extraction using hexane and acetone. Normal and transformed bronchial epithelial cells were then exposed to the extracts. Using the neutral red assay to measure cell viability we found that coastal urban PM from PR generally exhibits higher cytotoxicity than coastal rural PM. However, this effect is dependent on the polarity of the extracts and the collection season (in winter hexane PM10 is more toxic, whereas during the summer acetone PM10 is more toxic). We also found that non-polar organic constituents in PM from PR are generally more toxic than the polar organic constituents. The main conclusion from this work is that the metal contents of the organic PM extracts from PR could play a minor role in the cytotoxicity observed. This is supported by the findings of elements such as As, V, Ni, and Cu in the most cytotoxic extracts. However, organic compounds probably play the major role. The presence of bioactive fractions of PM underscores the importance of conducting more detailed studies.",M1
16570525,"Eye diseases in Puerto Rico.OBJECTIVE: To report on the major causes of eye diseases leading to visual impairment and blindness in a sub-urban population in Puerto Rico. DESIGN: A population-based study of eye diseases in Puerto Ricans living in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. PARTICIPANTS: Nine thousand two hundred ninety-eight patients aged from 40 to 79 years-of-age from the San Juan metropolitan area. METHODS: A chart review of 9,298 patients was done. Patients carrying diagnosis such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and diabetic retinopathy were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and chi square analysis were used to evaluate findings. RESULTS: 2,056 patients out of 9,298 had cataracts (22.1%); 3,963 patients (42.6%) had glaucoma; 199 patients had ARMD (2.1%); and 700 patients (7.5%) had diabetic retinopathy. The prevalence of cataracts was higher in the population study than in the Hispanic population of the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence of glaucoma was higher in our patients than in Hispanic population studied by the LALES (p&lt;0.0001). The prevalence of ARMD and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was lower than expected when compared to Hispanic population of LALES study (p&lt;0.0001 in both instances). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, the prevalence of cataracts and glaucoma was higher than the results found in the Hispanic populations reported in the LALES. However, in our study, we found a lower prevalence of ARMD and diabetic retinopathy. Various factors may lead to this significant difference in the prevalence of eye diseases between the <e>PR</e> population and Hispanic population in the continental USA. Further studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence of eye diseases in Puerto Rico.",M1
16528038,"Molecular evolution of dengue 2 virus in Puerto Rico: positive selection in the viral envelope accompanies clade reintroduction.Dengue virus is a circumtropical, mosquito-borne flavivirus that infects 50-100 million people each year and is expanding in both range and prevalence. Of the four co-circulating viral serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) that cause mild to severe febrile disease, DENV-2 has been implicated in the onset of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the Americas in the early 1980s. To identify patterns of genetic change since DENV-2's reintroduction into the region, molecular evolution in DENV-2 from Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) and surrounding countries was examined over a 20 year period of fluctuating disease incidence. Structural genes (over 20 % of the viral genome), which affect viral packaging, host-cell entry and immune response, were sequenced for 91 DENV-2 isolates derived from both low- and high-prevalence years. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that DENV-2 outbreaks in PR have been caused by viruses assigned to subtype IIIb, originally from Asia. Variation amongst DENV-2 viruses in PR has since largely arisen in situ, except for a lineage-replacement event in 1994 that appears to have non-PR New World origins. Although most structural genes have remained relatively conserved since the 1980s, strong evidence was found for positive selection acting on a number of amino acid sites in the envelope gene, which have also been important in defining phylogenetic structure. Some of these changes are exhibited by the multiple lineages present in 1994, during the largest Puerto Rican outbreak of dengue, suggesting that they may have altered disease dynamics, although their functional significance will require further investigation.",M1
16417222,"Genetic testing for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 and 2 and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 and 3 mutations in Puerto Rico.Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) (MIM #203300) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), bleeding tendency, and lysosomal dysfunction. HPS is very common in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>), particularly in the northwest part of the island, with a frequency of approximately 1:1,800. Two HPS genes and mutations have been identified in PR, a 16-base pair (bp) duplication in HPS1 and a 3,904-bp deletion in HPS3. In Puerto Ricans with more typical OCA, the most common mutation of the tyrosinase (TYR) (human tyrosinase (OCA1) gene) gene was G47D. We describe screening 229 Puerto Rican OCA patients for these mutations, and for mutations in the OCA2 gene. We found the HPS1 mutation in 42.8% of cases, the HPS3 deletion in 17%, the TYR G47D mutation in 3.0%, and a 2.4-kb deletion of the OCA2 gene in 1.3%. Among Puerto Rican newborns, the frequency of the HPS1 mutation is highest in northwest PR (1:21; 4.8%) and lower in central PR (1:64; 1.6%). The HPS3 gene deletion is most frequent in central PR (1:32; 3.1%). Our findings provide insights into the genetics of albinism and HPS in PR, and provide the basis for genetic screening for these disorders in this minority population.",M1
16194000,"Psychometric properties of the Spanish version of two mental health outcome measures: World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II and Lehman's Quality Of Life Interview.This study presents data on the cultural adaptation to Latino populations of two outcome measures that respond to the need for developing comprehensive instruments for outcome assessments in minority populations. We examined the psychometric properties of outcome measures designed to assess impairment in functioning, and quality of life. Impairment in functioning was measured with the Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DASII) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) and quality of life was measured with A. F. Lehman's (A. F. Lehman, 1983; A. F. Lehman, 1988) shortened Quality of Life Interview (QOLI). Spanish speaking consumers (N = 198) from Fresno (CA), San Antonio (TX) and San Juan (<e>PR</e>) participated in this study. They were recruited from both mental health outpatient clinics and primary care rural clinics. The WHO-DASII showed good to excellent internal consistency in all sites (alpha = .72 to .97) except for one subscale (Self-Care alpha = .47). Test-retest reliability estimates were mostly moderate to substantial (.57 to .83), again with one exception, the Self-Care subscale (.46). For the QOLI internal consistency ranged from .34 to .98 and test-retest reliability ranged from .40 to .86 across all sites. An initial validation strategy using both known-groups and concurrent validity produced promising evidence of the construct validity of both measures. The Spanish versions of the WHO-DASII and the QOLI lend support to the translation and adaptation process to which these instruments were subjected.",M1
16133901,"HIV transmission behaviors in jail/prison among puerto rican drug injectors in New York and Puerto Rico.This study examined HIV risk behavior in jail/prison among Puerto Rican drug injectors in New York (NY, n = 300) and Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>, n = 200), and its relationship with later drug and sex risk behaviors. During 3 years prior to interview, 66% of NY and 43% of PR samples were incarcerated at least once. While incarcerated, 5% of NY and 53% of PR injected drugs. Few reported engaging in sex inside jail/prison (5% in both sites). Of those who engaged in risk behaviors in jail/prison, almost all reported having unprotected sex and sharing injection equipment. The impact of jail/prison risk behaviors on risk behaviors after release differed between the two sites: they were more related to subsequent sex risk behaviors in NY, and subsequent injection risk behaviors in PR. The findings indicate a need for effective drug treatment programs inside jail/prisons to reduce HIV-related risk behaviors among drug injectors during incarceration and after release.",M1
15961023,"Workforce projections for emergency medicine in Puerto Rico: a five-year follow-up of an evident demand.In this study, two mathematical equations were used to calculate and establish the actual Emergency Medicine workforce needed in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) and project the time frame to meet the actual demand. 1) Supply equals the number of existing Emergency Physicians (EPs) plus residency-trained graduates in EM per year minus the annual attrition rate (3%); and 2) Demand equals six (6) full time equivalent positions per Emergency Department (ED) times the total number of EDs in PR. Under both scenarios tested, the significant EP shortage in PR will continue until 2044. The actual calculated shortage is 287 EPs. There is an actual significant shortage in the Puerto Rico EP workforce. It will take a long time to make leaders understand the positive impact of having residency-trained EPs in every ED, on quality patient care and the whole health care system.",M1
15959453,"Seroprevalence of poliovirus antibodies among children in a Dominican community--Puerto Rico, 2002.Although the Region of the Americas was certified as polio-free in 1994, an outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis associated with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) occurred during July 2000-July 2001 on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. A total of 21 cases of paralytic polio associated with type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) strain were reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic (DR). Outbreaks from cVDPV occur among children in communities with low immunity levels to polioviruses and the absence of circulation of wild poliovirus (WPV). The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>), located approximately 72 miles east of DR, has not had a case of paralytic polio since 1974. However, because of its proximity to DR and concerns that visitors and immigrants from DR (who tend to live in a separate community in PR) might not be fully vaccinated against polioviruses, the PR Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC assessed the seroprevalence of poliovirus antibodies among children aged 7-60 months in a predominantly DR community of PR. This report describes the results of that assessment, which indicated high levels of seropositivity for all three poliovirus serotypes. If vaccination rates remain high, the risk for a polio outbreak in this community is low. However, until all threats of poliovirus are eliminated globally, high rates of vaccination among preschool children must be ensured to prevent outbreaks of paralytic polio from any source (e.g., imported WPV, laboratory strains, or cVDPV) in the United States and its territories.",M1

An examination of HIV incidence rates and characteristics of seroconverters in each location was undertaken. Baseline and follow-up interviewing and HIV testing were conducted in 1998 to 2002 with seronegative Puerto Rican injection drug users (IDUs) and crack smokers from East Harlem, NY (n = 455) and Bayamón, PR (n = 268). There were a total of 32 seroconverters, 9 in NY and 23 in PR, for seroconversion rates of 0.88/100 person-years at risk (pyr; 95% CI, 0.31-1.45) in NY and 3.37/100 pyr (95% CI, 2.02-4.72) in PR (P &lt; 0.001). In PR, variables significantly related to seroconversion were younger age and using shooting galleries. Being in methadone treatment was protective against seroconversion. In NY, crack use was significantly related to seroconversion. The higher seroconversion rate found in PR indicates a need to enhance HIV prevention efforts, including increasing methadone treatment and access to sterile syringes. The need to address sexual risk behaviors in both locations was also indicated.

The sequences were derived by direct sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products generated from plasma virus. The products were sequenced in both directions and the complementary strands were compared prior to analysis. These processed sequences and GenBank sequences from the continental USA were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. The PR and USA sequences did not form independent clusters, indicating a shared HIV-1 infection. This may be due to the continuous human traffic or, less likely, may indicate a similar evolution of a common source virus. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, fairly similar in frequency in the PR and USA sequences analyzed here, supports human traffic as a rationale for the common infection. This work indicates that an efficacious vaccine developed for use in the USA mainland will also be effective in prevention in PR and perhaps the other countries of the Caribbean region.",M1
14768497,"Age at natural menopause in a sample of Puerto Rican women.OBJECTIVES: To characterize the distribution of age at menopause in a sample of Puerto Rican women and to evaluate the differences in demographic, health and lifestyle factors associated with menopausal state. BACKGROUND: Age at natural menopause may be an important marker of a woman's long-term risk of chronic disease. Understanding which factors influence the timing of menopause remains limited and while ethnic differences in age at menopause have been reported, little data are available for Puerto Rican women. METHODS: In 2000, a self-administered questionnaire was completed by a sample of 300 women aged 30-59 attending health fairs in the cities of Carolina, Aguadilla and Yauco, Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>). Data from this interview was used to determine age at menopause which was described with probit analysis. Women from different menopausal status groups were compared with respect to demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics by using contingency table analysis and chi-square statistics. RESULTS: In a sample where 53% of women were menopausal, the median age of natural menopause was 51.4 years (95% confidence intervals 50.3-52.5). Compared to premenopausal women, naturally and surgically postmenopausal women had lower educational attainment, increased parity and were more likely to be obese (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: This analysis provides the first estimate of age at natural menopause among women living in PR and the age is similar to that reported in other populations. Determining whether this population tends to have an early or late menopause will facilitate a better understanding of the potential chronic disease profile of Puerto Rican women as they age.",M1

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis using Medicare Denominator and hospitalization files. RESULTS: The rate ratio (<e>PR</e>/U.S.) of age, gender-adjusted hospitalizations among elderly Medicare beneficiaries with Part A coverage was 0.78, compared with 0.92 among beneficiaries with both Part A and Part B coverage. Among the latter, the rate ratios were 0.78 for surgical admissions, 1.08 for low-variation medical conditions, and 0.97 for high variation medical conditions. They were higher for younger elderly beneficiaries. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of hospitalization in Puerto Rico may be lower, the same or exceed those of the mainland U.S. depending on the age of the beneficiary and the type of hospitalization.",M1
12602804,"Integrating qualitative and quantitative methods: comparing HIV-related risk behaviors among Puerto Rican drug users in Puerto Rico and New York.A dual site project was conducted to assess determinants of injection and sex-related risk behaviors among Puerto Rican drug users. The project focused on injection drug users and crack smokers, and was conducted in East Harlem, NY and Bayamón, <e>PR</e> in 1996-2000. Qualitative methods included ethnographic mapping, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and observations. A survey component (East Harlem, n = 800; Bayamón, n = 400) was also conducted. Procedures to ensure integration of methodologies and comparability of data were developed. This paper describes the qualitative and survey methods used, and presents the comparative HIV risk behaviors. The integration of the two methodologies served multiple functions: each component identified issues to be addressed in the other, enhanced cross-site comparability of data, and assisted in interpretation of findings. The survey data showed high levels of risk behaviors in both communities, with significantly higher levels of risk reported in Bayamón. Conducting studies of similar ethnic groups in different communities provides opportunities to examine diverse sources of influence on risk behaviors. The integration of qualitative and quantitative methods can enhance comparability and understanding of findings, particularly when there are differences in behaviors between communities.",M1
12572243,"Prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the Puerto Rico Medical Center.The Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. The prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. Few prospective studies have been performed in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) concerning the GPC antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of GPC clinical isolates from PR to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (LZ), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and gemifloxacin (GM). The in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and Etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the Puerto Rico Medical Center Bacteriology Laboratory. The distribution of GPC collected was as follows: 213 S. aureus isolates, 162 E. faecalis, 16 E. faecium and 38 S. pneumoniae. The results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in S. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN), LZ and Q/D; 93% to GM; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in S. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to LN and GM; 87% to Q/D; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in E. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to LZ; 79% to GM; 78.6% to VAN; and 0% to Q/D. Sixty eight and 66% of the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in E. faecium, 100% were susceptible to LZ; 94% to Q/D; 69% to GM; 37.5% to VAN and 20% to ampicillin. In E. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of E. faecium and faecalis showed VanA phenotypic resistance, respectively. These results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in GPC, including 38% methicillin resistance in S. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to VAN. The new agents, LZ, Q/D and GM, proved to be effective against both, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. For E. faecium, both, LZ and Q/D were active, while for E. faecalis, only LZ showed consistent activity.",M1
11418227,"Prevalence and correlates of substance use disorders among older adolescents in Puerto Rico and the United States: a cross-cultural comparison.Although there are substantial data on adolescent substance use, little systematic research has studied the prevalence of adolescent substance disorders in general populations, let alone cultural differences in disorder prevalence. In this paper we report the prevalence and correlates of alcohol and drug use and disorder among older adolescents on Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) and in the United States (US). Data come from an island-wide survey of the PR general residential population (15-18 year old subsample, unweighted N=922) fielded in 1997, and from the National Comorbidity Survey of the US household population (15-18 year old subsample, unweighted N=641), fielded in 1991. Both surveys used a similar standardized interview based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to generate DSM-IV diagnoses. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used. The major findings are: (1) US youth report higher rates of lifetime alcohol and drug use and substance-related disorder than PR youth; (2) the transition to abuse or dependence occurs for one-third of US drinkers, one-fifth of drinkers in PR, and about one-half of the drug users in both US and PR; (3) there are marked variations across sites in the types of symptoms substance users are likely to experience; (4) with the exception of family income, most correlates operate similarly in both sub-samples; and (5) the majority of both US and PR youth with a past year substance use disorder did not report any service utilization in the past year.",M1
10412105,"Increased fecundity of Aedes aegypti fed human blood before release in a mark-recapture study in Puerto Rico.Laboratory experiments suggest that utilization of blood rather than natural sugar sources for energetic needs affords female Aedes aegypti a reproductive advantage over conspecifics that use sugar. To test this hypothesis under field conditions, we carried out a mark-release-recapture study in Florida, <e>PR</e>. Adult females (F1) reared from field-collected eggs were provided with a diet of human blood alone or human blood plus a 20% honey solution before their release. Backpack aspirators were used to collect mosquitoes from release houses for 5 consecutive days beginning the 2nd day after release. Survival was estimated from the slope of the regression line of the log-transformed daily number of recaptures for each treatment group. To compare fecundity of the treatment groups, each recaptured female was dissected, ovaries were removed, oocytes counted, and Christophers' stages of oocyte development scored. Recapture rates were 30% for the blood-only group and 23% for blood plus honey group. The daily survival rate of the blood-only group (55%) was not statistically different from that of the blood plus honey group (69%) (t = 0.32, P &gt; 0.05). By analysis of variance, fecundity (average number of stage III-V oocytes) was significantly higher in the females fed human blood alone (n = 103, 109 oocytes/female) than in the group fed on blood and honey (n = 50, 95 oocytes/female) (P = 0.0007). The observed gonotrophic cycle length of the recaptured females ranged from 3 to 7 days. Results from our field study are consistent with laboratory life-table experiments that suggest feeding exclusively on human blood provides a reproductive advantage for female A. aegypti.",M1

9715944,"Using disability-adjusted life years to assess the economic impact of dengue in Puerto Rico: 1984-1994.This study presents the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a non-monetary economic measure of impact, lost to dengue in Puerto Rico for the period 1984-1994. Data on the number of reported cases, cases with hemorrhagic manifestations, hospitalizations, and deaths were obtained from a surveillance system maintained at the Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (San Juan, <e>PR</e>). The reported cases were divided into two age groups (0-15 years old and &gt;15 years old), and then multiplied by predetermined factors (10 for 0-15 years; 27 for &gt;15 years) to allow for age-related under-reporting of cases. Severity of dengue was modeled by classifying cases into three groups: dengue fever, dengue with severe manifestations, and hospitalized cases. Each group was assigned a different number of days lost because of dengue-related disability. Dengue caused an average of 658 DALYs per year per million population (SE = 114, range = 145-1,519). A multivariate sensitivity analysis, which simultaneously altered the values of six input variables, produced a mean of 580 DALYs/year/million population, with a maximum average of 1,021 DALYs/year/million population, and a maximum, single-year estimate for 1994 of 2,153 DALYs/million population. The most important input was the number of days lost to classic dengue. The DALYs/year/million population lost to dengue in Puerto Rico are much greater than previous estimates concerning the impact of dengue hemorrhagic fever alone. The loss to dengue is similar to the losses per million population in the Latin American and Caribbean region attributed to any of the following diseases or disease clusters; the childhood cluster (polio, measles, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus), meningitis, hepatitis, or malaria. The loss is also of the same order of magnitude as any one of the following: tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (excluding human immunodeficiency virus), tropical cluster (e.g., Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis), or intestinal helminths. The results objectively suggest that when governments and international funding agencies allocate resources for research and control, dengue should be given a priority equal to many other infectious diseases that are generally considered more important.",M1
9701953,"Predation on Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) by Theridion rufipes (Araneae: Theridiidae) in Puerto Rico.Theridion rufipes Lucas was found in rearing cages of Aedes aegypti (L.) in the School of Medicine, San Juan, <e>PR</e>. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the spiders had a continuous existence in the cages and in the room outside the cages. A single spider eventually could eliminate all the mosquitoes in a cage. The behavior of the mosquitoes in the web was observed by isolating spiders individually in glass or plastic flasks. When a mosquito comes in contact with the beads of sticky silk on the web, it is immediately paralyzed before the spider approaches it. The instant immobilization without a struggle as well as other aspects of prey behavior suggest that there is a compound in the sticky webs that causes the paralysis. Analysis of this material might lead to the discovery of a new insecticide. Efforts to control dengue in Puerto Rico should not interfere with the natural enemies of the vector.",M1

Information from AIDS cases reported to the Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) AIDS Surveillance System was analyzed. From July 1981 through June 30 1995, a cumulative total of 15,877 AIDS cases have been reported in PR, 9,838 (62%) of these cases were reported in the San Juan SMSA and 2,044 (20.8%) were women. The male to female ratio was 3.8. The predominant mode of exposure among women was heterosexual contact (48.7%), followed by intravenous drug use (40.4%). The most affected age group among women was 30 to 39 years (43.3%) followed by 20-29 (26.2%). Eighty-one percent of women were in childbearing age. A substantial increase in AIDS cases has been reported for women who revealed heterosexual contact (from 45% in 1993 to 64% in 1995), representing the fastest growing category of AIDS cases in the island. The median survival time after reporting was 16.4 months (95% CI: 15.3-17.7) for males and 22.7 months (95% CI: 19.9 and 26.9) for females. Preventive efforts must be oriented toward education and risk behavior modification primarily directed to young women.",M1

A needle exchange program in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) was initiated under the auspices of the PR Department of Health and is currently being administered by the Community Research Initiative of Puerto Rico, Inc. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were performed with 387 samples with clearly visible amounts of blood, which were chosen randomly from the needle exchange program of the San Juan Metropolitan area on the north coast, and also of the Mayaguez area on the west coast of the island. In addition, 200 syringes without visible amount of blood were also randomly chosen, their contents were extracted with acidified methanol and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for drug content. One hundred and ninety four of the samples (58%) were confirmed to be positive for HIV-1. Four samples contained heroin alone, 190 were positive for cocaine and 2 indicated simultaneous use of both heroin and cocaine. In contrast to existing literature, based mostly on self-description, which indicates widespread use of heroin and cocaine mixture ( speedball ) among IDU's, our physical evidence suggests that a large majority of IDU's in PR currently inject cocaine but not heroin; and also that mixed drug use is rather rare.

Healthy People 2000 objectives call for increasing the proportion of hypertensive men whose blood pressure is under control to at least 40%. In addition, the objectives recommend reducing the prevalence of overweight to 41% among hypertensive women, and to 35% among hypertensive men (5). The Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) collected data on Mexican Americans (MA), Cuban Americans (CA), and Puerto Ricans (<e>PR</e>) living in the continental United States. A trained physician measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure twice in one visit. Our findings provide data to assess baseline estimates for several Healthy People 2000 objectives among Hispanics. Based on criteria from The Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-V), we found Hispanic women to have higher rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension than men. Only 8% of MA and PR men and 9% of CA men who were hypertensive had their high blood pressure under control. The prevalence of overweight among hypertensive men ranged from 39% to 60%; and among hypertensive women, from 44% to 74%.

Ninety percent of the patients had at least some concern about each of the 8 topics, and mean scores on the 8 subscales were near the midpoint on a 0-5 scale. There were significant inverse relationships between level of education, income, and BQ-PR total score. Those persons who experienced cancer-related pain on the day they completed the questionnaire were categorized as using adequate versus not adequate analgesic medication, a determination that was based on a comparison of their level of pain to the medication they were using.

1635968,"Dengue activity in Puerto Rico, 1990.Reported dengue activity in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>) increased in 1990 for the fourth consecutive year. The Community Hygiene Division of the PR Health Department received 9,540 reports of suspected dengue cases. Of the blood samples obtained from 7,660 patients, 1,911 were confirmed as dengue infection by laboratory tests at the Dengue Branch, San Juan Laboratories, Centers for Disease Control. Dengue 2 (DEN-2) continued to be the most frequently isolated serotype among all confirmed cases, hospitalized patients, and the confirmed cases with hemorrhagic manifestations. Disease was reported throughout the island and during all months, but activity, as in previous years, was lowest from April through July, and highest from September to November. The highest rates of laboratory-confirmed illness occurred in towns on the south coast and in the central mountains, with only one or two circulating virus serotypes (DEN-2 in the south; DEN-2 and DEN-4 in the central mountains). Although cases were confirmed in infants and octogenarians, the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases (1,293, 68%), and the highest attack rates (0.70/1000), were reported in persons younger than 30. Of patients with confirmed cases, 289 (15%) were hospitalized, and 438 (23%) reported at least one hemorrhagic manifestation. One presumptive dengue case with fatal outcome was reported in 1990 in a 17-year-old woman in whom a febrile illness, seizures, and coma developed; she died after cardiorespiratory arrest.

1775619,"[Importance of the family as a resource in social support in Puerto Rico]In this article we examine the role of the family in the provision of social support by studying the identity of persons which the participants consider available for providing support. We define social support as that human relationship in which socio-emotional (closeness, intimacy counseling), instrumental (goods and services) and recreational (companionship for recreation) resources are interchanged. Based on a probabilistic sample of the adult (17-68 yrs.) population, 912 persons were successfully interviewed (response rate = 90.4%) using a structured interview schedule. Results indicate that close relatives (parents, brothers/sisters, sons/daughters) are the main resource of all types of support, not only of the general population but also of specific demographic groups defined by their gender, age (17-39, 40-68) and schooling (0-11, 12 + yrs). The marital partner was also identified as an important support resource, especially emotional and recreational; more distant relatives were also important for providing instrumental support. Although the compared groups showed many similarities, they also differed in various aspects both when individually and jointly analyzed. It is concluded that the family is very important in the provision of social support in Puerto Rico (<e>PR</e>).",M1
1902955,"The infection characteristics of a South African isolate of Schistosoma mansoni: a comparison with a Puerto Rican isolate in BALB/c mice and Mastomys coucha.The infection characteristics of a South African (RSA) laboratory isolate of Schistosoma mansoni were compared with those of a widely studied Puerto Rican (<e>PR</e>) isolate in BALB/c mice and Mastomys coucha over the period of 5-12 weeks after infection. The infectivity, maturation and, in particular, the fecundity of the two schistosomes were found to differ markedly. Tissue egg-accumulation rates of the RSA strain were substantially lower than those of the PR strain. Although the maturation of both parasite strains was somewhat delayed in M. coucha, the characteristics of each was essentially consistent in both rodent hosts. Notwithstanding the possible influence of prolonged laboratory passage on the behaviour of schistosome isolates, the results of the present study are nevertheless considered to support the idea that parasite strain differences may, to some extent, account for regional variations in the morbidity of intestinal schistosomiasis. The need to be cognizant of the characteristics of individual host-parasite combinations when comparing different schistosome species and strains, particularly with respect to both their abilities to elicit immunopathology and induce concomitant immunity and their susceptibilities to chemotherapy, is highlighted.",M1

Serum and RBC folate were determined for all women aged 18-44 y by use of a radio-assay kit. The percent of women with low serum folate (less than 6.8 nmol/L) was 11.9% for MA, 10.1% for C, and 8.1% for PR. The prevalence of low concentrations of RBC folate (less than 363 nmol/L) was 7.8%, 16.7%, and 13.6% for MA, C, and PR, respectively. The percentages of women with reduced tissue stores of folate were 4.3% for MA, 6.0% for C, and 4.0% for PR. Years of education completed and poverty status did not significantly affect folate concentrations; however, the prevalence of low folate concentrations among users of vitamin or mineral supplements was significantly lower than it was among nonusers in selected subgroups.",M1

It has been estimated that the minimum amount of underreporting in the U.S. to be 20%, resulting in MM rates that may be substantially higher than reported. The national goal for the MM for the year 1990 has been set at 5/100,000, and at the present trend it is expected that this may be achieved among the white population, but not among minorities. P.R. reported a maternal mortality rate of 5/100,000 in 1975. It was suspected that such a low rate was due to underreporting, a study was undertaken to investigate that possibility. The results indicated that there was severe underreporting of maternal deaths during 1978 = 79. Recently, there has been a growing concern that the level of underreporting in <e>PR</e> continues to be high. Since there has been no evidence that the surveillance has improved, the Dept. of Health requested from the Dept. of Ob-Gyn of the University of Puerto Rico Medical School and the Dept. of Maternal and Child Health to conduct a study to find out if the previous findings held true for recent years. The study was based on the review of selected medical records corresponding to deaths of women of childbearing age whose causes of death, as coded in the death certificate, were considered as having a high probability of masking a misreported maternal death. It was decided to investigate those deaths occurring in 1982, to see if the results of the previous study had caused any impact on the surveillance of maternal deaths in Puerto Rico.",M1

From 1958 to 1979, colon cancer mortality rates for PR-NYC increased dramatically (i.e., 212% in males and 54% in females), whereas in PR-PR, male rates increased only slightly and female rates remained constant. For stomach cancer, incidence rates for male and female PR-NYC were slightly, but not significantly, higher than those for male and female PR-PR. In contrast, stomach cancer mortality rates for PR-NYC were lower than those for PR-PR throughout the survey period, and mortality decreased substantially in all racial-ethnic groups in New York City and Puerto Rico from 1958 to 1979. Results of this study indicated that the changes in colorectal and stomach cancer incidence and mortality in Puerto Rican-born residents after migration to New York City, although not as dramatic as in migrants from Japan and Eastern Europe, were comparable to those observed for Hispanic migrants to New Mexico and Los Angeles.",M1

PR expression was shown in 100% cases of the intact myometrium and simple leiomyoma, while ER expression was far less common, 37 +/- 4.2 and 23.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively. There were much fewer AgNOR proteins in the intact myometrium than in the leiomyoma (3.1 +/- 0.5 and 5.6 +/- 0.4, respectively). Moreover, the number of AgNOR proteins was shown to depend on the presence of ER: when smooth muscle cells were ER-positive, there were fewer argyrophilic granules than when they were absent in both intact myometrium and simple leiomyoma.",M2
20459777,"Breast cancer histology and receptor status characterization in Asian Indian and Pakistani women in the U.S.--a SEER analysis.BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest increase in estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) negative breast cancer yet little is known about histology or receptor status of breast cancer in Indian/Pakistani women.in the U.S. METHODS: We examined the United States National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Cancer program to assess: a) frequency of breast cancer by age, b) histologic subtypes, c) receptor status of breast cancer and, d) survival in Indians/Pakistanis compared to Caucasians. There were 360,933 breast cancer cases diagnosed 1988-2006. Chi-Square analyses and Cox proportional hazards models, to estimate relative risks for breast cancer mortality after adjusting for confounders, were performed using Statistical Analysis Software 9.2. RESULTS: Among Asian Indian/Pakistani breast cancer patients, 16.2% were &lt; 40 yrs. old compared to 6.23% in Caucasians (p &lt; 0.0001). Asian Indian women had more invasive ductal carcinoma (69.1 vs. 65.7%, p &lt; 0.0001), inflammatory cancer (1.4% vs. 0.8, p &lt; 0.0001) and less invasive lobular carcinoma (4.2% vs. 8.1%, p &lt; 0.0001) than Caucasians. Asian Indian/Pakistani women had more ER/PR negative breast cancer (30.6% vs. 21.8%, p = 0.0095) than Caucasians. Adjusting for stage at diagnosis, age, tumor grade, nodal status, and histology, Asian Indian/Pakistani women's survival was similar to Caucasians, while African Americans' was worse. CONCLUSIONS: Asian Indian/Pakistani women have higher frequency of breast cancer (particularly in age &lt; 40), ER/PR negative invasive ductal and inflammatory cancer than Caucasians.",M2
20458051,"Classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy is more effective in triple-negative, node-negative breast cancer: results from two randomized trials of adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for node-negative breast cancer.PURPOSE: Retrospective studies suggest that primary breast cancers lacking estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and not overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; triple-negative tumors) are particularly sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapy with alkylating agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials VIII and IX with node-negative, operable breast cancer and centrally assessed ER, PR, and HER2 were included (n = 2,257). The trials compared three or six courses of adjuvant classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with or without endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone. We explored patterns of recurrence by treatment according to three immunohistochemically defined tumor subtypes: triple negative, HER2 positive and endocrine receptor absent, and endocrine receptor present. RESULTS: Patients with triple-negative tumors (303 patients; 13%) were significantly more likely to have tumors &gt; 2 cm and grade 3 compared with those in the HER2-positive, endocrine receptor-absent, and endocrine receptor-present subtypes. No clear chemotherapy benefit was observed in endocrine receptor-present disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11). A statistically significantly greater benefit for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was observed in triple-negative breast cancer (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.73; interaction P = .009 v endocrine receptor-present disease). The magnitude of the chemotherapy effect was lower in HER2-positive endocrine receptor-absent disease (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.17; interaction P = .24 v endocrine receptor-present disease). CONCLUSION: The magnitude of benefit of CMF chemotherapy is largest in patients with triple-negative, node-negative breast cancer.",M2
20437866,"Molecular subtype approximated by quantitative estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 can predict the prognosis of breast cancer.AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer subtypes classified by quantitative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), and Her2. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: 923 patients with primary breast cancer having a median age of 53 years who were treated at the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai between January 2002 and June 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. Four molecular subtypes were constructed from the immunohistochemical results of quantitative hormone receptor (HR) and Her2 status. HR+ was defined as ER+ and PR+, HR+/- as ER/PR+ at lower levels or lacking either ER or PR, and HR- as both ER- and PR-. The four subtypes were HR+/Her2-, HR+/-/Her2-, HR-/Her2- (triple-negative), and Her2+. Clinical and pathological parameters, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) measurements were compared between patients with different molecular subtypes. RESULTS: The proportions of HR+/Her2-, HR+/-/Her2-, triple-negative, and Her2+ breast cancer were 36.6% (338/923), 22.9% (211/923), 20.6% (190/923), and 19.9% (194/923). The median follow-up was 49.0 months (4-77 months). In 145 cases disease recurrence or death occurred. In multivariate analysis with the HR+/Her2- subtype taken as the reference category, triple-negative and Her2+ subtypes were associated with increased recurrence and death with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.05 (95% CI 1.31-3.20; P = 0.002) and 1.89 (95% CI 1.20-2.97, P = 0.006) for DFS and 2.84 (95% CI 1.45-5.55; P = 0.002) and 2.95 (95% CI 1.51-5.77, P = 0.002) for OS, respectively; the HR+/-/Her2- subtype was marginally associated with poor prognosis with HR 1.51 (95% CI 0.94-2.43; P = 0.088) and 1.90 (95% CI 0.92-3.94; P = 0.084) for DFS and OS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer subtypes based on quantitative ER, PR, and Her2 may be predictive of prognosis. Patients whose tumors were not HR+/Her2- had a worse outcome in our study.",M2
20437637,"Expression of Ki-67, P53 and progesterone receptors in uterine smooth muscle tumors. Diagnostic value.Aim was to investigate expression of Ki-67, P53 and progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>) in leiomyomas (LM), smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) and leiomyosarcomas (LMS) and to establish possible usefulness of these three parameters in distinguishing between LM and STUMP and STUMP and LMS. Retrospective study of 51 uterine smooth muscle neoplasm (16 LM, 18 STUMP, 17 LMS) technically acceptable for analyses from years 2002-2007 from Department of Gynecological and Prenatal Pathology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Croatia. Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67, P53 and PR expression was performed. Every nuclei stained brown, regardless of shade intensivity, was considered positive. The interpretation of immunohistochemical staining was expressed as number of positive cells in 100 cell count in most active area of the slide. Non-parametric analysis of variance Kruskal-Walis test was performed. Ki-67 expression was negative in all LM and higher than 5% in 12/18 STUMP and 10/17 LMS. Significant differences were observed between LM and STUMP expression for Ki-67 (p = 0.000), and LM and LMS expression for Ki-67 (p = 0.000). There was no expression of P53 in LM, expression of P53 was found in 7/17 LMS and 5/18 STUMP Expression of P53 was significant between LM and LMS (p = 0.002), and between LM and STUMP (p = 0.006). Expression of PR was found in 16/16 LM and 18/18 STUMP 10/17 LMS did not show PR expression. Expression of PR was significant between LM and LMS (p = 0.018) and STUMP and LMS (p = 0.004). The findings of our study in concordance with other study results are helpful information establishing more diagnostic criteria and parameters for diagnosis in doubtful cases between three entities. Immunoassaying for Ki-67, P53 and PR are such parameters. The panel of their expression in specific case eases diagnosis.",M2
20423281,"Regulation of progesterone receptor A and B expression in human preterm, term, and postterm placental villi.OBJECTIVE: The progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>)-A/B ratio in the myometrium is reported to be closely related to labor onset. This might represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions for postterm and preterm deliveries, though the mechanisms currently remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation mechanism of PR-A and B expression in human preterm, term, and postterm placental villi. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, China. POPULATION: Singleton women of preterm (PRNIL, not in labor, n = 10), term (TNIL, not in labor, n = 10; TIL, in labor, n = 10), and postterm (PONIL, not in labor, n = 10) cesarean deliveries. METHODS: The PR-A/PR-B mRNA and protein ratios were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blots in villi from preterm, term, postterm groups. PONIL and PRNIL villi were incubated with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PG) and indomethacin for 72 hours, respectively, and the PR-A/PR-B mRNA and protein ratios and p38 signaling pathway were explored. RESULTS: The PR-A/PR-B ratio was highest in TIL, followed by PRNIL, PONIL and TNIL. Indomethacin significantly up-regulated PR-B expression, thereby decreasing the PR-A/PR-B ratio (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, PG reduced the expression of PR-B and increased PR-A, leading to a significant increase in the PR-A/PR-B ratio (p &lt; 0.05). We also determined that the PR-A/PR-B ratio was mediated through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the PR-A/PR-B ratio plays a key role in the mechanisms regulating preterm, term, and postterm deliveries.",M2
20418913,"The synergistic effect of Mig-6 and Pten ablation on endometrial cancer development and progression.Ablation of Mig-6 in the murine uterus leads to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and estrogen-induced endometrial cancer. An additional endometrial cancer mouse model is generated by the ablation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (Pten) (either as heterozygotes or by conditional uterine ablation). To determine the interplay between Mig-6 and the PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway during endometrial tumorigenesis, we generated mice with Mig-6 and Pten conditionally ablated in progesterone receptor-positive cells (<e>PR</e>(cre/+)Mig-6(f/f)Pten(f/f); Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d)). The ablation of both Mig-6 and Pten dramatically accelerated the development of endometrial cancer compared with the single ablation of either gene. The epithelium of Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice showed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells compared with Pten(d/d) mice. The expression of the estrogen-induced apoptotic inhibitors Birc1 was significantly increased in Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice. We identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) as an MIG-6 interacting protein by coimmunoprecipitation and demonstrated that the level of ERK2 phosphorylation was increased upon Mig-6 ablation either singly or in combination with Pten ablation. These results suggest that Mig-6 exerts a tumor-suppressor function in endometrial cancer by promoting epithelial cell apoptosis through the downregulation of the estrogen-induced apoptosis inhibitors Birc1 and the inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation.",M2
20412586,"Spontaneous feline mammary intraepithelial lesions as a model for human estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative breast lesions.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Intraepithelial lesions (IELs), such as usual ductal hyperplasia (UH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are risk factors that predict a woman's chance of developing invasive breast cancer. Therefore, a comparative study that establishes an animal model of pre-invasive lesions is needed for the development of preventative measures and effective treatment for both mammary IELs and tumors. The purpose of this study was to characterize the histologic and molecular features of feline mammary IELs and compare them with those in women. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens (n = 205) from 203 female cats with clinical mammary disease were retrieved from the archives of the Purdue University Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and Veterinary Teaching Hospital (West Lafayette, IN), and the Department of Pathology and Veterinary Clinic, School of Veterinary Medicine (Sassari, Italy). Histologic sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), were evaluated for the presence of IELs in tissue adjacent to excised mammary tumors. Lesions were compared to those of humans. Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor (ER-alpha), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) and Ki-67 was performed in IELs and adjacent tumor tissues. RESULTS: Intraepithelial lesions were found in 57 of 203 (28%) feline mammary specimens and were categorized as UH (27%), ADH (29%), and DCIS (44%). Most IELs with atypia (ADH and DCIS) were associated with mammary cancer (91%), whereas UH was associated with benign lesions in 53% of cases. Feline IELs were remarkably similar to human IELs. No ER or PR immunoreactivity was detected in intermediate-grade or high-grade DCIS or their associated malignant tumors. HER-2 protein overexpression was found in 27% of IELs. CONCLUSION: The remarkable similarity of feline mammary IELs to those of humans, with the tendency to lose hormone receptor expression in atypical IELs, supports the cat as a possible model to study ER- and PR-negative breast lesions.",M2
20392381,"Steroid hormone receptor association with prognostic markers in breast carcinoma in Northern Pakistan.OBJECTIVE: To determine steroid hormone receptor expression and their association with histological prognostic markers and biological profile in female breast carcinoma in Northern Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional, observational. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Histopathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2004 to December 2007. METHODOLOGY: Female patients belonging to Northern Pakistan with primary operable breast carcinoma were included in the study. Patient's age, microscopic tumour size, tumour grade, lymph node status and biological profile for Her-2/neu status were evaluated. Immunohistochemical expression for ER and <e>PR</e> was determined individually and conjointly for ER+PR+ and ER-PR- while their association with above prognostic markers was determined using the c2 test for univariate analysis. RESULTS: Out of the 726 cases, there were 657 (90.4%) cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma with mean age of 48+/-12 years and mean tumour size of 4.2+/-2.3 cm. Tumour was grade-II in 65% and lymph node metastases in 71.5% cases with Her-2/neu+ in 28.1%. ER and PR expression was 74.6% and 68.3% respectively. Conjoint expression of ER+PR+ was 456 (62.8%), ER-PR- in 21.2%, ER+PR- in 86 (11.8%) and ER-PR+ in 30 (4.1%) cases. Individually, ER and PR showed positive association with age, lymph node metastasis, tumour grade and inverse association with Her-2/neu. Conjoint expression of ER+PR+ (62.8%) and ER-PR-(21.2%) showed positive association with age, tumour grade, lymph node metastasis and inverse association with Her-2/neu (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hormone receptor expression of ER and PR expression is comparable to the West with ER and PR showing inverse association with Her-2/neu and positive association with age, tumour grade and lymph node metastases.",M2
20387333,"Hormone receptors and other prognostic factors in breast cancer in Cuba.Clinical management of breast cancer, making a prognosis and deciding on treatment, currently depend on defining prognostic factors, especially hormone receptors (HR). In addition to confirming the heterogeneity of the disease, these biological parameters are indispensable tools for designing personalized treatment. In this study, 1509 tumors from Cuban women diagnosed with breast cancer were examined. Hormone receptor (HR) expression was determined and correlated with a group of prognostic factors, such as age, tumor size, histological type, nuclear grade, histological grade, number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes, and clinical stage. Estrogen receptor (ER) expression was associated with low nuclear grade and histological grade, and with smaller tumor size (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of age at the time of diagnosis showed that ER expression was greater in patients in the group aged &gt;50 years (p &lt; 0.05). In general, ER expression was greater in patients in earlier clinical stages (p &lt; 0.05). With regard to HR expression, 53% of tumors in this sample were ER+ and 49% were <e>PR</e>+. In 38% of cases, both receptors were positive and in 28% both receptors proved negative. The ER+/PR- combination was observed in 23% of cases while only 11% exhibited the ER-/PR+ combination. These findings indicate that approximately 72% of the tumors studied expressed some level of hormone dependency. This is the first report of HR expression in Cuba using immunohistochemical techniques and a representative sample of breast tumors diagnosed in different provinces around the country.",M2
20375746,"Effects of mating on progesterone receptor isoforms in rat hypothalamus.In rodents, the display of sexual behavior during proestrus-estrus transition depends on the effect of estradiol and progesterone. Progesterone exerts its effects through intracellular receptor (<e>PR</e>) of which two isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) are found, with different regulation and function. In this study the effects of mating on the expression pattern of PR isoforms in the hypothalamus were investigated during proestrus-estrus transition by using western blot. PR-B isoform content significantly diminished during proestrus-estrus transition both in mated and nonmated female rats. In contrast, PR-A isoform content significantly increases during this period in nonmated rats, whereas it does not change in mated animals. These data show that PR isoforms are differentially expressed throughout proestrus-estrus transition and that mating modifies PR isoforms expression in the hypothalamus of the rat.",M2
20368555,"Intratumor heterogeneity and precision of microarray-based predictors of breast cancer biology and clinical outcome.PURPOSE: Identifying sources of variation in expression microarray data and the effect of variance in gene expression measurements on complex predictive and diagnostic models is essential when translating microarray-based experimental approaches into clinical assays. The technical reproducibility of microarray platforms is well established. Here, we investigate the additional impact of intratumor heterogeneity, a largely unstudied component of variance, on the performance of several microarray-based assays in breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide expression profiling was performed on 50 core needle biopsies from 18 breast cancer patients using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Global profiles of expression were characterized using unsupervised clustering methods and variance components models. Array-based measures of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) status were compared with immunohistochemistry. The precision of genomic predictors of ER pathway status, recurrence risk, and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics was evaluated by interclass correlation. RESULTS: Global patterns of gene expression demonstrated that intratumor variation was substantially less than the total variation observed across the patient population. Nevertheless, a fraction of genes exhibited significant intratumor heterogeneity in expression. A high degree of reproducibility was observed in single-gene predictors of ER (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.94) and PR expression (ICC = 0.90), and in a multigene predictor of ER pathway activation (ICC = 0.98) with high concordance with immunohistochemistry. Substantial agreement was also observed for multigene signatures of cancer recurrence (ICC = 0.71) and chemotherapeutic sensitivity (ICC = 0.72 and 0.64). CONCLUSION: Intratumor heterogeneity, although present at the level of individual gene expression, does not preclude precise microarray-based predictions of tumor behavior or clinical outcome in breast cancer patients.",M2
20367311,"Variable specimen handling affects hormone receptor test results in women with breast cancer: a large multihospital retrospective study.CONTEXT: Intermountain Healthcare hospitals use a single, standardized laboratory and automated testing process for estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/<e>PR</e>) tests to minimize testing errors. OBJECTIVES: To test the (1) variability in ER/PR negativity among hospitals and (2) association between specimen handling conditions and ER/PR negativity. DESIGN: Retrospective study of women who had breast cancer surgery at 7 Intermountain hospitals and ER/PR tests ordered between 1997 and 2003. Data were extracted from cancer registry. Frequency of ER/PR negativity was calculated for each surgery day and compared among hospitals and between 2 groups: regular (specimens obtained Sunday through Thursday, more likely to be tested within 24 hours of surgery) and prolonged (specimens obtained on Friday and Saturday, more likely to be tested more than 24 hours after surgery) specimen handling conditions. RESULTS: Five thousand seventy-seven women were tested for ER/PR. The frequency of ER and PR negativity was 20.9% and 27.9%, respectively. It increased with each day of the week for both ER (P = .03) and PR (P = .059) and tended to be higher for prolonged specimens for ER (23.6% versus 20.4%; P = .03) and for PR (30.1% versus 27.4%; P = .11) compared with regular specimens. After controlling for age and tumor size, both ER (P = .02) and PR (P = .02) negativity was significantly different among the hospitals and was associated with prolonged specimens for ER (P = .04) but not for PR (P = .09). CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen receptor and PR negativity remained highly variable among hospitals despite use of a single laboratory and tended to be significantly associated with prolonged specimen handling. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.",M2

METHODS: Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu immunohistochemical stains were performed on primary and metastatic breast carcinoma to axillary lymph nodes in 100 patients. Data was collected on a Performa and age, tumour size, type, grade and expression of ER, <e>PR</e> and HER-2/neu on primary and metastatic tumours were recorded. RESULTS: Hormone receptor status was compared between primary and metastatic tumours. Estrogen receptor positivity was observed in 28% primary tumours which were reduced to 25% in metastatic carcinoma. Progesterone receptors were positive in 28% primary tumours as compared to 22% in metastatic tumours. Her-2/neu protein over expression was noted in 44% primary and 45% metastatic breast tumours respectively. In case to case comparison ER, PR and HER-2/neu showed 91%, 88% and 95% concordance in primary and metastatic tumours respectively. CONCLUSION: ER, PR and HER-2/neu biomarkers showed significant concordance between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma.",M2
20355713,"Imaging progesterone receptor in breast tumors: synthesis and receptor binding affinity of fluoroalkyl-substituted analogues of tanaproget.The progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) is estrogen regulated, and PR levels in breast tumors can be used to predict the success of endocrine therapies targeting the estrogen receptor (ER). Tanaproget is a nonsteroidal progestin agonist with very high PR binding affinity and excellent in vivo potency. When appropriately radiolabeled, it might be used to image PR-positive breast tumors noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET). We describe the synthesis and PR binding affinities of a series of fluoroalkyl-substituted 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazine-2-thiones, analogues of Tanaproget. Some of these compounds have subnanomolar binding affinities, higher than that of either Tanaproget itself or the high affinity PR ligand R5020. Structure-binding affinity relationships can be rationalized by molecular modeling of ligand complexes with PR, and the enantioselectivity of binding has been predicted. These compounds are being further evaluated as potential diagnostic PET imaging agents for breast cancer, and enantiomerically pure materials of defined stereochemistry are being prepared.",M2
20349022,"Distribution of androgen and progesterone receptors in the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) ovary during postnatal life.This study describes the localization of androgen (AR) and progesterone (<e>PR</e>) receptors in the developing ovary in the spiny mouse. The immunohistochemical analysis showed for the first time the expression of AR and PR proteins in the ovary as early as in one day-old females. Both AR and PR were present in germinal epithelium cells, stromal cells as well as in the granulosa and theca layer of ovarian follicles. On days 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90, the distribution of AR and PR depended on the stage of follicular development rather than on the animal's age. A novel observation was that PR protein was detected not only in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, but also in the growing and early antral follicles. It was demonstrated that there is a different pattern of AR and PR immunoexpression throughout folliculogenesis. In contrast to AR, whose expression decreased during follicular development, the PR immunostaining increased during this time. It is concluded that androgens and progesterone may play an important role in the early stage of follicular development in the spiny mouse.",M2
20336785,"Age/race differences in HER2 testing and in incidence rates for breast cancer triple subtypes: a population-based study and first report.BACKGROUND: Although US year 2000 guidelines recommended characterizing breast cancers by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), national cancer registries do not collect HER2, rendering a population-based understanding of HER2 and clinical  triple subtypes  (estrogen receptor [ER] / progesterone receptor [<e>PR</e>] / HER2) largely unknown. We document the population-based prevalence of HER2 testing / status, triple subtypes and present the first report of subtype incidence rates. METHODS: Medical records were searched for HER2 on 1842 metropolitan Atlanta females diagnosed with breast cancer during 2003-2004. HER2 testing/status and triple subtypes were analyzed by age, race/ethnicity, tumor factors, socioeconomic status, and treatment. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: Over 90% of cases received HER2 testing: 12.6% were positive, 71.7% negative, and 15.7% unknown. HER2 testing compliance was significantly better for women who were younger, of Caucasian or African-American descent, or diagnosed with early stage disease. Incidence rates (per 100,000) were 21.1 for HER2+ tumors and 27.8 for triple-negative tumors, the latter differing by race (36.3 and 19.4 for black and white women, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: HER2 recommendations are not uniformly adhered to. Incidence rates for breast cancer triple subtypes differ by age/race. As biologic knowledge is translated into the clinical setting eg, HER2 as a biomarker, it will be incumbent upon national cancer registries to report this information. Incidence rates cautiously extrapolate to an annual burden of 3000 and 17,000 HER2+ tumors for black and white women, respectively, and triple-negative tumors among 5000 and 16,000 respectively. Testing, rate, and burden variations warrant population-based in-depth exploration and clinical translation.",M2
20305341,"Evaluation of estrogen receptor alpha, estrogen receptor beta, progesterone receptor, and cKIT expression in desmoids tumors and their role in determining treatment options.The present study evaluates the protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and cKIT in a wide number of desmoids tumors and their role in determining treatment options. Fifty-nine cases classified as muscle aponeurotic fibromatosis were selected. Samples were grouped by tumor location in: head and neck, extremity and abdominal/trunk; type of resection of the primary tumor (complete resection with adequate margins, marginal resection and resection with inadequate margins); type of treatment (exclusive surgery, surgery followed by radiation therapy and surgery followed by tamoxifen or cyclooxygenase inhibitor). A tissue microarray (TMA) was built and the immunohistochemical reactions were performed against ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and c-kit. All cases were negative for ERalpha, PR and c-KIT. 53/59 cases were positive for ERbeta. No significant difference was observed among clinical variables and the ERbeta status. The estimated 5 and 10 year local recurrence free survival (LRFS) for the patients with complete or marginal resection was 75% and 75%, respectively. Tumor location (p = 0.006) and type of resection (p = 0.001) were predictive of local relapse in the univariate analysis. All patients treated with post-operative tamoxifen were LRFS (p = 0.035). Head and neck and extremities lesions showed higher recurrence rates compared to abdominal/trunk lesions. Marginal resection was associated with local recurrence. In conclusion, although this is a retrospective study, the results presented can contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms under desmoid tumor development and can propose tamoxifen as a therapeutic option to be tested in prospective trials.",M2
20237167,"Human labor is associated with reduced decidual cell expression of progesterone, but not glucocorticoid, receptors.CONTEXT: Unchanging plasma progesterone (P4) levels suggest that human labor is initiated by reduced P4 receptor (<e>PR</e>) expression, which elicits functional P4 withdrawal. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is also implicated in this process. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare PR and GR staining in human decidual cells (DCs) and interstitial trophoblasts (ITs) of gestational age-matched pre- and postcontraction specimens and to evaluate steroid effects on PR and GR expression in human DC cultures. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Decidua basalis and parietalis sections were immunostained for PR or GR and then for the cytoplasmic DC and IT markers vimentin and cytokeratin. Western blotting measured PR and GR levels in nuclear extracts of cultured leukocyte-free term DCs after incubation with estradiol-17beta (E2) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). RESULTS: PR histological scores (HSCOREs) were significantly higher in DC nuclei from pre- vs. post-uterine-contraction decidua basalis and parietalis sections with PR immunostaining absent from ITs. In contrast, immunoreactive GR was localized in IT and DC nuclei. GR HSCORES were significantly higher in ITs than DCs but similar in pre- vs. post-uterine-contraction specimens. In term DC monolayers, PR-A and PR-B were enhanced by E2 and inhibited by MPA, whereas E2 plus MPA produced intermediate PR expression. The GR was constitutively expressed. CONCLUSIONS: In post- vs. pre-uterine-contraction specimens, significantly lower HSCOREs in DC nuclei, but not IT, and unchanging GR levels in DCs and ITs suggest that functional P4 withdrawal may occur in DCs and is unlikely to involve the GR. Nuclear extracts from DC monolayer cultures express steroid-regulated PR-A and PR-B and constitutive GR.",M2
20233903,"The core circadian gene Cryptochrome 2 influences breast cancer risk, possibly by mediating hormone signaling.As transcriptional regulators, circadian genes have the potential to influence a variety of biological pathways, including many cancer-related processes. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is essential for proper circadian timing and is a key component of the circadian regulatory feedback loop. Here, we report findings from genetic, epigenetic, loss-of-function, and transcriptional profiling analyses of CRY2 in breast cancer. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CRY2 were identified for genotyping in a case-control population (n = 441 cases and n = 479 controls), and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11038689, rs7123390, and rs1401417) were significantly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, with significant effect modification by menopausal status [dominant model for rs11038689: odds ratio (OR), 0.71; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.51-0.99; P for trend = 0.028; homozygous variants for rs7123390: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.86; P for trend = 0.028; and rs1401417: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92; P for trend = 0.017]. Interestingly, this association was only evident in women with estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/<e>PR</e>)-negative breast tumors but not with ER/PR-positive tumors. Breast cancer patients also had significantly higher levels of CRY2 promoter methylation relative to controls, which is consistent with tissue array data showing lower levels of CRY2 expression in tumor tissue relative to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, in vitro analyses identified several breast cancer-relevant genes that displayed altered expression following CRY2 knockdown. These findings suggest a role for CRY2 in breast tumorigenesis and provide further evidence that the circadian system may be an important modulator of hormone-related cancer susceptibility.",M2
20231683,"Predictors of tumor progression during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.PURPOSE Although most breast cancer patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) have a tumor response, a small proportion experience progressive disease (PD). Predictors of response have been reported, but predictors for progression have not been identified. We sought to identify predictors of tumor progression during NCT with the ultimate aim of identifying patients who might benefit from a first-line surgical approach or from novel targeted therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data were obtained from reviewing medical records of patients with stage I to III breast cancer who received NCT (anthracycline and/or taxane based). Statistical analysis was performed to compare patients with any response or stable disease with patients with PD. RESULTS One thousand nine hundred twenty-eight patients received NCT; 1,762 patients (91%) had some response, 107 (6%) had stable disease, and 59 (3%) had PD at some point during NCT. Factors predictive of PD included African American race (P = .002), tumor (T) status (P = .002), and American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage (P = .02). Histopathologic features of PD were high tumor grade (P = .005), high Ki-67 score (P = .002), and negative estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) status (P &lt; .001/P &lt; .001). Pre-NCT T status, race, and ER status were independent predictors of progression in multivariate analysis. Disease progression was a negative predictor of distant disease-free survival and overall survival in multivariate analysis (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION Factors predictive of PD include race, advanced tumor stage, high nuclear grade, high Ki-67 score, and ER/PR negativity. Because many of these variables are also associated with response to NCT, novel molecular predictors are needed to identify patients at risk for progression on standard NCT.",M2
20228382,"Steroid hormone receptor profile of premenopausal endometrial polyps.The etiology and pathogenesis of endometrial polyps (EPs) are only partially understood. To better understand how sex steroids regulate polyp growth, we investigated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the genes of reproductive steroid hormone receptors (estrogen receptors alpha [ERalpha] and beta [ERbeta], G protein-coupled receptor 30 [GPR30], and progesterone receptor [<e>PR</e>]) in EP tissue and autologous normal appearing endometrium (R) Within each patient, the normal appearing endometrial tissue remote from the site of the endometrial polyp (R) was taken as an internal control. Relative expressions of genes of interest within the endometrial polyp were compared to expressions of respective genes within the internal control tissue (i.e. R). R is the abbreviation for normal appearing endometrium in the later calculation formula. Ten patients diagnosed with EP in a tertiary care center were included in this study. Directed biopsies were obtained under hysteroscopy from the EP and from a normal appearing site remote from EP along the opposite uterine wall in each patient. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for gene expression profiling in the paired tissue samples. The relative gene expression between EP and normal appearing endometrium in each patient was analyzed with 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method. We found that ERalpha, ERbeta, GPR30, and PR were expressed in both normal appearing endometrium and EP in each patient. ERalpha, ERbeta, GPR30, and PR showed no difference in relative expression in EP samples compared with paired normal endometrial samples from the same uterine cavity. However, the relative expression of PR correlated with that of GPR30 (r = .70, P = .023), suggesting that the co-expression of PR and GPR30 may be a contributory mechanism in the pathogenesis of EPs at least in a subset of women.",M2
20221633,"Distinguishing between primary endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas: is a 2-marker (Vim/CEA) panel enough?Gynecological pathologists are used to operating many panels of various markers in combination for the diagnostic distinction between primary endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas. The conventional 3-marker (ER/Vim/CEA) panel is the most promising tool. In this study, our aim is to investigate whether a 2-marker panel is enough to distinguish between these two gynecologic malignancies. Additionally, we wish to determine which one is the most favorable among eight panels tested, including six 2-marker (ER/CEA, <e>PR</e>/CEA, Vim/CEA, ER/p16(INK4a), PR/p16(INK4a), Vim/p16(INK4a)) and two 3-marker (ER/Vim/CEA, ER/Vim/p16(INK)) panels. A tissue microarray was constructed using paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues from 35 hysterectomy specimens, including 14 primary endocervical adenocarcinomas and 21 primary endometrial adenocarcinomas. Utilizing the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, tissue array sections were immunostained with five commercially available antibodies (ER, Vim, CEA, PR, and p16(INK4a)) to evaluate their individual frequencies of expression. We found that all eight aforementioned panels showed an encouraging range of overall accuracy (69.2% to 78.3%). However, one panel of 2-markers (Vim, CEA) exhibited the most efficiency (78.3%) in the diagnostic distinction between primary endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Based on the analyzed data, we conclude that the 2-marker (Vim/CEA) panel seems adequate to be an appropriate, convenient, and efficient means to distinguish between primary endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Even though there were a limited number of cases, this study still provides valuable references to help avoid wasting resources and unnecessary marker testing.",M2
20204283,"Prognostic significance of insulin growth factor-I receptor and insulin growth factor binding protein-3 expression in primary breast cancer.We analyzed insulin-like growth factor receptor I (IGF-IR) and insulin growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) expression with respect to overall survival and relapse-free survival (RFS) in 460 patients with primary invasive breast cancer using immunohistochemistry. IGF-IR expression had a significant positive correlation with positive estrogen receptor (ER), positive progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and Bcl-2 expression. Univariate analysis showed significantly better overall survival (p=0.000) and RFS (p=0.004), in the IGF-IR-positive group. Multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction in relative risk for overall survival (p=0.019, HR=0.221, 95% CI=0.062-0.780) and RFS (p=0.026, HR=0.462, 95% CI=0.234-0.913) in the IGF-IR-positive group. IGF-IR expression in primary breast cancer is an independent favorable prognostic factor. IGFBP-3 expression in breast cancer is associated with poor outcome.",M2
20203223,"The clinicopathological characteristics of 'triple-negative' epithelial ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: 'Triple-negative' is traditionally used to define a specific subtype of breast cancer with negative oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-type 2 (HER2) expressions. ER/PR and HER2 testing is also widely used in the informative classification of ovarian cancer. AIM: To investigate whether a 'triple-negative' subtype also exists in ovarian cancer. METHODS: ER, PR and HER2 expressions in 116 Chinese women with primary epithelial ovarian cancer were reviewed. Triple-negative epithelial ovarian cancer (TNEOC) was defined based on negative ER, PR and HER2 expression. The clinicopathological characteristics and Ki-67, P53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in the TNEOC and non-TNEOC group were compared. RESULTS: 15.5% of cases (18/116) were identified as TNEOC among 116 ovarian carcinomas. Histological grade 3 was found in a higher percentage of the TNEOC than of the non-TNEOC group (94.4% vs 62.2%). TNEOC also correlated with a high level of Ki-67 and p53 expression. EGFR overexpression and other clinicopathological characteristics were not significantly associated with TNEOC subtype. TNEOC was associated with a shorter progression free survival and overall survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A novel subtype of ovarian carcinoma, which is negative for ER, PR and HER2 expression, has been identified; this specific ovarian subtype tends to have aggressive characteristics and a poor prognosis, which is similar to triple-negative breast cancer in most respects. TNEOC should be considered in future investigations of informative classification of ovarian cancer.",M2
20194857,"Breast cancer subtypes and the risk of local and regional relapse.PURPOSE: The risk of local and regional relapse associated with each breast cancer molecular subtype was determined in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer. Subtype assignment was accomplished using a validated six-marker immunohistochemical panel applied to tissue microarrays. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semiquantitative analysis of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), Ki-67, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from 2,985 patients with early invasive breast cancer. Patients were classified into the following categories: luminal A, luminal B, luminal-HER2, HER2 enriched, basal-like, or triple-negative phenotype-nonbasal. Multivariable Cox analysis was used to determine the risk of local or regional relapse associated the intrinsic subtypes, adjusting for standard clinicopathologic factors. RESULTS: The intrinsic molecular subtype was successfully determined in 2,985 tumors. The median follow-up time was 12 years, and there have been a total of 325 local recurrences and 227 regional lymph node recurrences. Luminal A tumors (ER or PR positive, HER2 negative, Ki-67 &lt; 1%) had the best prognosis and the lowest rate of local or regional relapse. For patients undergoing breast conservation, HER2-enriched and basal subtypes demonstrated an increased risk of regional recurrence, and this was statistically significant on multivariable analysis. After mastectomy, luminal B, luminal-HER2, HER2-enriched, and basal subtypes were all associated with an increased risk of local and regional relapse on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Luminal A tumors are associated with a low risk of local or regional recurrence. Molecular subtyping of breast tumors using a six-marker immunohistochemical panel can identify patients at increased risk of local and regional recurrence.",M2
20192071,"[Demonstration of the effect of estrogen and progesterone receptors on survival in breast cancer without cytostatic and hormonal treatment in a small set of patients]BACKGROUND: With respect to diagnostic and therapeutic progress, it may occur that the statistical sets of patients evaluated and treated with uniform methods are small. As a consequence, it is meaningful to check a greater number of statistical approaches. It is suitable to verify whether, for instance, the differences between the results (+) and (++) for estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and <e>PR</e>) in breast cancer have an effect on the length of survival. This question could be answered with the use of several Kaplan-Meier survival curves. However, it is also profitable to judge the simple graph of survival in dependence on receptor concentration. Nevertheless, traditional regression brings too great an error to this method of assessment. Therefore, the use of orthogonal regression is much more precise. Since it can be assumed that no non-revealable micro-metastases were present at the time of operation in some patients with N0, it is possible to achieve healing ad integrum of them using only simple surgery. Consequently, we concluded that it was necessary to exclude from the evaluation the group of patients in N0 surviving 10 years (in the search for evidence of the post-operative impact of age-based reduction of blood estrogen on survival). DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We verified these considerations when monitoring the ER and PR influence on overall survival. We performed this analysis in an approximately 2-year sample of 74 female patients who received the described treatment in Pardubice hospital. At the time of operation, 56 were postmenopausal and 21 of these postmenopausal patients were in stage N1. METHODS AND RESULTS: ER and PR in breast tumours were examined in the cytosol of operational biopsies. Adjuvant radiological treatment was used in addition to the surgical treatment of primary tumours and their original and post-operative metastases. In the case of premenopausal patients with ER, (+) therapeutic sterilization was performed. The finding of higher ER in postmenopausal surviving patients (in comparison to dead ones) was below the boundary of statistical significance. Also, longer survival in cases of higher ER concentrations in the group of dead N1 patients was below the boundary of statistical significance in the use of traditional regression. Therefore, we put together evidence from the group of surviving patients with evidence from the group of dead patients. In the case of N1 patients surviving 10 years, we rounded their survival period to 15 years for inclusion in the graph of survival dependence on ER. In the case of the combined (premenopausal with postmenopausal) group, statistical reliability appeared for longer survival of higher ER already in traditional regression. However, for the postmenopausal alone, the difference was statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, if we used orthogonal regression (similar to Deming regression) instead of traditional regression, then the reliability of the dependence of the length of survival on ER increased (in the last cited graph) to such a degree that it was statistically highly significant (at the level of 0.001) even in case of just postmenopausal patients. The same level of statistical reliability was achieved in the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Also in the case of PR--the higher concentrations of this receptor in survivors compared to dead patients were not statistically significant. But (in contrast to ER) in the case of PR, we observed a statistically significant increase in survival time depending on the receptor concentration within the group of only the dead patients--hence without putting them together with the surviving patients). CONCLUSIONS: The graph of the Kaplan-Meier analysis is more frequently used when solving these problems but the graph of simple dependence of survival on receptor concentration should not be neglected either because, for example, it better shows the difference in survival between ER(+) and (++). Nevertheless, it is necessary to use orthogonal regression in it. The greater suitability of PR and ER for short-term and long-term prognosis, respectively, which we identified in our statistical set, is in concordance with the literature.",M2
20181795,"Reduced prepubertal expression of progesterone receptor in the hypothalamus of female aromatase knockout mice.Previous research using alpha-fetoprotein knockout and aromatase knockout (ArKO) female mice suggested that the developing hypothalamic mechanisms that later control feminine sexual behavior are protected prenatally from estradiol, whereas shortly after birth, they may be stimulated by this same sex hormone. In the present study, we found that the amount of progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (<e>PR</e>-ir) in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus was significantly lower in ArKO female mice than in wild-type (WT) females at several prepubertal ages including postnatal d 15 (P15), P15, P20, and P25 but not neonatally at P0, P5, or P10. Likewise, PR-ir in the lateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus was significantly lower at P25 in ArKO vs. WT female mice but not at earlier postnatal ages. PR-ir was consistently higher in male than in female WT mice in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and medial preoptic nucleus over P0-P10 and in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus over P0-P20. In these brain regions across these latter ages, PR-ir in male ArKO mice was significantly lower than in WT males and resembled the values seen in WT females, confirming previous reports that estradiol formed in the developing male hypothalamus from testicular testosterone is responsible for male-typical levels of neural PR expression. Thus, estradiol induces both female- and male-typical expression of PR postnatally in the mouse hypothalamus. Future experiments will determine whether this estradiol-induced PR expression contributes to either female- or male-typical brain and behavioral differentiation.",M2
20179229,"Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition does not improve the reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ proliferation with aromatase inhibitor therapy: results of the ERISAC randomized placebo-controlled trial.PURPOSE: Tamoxifen reduces risk of recurrence after breast conservation surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but no data exists on the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors for DCIS. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in DCIS, representing another potential therapeutic target. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of aromatase and/or COX-2 inhibition on epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in a presurgical study of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS. Methods: Postmenopausal women with ER-positive DCIS diagnosed by core biopsy were randomized to a 2 x 2 design of either 14 days of exemestane or placebo and celecoxib, or placebo immediately before surgery. Paired baseline and end point biopsies were analyzed for proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), COX-2, and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) expression by immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was a decrease in Ki67 between diagnosis and surgical excision. RESULTS: Ninety women were randomized: all were ER positive, 49 (54%) had grade III tumors, and 29 (32%) were HER2 positive (3+). Exemestane reduced proliferation compared with placebo with a median reduction of 9% (95% confidence interval, 6-14; P &lt; 0.001). Progesterone receptor was reduced by exemestane (mean decrease, 19%; 95% confidence interval, 9-28; P = 0.011). The effect of exemestane on proliferation was seen regardless of grade, HER2, or PR expression. Celecoxib had no effect on proliferation or apoptosis alone, or in combination with exemestane. CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane reduces proliferation in ER-positive DCIS. Aromatase inhibition is a potential alternative to tamoxifen in patients who have undergone breast conservation for ER-positive DCIS.",M2
20164004,"A matched case-control study of Triple negative vs. HER-2 positive (irrespective of hormonal status) breast cancer: two subtypes with high risk features and poor outcome.Genetic profile studies of breast cancer identified a number of biologically different subtypes. These genetic subtypes are often surrogated by estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>) and HER2 status as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Triple negative (TN) subtype is recognized to have high risk features and poor outcome. Over expression of the HER2 is also recognized as a poor outcome marker. The characteristics and outcome of HER2 positive tumours (irrespective of hormonal status) (HER2 HR+/-) identified by IHC have not addressed in the era of surrogate genetic subtyping. Therefore, we retrospectively compared the risk features and clinical outcome of patients with TN against these with HER2 HR+/- tumours.",M2
20155281,"Immunohistochemical detection of steroid receptor cofactors in ovarian endometriosis: involvement of down-regulated SRC-1 expression in the limited growth activity of the endometriotic epithelium.To study the steroid hormone-induced growth mechanisms of endometriosis, the immunohistochemical expression of steroid hormone receptor cofactors was investigated in 37 cases of endometriotic epithelia and was compared with that of eutopic endometria of identical patients. The expression of steroid receptor coactivators (p300/CBP and SRC-1) and corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) was examined in relation to the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), and Ki-67. Results of immunostaining were indicated as a  positivity index  (PI, full score; 100). The expression of ER and PR in endometriotic epithelia largely resembled that in eutopic endometria, however, the expression of Ki-67 in the proliferative phase (PI 13.8 +/- 2.4, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than that in eutopic endometria (32.6 +/- 10.6). The expression of SRC-1 in eutopic endometria was increased in the proliferative phase (56.5 +/- 16.8) and decreased in the secretory phase (14.8 +/- 6.9). In endometriosis, however, the PI for SRC-1 did not show apparent cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, the expression of SRC-1 in endometriotic epithelia in the proliferative phase was significantly lower than that in eutopic endometria. These findings suggested the reduced proliferative activity in endometriotic epithelia to be related to the reduced expression of SRC-1.",M2
20154280,"Hormone receptor and c-ERBB2 status in distant metastatic and locally recurrent breast cancer. Pathologic correlations and clinical significance.Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), and c-ERBB2 (HER2/neu) are therapeutically and prognostically important markers in the management of breast carcinoma. They are not always analyzed in distant metastatic and locally recurrent breast cancers. We compared immunohistochemical expression in a series of primary breast carcinomas with their distant metastases (n = 72) and local recurrences (n = 45) and analyzed the impact of any changes on survival. Discordance rates between primary and metastatic and between primary and locally recurrent lesions, respectively, were 18% (13/72) and 13% (6/45) for ER, 42% (30/72) and 33% (15/45) for PR, and 7% (5/72) and 2% (1/45) for c-ERBB2. There was statistically significant discordance between primary and metastatic PR status (P = .017; kappa = 0.201). Among locally recurrent tumors, 15 (33%) of 45 revealed discordance for PR (P = .006; kappa = 0.366). We observed a trend for shorter survival among women with ER- metastatic and locally recurrent tumors regardless of the primary tumor ER status. Our findings suggest a benefit for routine evaluation of ER, PR, and c-ERBB2 status in distant metastatic and locally recurrent breast cancer for therapeutic and prognostic purposes.",M2
20151981,"Association between vitamin D and calcium intake and breast cancer risk according to menopausal status and receptor status in Japan.Although several studies have investigated the possible association between elevated vitamin D and calcium intake and low breast cancer risk, findings have been inconsistent. We conducted a case-control study to clarify the association between vitamin D and calcium intake and breast cancer risk among pre- and post- menopausal women in Japan. We also investigated whether these effects were modified by tumor receptor status, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status. We examined 1803 breast cancer patients and 3606 age- and menopausal status-matched noncancer controls. Among cases, 713 were assessed for ER, PR, and HER2 status. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional or unconditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. A significant inverse association was observed between vitamin D and calcium intake and breast cancer risk among all subjects, with top quartile ORs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63-0.90; trend P = 0.001) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99; trend P = 0.038), respectively. In analyses stratified by menopausal status, a significant association between risk and vitamin D was observed only among premenopausal women (trend P &lt; 0.001), whereas that between risk and calcium intake was seen only among postmenopausal women (trend P = 0.022). Heterogeneity by menopausal status for these associations was statistically significant. This association was modified by tumor receptor status. These findings suggest that the protective effects of vitamin D and calcium intake against breast cancer risk may differ by menopausal status and receptor status.",M2
20148455,"Expression of HER2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptors, CA 125 and CA19-9 on cancer cell membrane in patients with serous and mucinous carcinoma of the ovary.PURPOSE: To examine the expression of the membrane markers of estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>), CA-125, CA 19-9 and HER2/neu in ovarian cancer tissues. METHODS: Fifty-four samples of ovarian cancer tissues originating from 55 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry. Forty-three had serous papillary ovarian cancer, 9 of which were grade I, 12 grade II and 2 grade III. Twelve patients had a classic mucinous ovarian cancer, 5 of which were grade I, 4 grade II and 0 grade III. RESULTS: Out of 43 patients with serous ovarian cancer, 7 expressed both steroid receptors, 22 had only one (10 ER and 12 PR), while 14 were negative. Only 2/12 patients with classic mucinous ovarian cancer expressed of both receptors. CA-125 was expressed in 37/43 patients with serous ovarian cancer and in 4/12 patients with classic mucinous ovarian cancer. CA 19-9 was expressed in 3/43 patients with serous ovarian cancer, and coexpressed with CA-125 in 2/3 patients. In patients with classic mucinous ovarian cancer, 4/12 had expression of CA 19-9 without coexpression with CA-125. HER2/neu positivity (3+) was proven in only one case with classic mucinous ovarian cancer, and any other expression (1+) in 7 additional patients (1 mucinous and 6 serous ovarian cancers). CONCLUSION: Positive HER2/neu expression in the cells of ovarian cancer is very rare and HER2/neu overexpression is even rarer. Expression of ER and PR does not depend on tumor grade and/or at least not in grade I and II. Positive CA 19-9 expression may be present not only in cases of classic mucinous ovarian cancer but also in typical serous ovarian cancer. However, in the classic mucinous ovarian cancer, CA-125 may be expressed, though in relatively low percentage.",M2
20140084,"Keratin promoter based gene manipulation in the murine conducting airway.Systems capable of targeting genetic manipulations to keratin-positive airway basal cells are more poorly developed than systems targeting other airway epithelial cell populations and this has likely hindered development of animal models of diseases such as lung squamous cell carcinoma. Although keratin promoter driven-Cre recombinase constructs are potentially useful for targeting these cells, these constructs have substantially higher activity in the skin and oral epithelium than in the airways. We developed a method for delivering RU486, the conditional activator of Cre recombinase progesterone receptor (CrePR) fusion proteins to the lung and then examined the activity of three keratin-driven CrePR constructs in the conducting airways. We also developed a technique for survival bronchioalveolar lavage on non-ventilated animals to examine the effects of the acetone/oil vehicle required to deliver RU486 to the lung. K5CrePR1 and K14CrePR1 constructs differ only in the keratin promoter used to target CrePR1 expression while K5Cre*<e>PR</e> contains a truncated progesterone receptor designed to reduce RU486-independent Cre activity. While all three constructs demonstrate RU486-inducible Cre activity in the conducting airways, both construct activity and tightness of regulation vary considerably. K5Cre*PR is the most tightly regulated Cre driver making it ideal for targeting somatic mutations to the airway epithelia while K5CrePR1 and K14CrePR1 may be better suited to studying diseases of the conducting airways where gene targeting of keratin expressing cells and their derivatives is desired.",M2
20139427,"Effects of oral and vaginal administration of levonorgestrel emergency contraception on markers of endometrial receptivity.BACKGROUND: The standard regimen of the levonorgestrel-only pill (1.5 mg either in a single dose or in a dose of 0.75 mg twice, 12 h apart) administered orally for emergency contraception (EC) has been shown to have no effect on endometrial development and markers of endometrial receptivity. We aimed to explore whether repeated oral and single vaginal administration of levonorgestrel affect the endometrium and thus potentially increase the EC efficacy, compared with the standard regimen. METHODS: Endometrial biopsies were taken from non-smoking, healthy women with proven fertility on cycle days LH + 6 to LH + 8 in control and levonorgestrel treatment cycles (each woman serving as her own control). Levonorgestrel was administered either orally (0.75 mg x 4, at 24 h intervals on LH + 1 to LH + 4; n = 8) or vaginally (a single dose of 1.5 mg on LH + 2; n = 7). Immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR was performed to compare the levels of protein and mRNA for sex steroid receptors, interleukin-1beta, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and mucin 1 in endometrial cells. RESULTS: Following the repeated oral treatment, the immunoreactivity of both progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>)-A and PR-B declined in glandular epithelium (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively), whereas stromal immunoreactivity and mRNA expression of LIF increased compared with control (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). However, vaginal levonorgestrel did not cause any significant endometrial changes. CONCLUSIONS: The two regimens of levonorgestrel caused either only minor or no alterations in markers of endometrial receptivity. New agents targeting the endometrial development should be explored in order to increase EC efficacy.",M2
20138441,"Concordance between HER-2 and steroid hormone receptor expression between primary breast cancer, sentinel node metastases, and isolated tumor cells.Our aim was to compare the HER-2 and hormone receptor status between primary tumor (PT) and sentinel node (SN) metastases in breast cancer. We analyzed 65 PTs with 42 macrometastases, 18 micrometastases, and 5 ITCs for the HER-2 amplification status and for the hormone receptor status. In HER-2-positive PTs, 26 of 29 metastases were HER-2-positive, including all six analyzed micrometastases and ITCs. Three macrometastases were HER-2-negative. In HER-2-negative PTs, 35 of 36 metastases were HER-2-negative. A low-grade HER-2 amplification was detected in one micrometastasis. A full concordance between the PT and SN metastases in both HER-2 amplification and ER and <e>PR</e> status was observed in 40 of 56 (71%) cases. These 40 fully concordant cases included 27 macrometastatic, 9 micrometastatic, and 4 ITC-cases. The concordance in HER-2, ER, and PR was high between the PT and their SN metastases. However, the concordance may be remarkably lower when analyzed simultaneously for all three predictive factors.",M2

The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of candidate biomarkers in tumors from patients with TNB. Tissue microarrays were prepared from primary tumors from premenopausal breast cancer patients (500/564) randomized to adjuvant tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining included ER, <e>PR</e>, HER2, epidermal receptor growth factor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). EGFR and HER2 gene copy number was defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All patients were included in the descriptive analysis, but only untreated patients in the survival analysis. TNB was diagnosed in 96 patients and correlated significantly to low age, Nottingham histological grade (NHG) III, high Ki67-index, T2 tumors, node negativity, EGFR positivity, increased EGFR gene copy number and high VEGFR2 expression. TNB was an independent prognostic factor for decreased 5-year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) (HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.6), P = 0.01), but not for 10-year BCSS. High VEGFR2 expression was significantly correlated to decreased BCSS in TNB patients. TNB was associated with decreased BCSS and clinicopathological characteristics of an aggressive tumor type. High VEGFR2 expression, EGFR expression, and EGFR gene copy number were significantly correlated to TNB, supporting their role as putative candidate biomarkers for selection of targeted therapy in TNB.",M2
20131351,"Immunohistochemical surrogate markers of breast cancer molecular classes predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a single institutional experience with 359 cases.BACKGROUND: Complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is predominantly seen in  ERBB2  and  basal-like  tumors using expression profiling. We hypothesize that a similar response could be predicted using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). METHODS: ER, PR, and HER2 were used to classify 359 tumors treated with NACT into 6 groups: luminal A (strong ER+, HER2 negative), luminal B (weak to moderate ER+, HER2 negative), triple negative (negative for ER, PR, and HER2), ERBB2 (negative for ER and PR, but HER2+), luminal A-HER2 hybrid (strong ER+ and HER2+), and luminal B-HER2 hybrid (weak to moderate ER+ and HER2+). Complete pathologic response was defined as absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and regional lymph nodes. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (48 of 359) demonstrated complete pathologic response. The highest rate of complete pathologic response was seen in ERBB2 (33%; 19 of 57) and triple negative (30%; 24 of 79) tumor classes. Among the ER+  molecular  group, the highest rate of complete pathologic response was seen among luminal B-HER2 hybrid tumors, 8% (2 of 24). Remainder of ER+ tumors demonstrated a very low rate of complete pathologic response, 1.5% (3 of 198). The 5-year survival for patients achieving complete pathologic response was 96% compared with 75% in patients that failed to achieve complete pathologic response. The overall survival was worse in the ER-negative group (ERBB2 and triple negative) compared with the ER-positive group. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the recently defined  triple negative paradox,  or rather  hormone receptor negative paradox,  that despite the best response to NACT, ERBB2 and triple negative tumors show the worst overall survival because of higher relapse among those with residual disease.",M2
20124487,"Transcription factor KLF11 integrates progesterone receptor signaling and proliferation in uterine leiomyoma cells.Uterine leiomyoma is the most common tumor of the female genital tract and the leading cause of hysterectomy. Although progesterone stimulates the proliferation of uterine leiomyoma cells, the mechanism of progesterone action is not well understood. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-cloning approach to identify progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) target genes in primary uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle cells. We identified 18 novel PR-binding sites, one of which was located 20.5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Krüppel-like transcription factor 11 (KLF11) gene. KLF11 mRNA levels were minimally downregulated by progesterone but robustly upregulated by the progesterone antagonist RU486. Luciferase reporter assays showed significant baseline and RU486-inducible promoter activity in the KLF11 basal promoter or distal PR-binding region, both of which contained multiple Sp1-binding sequences but lacked classic progesterone response elements. RU486 stimulated recruitment of Sp1, RNA polymerase II, PR, and the coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-2 to the distal region and basal promoter. siRNA knockdown of PR increased KLF11 expression, whereas knockdown of KLF11 increased leiomyoma cell proliferation and abolished the antiproliferative effect of RU486. In vivo, KLF11 expression was significantly lower in leiomyoma tissues compared with adjacent myometrial tissues. Taken together, using a ChIP-cloning approach, we uncovered KLF11 as an integrator of PR signaling and proliferation in uterine leiomyoma cells.",M2
20123965,"Multimodal regulation of E2F1 gene expression by progestins.An analysis of mRNA expression in T47D breast cancer cells treated with the synthetic progestin R5020 revealed a subset of progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) target genes that are enriched for E2F binding sites. Following up on this observation, we determined that PR-B acts in both direct and indirect manners to positively upregulate E2F1 expression in T47D cells. The direct effects of PR on E2F1 expression were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, which indicated that the agonist-bound receptor was recruited to several enhancer elements proximal to the E2F1 transcript. However, we also noted that cycloheximide partially inhibits R5020 induction of E2F1 expression, indicating that the ligand-dependent actions of PR on this gene may involve additional indirect regulatory pathways. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that treatment with R5020 significantly increases both hyperphosphorylation of Rb and recruitment of E2F1 to its own promoter, thus activating a positive feedback loop that further amplifies its transcription. Furthermore, we established that PR-mediated induction of Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), which can bind to GC-rich DNA within the E2F1 promoter, is required for maximal induction of E2F1 expression by progestins. Taken together, these results suggest a new paradigm for multimodal regulation of target gene expression by PR.",M2
20116396,"Activation of progestin receptors in female reproductive behavior: Interactions with neurotransmitters.The steroid hormone, progesterone (P), modulates neuroendocrine functions in the central nervous system resulting in alterations in physiology and reproductive behavior in female mammals. A wide body of evidence indicates that these neural effects of P are predominantly mediated via their intracellular progestin receptors (<e>PRs</e>) functioning as  ligand-dependent  transcription factors in the steroid-sensitive neurons regulating genes and genomic networks. In addition to P, intracellular PRs can be activated by neurotransmitters, growth factors and cyclic nucleotides in a ligand-independent manner via crosstalk and convergence of pathways. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that rapid signaling events associated with membrane PRs and/or extra-nuclear, cytoplasmic PRs converge with classical PR activated pathways in neuroendocrine regulation of female reproductive behavior. The molecular mechanisms, by which multiple signaling pathways converge on PRs to modulate PR-dependent female reproductive behavior, are discussed in this review.",M2
20116235,"Dietary carotenoids and risk of hormone receptor-defined breast cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women.Carotenoids have antioxidant and antiproliferative properties and may reduce the risk of breast cancer. We examined the association between dietary carotenoids and risk of invasive breast cancer in the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a population-based cohort of 36,664 women who completed a questionnaire in 1997. During a mean follow-up of 9.4 years, 1008 women were diagnosed with incident breast cancer. Dietary carotenoids were not significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer overall or with any subtype defined by oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) status. However, dietary alpha-carotene and beta-carotene were inversely associated with the risk of ER-PR-breast cancer among ever smokers. Among ever smokers, the multivariable relative risks of ER-PR-breast cancer comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of intake were 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11-0.94; P(trend)=0.01) for alpha-carotene and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.12-0.99; P(trend)=0.03) for beta-carotene. The risk of breast cancer also decreased with increasing intakes of alpha-carotene (P(trend) = 0.02) and beta-carotene (P(trend)=0.01) among women who did not use dietary supplements. These findings suggest that dietary alpha-carotene and beta-carotene are inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer among smokers and among women who do not use dietary supplements.",M2
20111699,"A computer simulation of progesterone and Cox2 inhibitor treatment for preterm labor.BACKGROUND: Sufficient information from in vitro and in vivo studies has become available to permit computer modeling of the processes that occur in the myometrium during labor. This development allows the in silico investigation of pathological mechanisms and the trialing of potential treatments. METHODS/RESULTS: Based on the human literature, we developed a computer model of the immune-endocrine environment of the myometrial cell. The interactions between molecules are represented by differential equations. The model is designed to simulate the estrogen and progesterone receptor changes during pregnancy and particularly the changes in the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) isoforms A and B that are thought to mediate functional progesterone withdrawal in the human at labor. Parturition is represented by an increase in the PRA to PRB ratio to levels seen in women in labor. Infection is shown by inducing inflammation in the system by increasing phospho-IkB kinase concentration (IKK) levels; which lead to increased NF-kappaB activation, causing an increase in the PRA/PRB ratio. We examined the effects of progesterone or cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox2) inhibitor treatments on the PRA/PRB ratio in silico. The model predicted that high doses of progesterone and Cox2 inhibition would be effective in preventing an NF-kappaB-induced PRA/PRB ratio increase to the levels found during labor. CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate the use of dynamic biological computer simulations to test the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. This may allow the early rejection of ineffective therapies prior to expensive field trials.",M2
20108215,"Comparative evaluation of the erbB2 and hormone receptor status of neighboring invasive and in situ components of ductal carcinomas of the breast.BACKGROUND: It remains unknown whether erbB2 expression and hormone receptor status predict the invasive potential of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. OBJECTIVES: To examine erbB2 and estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/<e>PR</e>) status in the precise areas where DCIS turns into invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven cases of breast malignancies harboring contiguous regions of DCIS and IDC were selected. Separate histological samples from the DCIS and the neighboring IDC were obtained using tissue microarrays. The erbB2 and ER/PR statuses were assessed using immunohistochemistry (erbB2 and ER/PR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH - only erbB2). RESULTS: The expression of erbB2 did not differ in the DCIS and IDC components of the breast tumors (p=0.35). There was good agreement in sample-by-sample comparisons of erbB2 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.78), PR (ICC=0.61) and ER (ICC=0.70) expression in the DCIS and IDC components. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the expressions of erbB2 and ER/PR do not differ in the contiguous regions from DCIS to IDC.",M2
20108182,"17Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 deficiency and progesterone resistance in endometriosis.Estradiol (E2) stimulates the growth and inflammation in the ectopic endometriotic tissue that commonly resides on the pelvic organs. Several clinical and laboratory-based observations are indicative of resistance to progesterone action in endometriosis. The molecular basis of progesterone resistance in endometriosis may be related to an overall reduction in the levels of progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>). In normal endometrium, progesterone acts via PR on stromal cells to induce secretion of paracrine factor(s) that in turn stimulate neighboring epithelial cells to express the enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD17B2). HSD17B2 is an extremely efficient enzyme and rapidly metabolizes the biologically potent estrogen E2 to weakly estrogenic estrone. In endometriotic tissue, progesterone is incapable of inducing epithelial HSD17B2 expression due to a defect in stromal cells. The inability of endometriotic stromal cells to produce progesterone-induced paracrine factors that stimulate HSD17B2 may be due to the very low levels of PR observed in vivo in endometriotic tissue. The end result is deficient metabolism of E2 in endometriosis giving rise to high local concentrations of this mitogen. The molecular details of this physiological paracrine interaction between the stroma and epithelium in normal endometrium and its lack thereof in endometriosis are discussed.",M2
20106771,"Prevalence and classification of spontaneous mammary intraepithelial lesions in dogs without clinical mammary disease.Mammary intraepithelial lesions (IELs) are noninvasive epithelial proliferations that include ductal hyperplasia (DH), atypical DH (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In women, IELs are associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer and form a basis for therapeutic decisions. Similarly, in female dogs, IELs are common in tumor-bearing glands and in non-tumor-bearing glands. To determine the prevalence and types of spontaneous IELs, mammary glands from 108 female dogs without clinical mammary disease were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically. Within this population, 56 dogs (52%) had at least one type of spontaneous IEL, including DH (49 dogs), ADH (14 dogs), low-grade DCIS (19 dogs), intermediate-grade DCIS (12 dogs), and high-grade DCIS (1 dog). Twenty-one dogs had two or more different IEL types. In 23 of 24 dogs with atypical IELs (ADH or DCIS), immunohistochemical expression was determined for estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), and Ki-67. For all markers examined, low-grade DCIS had significantly lower scores than did adjacent nonlesional gland; PR expression was significantly decreased in low-grade DCIS compared to other atypical lesions. Sixty-one lesions were ER-alpha negative (12 ADH, 36 low-grade DCIS, 13 intermediate-grade DCIS), and no lesions overexpressed HER-2/neu. Based on the dog's prevalence of spontaneous mammary IELs that precede clinical mammary disease, the remarkable histologic similarity between canine and human IELs, and the loss of ER expression in certain IELs in both species, the dog shows promise as a model for human breast preneoplasia.",M2
20104988,"Immunohistochemical determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors in canine mammary tumors.Mammary gland tumors are by far the most commonly found tumors in domestic dogs. Effective therapeutic procedures with prompt accurate diagnoses are of prime importance for this life threatening neoplasm. Although immunohistochemical methods provide valuable information such as the location and semi-quantitative data of the interested antigens in particular tumors, conventional methods like histopathological diagnosis remain useful and necessary for identification and classification of tumors. In the present study, we combined histopathology with immunohistochemical staining of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>) in canine mammary gland tumors. Fifty dogs with primary mammary tumors underwent surgery at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Mahidol University during 2005 to 2007. Three of them were diagnosed with precancerous lesions and negatively stained for ER or PR antibody. Twenty-one were diagnosed with benign tumors classified as adenomas and benign mixed mammary gland tumors. Nearly 60% of thelesions were negatively stained for ER or PR. PR positively stained, both PR and ER stained and ER stained tumors accounted for 19%, 19% and 5%, respectively. Of the malignant tumors, eighty-six percent were adenocarcinomas and 14% were malignant mixed mammary gland tumors. Nearly 70% were negatively stained for ER or PR, 14% were PR positively stained, 14% were both PR and ER stained and 5% were ER stained. Four dogs had unidentified lesions. In summary, more than half of of our benign and malignant canine mammary tumors were negatively stained for ER and PR. This indicates a lack of correlation with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor expression.",M2
20104975,"Factors associated with HER2 overexpression in breast cancer: Experience in an Asian developing country.INTRODUCTION: The HER2 gene is amplified in up to 30% of human breast cancers, leading to overexpression of the HER2 protein on the cell surface. Overexpression of HER2 is associated with a more aggressive cancer and hence a poorer overall survival. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between clinico-pathological features and HER2 overexpression in breast cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in the Department of Surgery, University Malaya Medical Centre. The association between HER2 overexpression, determined by immunohistochemistry, and other clinicopathological factors was evaluated in 996 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer treated from 2005 to 2007 using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: HER2 overexpression occurred in 30.3% of patients. On bivariate analysis, HER2 overexpression was inversely related to ER expression (p&lt;0.01) and <e>PR</e> expression (p&lt;0.01). This overexpression was associated with a higher tumour grade, lymphovascular positivity and infiltrating ductal carcinoma subtype. On multivariate analysis, HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with higher tumour grade (p= 0.018, CI 1.25-11.04), PR negativity (p= 0.002, CI 0.30-0.77) and lymphovascular positivity (p= 0.042, CI 1.01-2.12). CONCLUSIONS: HER2 overexpression was observed in 30.3% of Malaysian female breast cancer patients. This group of patients represents a more aggressive subtype of breast cancer with higher tumour grade, PR negativity and lymphovascular positivity. No significant relationship was established between HER2 overexpression and age, race, lymph node, ER, pathology subtype and stage of disease from this study.",M2
20104967,"Immunohistochemical analysis of ER, <e>PR</e>, Her2 and CK5/6 in infiltrative breast carcinomas in Indian patients.AIM: Breast cancer is biologically a heterogeneous disease. Patients with the same diagnostic profile have markedly different clinical outcomes. Gene expression studies identified distinct breast cancer subtypes that differ in prognosis. Aim is to identify the immunohistochemical subtypes of breast carcinoma and correlate the results with pathological features associated with adverse prognosis in our study population. METHOD: We included 107 consecutive cases of invasive breast carcinoma and sub classified using immunohistochemical staining for ER, PR, Her2, and CK5/6 into the following subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, Her2(+) and unclassified. Associations between tumor subtypes and tumor characteristics were examined. RESULTS: The proportion of each subtype in our patient population was: luminal A 37.4%, luminal B 11.1%, Her2(+) 29% and basal-like 7.5%. The following variables were significantly associated with IHC breast cancer subtypes: patient age (p&lt;0.05), overall histopathology grade (p&lt;0.001), nuclear grade (p&lt;0.005) and mitotic index (p&lt;0.001). Her2(+) and basal like subtypes were associated with poor differentiation (p&lt;0.01), higher nuclear grade (p&lt;0.05) and high mitotic index (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a higher proportion of patients in the study population undergo total mastectomy and harbor poorly differentiated, node positive tumors than reported. There was also a relatively high percentage of the Her2(+) subtype (29%).",M2
20104427,"Estrogen receptor-beta, estrogen receptor-alpha, and progesterone resistance in endometriosis.Loss of progesterone signaling in the endometrium may be a causal factor in the development of endometriosis, and progesterone resistance is commonly observed in women with this disease. In endometriotic stromal cells, the levels of progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), particularly the PR-B isoform, are significantly decreased, leading to a loss of paracrine signaling. PR deficiency likely underlies the development of progesterone resistance in women with endometriosis who no longer respond to progestin therapy. Here we review the complex epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms leading to PR deficiency. The initial event may involve deficient methylation of the estrogen receptor (ER)beta promoter resulting in pathologic overexpression of ERbeta in endometriotic stromal cells. We speculate that alterations in the relative levels of ERbeta and ERalpha in endometrial tissue dictate E2-regulated PR expression, such that a decreased ERalpha-tauomicron-ERbeta ratio may result in suppression of PR. In this review, we propose a molecular model that may be responsible for changes in ERbeta and ERalpha leading to PR loss and progesterone resistance in endometriosis.",M2
20104426,"Epithelial-stromal interaction and progesterone receptors in the mouse uterus.Healthy uterine function depends on the balanced interaction of the ovarian steroids estrogen and progesterone (P4) signaling through their respective receptors. The expression of each receptor is regulated by the other through crucial cross talk between the epithelial and stromal compartments. Ablation of the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) results in complete infertility in mice, and evidence increasingly demonstrates that the PR is a major mediator of epithelial-stromal cross talk and events leading to the disruption of this communication can lead to P4 resistance in the uterus. This resistance, through impaired P4 signaling, can be at the level of the PR itself, coregulators, and downstream effectors. The mechanisms underlying P4 resistance is of critical importance in women's health because this defect is seen in a wide variety of diseases including infertility, endometriosis, endometrial carcinoma, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and leiomyomas. By using mouse models of PR signaling, many of these mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated and aid in the development of effective therapies for treatment of uterine diseases.",M2
20100960,"Migraine history and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.PURPOSE Both migraine and breast cancer are hormonally mediated. Two recent reports indicate that women with a migraine history may have a lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer than those who never suffered migraines. This finding requires confirmation; in particular, an assessment of the influence of use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) is needed, because many studies indicate that NSAID use also may confer a reduction in breast cancer risk. METHODS We assessed the relationship between self-reported history of migraine and incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in 91,116 women enrolled on the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study prospective cohort from 1993 to 1998 at ages 50 to 79 years. Through September 15, 2005, there were 4,006 eligible patients with breast cancer diagnosed. Results Women with a history of migraine had a lower risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 98) than women without a migraine history. This risk did not vary by recent NSAID use. The lower risk was somewhat more pronounced for invasive estrogen-receptor-positive and progesterone-receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97), as no reduction in risk was observed for invasive ER-negative/<e>PR</e>-negative tumors (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.57), and this difference in risk estimates was borderline statistically significant (P = .06). CONCLUSION This study supports the hypothesis that a history of migraine is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer and that this relationship is independent of recent NSAID use.",M2
20096851,"Progesterone receptor expression and proliferative activity in uterine tumours of pet rabbits.Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common uterine tumour of domestic rabbits. The present immunohistochemical study examined the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19), the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 and telomerase in normal rabbit uterine tissue and examples of endometrial hyperplasia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Tubulopapillary adenomas and adenocarcinomas were the most common histological subtypes in this series. Cytoplasmic expression of CK19 was recorded in two of three samples of normal endometrium and in one of three samples of endometrial hyperplasia, in all adenomas and five of six adenocarcinomas. PR was expressed within the nucleus of normal endometrial cells and in one of three samples of endometrial hyperplasia, each of four adenomas and in four of six adenocarcinomas. This finding suggests that PR expression is not directly involved in neoplastic transformation of the endometrium and that such expression is not a prognostic indicator. Nuclear labelling of telomerase activity was found in one of three normal uteri, all samples of endometrial hyperplasia, two of four adenomas, but none of the adenocarcinomas. The proliferation index as determined by Ki-67 expression was 9.7+/-2.75% (mean+/- standard-deviation (SD)) for normal endometrium, 11.29+/-2.5% for hyperplastic endometrium, 19.40+/-3.01% for benign tumours and 19.41+/-7.9% for malignant tumours. These findings may be interpreted to suggest that hormonal and anti-proliferative treatment may be more appropriate for the management of uterine carcinomas in rabbits than anti-telomerase treatment.",M2
20095338,"[Clinicopathologic features and prognosis of triple negative breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of triple negative breast cancer. METHODS: The clinical datas of 477 patients of primary breast cancer which were diagnosed by pathology in the 4th Hospital of Hebei Medical University from Jan. 2004 to Dec. 2004 were analyzed. All of the patients were divided into two groups according to the results of immunohistochemistry: one was triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which included estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) negative and other was non-triple negative breast cancer. We compared TNBC with the group of non-triple negative breast cancer in the clinicopathologic features. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 477 patients, 12.6% (60/477) was TNBC patients in which 76.7% of age was younger than fifty years(46/60), 28.3% of T &gt; 5 cm (17/60), 68.3% of lymph nodes metastasis (41/60), 31.7% of grade III (19/60) and 13.3% of family history of breast cancer (8/60), (P &lt; 0. 05). Till June 2008, the median time of follow-up was 48 months (42-54 months). Local recurrence or distant metastasis were 26.7% (16/60) of TNBC which was higher than 15.3% (64/417) of non-triple negative cases; DFS was 68.3% in TNBC group and 79.6% in the non-triple negative breast cancer group. The OS was 81.7% in TNBC group and 90.9% in the non-triple negative breast cancer group (Log-Rank = 3.917, P = 0.048; Log-Rank = 4.838, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: These patients of triple negative breast carcinoma were usually young (age &lt; 50), with tumor growth fast, much more invasion and poorly prognosis.",M2
20090851,"Role of progesterone receptor polymorphisms in the recurrent spontaneous abortions: Indian case.BACKGROUND: We attempt to ascertain if the 3 linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Progesterone Receptor (<e>PR</e>) gene (exon 1: G 1031 C; S344T, exon 4: G 1978 T; L660V and exon 5: C 2310 T; H770H) and the PROGINS insertion in the intron G, between exons 7 and 8, are associated with Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion (RSA) in the Indian population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 143 women with RSA and 150 controls were sequenced for all the 8 exons looking for the above 3 linked SNPs of the PR gene earlier implicated in the RSA, as well as for any new SNPs that may be possibly found in the Indian population. PROGINS insertion was screened by electrophoresis. We did not find any new mutations, not observed earlier, in our population. Further, we did not find significant role of the *2 allele (representing the mutant allele at the three SNP loci) or the T2 allele (PROGINS insertion) in the manifestation of RSA. We also did not find an LD pattern between each of the 3 SNPs and the PROGINS insertion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the PR gene mutations may not play any exclusive role in the manifestation of RSA, and instead, given significantly higher frequency of the *2 allele among the normal women, we surmise if it does not really confer a protective role among the Indian populations, albeit further studies are required in the heterogeneous populations of this region before making any conclusive statement.",M2
20087430,"Progesterone action in human tissues: regulation by progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) isoform expression, nuclear positioning and coregulator expression.Progesterone is a critical regulator of normal female reproductive function, with diverse tissue-specific effects in the human. The effects of progesterone are mediated by its nuclear receptor (PR) that is expressed as two isoforms, PRA and PRB, which are virtually identical except that PRA lacks 164 amino acids that are present at the N-terminus of PRB. Considerable in vitro evidence suggests that the two PRs are functionally distinct and in animals, tissue-specific distribution patterns of PRA and PRB may account for some of the diversity of progesterone effects. In the human, PRA and PRB are equivalently expressed in most target cells, suggesting that alternative mechanisms control the diversity of progesterone actions. PR mediates the effects of progesterone by association with a range of coregulatory proteins and binding to specific target sequences in progesterone-regulated gene promoters. Ligand activation of PR results in redistribution into discrete subnuclear foci that are detectable by immunofluorescence, probably representing aggregates of multiple transcriptionally active PR-coregulator complexes. PR foci are aberrant in cancers, suggesting that the coregulator composition and number of complexes is altered. A large family of coregulators is now described and the range of proteins known to bind PR exceeds the complement required for transcriptional activation, suggesting that in the human, tissue-specific coregulator expression may modulate progesterone response. In this review, we examine the role of nuclear localization of PR, coregulator association and tissue-specific expression in modulating progesterone action in the human.",M2
20081807,"Aggressiveness of 'true' interval invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast in postmenopausal women.There is debate whether interval carcinomas differ from screen-detected tumours biologically. In this study, clinico-pathological parameters and the expression of well-validated biological markers were compared between 'true' interval carcinomas and screen-detected/missed carcinomas hypothesising that 'true' interval carcinomas show a more aggressive biological behaviour. The study group consisted of 92 consecutive postmenopausal women attending the breast screening programme and presenting with an invasive ductal carcinoma. All screening mammograms were re-reviewed. Sixteen patients had a 'true' interval carcinoma. Seven carcinomas were missed at screening, but detected on re-reviewing of the screening mammogram. Radiological characteristics were assessed from diagnostic mammograms. Data on patient- and tumour characteristics and follow-up data were recorded from hospital records. Median follow-up was 61 months. Immunohistochemistry for ER, <e>PR</e>, Her2/neu and p53 was performed on TMA sections. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. In univariate analysis, 'true' interval carcinomas were significantly larger (odd ratios (OR) 7.2, 95% CI 1.8-28.1) and less frequently ER (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9) and PR (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) positive. In multivariate analysis, 'true' interval carcinoma was independently associated with larger tumours (OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.4-36.2). A trend toward ER negativity was found (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.1). 'True' interval carcinomas showed a trend toward a decreased relapse-free survival (HR 1.7 95% CI 0.9-3.1). Although 'true' interval carcinomas were significantly larger than screen-detected/missed interval carcinomas, it remains challenging to observe parameters that determine this difference between 'true' interval carcinomas and screen-detected lesions.",M2

We have defined the expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), a biomarker previously identified for EC, and compared its expression to oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and E-cadherin. We found that L1CAM was absent in normal endometrium and the vast majority of endometrioid ECs (type 1) but was strongly expressed in serous and clear-cell ECs, considered as type 2. 78/272 cases were identified as L1CAM-positive endometrioid ECs that were correlated with a poor prognosis. Strikingly, we observed an inverse relationship between L1CAM and ER/PR/E-cadherin expression in all ECs. In mixed ECs, composed of endometrioid (L1CAM(-) ER/PR(+) E-cadherin(+)) and clear-cell/serous (L1CAM(+) ER/PR(-) E-cadherin(-)), both phenotypes were co-expressed. In some of these cases L1CAM was up-regulated at the leading edge of the tumour, where ER/PR and E-cadherin expression were selectively lost. In EC cell lines treated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer TGFbeta1, L1CAM and vimentin were strongly up-regulated, while E-cadherin expression was reduced. The treatment also resulted in an increased expression of the EMT transcription factor Slug and an enhanced cell invasion. Depletion of Slug by siRNA knockdown prevented both L1CAM up-regulation and enhanced cell invasion. According to our analysis, we suggest that L1CAM is a novel marker for EMT in ECs and that L1CAM-typing could identify endometrioid ECs that have type 2-like features and are at high risk for recurrence.",M2
20071307,"[Gene expression based multigene prognostic and predictive tests in breast cancer]Patient tailored therapy will serve the fundamentals of future cancer treatment. For this it will be imperative to characterize the tumor and to acquire precise predictive and prognostic information. We can achieve this by using not only monogenic (like ER, <e>PR</e>, HER-2, Ki-67) but also multigene assays, which can provide answers to several diagnostic questions simultaneously. We present a summary of currently available RT-PCR and microarray based multigene tests including MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, BLN Assay, Theros Breast Cancer Index SM, MapQuant DX, ARUP Breast Bioclassifier, Celera Metastatic Score, eXagen BCtm, Invasive Gene Signature, Wound Response Indicator and Mammostrat. Two of these (Oncotype DX and MammaPrint) are already incorporated in several diagnostic protocols. However, multiple unsolved issues deteriorate the value of these tests: generally the validation is poor, the gene sets do not confirm each other, the associated costs are high and the necessary bioinformatics is highly complex.",M2
20068186,"Use of four biomarkers to evaluate the risk of breast cancer subtypes in the women's contraceptive and reproductive experiences study.Epidemiologic studies suggest that some hormone-related risk factors in breast cancer differentially influence risk for disease subtypes classified by the status of the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/<e>PR</e>). However, it remains unclear whether human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or p53 expression status further differentiates these exposure-risk group associations. We evaluated the associations of oral contraceptive (OC) use and reproductive factors with incident invasive breast cancer subtypes among 1,197 population-based cases and 2,015 controls from the Los Angeles County or Detroit components of the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences Study. Case-control comparisons by ER/PR/HER2/p53 status were conducted by multivariable polychotomous unconditional logistic regression methods. We found that OC use was not associated with any breast cancer subtype as defined by ER/PR/HER2/p53 status, except for a 2.9-fold increased risk of so-called triple-negative tumors (ER(-)/PR(-)/HER2(-)) among women of 45 to 64 years of age who started OC use before age 18. Parity was associated with a decreased risk of luminal A (ER(+) or PR(+), HER2(-)), luminal B (ER(+) or PR(+)/HER2(+)), and ER(-)/PR(-)/HER2(+) tumors. Age at first full-term pregnancy was positively associated with luminal A tumors among older women. Neither of these reproductive factors was associated with triple-negative tumors. Long duration of breast-feeding lowered the risk of triple-negative and luminal A tumors. p53 status did not define further differential risk patterns. Our findings offer evidence of differences in the hormone-related risk factors between triple-negative cancers and other ER/PR/HER2-defined subtypes of breast cancer.",M2
20063045,"Interstitial Cajal-like cells of human Fallopian tube express  estrogen and progesterone receptors.Cells of the female reproductive tract are subject to hormonal control via sex steroid genomic receptors expressed at nuclear level. We previously showed that interstitial Cajal-like cells (ICLC) of human myometrium expressed estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/<e>PR</e>). Our aim, based on these results, was to see if ER and/or PR could be found also in tubal ICLC. Indeed, we present here immunohistochemical evidence that ICLC of human Fallopian tube (isthmic region) have such receptors. Stromal ICLC, as well as ICLC among smooth muscle layers, were identified in tissue sections by their morphological features (e.g. several very long, moniliform, prolongations of cell body) as well as by c-kit positivity, vital staining with methylene blue or silver impregnation. Additional evidence was provided by sequential staining for c-kit and for PR on the same cell, by 'sandwich method'. In vitro, the 4th passage cell cultures from Fallopian tube muscularis exhibiting ICLC morphology showed the presence of ER-alpha and/or PR-A by immunofluorescence. In conclusion, our data suggest that ICLC could function as steroid sensors, and might be implicated in Fallopian tube motility (via gap junctions or juxta- and/or paracrine mechanisms).",M2
20057162,"Endocrine traits of polycystic ovary syndrome in prenatally androgenized female Sprague-Dawley rats.Although hyperandrogenism is an important condition and is considered the possible pathogenesis behind polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), data supporting this is still scarce. We sought to determine whether or not prenatal androgen exposure leads to PCOS and the possible cellular mechanisms involved. To induce prenatal androgen exposure, pregnant rats were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of free testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from embryonic days 16 to 19, and their female offspring were studied as adults. The mRNA expression of the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) in the preoptic area (POA) hypothalamus was higher in the experimental groups than in the control group after ovariectomy and stimulation with estradiol benzoate. The levels of T, P, leutinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol were higher in the experimental groups than in the control groups. The frequency and magnitude of LH secretion was increased in experimental rats as compared with the control group. The anogenital distance of the experimental groups was prolonged and the nipple number was lower than that of the control group. Almost all experimental rats had prolonged or irregular estrous cycles. The experimental groups had fewer corpus luteum and preovulatory follicles and more preantral follicles and antral follicles than the controls. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excess androgen during the prenatal period may cause PCOS. Additionally, we show that hyperandrogenic interference in the release of preovulatory LH surges is mediated by the suppressive effects of androgens on PR expression in POA-hypothalamic tissue.",M2
20056218,"The selective progesterone receptor modulator CDB4124 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in uterine leiomyoma cells.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of selective P receptor (<e>PR</e>) modulator CDB4124 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle (LSM) cells and control myometrial smooth muscle (MSM) cells in matched uteri. DESIGN: Laboratory research. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal women (n = 12) undergoing hysterectomy for leiomyoma-related symptoms. INTERVENTION(S): Treatment of primary LSM and MSM cells with CDB4124 (10(-8)-10(-6) M) or vehicle for 24, 48, or 72 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Western blot for protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cleaved polyadenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose polymerase, Bcl-2, and Krüppel-like transcription factor 11; 93-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to evaluate viable cell numbers; and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. RESULT(S): Treatment with CDB4124 significantly decreased levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the number of viable LSM cells, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. On the other hand, treatment with CDB4124 increased levels of the apoptosis marker cleaved polyadenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose polymerase and the tumor suppressor Krüppel-like transcription factor 11 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in LSM cells. In matched MSM cells, however, CDB4124 did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis. CONCLUSION(S): CDB4124 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in LSM but not in MSM cells.",M2
19996493,"Effects of ovariectomy in prepubertal goats.The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of ovariectomy on mammary gland development in prepubertal goats and to validate this model to study mammogenesis in young dairy ruminants. In this experiment, 3 months of aged goats were ovariectomized (ovx) while shammed goats played as surgery controls (sham). Thereafter, sham and ovx goats were slaughtered at 7 months of age to provide tissue for the assays. Results demonstrated that proliferation of mammary of mammary epithelial cells was significantly lower in ovariectomized goats compared to control goats. In ovx animal, epithelium structures were completely overstretched and epithelial ducts were undeveloped with limited branching whereas control animals had classical complex arborescent units with multiple round ductules and limited stroma. Concerning ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha), <e>PR</e> (progesterone receptor) and P450 (aromatase) expression, results showed number of ERalpha, PR and P450 positive cells was higher in shammed goats compared to ovariectomized goats. All this results suggested that goat mammogenesis and ovarian control are similar to prepubertal heifers and that young goats are a good model to study mammary gland development in ruminants. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ovariectomy of prepubertal goats decreased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells with a profound alteration of cell adhesion molecules.",M2
20044859,"Lack of knowledge of hormone receptor status and use of endocrine therapy in invasive breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of understanding in women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer of the key clinical features of their disease that are important determinants in treatment decision making. METHODS: The 1684 women aged between 26 and 88 years at diagnosis enrolled in a 5-year cohort study were asked by questionnaire about their estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) status and about their past or current treatment with adjuvant endocrine therapy. Information was linked with their ER and PR status determined from the histopathology report. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between age and education status and the likelihood of being able to correctly report hormone receptor status, as well as the relationship between the likelihood of receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy and knowledge of hormone receptor status in women who were ER or PR positive. RESULTS: Not being able to correctly report hormone receptor status was associated with being older and having a lower level of education. Of women who were ER positive or PR positive or both and were at least 40 weeks from diagnosis, having received some form of endocrine therapy was significantly associated with self-identification as being ER or PR positive (OR=1.82, 95% CI 1.24-2.68, p=0.002), even when age was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: That self-knowledge of hormone receptor status was independently associated with likelihood of receiving endocrine therapy suggests that the methods of helping women understand the nature of their breast cancer are worthy of review.",M2
20044629,"Statins and breast cancer in postmenopausal women without hormone therapy.BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on the association between statin use and risk of breast cancer among overweight or obese postmenopausal women who have never used hormone therapy (HT) is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Fargo, ND, USA. Cases were overweight or obese, postmenopausal White women without a history of HT use who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Controls were White women without clinical cancer who were seen at the same hospital for an annual physical examination. RESULTS: From a patient population aged 55 to 81 years old, data were obtained on 95 cases and 94 controls. Overall, there was no association between the use of statins and breast cancer risk odds ratio (OR)=1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-2.5). However, risk varied by hormone receptor status. Compared to non-users, obese women who used hydrophobic statins had an elevated risk of progesterone receptor-negative (<e>PR</e>(-)) breast cancer OR=4.0 (95% CI 1.2-13.8), but not of tumors with other hormone receptor profiles. The risk for breast cancer was also significantly increased among overweight women who used hydrophobic statins for less than or equal to 4 years OR=4.1 (95% CI 1.2-14.4). CONCLUSION: This observational study found an increased risk of breast cancer related to duration of statins use and PR(-) among postmenopausal women.",M2
20043998,"In vitro characterization of ZK 230211--A type III progesterone receptor antagonist with enhanced antiproliferative properties.The progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) is a key regulator of female reproductive functions. Compounds with progesterone inhibiting effects (PR antagonists) have found numerous utilities in female reproductive health, ranging from contraception to potential treatment of progesterone-dependent diseases like uterine leiomyomas. Based on in vitro characteristics such as DNA binding activity and partial agonistic transcriptional behavior in the presence of protein kinase A activators (cyclic-AMP), three types of PR modulators with antagonistic properties have been defined. In this study, we analyzed the in vitro characteristics of the PR antagonist ZK 230211 in comparison to the classical antagonists onapristone and mifepristone. We focused on PR actions in genomic signaling pathways, including DNA binding activity, nuclear localization and association with the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) as well as actions in non-genomic signaling, such as the activation of c-Src kinase signaling and cyclin D1 gene promoter activity. ZK 230211 represents a type of PR antagonist with increased inhibitory properties in comparison to mifepristone and onapristone. When liganded to the progesterone receptor, ZK 230211 induces a strong and persistent binding to its target response element (PRE) and increases NCoR recruitment in CV-1 cells. Furthermore, ZK 230211 displays less agonistic properties with regard to the association of PR isoform B and the cytoplasmic c-Src kinase in HeLa cells. It represses T47D cell cycle progression, in particular estradiol-induced S phase entry. In summary, our studies demonstrate ZK 230211 to be a type III progesterone receptor antagonist which is characterized by very strong DNA binding activity and strong antiproliferative effects in the cancer cell lines HeLa and T47D.",M2
20043345,"Fractionated evaluation of immunohistochemical hormone receptor expression enhances prognostic prediction in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy.OBJECTIVE: To compare the prognostic prediction between dichotomized and fractionated evaluations of hormone receptor expressions. METHODS: Patients with stages I-III breast cancers, who received adjuvant tamoxifen, were enrolled. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A fractionated score (F score), the percentage of positive-staining nuclei (0=none, 1=1%-10%, 2=11%-30%, 3=31%-50%, 4=51%-70%, and 5=71%-100%), was assigned to each case. The dichotomized scoring method defines an F score &gt;1 as positive. The prognostic values of both scores were compared by multiple Cox's proportional hazard models of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixteen patients with a median follow-up of 78.0 months were included. F scores for ER and PR correlated directly with DFS and OS. Although both the dichotomized and fractionated ER and PR scores were significantly associated with DFS and OS in univariate analyses, only fractionated ER and PR scores remained as independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS in the final multiple Cox's proportional hazard models. CONCLUSION: Fractionated IHC hormone receptor expression evaluation enhances the prognostic prediction compared with a dichotomized assessment.",M2
20029965,"A mouse model to dissect progesterone signaling in the female reproductive tract and mammary gland.Considering the regulatory complexities of progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) action throughout the female reproductive axis and mammary gland, we generated a mouse model that enables conditional ablation of PR function in a spatiotemporal specific manner. Exon 2 of the murine PR gene was floxed to generate a conditional PR allele (PR(flox)) in mice. Crossing the PR(flox/flox) mouse with the ZP3-cre transgenic demonstrated that the PR(flox) allele recombines to a PR null allele (PR(d)). Mice homozygous for the recombined null PR allele (PR(d/d)) exhibit uterine, ovarian, and mammary gland defects that phenocopy those of our previously described PR knockout (PRKO) model. Therefore, this conditional mouse model for PR ablation represents an invaluable resource with which to further define in a developmental and/or reproductive stage-specific manner the individual and integrative roles of distinct PR populations resident in multiple progesterone-responsive target sites.",M2
20026682,"Silencing of the JNK pathway maintains progesterone receptor activity in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells exposed to oxidative stress signals.Survival of the conceptus is dependent on continuous progesterone signaling in the maternal decidua but how this is achieved under conditions of oxidative stress that characterize early pregnancy is unknown. Using primary cultures, we show that modest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase sumoylation in human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), leading to enhanced modification and transcriptional inhibition of the progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>). The ability of ROS to induce a sustained hypersumoylation response, or interfere with PR activity, was lost upon differentiation of HESCs into decidual cells. Hypersumoylation in response to modest levels of ROS requires activation of the JNK pathway. Although ROS-dependent JNK signaling is disabled on decidualization, the cells continue to mount a transcriptional response, albeit distinct from that observed in undifferentiated HESCs. We further show that attenuated JNK signaling in decidual cells is a direct consequence of altered expression of key pathway modulators, including induction of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1). Overexpression of MKP1 dampens JNK signaling, prevents hypersumoylation, and maintains PR activity in undifferentiated HESCs exposed to ROS. Thus, JNK silencing uncouples ROS signaling from the SUMO conjugation pathway and maintains progesterone responses and cellular homeostasis in decidual cells under oxidative stress conditions imposed by pregnancy.",M2
20019164,"Progesterone receptor A mediates VIP inhibition of contraction.The slow transit time of the colon in females with constipation is due to impairment of agonist-induced contraction. The impairment is associated with downregulation of G proteins that mediate contraction and upregulation of Gs proteins that mediate relaxation. These changes are caused by overexpression of progesterone (P4) receptors in the colon, rendering its muscle cells sensitive to physiological P4 concentrations. Downregulation of Gq/11 is mediated by P4 receptor B (<e>PR</e>-B). We examined whether upregulation of Gs proteins increased the inhibition of contraction and whether the increase is mediated by the P4 receptor A (PR-A). These studies were conducted in colon-isolated colon muscle cells from human control and slow-transit constipation (STC) females and from guinea pigs. Muscle cell contraction was induced by CCK-8. Inhibition of contraction was induced by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and 8'bromo-c'AMP (8B-c'AMP) G protein levels were determined by Western blot. VIP-induced inhibition of contraction was greater in muscle cells from STC and P4-treated muscle cells. There were no differences in the inhibition induced by 8B-c'AMP between muscle cells from STC and P4-treated controls. The increased VIP-induced inhibition of muscle cells treated with P4 was blocked by pretreatment with PR-A antibodies and unaffected by PR-B antibodies. These antibodies had no effect on 8B-c'AMP induced-inhibition. The P4 upregulation of Gs proteins was blocked by PR-A antibodies and unaffected by PR-B antibodies. Similar results were obtained in muscle cells from guinea pig colons. We concluded that P4 upregulation of Gs proteins increases VIP-induced inhibition of contraction mediated by PR-A.",M2
20010529,"Relation between pathomorphological response in tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinico-morphological and molecular prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer.AIM: To determine the correlation between tumor pathomorphological response (PMR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and clinico-morphological and molecular prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer (BC), and to determine the possible impact of the PMR and estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>) and Her-2/neu BC status on the disease course. METHODS: The data from the medical history of patients on IIB stage (T2N1M0, T3N0M0) (n = 247), who received treatment with NACT, were used. The correlation between the parameters was determined using the Spearman's coefficient. Patient's survival was analyzed by Kaplan - Meier method. The association between PMR grades with the risk of disease relapse was estimated by Cox's regression analysis. RESULTS: PMR grade correlated with tumor differentiation grade (rho = 0.38; p 0.05) and BC subtypes (rho = 0.05; p &gt; 0.05). The patients with the same PMR grades didn't differ by the number of lymph node metastases (p &gt; 0.05) and differed by the presence of embolus in tumor vessels (p 0.05). The risk of disease relapse depended on PMR grade: for grade 2-3 it was significantly decreased (HR = 0.71, 95% CI - 0.25-2.9, p = 0.0037), and for grade 4-5 it was the highest (HR = -1.23, 95% CI - 0.24-5.05, P = 0.0001), while 0-1 grade had no impact on the risk of disease relapse (HR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.38; p = 0.7). CONCLUSION: The data of combined clinical, histological and immunohistochemical analysis have shown that PMR grades may serve as the criteria for individualization of adjuvant treatment of the patients with locally advanced BC.",M2
20010525,"Association between polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene and clinical parameters in breast cancer.BACKGROUND: A C/T transition - rs4987117 (the Thr1915Met polymorphism) and an A/G transition - rs11571653 (the Met784Val polymorphism) in the BRCA2 gene were linked to breast cancer risk in Polish and Japanese populations, respectively. AIM: To study the association between polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene and clinical parameters in breast cancer. METHODS: Both polymorphisms were evaluated by RFLP - PCR in blood samples obtained from 117 women with sporadic breast cancer. Patients were stratified by genotype, Bloom - Richardson grade, TNM stage, estrogene and progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>) status and the linkages of each genotype with each stratum were calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Variant genotypes and alleles of both polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene were inversely related to hormone receptor status for a group of patients with at least one positive receptor status as compared to a group with both receptors negative status (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.95, p = 0.043 and OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 - 0.82, p = 0.013 for Met1915Met homozygote and 1915Met allele, respectively and OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 - 0.13, p = 0.0005 and OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.88, p = 0.021, for Val784Val homozygote and the 784Val allele. No association was found between both polymorphisms and Bloom - Richardson grading and TNM staging. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variant genotypes of the Thr1915Met and Met784Val polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene may be indicative factors in therapy of ductal breast cancer.",M2
20008677,"DC-SCRIPT: nuclear receptor modulation and prognostic significance in primary breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>)-B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and retinoic acid receptor alpha, have been implicated in breast cancer etiology and progression. We investigated the role of dendritic cell-specific transcript (DC-SCRIPT) as coregulator of these nuclear receptors and as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. METHODS: The effect of DC-SCRIPT on the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. DC-SCRIPT expression in normal and tumor tissue from breast cancer patients was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of tumor DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression was assessed in three independent cohorts of breast cancer patients: a discovery group (n = 47) and a validation group (n = 97) (neither of which had received systemic adjuvant therapy) and in a tamoxifen-treated validation group (n = 68) by using a DC-SCRIPT to porphobilinogen deaminase transcript ratio cutoff of 0.15 determined in the discovery group. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model analyses were performed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: DC-SCRIPT suppressed ER- and PR-mediated transcription in a ligand-dependent fashion, whereas it enhanced the retinoic acid receptor alpha- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated transcription. In breast tissue samples from nine patients, DC-SCRIPT mRNA was expressed at lower levels in the tumor than in the corresponding normal tissue (P = .010). Patients in the discovery group with high tumor DC-SCRIPT mRNA levels (66%) had a longer disease-free interval than those with a low DC-SCRIPT mRNA level (34%) (hazard ratio [HR] of recurrence for high vs low DC-SCRIPT level = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06 to 0.93, P = .039), which was confirmed in the validation group (HR of recurrence = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.95, P = .034). This prognostic value was confined to patients with ER- and/or PR-positive tumors (discovery group: HR of recurrence = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.89, P = .030; validation group: HR of recurrence = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.91, P = .028) and was also observed in the second validation group (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.97, P = .040). DC-SCRIPT was an independent prognostic factor after correction for tumor size, lymph node status, and adjuvant therapy (n = 145; HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.85, P = .010). CONCLUSION: DC-SCRIPT is a key regulator of nuclear receptor activity that has prognostic value in breast cancer.",M2
20008003,"Partial agonist activity of the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486 mediated by an amino-terminal domain coactivator and phosphorylation of serine400.Jun dimerization protein-2 (JDP-2) is a progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) coregulatory protein that acts by inducing structure and transcriptional activity in the disordered amino-terminal domain (NTD) of PR. JDP-2 can also potentiate the partial agonist activity of the PR antagonist RU486 by mechanisms that have not been defined. Functional mutagenesis experiments revealed that a subregion of the NTD (amino acids 323-427) was required for the partial agonist activity of RU486 induced by PR interaction with JDP-2. However, this subregion was not required for JDP-2 enhancement of the activity of progestin agonists. Mutation of phosphorylation sites within this region of the NTD showed that phosphorylation of serine 400 was required for the partial agonist activity of RU486 stimulated by JDP-2, but was not required for activity of hormone agonist, either in the presence or absence of JDP-2. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A is a novel PR coregulator that binds the NTD and acts by phosphorylating steroid receptor coactivator-1 and modulating steroid receptor coactivator-1 interaction with PR. Cdk2/cyclin A also potentiated the partial agonist activity of RU486; however, phosphorylation of serine 400 was not required, indicating that JDP-2 and Cdk2/cyclin A act by distinct mechanisms. We conclude that PR bound to RU486 and associated with JDP-2 adopts an active conformation in a subregion of the NTD requiring phosphorylation of serine 400 that is distinct from that promoted by progestin agonists. These data underscore the structural flexibility of the NTD of PR, and the ability of steroid ligands together with interacting proteins to affect the conformation and activity of the NTD.",M2
20000807,"Na(+) and K(+) allosterically regulate cooperative DNA binding by the human progesterone receptor.Cooperativity is a common mechanism used by transcription factors to generate highly responsive yet stable gene regulation. For the two isoforms of human progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>-A and PR-B), differences in cooperative DNA binding energetics may account for their differing transcriptional activation properties. Here we report on the molecular origins responsible for cooperativity, finding that it can be activated or repressed with Na(+) and K(+), respectively. We demonstrate that PR self-association and DNA-dependent cooperativity are linked to a monovalent cation binding event and that this binding is coupled to modulation of receptor structure. K(+) and Na(+) are therefore allosteric effectors of PR function. Noting that the apparent binding affinities of Na(+) and K(+) are comparable to their intracellular concentrations and that PR isoforms directly regulate the genes of a number of ion pumps and channels, these results suggest that Na(+) and K(+) may additionally function as physiological regulators of PR action.",M2
19996973,"N-acetyltransferase 2, exposure to aromatic and heterocyclic amines, and receptor-defined breast cancer.The role of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphism in breast cancer is still unclear. We explored the associations between potential sources of exposure to aromatic and heterocyclic amines (AHA), acetylation status and receptor-defined breast cancer in 1020 incident cases and 1047 population controls of the German GENICA study. Acetylation status was assessed as slow or fast. Therefore, NAT2 haplotypes were estimated using genotype information from six NAT2 polymorphisms. Most probable haplotypes served as alleles for the deduction of NAT2 acetylation status. The risks of developing estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>)-positive or negative tumors were estimated for tobacco smoking, consumption of red meat, grilled food, coffee, and tea, as well as expert-rated occupational exposure to AHA with logistic regression conditional on age and adjusted for potential confounders. Joint effects of these factors and NAT2 acetylation status were investigated. Frequent consumption of grilled food and coffee showed higher risks in slow acetylators for receptor-negative tumors [grilled food: ER-: odds ratio (OR) 2.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-6.14 for regular vs. rare; coffee: ER-: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.22-5.33 for &gt;or=4 vs. 0 cups/day]. We observed slightly higher risks for never smokers that are fast acetylators for receptor-positive tumors compared with slow acetylators (ER-: OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00-1.73). Our results support differing risk patterns for receptor-defined breast cancer. However, the modifying role of NAT2 for receptor-defined breast cancer is difficult to interpret in the light of complex mixtures of exposure to AHA.",M2
19996549,"Changes in the levels of progesterone receptor mRNA and protein in the bovine corpus luteum during the estrous cycle.Progesterone (P4) is synthesized in the luteal cells of many species. The objective of the present study was to determine the expression pattern of P4 receptor (<e>PR</e>) mRNA and the distribution of PR protein in the bovine corpus luteum (CL) during the estrous cycle. The gene expression of PR in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle was determined by real-time PCR analysis, and the PR protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Messenger RNA of PR was clearly expressed in the CL throughout the estrous cycle. The level of PR mRNA in the CL was highest at the early stage of the estrous cycle and was higher at the mid and late stages than at the regressed stage (P&lt;0.01). In regard to the distribution of PR, the protein was expressed in both small and large luteal cells and in vascular endothelial cells throughout the estrous cycle. These results suggest that P4 has a role in regulating luteal and endothelial cell function in the bovine CL, especially at the early luteal stage as an autocrine/paracrine regulator.",M2
19961842,"Clinical significance of Stratifin, ERalpha and <e>PR</e> promoter methylation in tumor and serum DNA in Indian breast cancer patients.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the concordance of promoter methylation of stratifin, ERalpha and PR in tumor and circulating DNA in breast cancer patients and their association with clinicopathological parameters and disease prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Methylation specific PCR were carried out to investigate the promoter methylation status of stratifin, ERalpha and PR in tumor and circulating DNA in 100 breast cancer patients in a prospective study. The effect of promoter methylation on protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Significant association was observed between promoter methylation of stratifin in tumors (61%) and paired sera (56%) (r=0.78; p &lt; or = 0.001). Loss of stratifin expression was observed in 47% tumors and was associated with poor overall survival (p=0.05). Significant correlation was observed between methylation status of ERalpha with PRB (p&lt;0.0001, OR=20.8, 95% CI=7.4-58.0) and stratifin (p=0.003, OR=2.0, 95% CI=0.8-4.4). CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential utility of serum DNA methylation of these genes as surrogate for tumor DNA methylation as a promising tool for cancer diagnosis.",M2
19959188,"Predictors of axillary lymph node involvement in women with T3 breast cancers: analysis of 1988-2003 SEER data.BACKGROUND: We investigated characteristics associated with axillary lymph node (LN) status in patients with T3 breast cancers and hypothesized that LN status is an independent predictor of survival. METHODS: Characteristics associated with axillary LN metastasis among women with T3 breast cancers were identified from the 1988-2003 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The primary outcome was breast cancer-specific mortality. Cox models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 12,778 patients with T3 breast cancers were analyzed (8201 LN+, 3695 LN-, 882 unknown). LN+ patients were more likely to be &lt;50 y, married, and have ER+/<e>PR</e>+, grade 3 invasive ductal cancers (P&lt;0.01 for each). Most patients underwent mastectomy (87.4%). Post-mastectomy radiation was more commonly used in LN+ patients (P&lt;0.01). LN+ patients had higher breast cancer-specific mortality (36.2% versus 16.4%, P&lt;0.01) and were more likely to die during the follow-up period (aHR = 2.87, 95% CI: 2.62-3.15) compared with LN- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the SEER database indicated that several patient and tumor characteristics predict a higher likelihood of axillary LN involvement in patients with T3 breast cancers. LN status was an independent predictor of survival in women with T3 breast cancers.",M2
19952285,"Long-range transcriptional control of progesterone receptor gene expression.Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binds to specific target DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (EREs), to regulate estrogen-responsive gene expression. The progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) gene has been used extensively as a marker of estrogen responsiveness. Although we previously identified cis elements within 1 kb of the PR-B transcription start site that are associated with ERalpha and help to confer estrogen responsiveness, the identification of ERalpha binding sites far removed from the transcription start site suggested that long-range regulation of this gene may occur. We now show that eight regions of the PR gene from 311 kb upstream to 4 kb downstream of the PR-B transcription start site interact with ERalpha and that coactivator proteins and acetylated histones are selectively associated with these gene regions. Specific PR gene regions confer estrogen responsiveness to a heterologous reporter plasmid, and mutation of EREs within these regions diminishes estrogen-induced transactivation. Importantly, chromosome conformation capture assays reveal ERalpha- and ligand-dependent interactions between proximal and distal PR gene regions. Taken together, our studies suggest that distal regions of the PR gene participate in the dynamic regulation of this gene and that the coordinated action of proximal and distal PR gene regions allows cells to respond to changes in hormone levels with extraordinary versatility and sensitivity.",M2
19949674,"Impact of grade, hormone receptor, and HER-2 status in women with breast cancer on response to specific chemotherapeutic agents by in vitro adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay.This study was designed to assess whether histological and biological factors of breast cancer can predict chemoresponse to specific agents. Adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) was employed to retrieve chemoresponse to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxetaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and paclitaxel in 49 patients. Tumors with high histologic and nuclear grade have higher response rate to doxorubicin (P&lt;0.05) and palitaxel (P&lt;0.05). Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors respond well to doxorubicin (P=0.038), and progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>)-negative tumors to 5-FU (P=0.039), doxetaxel (P=0.038), doxorubicin (P=0.000), epirubicin (P=0.010), and paclitaxel (P=0.003). Among the breast cancer subtypes determined by ER, PR, and HER-2 immunohistochemical stains, the HER-2+/ER- subtype has a higher response rate to doxorubicin (P=0.008). This in vitro result suggests that the combination of histologic and nuclear grade, hormone receptor, and HER-2 status can be a predictive factor of response to specific chemotherapy agents. Further in vivo study should be followed for clinical trials.",M2
19941958,"Mechanism of action of bolandiol (19-nortestosterone-3beta,17beta-diol), a unique anabolic steroid with androgenic, estrogenic, and progestational activities.Bolandiol is a synthetic anabolic steroid that increases lean body mass and bone mineral density without significant stimulation of sex accessory glands in castrate adult male rats. Since bolandiol suppresses gonadotropins and endogenous testosterone (T) production, we investigated its mechanism of action. We compared the potency of bolandiol in vitro and in vivo with T, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 19-nortestosterone (19-NT) and estradiol (E(2)). Bolandiol bound with lower affinity to the recombinant rat androgen receptor (AR) than the other androgens and had low, but measurable, affinity for recombinant human progestin receptors (<e>PR</e>-A, PR-B), and estrogen receptors (ERalpha and beta-1). Functional agonist activity was assessed in transcription assays mediated by AR, PR, or ER. Bolandiol was stimulatory in all these assays, but only 4-9% as potent as T, DHT, and 19-NT via AR, 1% as potent as progesterone via PR, and 3% and 1% as potent as E(2) acting through ERalpha or ERbeta, respectively. In immature castrate rats, bolandiol was equipotent to T in stimulating growth of the levator ani muscle but less potent than T in stimulating growth of the sex accessory glands. Bolandiol also stimulated uterine weight increases in immature female rats, which were partly blocked by ICI 182,780, but it was not aromatized in vitro by recombinant human aromatase. In contrast to T, stimulation of sex accessory gland weights by bolandiol was not inhibited by concomitant treatment with the dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride. As bolandiol exhibits tissue selectivity in vivo, it may act via AR, PR, and/or ER, utilize alternative signaling pathway(s) or transcriptional coregulators, and/or be metabolized to a more potent selective steroid.",M2
19940123,"Nuclear factor 1 synergizes with progesterone receptor on the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter wrapped around a histone H3/H4 tetramer by facilitating access to the central hormone-responsive elements.Steroid hormones induce transcription of their responsive genes by complex mechanisms including synergism between the hormone receptors and other transcription factors. On the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter progesterone induction is mediated by the reciprocal synergism between progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and the ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor 1 (NF1). PR binding mediates ATP-dependent displacement of histone H2A and H2B, enabling NF1 access to its target site. In minichromosomes assembled in vitro NF1 binding facilitates access of PR to the hormone-responsive elements (HREs) by precluding reforming of the histone octamer, but the function of NF1 in living cells remains unclear. Here we show that depleting NF1 by small interfering RNAs or mutating the NF1-binding site significantly compromises transcription of the MMTV promoter. The central HREs 2 and 3 are not needed for ATP-dependent H2A/H2B displacement or NF1 binding but are critical for full PR binding and MMTV transactivation. We found that NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter on a H3/H4 histone tetramer particle exposes the central HREs and facilitates their binding by PR, suggesting a possible mechanism for the reciprocal synergism between PR and NF1.",M2
19932916,"Treatment of advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma with aromatase inhibitors.BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are sometimes used in the treatment of selected patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS), but there are few data assessing the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in this setting. METHODS: We performed a retrospective electronic medical record review of patients with uterine LMS treated with an aromatase inhibitor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1998 and 2008. We assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response among patients with measurable disease and explored the correlation of hormone receptor status with outcome. RESULTS: Forty patients with advanced or recurrent uterine LMS were treated with aromatase inhibitors. Thirty-four patients had measurable disease. Hormone receptor status for these patients was as follows: estrogen receptor (ER) positive-22, ER negative-9, ER unknown-3, progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) positive-10, PR negative-10, PR unknown-14. Aromatase inhibitors used were letrozole (in 74% of patients), anastrozole (21%), and exemestane (6%). Median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.8-5.1). The 1-year PFS rate was 28% (95% CI: 11-48%) for ER and/or PR positive uterine LMS. Best objective response was partial response (PR) in 3/34 patients (9%) (all of whom were ER positive). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with mostly low-volume and ER positive uterine LMS, aromatase inhibitors achieved objective response in only 9%. Relatively prolonged PFS was observed among ER positive uterine LMS patients. In the absence of a no-treatment control group, the prolonged PFS cannot be attributed solely to the activity of the aromatase inhibitor treatment since it may reflect the underlying biology of low-volume, ER positive uterine LMS.",M2
19929576,"Interferon-alpha is involved in the luteinizing hormone-induced differentiation of rat preovulatory granulosa cells.A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers physiological changes within the ovarian follicles, including reprogramming to induce terminal differentiation of the granulosa cells (GCs). Cytokines are members of a large regulatory network that resides in the ovaries and are involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and gamete production. Recently we found that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) was overexpressed in LH-treated preovulatory GCs, as determined by a microarray analysis. In this study, we evaluated the expression of IFN-alpha and its role in the differentiation of rat preovulatory GCs. Rat GCs were treated with LH in vitro or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in vivo, both of which are well-known inducers of differentiation, and IFN-alpha production and cell differentiation were determined. Stimulation of rat primary GCs with LH or hCG increased expression of IFN-alpha. LH treatment led to increased phosphorylation of PI3-K and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and specific inhibitors for PI3-K and ERK suppressed the LH-induced IFN-alpha expression in preovulatory GCs. Furthermore, treatment with anti-rat IFN-alpha blocking antibody delayed the LH-induced differentiation of GCs and suppressed the expression of ovulation-related genes, including progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). These results indicate that LH induces IFN-alpha expression in preovulatory GCs via a PI3-K/ERK signaling pathway and that interferon-alpha production may be involved in the LH-induced differentiation of preovulatory GCs in rats.",M2
19913568,"New-D-homoandrost-4,6-diene derivatives as potent progesterone receptor antagonist.The aim of this study was to synthesize three different D-homoandrostadiene derivatives (2-4) and study their biological activity. We carried out in vivo and in vitro experiments using female cycling mice, which were synchronized for estrus with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and injected with the steroidal compounds. It was also determined the binding of these compounds to the progesterone receptors (<e>PR</e>). Since these steroids have a new D-homoandrostandienone skeleton in their molecular structure, it was of interest also to study their binding to the androgen receptors (AR). After LHRH treatment, the mice of the control group showed the presence of 14+/-4 corpus lutea in the ovary whereas the animals treated with steroids 2-4, with RBAs of 100%, exhibited 11+/-7, 12+/-2, and 10+/-4 respectively. As a result of this study, it is evident that these steroids did not inhibit the ovulation in these animals. The uterus of the control group, showed the typical progestational activity with an enlarged endometrial thickness with a secretory activity. However, the endometrium of the mice treated with steroids 2-4 did not show an enlargement of the endometrium and no secretory activity could be detected. This fact indicates that compounds 2-4 had antagonistic activity in this tissue. The overall data show that steroids 2-4 are antagonists of the PR. However, they do not bind to the AR. These results also demonstrate that 2-4 have an antiprogestational activity in vivo, but do not decrease the number of corpus lutea in the ovary of mice treated with LHRH.",M2
19912364,"Automated image analysis for high-throughput quantitative detection of ER and <e>PR</e> expression levels in large-scale clinical studies: the TEAM Trial Experience.AIMS: Routine immunohistochemistry is regarded as a semiquantitative method for the evaluation of in situ protein expression. Analysis of tissue biomarkers in large clinical trials is central to the development of novel targeted approaches to therapy, requires the analysis of tens of thousands of data points, and frequently makes use of high-throughput analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of image analysis for accurate and reproducible quantitative evaluation of biomarkers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We showed, in 397 cases of breast cancer from the Phase III TEAM clinical trial, excellent correlations between semiautomated image analysis of TMAs and manual scoring of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels (interclass correlation coefficients 0.93 and 0.96 respectively). Two or more TMA cores were excellently correlated with manual scores, and using more than three cores increased the number of cases available for analysis to &gt;92%. TMAs are confirmed as representative of whole sections for immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue biomarkers ER and PR. CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated image analysis is appropriate for the analysis of tissue biomarkers within large clinical trials. These data provide support for the use of TMAs and image analysis in translational research.",M2
19900140,"Prognostic markers for coexistent carcinoma in high-risk endometrial hyperplasia with negative D-score: significance of morphometry, hormone receptors and apoptosis for outcome prediction.OBJECTIVES: Hysterectomy represents the current routine therapy for high-risk endometrial precancers. More sophisticated methods are needed for treatment decision among women who want to preserve fertility and seriously ill patients. Among women diagnosed with high-risk hyperplasia, approximately 40% show signs of endometrial cancer in the hysterectomy specimen. Thus, more sophisticated methods are needed to select the women at risk. SETTING: University Hospital of Tromsø, Regional Center for Gynecological Oncology in northern Norway. POPULATION: From 1999 to 2004, 258 consecutive patients had endometrial hyperplasia diagnosed by D-score; 57 among these were high-risk cases (D-score &lt; 0) and 10 had coexisting endometrial carcinoma. No further cancers were detected after long-term follow-up (4-10 years). DESIGN: From the initial histological specimens, material from the 10 patients with cancer and from the 13 cases without cancer (high-risk D-score &lt; 0) was analyzed with selected histomorphometric (architectural and nuclear) and immunohistochemical (hormone receptors and apoptotic) features blinded to the investigator. METHOD: Original slides were used for computerized histomorphometry (4-class rule and related procedures). Serial sections from the paraffin embedded material were used for immunohistochemical investigations. Immunohistochemical expression in glands and stroma was evaluated by the semi-quantitative H-score (ER-alpha, ER-beta, <e>PR</e>-A, PR-B, RCAS-1, Bcl-2, BAX, and Caspase-3). RESULTS: The histomorphometric 4-class rule differentiates between presence and absence of cancers with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 77%. Several morphometric and immunohistochemical features were significantly different in cases with cancer and hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Histomorphometry seems superior in predicting coexistent carcinoma in high-risk endometrial hyperplasia and should be considered for clinical use.",M2
19898850,"Triple-negative breast cancer: correlation between imaging and pathological findings.OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the mammography and ultrasound findings of triple-negative breast cancer and to compare the results with characteristics of ER-positive/<e>PR</e>-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer and ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancer. METHODS: From January 2007 to October 2008, mammography and ultrasound findings of 245 patients with pathologically confirmed triple-negative (n = 87), ER-positive/PR-negative/HER2-negative (n = 93) or ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancers (n = 65) were retrospectively reviewed. We also reviewed pathological reports for information on the histological type, histological grade and the status of the biological markers. RESULTS: Triple-negative breast cancers showed a high histological grade. On mammography, triple-negative breast cancers usually presented with a mass (43/87, 49%) or with focal asymmetry (19/87, 22%), and were less associated with calcifications. On ultrasound, the cancers were less frequently seen as non-mass lesions (12/87, 14%), more likely to have circumscribed margins (43/75, 57%), were markedly hypoechoic (36/75, 57%) and less likely to show posterior shadowing (4/75, 5%). Among the three types of breast cancers, ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancers most commonly had associated calcifications (52/65, 79%) on mammography and were depicted as non-mass lesions (21/65, 32%) on ultrasound. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the imaging findings might be useful in diagnosing triple-negative breast cancer.",M2
19898422,"Estrogen receptor-beta expression in invasive breast cancer in relation to molecular phenotype: results from the Nurses' Health Study.The expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and related genes has emerged as one of the major determinants of molecular classification of invasive breast cancers. Expression of a second ER, estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta), has not been previously evaluated in a large population-based study. Therefore, we examined ER-beta expression in a large population of women with breast cancer to assess its relationship to molecular categories of invasive breast cancer. We constructed tissue microarrays from paraffin blocks of 3093 breast cancers that developed in women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Tissue microarray sections were immunostained for ER-alpha, progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and with a monoclonal antibody to ER-beta. Cancers were categorized as luminal A (ER-alpha+ and/or PR+ and HER2-); luminal B (ER-alpha+ and/or PR+ and HER2+); HER2 (ER-alpha- and PR- and HER2+); and basal-like (ER-alpha-, PR-, HER2- and EGFR or cytokeratin 5/6+). The relationship between expression of ER-beta and molecular class of invasive breast cancer was analyzed. Overall, 68% of breast carcinomas were ER-beta+. Expression of ER-beta was significantly associated with expression of ER-alpha (P&lt;0.0001) and PR (P&lt;0.0001), and was inversely related to expression of HER2 (P=0.004), CK5/6 (P=0.02) and EGFR (P=0.006). Among 2170 invasive cancers with complete immunophenotypic data, 73% were luminal A, 5% luminal B, 6 % HER2 and 11% basal-like. ER-beta expression was significantly related to molecular category (P&lt;0.0001) and was more common in luminal A (72% of cases) and B (68% of cases) than in HER2 or basal-like types. However, despite their being defined by the absence of ER-alpha expression, 55% of HER2-type and 60% of basal-like cancers showed expression of ER-beta. The role of ER-beta in the development and progression of breast cancers defined by lack of expression of ER-alpha merits further investigation.",M2
19897621,"Expression of progesterone receptor related to the polymorphism in the PGR gene in the rabbit reproductive tract.The association of the 2464G &gt; A SNP found in the promoter region of the rabbit progesterone receptor gene with progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>) expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. This SNP was associated with 2 lines divergently selected for uterine capacity, the high line selected to increase uterine capacity and the low line selected to decrease uterine capacity. Two progesterone isoforms were obtained using a commercial monoclonal antibody: the PR-B isoform described previously in rabbits, and the PR-A isoform, not described previously in rabbits. The GG genotype, the genotype more frequent in the high line, showed less PR-B and PR-A expression than the AA genotype in the oviduct (GG/AA(PR-B) = 0.81 and GG/AA(PR-A) = 0.73) and uterus (around 0.70 in both isoforms). The GA genotype showed similar PR-A expression in both tissues and also similar PR-B expression in the oviduct to the GG genotype. Conversely, the GG genotype showed less PR-B expression than the GA genotype in the uterus (GG/GA(PR-B) = 0.79). Similar expression of both PR isoforms was found in the uterus at d 2 and 3 of gestation; meanwhile, an increase of both isoforms was observed in the oviduct. Similar PR-A expression was observed in the ampulla and isthmus; meanwhile, the PR-B expression in the isthmus was double that in the ampulla.",M2
19897034,"Melatonin affects steroidogenesis and delayed ovulation during winter in vespertilionid bat, Scotophilus heathi.The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of melatonin in ovarian activity of Scotophilus heathi particularly in reference to changes in steroidogenesis and steroid receptor expression during the anovulatory period of delayed ovulation. Female S. heathi showed an increased circulating melatonin level during the period of delayed ovulation in winter coinciding with the increased androstenedione (A(4)) levels, body fat and ovarian androgen receptor expression. The circulating melatonin level decreased to a low level after winter during the period of ovulation in March which also coincided with the decreased circulating A(4) levels and body fat. The circulating estrogen (E(2)) showed two peaks corresponding with the two waves of follicular development in November and February. Both the isoforms of progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), PR-A and PR-B, remained high throughout the follicular development, but expression of PR-A declined significantly during the ovulation. The treatment with melatonin, both in vitro and in vivo, significantly increased progesterone and A(4), but not the estradiol synthesis by the ovaries of S. heathi. The study further suggested that the increased androgens during winter may be primarily due to the stimulatory effect of melatonin on steroidogenic enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) activity. Therefore the increased circulating melatonin level in S. heathi during winter delay (inhibits) ovulation through increased androgen synthesis, but suppression of estradiol synthesis.",M2
19887485,"Microarray-based determination of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status in breast cancer.PURPOSE: The level of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), and HER2 aids in the determination of prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry is currently the predominant method for assessment, but differences in methods and interpretation can substantially affect the accuracy, resulting in misclassification. Here, we investigated the association of microarray-based mRNA expression levels compared with immunohistochemistry. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microarray mRNA quantification of ER, PR, and HER2 was done by the developed TargetPrint test and compared with immunohistochemical assessment for breast tumors from 636 patients. Immunohistochemistry was done in a central laboratory and in an independent reference laboratory according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines for 100 cases. For HER2 immunohistochemistry 2+ cases, additional chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was used to determine the final status. RESULTS: ER concordance between microarray and central immunohistochemistry was 93% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 91-95%]. Only 4% of immunohistochemistry-positive samples were classified negative using microarray, whereas 18% of immunohistochemistry-negative samples showed a positive microarray ER status. Concordance for PR was 83% (95% CI, 80-86%) and 96% of all samples showed an identical classification of HER2 status by microarray and immunohistochemistry/CISH (95% CI, 94-98%). Nine percent of immunohistochemistry HER2-positive samples showed a negative microarray classification. Detailed review of 11 cases with discordant classifications by American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists and central immunohistochemistry indicated that microarray assessment was likely to add additional information in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: Microarray-based readout of ER, PR, and HER2 shows a high concordance with immunohistochemistry/CISH and provides an additional, objective, and quantitative assessment of tumor receptor status in breast cancer.",M2
19877382,"Breast cancer immunohistochemical features in young women with BRCA 1/2 mutations.Breast cancer among young women is a rare pathology. In most studies published so far, this patients group is not being analyzed separately. Particularities of this pathology require an additional examination of the immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic markers of the disease for development of the effective treatment protocols. The mutations of BRCA1/2 are the important factor impacting to the disease prognosis along the age of the patient. AIM: To compare the expression of prognostically meaningful immunohistochemical markers such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), HER-2, p53, Ki-67, in tumor cells of the female patients with breast cancer aged less than 36 depending on the presence of absence of mutations in CRCA1/2 genes. METHODS: Two hundred forty-eight patients aged less than 36 at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer were examined clinically. Expression of ER, PR HER-2, p53, Ki-67 was determined by indirect immunohistochemical method. mutations of BRCA1 (185delAG, o5382insC) and BRCA2(6174delT) genes were screened using multiplex PCR in 99 patients. RESULTS: Mutations of BRCA1/2 genes were found in 9.1% of patients. More aggressive clinical course of the disease was seen in mutations carriers, who had 3-years survival of only 55.6%. They did not demonstrated of ER, PR, and HER-2 in 88.0% of the cases. Whereas, patients without BRCA1/2 mutations did no express ER, PR, and HER-2 in only 42.0% of cases. There were no differences between patients with and without mutations in terms of tumor size, presence of metastases in lymph nodes, p53 and Ki-67 expression. CONCLUSION: Presence of BRCA1/2 genes mutations in young women is associated with more aggressiveness of the breast cancer (their 3-years survival is 25,5% less) and absence of the ER, PR, HER-2 receptors, which is unfavorable prognostic factor in terms of hormone therapy. These data should be taken into account at chemotherapy planning, especially in patients with early stages of the disease. There were no differences between patients with and without BRCA1/2 mutations in terms of tumor size, lymph nodes involvement, tumor histology, and p53 and Ki-67 proteins expression.",M2
19876578,"[ErbB-2 expression and hormone receptor status in areas of transition from in situ to invasive ductal breast carcinoma]PURPOSE: to evaluate the expression of erbB-2 and of the estrogen and progesterone (ER/P) hormonal receptors in the transition regions between the in situ and the invasive fractions of ductal breast neoplasia (ISDC and IDC, respectively). METHODS: Eighty-five cases of breast neoplasia, containing contiguous ISDC and IDC areas, were selected. Histological specimens from the ISDC and the IDC areas were obtained through the tissue microarray (TMA) technique. The erbB-2 and the ER/<e>PR</e> expressions were evaluated through conventional immunohistochemistry. The McNemar's test was used for the comparative analysis of the expressions of erbB-2 protein and the ER/PR in the in situ and invasive regions of the tumors. The confidence intervals were set to 5% (p=0.05). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess the cross-tabulation agreement of the erbB-2 and the ER/PR expression in the ISDC and the IDC areas. RESULTS: the erbB-2 expression has not differed between the ISDC and the IDC areas (p=0.38). Comparing the two areas in each case, there was agreement in the expression of erbB-2 (ICC=0.64), PR (ICC=0.71) and ER (ICC=0.64). Restricting the analysis to tumors with the in situ component harboring necrosis (comedo), the ICC for erbB-2 was 0.4, compared to 0.6 for the whole sample. In this select group, the ICC for PR/ER did not differ substantially from those obtained with the complete dataset: as for the ER, ICC=0.7 (versus 0.7 for the entire sample) and for PR, ICC=0.7 (versus 0.6 for the entire sample). CONCLUSIONS: our findings suggest that the erbB-2 and the ER/PR expressions do not differ in the contiguous in situ and invasive components of breast ductal tumors.",M2
19875972,"Correlation between epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and expression of female hormone receptors in East-Asian lung adenocarcinomas.INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are more common in lung adenocarcinoma and in female patients of East-Asian origin. We aimed to assess the expression of female hormone receptors in East-Asian lung adenocarcinomas, their correlation with EGFR mutations, and prognostic significance. METHODS: Estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, ERbeta, progesterone receptor (<e>PR</e>), and Her-2 expression were examined using immunohistochemical methods on 109 lung adenocarcinoma cases. EGFR mutations were analyzed by partially denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Association of hormone receptor with clinical factors was assessed using the Fisher's exact test. Associations with survival were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Using scoring criteria routinely used for breast cancer, there were four (4%) ERalpha, one (1%) ERbeta, six (6%) PR, and one (1%) Her-2 positive cases. Considering any staining as positive, 14 (14%) ERalpha, 10 (9%) ERbeta, 12 (12%) PR, and 26 (24%) Her-2 cases were positive. Thirty-nine patients (39%) had EGFR mutations. ERalpha positivity was significantly associated with ERbeta and PR positivity. There were more EGFR mutations seen in tumors with ERbeta positivity (60%) compared with those with negative expression (37.9%), and there was a trend toward a poorer outcome for patients with tumor that were positive for ERbeta and Her-2. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and Her-2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma are present but limited. This suggests that hormonal influence may not be an important factor to account for the high prevalence of lung cancer among the East-Asian women.",M2

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare expression patterns and hormonal regulation of SHR in FT with that described in endometrium and to determine whether SHR expression is altered in FT of women with ectopic pregnancy (EP). DESIGN: Tissue was analyzed and cultured. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Women undergoing surgery for benign gynecological conditions (n = 14) and EP (n = 6) participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to determine SHR mRNA expression and protein localization, respectively. SHR levels were measured in tubal explant cultures stimulated with estrogen and progestogen. RESULTS: ERalpha and ERbeta mRNAs were constitutively expressed in FT during the menstrual cycle. <e>PR</e>-AB and PR-B mRNAs were decreased in midluteal phase compared to follicular phase. ERalpha, PR-AB, and PR-B mRNAs were down-regulated in human FT in vitro by treatment with progestogen. ERalpha, ERbeta1, ERbeta2, PR, and AR proteins localized to cell nuclei of epithelium, stroma, and smooth muscle of nonpregnant FT. In FT from women with EP, PR-B mRNA was decreased when compared to midluteal FT, and ERalpha protein was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: SHR expression in FT is different from that observed in endometrium recovered at similar stages of the menstrual cycle, and expression in FT from women with EP is also altered compared with normal FT. These data are an important benchmark for furthering the understanding of normal human FT physiology, changes in expression of SHR in FT in response to progesterone, and disorders of FT function, such as EP.",M2
