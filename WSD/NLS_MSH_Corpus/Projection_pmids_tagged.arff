20234017,"Remembering and forecasting: The relation between autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking.Episodic future thinking is a <e>projection</e> of the self into the future to mentally preexperience an event. Previous work has shown striking similarities between autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking in response to various experimental manipulations. This has nurtured the idea of a shared neurocognitive system underlying both processes. Here, undergraduates generated autobiographical memories and future event representations in response to cue words and requests for important events and rated their characteristics. Important and word-cued events differed markedly on almost all measures. Past, as compared with future, events were rated as more sensorially vivid and less relevant to life story and identity. However, in contrast to previous work, these main effects were qualified by a number of interactions, suggesting important functional differences between the two temporal directions. For both temporal directions, sensory imagery dropped, whereas self-narrative importance and reference to normative cultural life script events increased with increasing temporal distance.",M1
20166909,"Projecting subacute inpatient activity in New South Wales.We describe the development of a method for estimating and modelling future demand for sub- and non-acute inpatient activity across New South Wales, Australia to 2016. A time series linear regression equation was used, which is consistent with <e>projection</e> models found in the literature. Results of the modelling indicated an increase in rehabilitation, palliative care and maintenance episodes and bed-days. Projections for other categories of care are problematic due to smaller levels of activity and data quality issues. This project indicated a need for ongoing monitoring of type-changing by facilities and management of data quality. Local planners will need to consider a range of factors when considering the applicability activity projections at a local level, particularly within the specific age and clinical groupings.",M1
20159675,"[<e>Projection</e> of the incidence of breast cancer in France in 2018]The objective of this work is to estimate the trends of the incidence of breast cancer until 2018, in the French context on the basis of an age cohort model. The model extrapolates the trend of incidence rate per generation and age, incorporates the effects of demographic changes in the female population in terms of size and age structure and simulates the impact of the withdrawal of the use of hormone therapy for menopause (HTM) under different assumptions. The results suggest a continuous growth in the number of incident cases that would increase from 49,814 to 64,621 between 2005 and 2018. Changes in incidence following the HTM use withdrawal, should be moderate and transient. The most important epidemiological parameters in explaining the future incidence of breast cancer remains the  cohort  effect that continues to have a significant impact until the extinction of cohorts for which the increase was more marked (birth years 1920 to 1945). This factor alone explains 18% of the growth in the number of incident cases in 2018, while the effect of population growth account for 6.6%, the cessation of HTM a 6.4% decrease and aging a 4.6% growth.",M1
19811588,"Non-invasive risk stratification of coronary artery disease: an evaluation of some commonly used statistical classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy and clinical usefulness.OBJECTIVE: To compare different prediction models for assessing outcome of patients undergoing non-invasive risk stratification of suspected or known coronary artery disease. METHODS: Six statistical classifiers and data mining models were applied to the prospective data bank of two different institutions. Of these, one represented the training (n = 2777) and the other one the test (n = 2679) set, each set consisting of usual clinical and stress echo information of patients followed-up for the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and non-fatal acute coronary syndromes. The following models were used: Logistic regression, Generalized Additive Model, <e>Projection</e> Pursuit Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks. Models were selected using the Akaike Information Criterion and compared in terms of accuracy and Negative Predictive Value, overall Misclassification Rate and ROC Area Under Curve. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 31 months, 573 events occurred: 271 in the training and 302 in the test set respectively. All models selected the same subset of covariates as significantly associated with the outcome. The comparison of model performance showed that: (1) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks provided a worse prediction of outcome than models more closely bonded to the hypothesis of linearity of the covariates effect; (2) overall predictive capability of the best performing models was excellent (&gt;90% and &gt;85% for training and test set respectively); and (3) there was a substantial lack of agreement among model indications in the individual patient. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of variables and predictive models are not independent processes and may affect the performance of risk scoring systems or algorithms designed to transfer general prognostic rules into clinical practice. Thus, caution must be used in translating model prediction into strict clinical indications.",M1
19785785,"[Diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands: estimate of the current disease burden and prognosis for 2025]OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of people with diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands in 2007 using a new method; to describe trends in the past; to predict the situation in 2025. DESIGN: Model calculations. METHODS: Based on five general practice records (Nijmegen Continuous Morbidity Registration [CMR], Netherlands Information Network of General Practice [LINH], Limburg Family Practice Registration Network [RNH-Limburg], Registration Network University Family Practices, Leiden and its environs [RNUH-LEO], and the transition project) the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes in the Netherlands in 2007 was estimated. Trends in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes were estimated from the five records over the period 2000-2007. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in 2025 was estimated using the Dutch Chronic Diseases Model, which takes into account demographic developments and a further increase in obesity in the Netherlands in the future. RESULTS: In 2007, 740,000 persons (95% CI: 665,000-824,000) with diabetes were undergoing care. The incidence of new diabetes during 2007 was 71,000 (95% CI: 57,000-90,000). The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by almost 80% in 2000-2007. The model <e>projection</e> resulted in an estimate of 1.3 million people with diagnosed diabetes in 2025, i.e. 8% of the Dutch population. There is a high level of uncertainty about these estimates. CONCLUSION: The increase in the number of diabetes patients in 2025 has consequences for care and will require measures to be taken in coming years in the areas of prevalence and care organisation.",M1
19698008,"Visions for required postgraduate year 1 residency training by 2020: a comparison of actual versus projected expansion.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of expanding postgraduate year (PGY) 1 residency training as proposed by the American College of Clinical Pharmacy and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). DESIGN: Prospective survey analysis. DATA SOURCE: The ASHP Online Residency Directory was used to obtain PGY1 residency program data from June 2007-June 2008. A four-item questionnaire was developed to survey future residency growth in identified PGY1 programs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survey data were aggregated to project future residency growth in the  next few years  (range 2-4 yrs). Estimates of Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) graduates to 2020 were used to calculate PGY1 residency positions and average annual growth rates required if 24% (scenario 1), 75% (scenario 2), and 100% (scenario 3) of pharmacy graduates pursue PGY1 residencies. Projected growth from the survey was compared with required growth under the scenarios, as well as with actual PGY1 growth from June 2007-June 2008. A subset analysis of college-affiliated and Veterans Affairs (VA) PGY1 programs was performed. The survey response rate was 57%. The PGY1 positions were projected to increase by 8.3%/year in the next few years or 4193 positions by 2020 if 8.3% growth is sustained. Required average annual growth rates for scenarios 1-3, respectively, were 4.8%, 14.4%, and 17%. Projected growth rates were sufficient to achieve only scenario 1 in which 24% (percentage of pharmacists estimated to practice in health systems) of graduates pursue PGY1 residencies. The actual PGY1 growth rate from 2007-2008 was 9.9%. The VA positions actually grew at 12.5% and college-affiliated positions grew at 8.3% over this period, whereas VA <e>projection</e> for growth was 4.8% and college-affiliated projection was 9.6%. CONCLUSION: Having sufficient PGY1 residency positions available for all Pharm.D. graduates by 2020 would require at least a 17% average annual growth rate, whereas survey respondents predicted 8.3%. Actual residency growth in 2008 (9.9%) exceeded survey projections. Study data suggest that the ASHP aspiration to have all graduates who pursue health-system pharmacy careers complete a PGY1 residency is achievable. Higher percentages, 75% or 100%, are only partially achievable. Continued growth of college-affiliated residencies and sustained growth in the VA system are important to achieving residency growth goals.",M1
19650718,"Time trend of mesothelioma incidence in the United States and <e>projection</e> of future cases: an update based on SEER data for 1973 through 2005.The time trend of mesothelioma incidence and projections of future cases provide useful information for analyzing proposed public health interventions where asbestos exposure may be an issue, evaluating regulatory proposals, and estimating the remaining potential costs of programs to compensate individuals with asbestos-related diseases. We used the April 2008 release of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, which covers 1973 through 2005, to analyze the time trends in age-adjusted mesothelioma incidence and to estimate an age and birth-cohort model to project the number of future mesothelioma cases. The increase in the number of SEER cancer registries from 13 to 17 in 2000 had little effect on the time pattern of age-adjusted mesothelioma incidence, and the pattern over time of pleural mesothelioma was indistinguishable from the pattern for total mesothelioma defined as sum of pleural and peritoneal cases. Our analysis suggests that the SEER registries viewed as a sample of the U.S. population over-represents high mesothelioma incidence, a fact that we accounted for in our projections. For 2008 we estimate approximately 2,400 cases, with asbestos the likely cause in 58%. We project that asbestos will no longer be a factor in mesothelioma cases after the year 2042. For 2008 through 2042, we estimate slightly more than 68,000 total cases, with asbestos the likely cause in 34%.",M1
19372029,"Stability analysis of static recurrent neural networks using delay-partitioning and <e>projection</e>.This paper introduces an effective approach to studying the stability of recurrent neural networks with a time-invariant delay. By employing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional form based on delay partitioning, novel delay-dependent stability criteria are established to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of static neural networks. These conditions are expressed in the framework of linear matrix inequalities, which can be verified easily by means of standard software. It is shown, by comparing with existing approaches, that the delay-partitioning projection approach can largely reduce the conservatism of the stability results. Finally, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",M1
19357241,"<e>Projection</e> of the number of patients with tuberculosis in the Netherlands in 2030.BACKGROUND: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in The Netherlands has been declining for many years. For the purpose of planning future TB-control activities we estimated the number of TB patients in The Netherlands up to 2030. METHODS: Statistical modelling for 5-year age groups up to 2030 distinguishing among Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source (survival model), non-Dutch patients (projection of the proportion of culture-positive patients among first generation immigrants) and Dutch patients infected by a non-Dutch source (fixed relation with the number of non-Dutch patients). RESULTS: The number of TB patients is expected to decline to 877 in 2030. After 2010 declines may slow due to an increase in non-Dutch TB patients. This increase cancels out the decrease of Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source. In 2030, 85% of all TB patients are expected to be non-Dutch. In the four largest counties and the rest of The Netherlands, this will be 89 and 76%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The decrease in TB incidence observed over many years may stall from 2010 onwards because of an estimated increase in non-Dutch TB patients. Given their disproportionate burden, future TB-control activities should prioritize the health of first-generation immigrants. Enhanced TB control in the countries of origin and new diagnostic tests to identify those at high risk of developing active TB could help in reducing further the TB incidence in the Netherlands. Future TB-control efforts must be organized in a flexible way to be able to incorporate changing epidemiological situations.",M1
19161472,"Inferring the past to predict the future: climate modelling predictions and phylogeography for the freshwater gastropod Radix balthica (Pulmonata, Basommatophora).Understanding the impact of past climatic events on species may facilitate predictions of how species will respond to future climate change. To this end, we sampled populations of the common pond snail Radix balthica over the entire species range (northwestern Europe). Using a recently developed analytical framework that employs ecological niche modelling to obtain hypotheses that are subsequently tested with statistical phylogeography, we inferred the range dynamics of R. balthica over time. A Maxent modelling for present-day conditions was performed to infer the climate envelope for the species, and the modelled niche was used to hindcast climatically suitable range at the last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 21,000 years ago. Ecological niche modelling predicted two suitable areas at the LGM within the present species range. Phylogeographic model selection on a COI mitochondrial DNA data set confirmed that R. balthica most likely spread from these two disjunct refuges after the LGM. The match observed between the potential range of the species at the LGM given its present climatic requirements and the phylogeographically inferred refugial areas was a clear argument in favour of niche conservatism in R. balthica, thus allowing to predict the future range. The subsequent <e>projection</e> of the potential range under a global change scenario predicts a moderate pole-ward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of areas currently occupied in France, western Great Britain and southern Germany.",M1
19124775,"Forecasting United States mortality using cohort smoking histories.In this paper, we introduce a recently established relationship between cohort smoking patterns and adult mortality into mortality <e>projections</e> for the United States. In particular, we incorporate a variable representing the intensity of smoking within a cohort into the original Lee-Carter projection model. The introduction of this variable accounts for important anomalies in the recent age/sex pattern of mortality change and enables the use of a common temporal trend of mortality change for the 2 sexes. We project age-specific mortality rates for men and women at ages 50-84 between 2004 and 2034 in the United States. Because of reductions in smoking that have already occurred or can be reliably projected, mortality is projected to decline much faster when smoking is introduced into the model.",M1
19030896,"Climate change and adaptation needs.Observations confirm that climate is changing and it is projected to continue changing rapidly. Adaptation is needed to mitigate the projected adverse impacts of climate change, such as climate-change-related exposures which could affect the health status of many people. Climate <e>projections</e> for this century are available with a high spatial and time resolution. But they are afflicted with uncertainties because of the unknown future emissions of greenhouse gases as well as natural variability and the imperfect understanding of climate science and modelling. The evaluation of climate impacts further increases the uncertainty of the result. Is it justified to act on the basis of uncertain climate information? The results of climate models often differ slightly but they show robust and one-to-one trends in the future development. A quantitative or qualitative estimation of the probability of the climate projection facilitates the appraisal of the climate projection. In accordance with the precautionary principle, stakeholders should act in order to mitigate adverse effects of climate change even under the conditions of uncertainty for instance by using methods of risk assessment and risk management. The inclusion of uncertainties should be a part of this risk assessment process.",M1
19064858,"<e>Projection</e> of diabetic retinopathy and other major eye diseases among people with diabetes mellitus: United States, 2005-2050.OBJECTIVES: To estimate the number of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR), vision-threatening DR (VTDR), glaucoma, and cataracts among Americans 40 years or older with diagnosed diabetes mellitus for the years 2005-2050. METHODS: Using published prevalence data of DR, VTDR, glaucoma, and cataracts and data from the National Health Interview Survey and the US Census Bureau, we projected the number of Americans with diabetes with these eye conditions. RESULTS: The number of Americans 40 years or older with DR and VTDR will triple in 2050, from 5.5 million in 2005 to 16.0 million for DR and from 1.2 million in 2005 to 3.4 million for VTDR. Increases among those 65 years or older will be more pronounced (2.5 million to 9.9 million for DR and 0.5 million to 1.9 million for VTDR). The number of cataract cases among whites and blacks 40 years or older with diabetes will likely increase 235% by 2050, and the number of glaucoma cases among Hispanics with diabetes 65 years or older will increase 12-fold. CONCLUSION: Future increases in the number of Americans with diabetes will likely lead to significant increases in the number with DR, glaucoma, and cataracts. Our projections may help policy makers anticipate future demands for health care resources and possibly guide the development of targeted interventions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Efforts to prevent diabetes and to optimally manage diabetes and its complications are needed.",M1
19048180,"The health and economic consequences of osteopenia- and osteoporosis-attributable hip fractures in Germany: estimation for 2002 and <e>projection</e> until 2050.SUMMARY: The health and economic burden of osteopenia- and osteoporosis-attributable hip fractures (OHF) in Germany was estimated for 2002 and projected until 2050. We found 108,341 OHF resulting in 2,998 million Euros cost, which will more than double by the year 2050, calling for improvement and development of prevention strategies for OHF. INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to estimate the health impact and the societal costs of OHF in Germany in the year 2002 and to extrapolate these estimates to the years 2020 and 2050. METHODS: We estimated OHF-attributable deaths, years of potential life lost (YPLL) and quality-adjusted life years lost (QALYs) using attributable fractions. Direct costs for acute treatment, rehabilitation, nursing care, non-medical costs and indirect costs for sickness absence, early retirement and mortality were estimated. All estimates were extrapolated to 2020 and 2050 using an estimation of future population composition and life expectancy. RESULTS: We found 108,341 OHF resulting in 3,485 deaths, 22,724 YPLL, 114,058 QALYs, 2,736 millions of Euros direct cost and 262 millions of Euros indirect costs. Projection to 2020 showed corresponding increases of 44%, 62%, 56%, 49%, 47% and 33%, whereas the projection to 2050 resulted in changes of 128%, 215%, 196%, 152%, 138% and 90%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OHF have considerable impact on health and direct costs in the elderly. Both may strongly increase in future decades due to demographic changes, calling for improvement and development of effective strategies for preventing and dealing with OHF.",M1
18980574,"Estimating and projecting subacute care demand: findings from a review of international methods.A review of <e>projection</e> methodologies used to project sub-acute inpatient activity in various international health care jurisdictions was undertaken as part of a project to develop subacute inpatient activity projections for the state with the largest population in Australia. The literature search identified nearly 200 articles and found three main groups of projection methodologies: projections with a focus on subacute care; projections with a focus on acute care, but which often included subacute activity in the overall projections; and projections of specific diseases/conditions influencing the demand for subacute care. In terms of the examples in the literature specifically regarding subacute care, the most common method of estimating current or future need was the use of normative benchmark ratios of beds to population. This was mainly to provide a policy basis to encourage development of subacute services, but also because of convenience. In the literature regarding acute activity projection methodologies, many incorporated subacute activity in the overall activity measures of the acute hospital unit. The most common method of acute care activity projection was use of current or trended utilisation rates applied to population projections. It appears that a significant amount of planning and demand projection being undertaken internationally on subacute care takes place within acute care methodologies. In regard to the potential use of specific diseases/conditions that drive demand for subacute care, such as stroke or cancer, it is suggested that the best use of these disease-specific projections is in reality testing the results of other modelling. A number of conclusions are made and issues highlighted regarding projections of subacute inpatient activity.",M1
18696288,"Burden of Alzheimer's disease: population-based estimates and <e>projections</e> for New Zealand, 2006-2031.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD, including 'mixed' dementia) in New Zealand in 2006, and project this burden out to 2031. METHOD: An incidence to prevalence methodology was utilized, the foundation of which is a discrete time Markov model allowing for multiple stages of disease (early vs late). Population estimates and projections, and all-cause mortality rates, were obtained from Statistics New Zealand. In the absence of usable New Zealand data, data on disease incidence and progression were obtained from systematic reviews of the international (mainly European, Australian and North American) literature. Projection scenarios included a demographic scenario in which change resulted only from increases in population size and ageing; a prevention scenario in which incidence rates were reduced by 25% from 2011; a treatment scenario in which disease progression rates were likewise reduced by 25% from 2011; and a combined scenario capturing both interventions. RESULTS: The model estimated that approximately 28000 people are currently living with AD (whether formally diagnosed or not), approximately 55% in the early and 45% in the late stage of the disease; approximately 6600 people newly develop AD each year; and approximately 2300 people die from (as opposed to with) this condition. The model projected that the prevalence of AD will increase approximately 2.5-fold (to approx. 70,000 people) by 2031, if demographic drivers are unopposed. Plausible improvements in prevention and treatment, however, acting together, could reduce this growth by up to 50%, so that the prevalence of AD only doubles. CONCLUSION: Even this more optimistic projection has profound implications for the funding and provision of dementia care services, as well as for patients, their families, informal carers and the psychogeriatric workforce. New service configurations and models of care will be necessary. Access, quality and coordination standards for home care, day care, respite care, residential care and specialist services (including memory clinics) will need to respond accordingly.",M1

In countries such as Canada where TB incidence rate is low, increasing immigration trends may have significant impact on the TB transmission patterns in these countries. In this study we formulate a deterministic epidemiological model of TB transmission in two demographically distinct populations: Canadian born and foreign born populations, in order to investigate the effects of this demographic distinction on the short-term incidence and long-term transmission dynamics, and with special emphasis on the impact of immigration latent TB cases on the overall TB incidence rate in the whole population.",M1
18647867,"Progress and challenges in modelling country-level HIV/AIDS epidemics: the UNAIDS Estimation and <e>Projection</e> Package 2007.The UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) was developed to aid in country-level estimation and short-term projection of HIV/AIDS epidemics. This paper describes advances reflected in the most recent update of this tool (EPP 2007), and identifies key issues that remain to be addressed in future versions. The major change to EPP 2007 is the addition of uncertainty estimation for generalised epidemics using the technique of Bayesian melding, but many additional changes have been made to improve the user interface and efficiency of the package. This paper describes the interface for uncertainty analysis, changes to the user interface for calibration procedures and other user interface changes to improve EPP's utility in different settings. While formal uncertainty assessment remains an unresolved challenge in low-level and concentrated epidemics, the Bayesian melding approach has been applied to provide analysts in these settings with a visual depiction of the range of models that may be consistent with their data. In fitting the model to countries with longer-running epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, a number of limitations have been identified in the current model with respect to accommodating behaviour change and accurately replicating certain observed epidemic patterns. This paper discusses these issues along with their implications for future changes to EPP and to the underlying UNAIDS Reference Group model.",M1
18647862,"The Spectrum <e>projection</e> package: improvements in estimating mortality, ART needs, PMTCT impact and uncertainty bounds.BACKGROUND: The approach to national and global estimates of HIV/AIDS used by UNAIDS starts with estimates of adult HIV prevalence prepared from surveillance data using either the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) or the Workbook. Time trends of prevalence are transferred to Spectrum to estimate the consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including the number of people living with HIV, new infections, AIDS deaths, AIDS orphans, treatment needs and the impact of treatment on survival. METHODS: The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections regularly reviews new data and information needs and recommends updates to the methodology and assumptions used in Spectrum. The latest update to Spectrum was used in the 2007 round of global estimates. RESULTS: Several new features have been added to Spectrum in the past two years. The structure of the population was reorganised to track populations by HIV status and treatment status. Mortality estimates were improved by the adoption of new approaches to estimating non-AIDS mortality by single age, and the use of new information on survival with HIV in non-treated cohorts and on the survival of patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART). A more detailed treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV now provides more prophylaxis and infant feeding options. New procedures were implemented to estimate the uncertainty around each of the key outputs. CONCLUSIONS: The latest update to the Spectrum program is intended to incorporate the latest research findings and provide new outputs needed by national and international planners.",M1
18512443,"Emission <e>projections</e> for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Section 812 second prospective Clean Air Act cost/benefit analysis.Section 812 of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to perform periodic, comprehensive analyses of the total costs and total benefits of programs implemented pursuant to the CAAA. The first prospective analysis was completed in 1999. The second prospective analysis was initiated during 2005. The first step in the second prospective analysis was the development of base and projection year emission estimates that will be used to generate benefit estimates of CAAA programs. This paper describes the analysis, methods, and results of the recently completed emission projections. There are several unique features of this analysis. One is the use of consistent economic assumptions from the Department of Energy's Annual Energy Outlook 2005 (AEO 2005) projections as the basis for estimating 2010 and 2020 emissions for all sectors. Another is the analysis of the different emissions paths for both with and without CAAA scenarios. Other features of this analysis include being the first EPA analysis that uses the 2002 National Emission Inventory files as the basis for making 48-state emission projections, incorporating control factor files from the Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs) that had completed emission projections at the time the analysis was performed, and modeling the emission benefits of the expected adoption of measures to meet the 8-hr ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the PM2.5 NAAQS. This analysis shows that the 1990 CAAA have produced significant reductions in criteria pollutant emissions since 1990 and that these emission reductions are expected to continue through 2020. CAAA provisions have reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by approximately 7 million t/yr by 2000, and are estimated to produce associated VOC emission reductions of 16.7 million t by 2020. Total oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) emission reductions attributable to the CAAA are 5, 12, and 17 million t in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission benefits during the study period are dominated by electricity-generating unit (EGU) SO2 emission reductions. These EGU emission benefits go from 7.5 million t reduced in 2000 to 15 million t reduced in 2020.",M1

METHODS: Based on nationally representative survey data from the year 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), prevalence estimates of doctor-diagnosed depression (minor or major, and dysthymia) were weighted to incorporate the complex sampling design and increase generalizability of the findings. The weighted prevalence data by age and sex in 2006 were then used to estimate the projected adult population with lifetime experience of depressive disorder based on the sex-specific US Census national population projections from year 2005-2050. RESULTS: In year 2006 the (weighted) prevalence of lifetime experience of depressive disorder was 15.7% among 188,292 respondents aged 18 years or older. Female prevalence was 20.6%, which was about twice as high as the prevalence among males (11%). From year 2005-2050, the total number of US adults with depressive disorder will increase from 33.9 million to 45.8 million, a 35% increase. The increase is projected to be greater in the elderly population aged &gt;or=65 years (3.8-8.2, a 117% increase) than in the young population aged &lt;65 years (30.1-37.7, a 25% increase). CONCLUSIONS: By year 2050, approximately 46 million US adults aged 18 years or older will be diagnosed with a depressive disorder. The increase will be more pronounced in adults aged 65 or older. Prevention, detection, and treatment of depressive disorders might attenuate the magnitude of this estimate.",M1
18466941,"Nonlinearity in eigenvalue-perturbation curves of simulated population <e>projection</e> matrices.Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of population projection matrices (PPMs) are established tools in the analysis of structured populations, but they make a linear approximation of the usually nonlinear relationship between population growth and matrix elements. The evaluation of alternative population management interventions may be particularly vulnerable to error if the degree of nonlinearity depends on the element of the PPM that is targeted. The second self-derivative and the self-sensitivity of elasticity can be used to estimate the degree and sign of nonlinearity in sensitivity and elasticity analyses, respectively. Using simulated matrices, we demonstrate that the magnitude and sign of the second self-derivative and the self-sensitivity of elasticity vary systematically, according to the element of the PPM subject to perturbation. Population management prescriptions based on sensitivity and elasticity analysis should always be backed up by nonlinear analyses.",M1

In the longer-term, the projections suggest that the population will continue rising beyond 2031 for the full length of the projection period. The population will become older with the median age expected to rise from 39.0 years in 2006 to 41.8 years by 2031.

18447067,"Change of the guard in obstetrics and gynaecology: projected retirement to 2025.The purpose of the paper is to forecast retirement of the specialist obstetricians and gynaecologists in Australia to 2025. The gender and hours of work of younger and older cohorts were compared to determine the likely impacts of the transition from older to younger cohorts. The paper used the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's annual Medical Labour Force Surveys to examine trends in attrition of obstetricians and gynaecologists over the age of 45 years from the workforce and to predict their rate of retirement to 2025. The <e>projection</e> results show that between the years 2000 and 2025, 59% of the obstetricians and gynaecologists would retire. The rising proportion of women in obstetrics and gynaecology and shorter working hours of both men and women will have a compounding effect on physician retirement. The paper concludes that the changes in practice, increasing feminisation and retirement from the workforce coupled with higher female population growth in the childbearing years and slightly higher fertility mean that ensuring an adequate obstetricians and gynaecologists in Australia will be a significant challenge over the next 20 years. There is the potential for shortages in obstetric care with particular risks for rural areas.",M1
18438715,"Prediction of mesothelioma and lung cancer in a cohort of asbestos exposed workers.BACKGROUND: Several papers have reported state-wide <e>projections</e> of mesothelioma deaths, but few have computed these predictions in selected exposed groups. OBJECTIVE: To predict the future deaths attributable to asbestos in a cohort of railway rolling stock workers. METHODS: The future mortality of the 1,146 living workers has been computed in term of individual probability of dying for three different risks: baseline mortality, lung cancer excess, mesothelioma mortality. Lung cancer mortality attributable to asbestos was calculated assuming the excess risk as stable or with a decrease after a period of time since first exposure. Mesothelioma mortality was based on cumulative exposure and time since first exposure, with the inclusion of a term for clearance of asbestos fibres from the lung. RESULTS: The most likely range of the number of deaths attributable to asbestos in the period 2005-2050 was 15-30 for excess of lung cancer, and 23-35 for mesothelioma. CONCLUSION: This study provides predictions of asbestos-related mortality even in a selected cohort of exposed subjects, using previous knowledge about exposure-response relationship. The inclusion of individual information in the projection model helps reduce misclassification and improves the results. The method could be extended in other selected cohorts.",M1
18324936,"<e>Projection</e> of the supply of and demand for board-certified nephrologists for ESRD in Taiwan.OBJECTIVE: Taiwan is the country where end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is most prevalent. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the rising demand for dialysis or transplantation as a result of ESRD can be balanced by the supply of board-certified (B-C) nephrologists. METHODS: Two Markov processes were applied for the projection of the supply of B-C nephrologists in ESRD and for the projection of the demand from ESRD in 2020, assuming linear, exponential growth and no increase. RESULTS: The supply of B-C nephrologists was projected at 1346 in 2020. To make allowance for the share of total time of professional activities in full-time equivalent (FTE) for B-C nephrologists, the demand was 1556, 962 and 2652 with assumptions of steady, linear and exponential growth, respectively. By the year 2020, 210 and 1306 additional FTE nephrologists will be required to meet, respectively, a linear and an exponential increase in demand from ESRD. CONCLUSIONS: The projection of the supply of and the demand for B-C nephrologists was made in this study using two Markov processes. The methods and results can be adopted as a reference for health manpower planning on B-C nephrologists.",M1
18311642,"Prediction of pH-dependent aqueous solubility of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.Recently we developed a model for prediction of pH-dependent aqueous solubility of drugs and drug like molecules. In the present work, the model was applied on a series of novel Histone Deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors discovered at TopoTarget. The applicability of our model was evaluated on the series of HDAC inhibitors by use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and 2D-<e>projection</e> of the HDAC inhibitors on the chemical space of the training data set of the artificial neural network (ANN) module. The model was refined for the particular chemical space of interest, which led to two modifications in the training data set of the ANN. The performance of the original and the two modified versions of the model were evaluated against the commercial software from Simulations-plus and pH-dependent solubility measurements for representative compounds of the series. The results of the evaluation indicate that one can develop models that are more accurate in predicting differences in the solubility of structurally very similar compounds than models that have been trained on structurally unbiased, diverse data sets. Such 'tailor-made' models have the potential to become trustworthy enough to replace time-consuming and expensive medium- and high-throughput solubility experiments by providing results of similar or even better quality.",M1

Development and perspectives of phase contrast techniques]The early and reliable detection of breast cancer is often difficult with conventional mammography, especially within dense breast parenchyma.

These phase contrast imaging techniques can generate <e>projection</e> images with much less glandular dose than conventional mammography. Even the acquisition of phase contrast CT data sets with an acceptable exposure dose is possible. As brilliant x-ray beams are required for phase contrast imaging, which up to now were only available at synchrotron facilities, these methods were restricted to only a few laboratories. However, with the advent of newly developed high intensity lasers which are also able to produce such radiation, a widespread and affordable use of this technique seems realistic.

18267905,"Towards quantifying uncertainty in predictions of Amazon 'dieback'.Simulations with the Hadley Centre general circulation model (HadCM3), including carbon cycle model and forced by a 'business-as-usual' emissions scenario, predict a rapid loss of Amazonian rainforest from the middle of this century onwards. The robustness of this <e>projection</e> to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer canopy light interception model and compare with the simple 'big-leaf' approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography). We find that the loss of Amazonian rainforest is robust across the climate uncertainty explored by perturbed physics simulations covering a wide range of global climate sensitivity. The introduction of the refined light interception model leads to an increase in simulated gross plant carbon uptake for the present day, but, with altered respiration, the net effect is a decrease in net primary productivity. However, this does not significantly affect the carbon loss from vegetation and soil as a consequence of future simulated depletion in soil moisture; the Amazon forest is still lost. The introduction of the more sophisticated dynamic vegetation model reduces but does not halt the rate of forest dieback. The potential for human-induced climate change to trigger the loss of Amazon rainforest appears robust within the context of the uncertainties explored in this paper. Some further uncertainties should be explored, particularly with respect to the representation of rooting depth.",M1
18241159,"An alternative approach to projecting health expenditure in Australia.OBJECTIVE: To introduce a large body of work that explores the modelling of expenditure on health services per person living with major causes of disease or injury as a valid basis for conclusions regarding future health expenditure in Australia. METHODS: Separate <e>projections</e> were calculated for important health conditions (or groups of conditions) by type of expenditure (hospital care, medical services, pharmaceuticals, aged care homes and other health services). Analyses accounted for expected changes in the number of affected cases, the proportion of cases treated, the volume of health services per treated case and excess health price inflation. RESULTS: Total health expenditure in Australia is expected to increase from 9.4% of GDP in 2002-03 to 10.8% of GDP in 2032-33. This represents a 15% increase in the  health : GDP  proportion over the projection period, or an annual growth of 0.5%. Two-thirds of this growth is accounted for by expected increases in population size and population ageing. CONCLUSIONS: The lower annual growth in the  health : GDP  proportion compared with other estimates for Australia (range, 0.9% to 1.7%) was attributed to different assumptions regarding non-demographic growth factors, particularly volume per case. Explicit modelling of these factors separately for each condition ensured that assumptions remained within plausible limits.",M1
18063825,"Stroke incidence and survival in the beginning of the 21st century in southern Sweden: comparisons with the late 20th century and <e>projections</e> into the future.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report trends of stroke incidence and survival up to year 2001/2002 in Lund-Orup, Sweden, and projections of future stroke incidence in Sweden. METHODS: Lund Stroke Register, a prospective population-based study, included all first-ever stroke patients, between March 1, 2001 and February 28, 2002, in the Lund-Orup health care district. Institution-based studies for 1983 to 1985 and 1993 to 1995 were used for comparison. We calculated age-standardized incidence and Cox proportional hazards analysis of survival (stroke subtype, sex, age group, and study period in the analysis). Minimum follow-up was 46 months. Based on our register's stroke incidence and the official Swedish population projection, a projection for future stroke incidence on a national basis was calculated. RESULTS: We included 456 patients with first-ever stroke in 2001/2002. The age-standardized incidence (to the European population) was 144 per 100 000 person-years (95%CI 130 to 158) in 2001/2002, 158 (95%CI 149 to 168) in 1993 to 1995, and 134 (95%CI 126 to 143) in 1983 to 1985. Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated decreased risk of death after stroke in 2001/2002 (hazard ratio 0.80; 95%CI 0.67 to 0.94) compared with 1993 to 1995. Up to year 2050, the annual number of new stroke patients in Sweden may increase by 59% based solely on demographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite possible underestimation of stroke incidence during the previous institution-based studies, the increased stroke incidence between 1983 to 1985 and 1993 to 1995 did not continue in 2001/2002. The long-term survival after stroke continues to improve. As the elderly population is growing in Sweden, stable incidence and increasing survival will result in a rapidly increasing prevalence of stroke patients in Sweden.",M1
18037190,"Lung cancer mortality in France. Trend analysis and <e>projection</e> between 1975 and 2012, using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model.INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is currently the most common cancer in the world and as such is an important public health concern. One of the main challenges is to foresee the evolution of trends in lung cancer mortality rates in order to anticipate the future burden of this disease as well as to plan the supply of adequate health care. The aim of this study is to propose a quantification of future lung cancer mortality rates by gender in France until the year 2012. METHODS: Lung cancer mortality data in France (1978-2002) were extracted from the National Statistics of Death and analyzed by 5-year age-groups and periods, using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. DISCUSSION: Between 1978 and 2002, female lung cancer mortality rate rises by 3.3%year(-1). For men, a slow increase is observed until 1988-1992 followed by a declining trend. In 1998-2002, age-standardized mortality rates were, respectively, 45.5 and 7.6 per 100000 for males and for females. By 2008-2012 these figures would reach 40.8 (95% credibility interval (CI): 32.7, 50.0) and 12.1 (CI: 11.7, 12.6) per 100000, respectively, which represents among women a 4.7% annual increase (CI: 4.5, 5.0). RESULTS: Our results highlight the relevance of pursuing public health measures in order to cope more actively with tobacco smoking in the prevention strategy against lung cancer specifically among women.",M1
17960136,"Neural mechanisms mediating optimism bias.Humans expect positive events in the future even when there is no evidence to support such expectations. For example, people expect to live longer and be healthier than average, they underestimate their likelihood of getting a divorce, and overestimate their prospects for success on the job market. We examined how the brain generates this pervasive optimism bias. Here we report that this tendency was related specifically to enhanced activation in the amygdala and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex when imagining positive future events relative to negative ones, suggesting a key role for areas involved in monitoring emotional salience in mediating the optimism bias. These are the same regions that show irregularities in depression, which has been related to pessimism. Across individuals, activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with trait optimism. The current study highlights how the brain may generate the tendency to engage in the <e>projection</e> of positive future events, suggesting that the effective integration and regulation of emotional and autobiographical information supports the projection of positive future events in healthy individuals, and is related to optimism.",M1
17710718,"Projecting effects of improvements in passive safety of the New Zealand light vehicle fleet.OBJECTIVES: In the year 2000, as part of the process for setting New Zealand road safety targets, a <e>projection</e> was made for a reduction in social cost of 15.5 percent associated with improvements in crashworthiness, which is a measure of the occupant protection of the light passenger vehicle fleet. Since that document was produced, new estimates of crashworthiness have become available, allowing for a more accurate projection. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for projecting changes in casualty rates associated with passive safety features and to apply this methodology to produce a new prediction. METHOD: The shape of the age distribution of the New Zealand light passenger vehicle fleet was projected to 2010. Projected improvements in crashworthiness and associated reductions in social cost were also modeled based on historical trends. These projections of changes in the vehicle fleet age distribution and of improvements in crashworthiness together provided a basis for estimating the future performance of the fleet in terms of secondary safety. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A large social cost reduction of about 22 percent for 2010 compared to the year 2000 was predicted due to the expected huge impact of improvements in passive vehicle features on road trauma in New Zealand. Countries experiencing improvements in their vehicle fleets can also expect significant reductions in road injury compared to a less crashworthy passenger fleet. Such road safety gains can be analyzed using some of the methodology described here.",M1
17708227,"Predicting [corrected] extinction risk in spite of predator-prey oscillations.Most population viability analyses (PVA) assume that the effects of species interactions are subsumed by population-level parameters. We examine how robust five commonly used PVA models are to violations of this assumption. We develop a stochastic, stage-structured predator-prey model and simulate prey population vital rates and abundance. We then use simulated data to parameterize and estimate risk for three demographic models (static <e>projection</e> matrix, stochastic projection matrix, stochastic vital rate matrix) and two time series models (diffusion approximation [DA], corrupted diffusion approximation [CDA]). Model bias is measured as the absolute deviation between estimated and observed quasi-extinction risk. Our results highlight three generalities about the application of single-species models to multi-species conservation problems. First, our collective model results suggest that most single-species PVA models overestimate extinction risk when species interactions cause periodic variation in abundance. Second, the DA model produces the most (conservatively) biased risk forecasts. Finally, the CDA model is the most robust PVA to population cycles caused by species interactions. CDA models produce virtually unbiased and relatively precise risk estimates even when populations cycle strongly. High performance of simple time series models like the CDA owes to their ability to effectively partition stochastic and deterministic sources of variation in population abundance.",M1
17691537,"Fifty years of United Kingdom national population <e>projections</e>: how accurate have they been?This article considers the accuracy of the official national population projections made for the UK over the last fifty years The findings take account of the revision to population estimates following the 2001 Census and are largely similar to the findings of a previous review carried out after the 1991 Census. The total population has been projected reasonably accurately but this is largely a chance result of compensating errors in the assumptions of fertility, mortality and net migration. The largest differences between projected and actual populations are for the very young and the very old, while projections of the working age population have been comparatively accurate. Fertility and mortality errors have reduced in more recent projections, while migration errors have grown. However, this may simply reflect the volatility or stability of the respective time-series at the time the projections are made. Changes in estimates of the past and current size of the population (highlighted by the revisions made to population estimates following the 2001 Census) are also shown to play a part in explaining projection error.",M1
17610397,"Statistical <e>projection</e> of clinical subsample estimates to a survey population.BACKGROUND: The goal of public health research often involves estimating clinical outcomes for a broad target population. The gold standard for the basis of such inference is a nationally representative survey that includes a clinical component. The cost of this gold standard can be prohibitive, and alternative approaches are needed. We propose a statistical methodology for projecting estimates from a clinical subsample to a larger survey population that has utility in periodontal research. METHODS: The statistical methodology consists of fitting prediction models to clinical outcome variables that are available only for a subset of the survey population. Variables measured on the larger survey population are included in the model as predictors. The resulting prediction equations are applied to the entire survey population to produce estimates of prevalence for the clinical outcomes of interest. Methods for computing variance estimates for the model-based predictions also are proposed. RESULTS: This projection methodology was developed originally for use with a nationally representative sample of the veteran population in the United States as part of the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study. Details of the projection methodology and illustration of its use are provided. Issues associated with the application of this methodology to periodontal research are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed projection methodology supports valid inference about clinical outcomes to a broad population using data from a more narrowly defined clinical subsample. This approach is useful in addressing important public health questions until such time as a nationally representative clinical study can be undertaken.",M1
17603823,"Cognitive impairment in older people: future demand for long-term care services and the associated costs.BACKGROUND: <e>Projections</e> are presented of future numbers of older people with cognitive impairment (CI) in England, their demand for long-term care (LTC) services and future costs of their care. The sensitivity of the projections to factors that are likely to affect future LTC expenditure is explored. These factors include future numbers of older people, prevalence rates of CI, trends in household composition, informal care provision, care service patterns and unit costs. METHODS: A macrosimulation (or cell-based) model was developed to produce the projections, building on an earlier PSSRU model. Base case assumptions are made about trends in key factors expected to impact on future LTC expenditure, and variant assumptions about the key factors are introduced to test for sensitivity. RESULTS: Expenditure on LTC services for older people with CI is projected to rise from 0.60% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ( pound5.4 billion) in 2002 to 0.96% of GDP ( pound16.7 billion) in 2031, under base case assumptions. Under variant assumptions, the projection for 2031 ranges from 0.83% to 1.11% of GDP. These figures do not include the opportunity costs of informal care. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity analysis shows that projected demand for LTC is sensitive to assumptions about the future numbers of older people and future prevalence rates of CI and functional disability. Projected expenditure is also sensitive to assumptions about future rises in the real unit costs of services.",M1

17328042,"The United States rheumatology workforce: supply and demand, 2005-2025.OBJECTIVE: To develop and apply a model that allows prediction of current and future supply and demand for rheumatology services in the US. METHODS: A supply model was developed using the age and sex distribution of current physicians, retirement and mortality rates, the number of fellowship slots and fill rates, and practice patterns of rheumatologists. A Markov <e>projection</e> model was used to project needs in 5-year increments from 2005 to 2025. RESULTS: The number of rheumatologists for adult patients in the US in 2005 is 4,946. Male and female rheumatologists are equally distributed up to age 44; above age 44, men predominate. The percent of women in adult rheumatology is projected to increase from 30.2% in 2005 to 43.6% in 2025. The mean number of visits per rheumatologist per year is 3,758 for male rheumatologists and 2,800 for female rheumatologists. Assuming rheumatology supply and demand are in equilibrium in 2005, the demand for rheumatologists in 2025 is projected to exceed supply by 2,576 adult and 33 pediatric rheumatologists. The primary factors in the excess demand are an aging population which will increase the number of people with rheumatic disorders, growth in the Gross Domestic Product, and flat rheumatology supply due to fixed numbers entering the workforce and to retirements. The productivity of younger rheumatologists and women, who will make up a greater percentage of the future workforce, may also have important effects on supply. Unknown effects that could influence these projections include technology advances, more efficient practice methods, changes in insurance reimbursements, and shifting lifestyles. Current data suggest that the pediatric rheumatology workforce is experiencing a substantial excess of demand versus supply. CONCLUSION: Based on assessment of supply and demand under current scenarios, the demand for rheumatologists is expected to exceed supply in the coming decades. Strategies for the profession to adapt to this changing health care landscape include increasing the number of fellows each year, utilizing physician assistants and nurse practitioners in greater numbers, and improving practice efficiency.",M1
17202254,"Neural substrates of envisioning the future.The ability to envision specific future episodes is a ubiquitous mental phenomenon that has seldom been discussed in the neuroscience literature. In this study, subjects underwent functional MRI while using event cues (e.g., Birthday) as a guide to vividly envision a personal future event, remember a personal memory, or imagine an event involving a familiar individual. Two basic patterns of data emerged. One set of regions (e.g., within left lateral premotor cortex; left precuneus; right posterior cerebellum) was more active while envisioning the future than while recollecting the past (and more active in both of these conditions than in the task involving imagining another person). These regions appear similar to those emerging from the literature on imagined (simulated) bodily movements. A second set of regions (e.g., bilateral posterior cingulate; bilateral parahippocampal gyrus; left occipital cortex) demonstrated indistinguishable activity during the future and past tasks (but greater activity in both tasks than the imagery control task); similar regions have been shown to be important for remembering previously encountered visual-spatial contexts. Hence, differences between the future and past tasks are attributed to differences in the demands placed on regions that underlie motor imagery of bodily movements, and similarities in activity for these two tasks are attributed to the reactivation of previously experienced visual-spatial contexts. That is, subjects appear to place their future scenarios in well known visual-spatial contexts. Our results offer insight into the fundamental and little-studied capacity of vivid mental <e>projection</e> of oneself in the future.",M1
17175565,"Long-term care and dementia services: an impending crisis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: since the transfer of long-stay care to the independent sector, provision of places in care homes in the United Kingdom has varied in response to market trends, and has shown a consistent fall in the past 10 years. People with dementia constitute the largest diagnostic group affected by these changes, and are also likely to be the group that will determine future need. We therefore estimated the number and proportion of older residents in care homes who suffer from dementia relative to all those with dementia in the United Kingdom and projected future levels of demand on the basis of this data. DESIGN AND METHOD: the number of dementia cases in long-stay care was estimated from a random sample survey in south-east England and compared with data on age-specific prevalence. <e>Projections</e> of future demand were based on UK population projections for the next 40 years. MAIN RESULT: over half of all people with dementia in the United Kingdom are in care homes. The number of available long-stay places in care homes has fallen by one-sixth over the past decade. Projection of future demand suggests that well over double the present total places in care homes would be required by 2043 to maintain the present ratio of institutional to community services for dementia. CONCLUSION: this finding suggests an impending crisis of availability. A more realistic scenario calls for investment in affordable domiciliary care of good quality, but it will also depend on the acceptance of the fact that the main function of long-stay care for old people is now to provide for advanced cases of dementia, with consequent requirement for improvement in staff ratios and training.",M1
17078415,"Nursing home safety: a review of the literature.The number of older persons in the United States is rapidly growing and, based on this growth <e>projection</e>, the number of consumers needing nursing home (NH) care will likely triple in the next 10 years. Although NHs have been bombarded and scrutinized about the care that they provide, the concept of safety (specifically, error prevention) remains at the margin of most quality improvement efforts. The purpose of this review is to explore what has recently been written (2000-2005) about the evolution of the NH as an organization focused on safety and the most critical clinical processes that must be closely monitored for a safe NH environment to occur. After a thorough review of both organizational and clinical NH literature, 30 organizational studies and 39 clinically based studies were reviewed. The review revealed that, organizationally, teamwork, communication, and leadership all were critical in resident and staff outcomes and clinically, assessment was an important missing process at critical points in the residents' care for prevention and timely treatment of potentially dangerous conditions. The value of the registered nurse (RN) in this setting was clear in the many assessment issues noted and the lack of RN guidance for adherence to recognized practice guidelines. To explicate the role of the RN, first, better outcome measures must be developed that are nurse sensitive. A second clear agenda for NH research is the explication of the role of leadership, particularly nursing leadership, to create an environment where open and accurate communication can be accomplished among all of the diverse NH roles. This will help all members of the team to identify care improvement opportunities. Finally, a new frontier for the NH setting is the use of technology and the need to harness the information that has set in the NH system for years. Information mastery for staff and leadership is a necessary aspect of the organization that must be developed to provide sound information for strategic and focused change to occur.",M1

METHODS: An economic simulation model was developed to project the number of cardiovascular events and associated direct and indirect costs under varying treatment scenarios. RESULTS: In an average-sized commercial health plan with 210,000 covered lives and 9,336 high-risk patients, an uptake of rosuvastatin by 11% of high-risk patients would result in eight fewer cardiovascular events, a net savings of 0.85 million dollars in direct medical costs and a net savings of 36,404 dollars in productivity loss over a period of 5 years. The overall reduction in total costs is equivalent to 1735 dollars per rosuvastatin-treated patient.

16806563,"Hong Kong's health spending <e>projections</e> through 2033.OBJECTIVE: To derive actuarial projection estimates of Hong Kong's total domestic health expenditure to the year 2033. METHODS: Disaggregating health expenditure by age, sex, unit cost and utilisation level, we estimated future health spending by projecting utilisation (by public/private, inpatient/outpatient care) to reflect demographic changes and associated increase in demand (from higher expectations and greater intensity of care), and then multiplying such by the projected unit costs (incorporating the impact of key cost drivers such as public expectations, technological changes and potential productivity gains) to obtain total expenditure estimates. RESULTS: The model was most sensitive to the excess health care price inflation rate, i.e. the annual price/cost growth of medical goods and services over and above per capita GDP growth. Population ageing and growth per se, without taking into account related technologic innovation for chronic conditions that particularly afflict older adults, contribute relatively little to overall spending growth. Given the model assumptions, it is possible to limit total health spending to below 10% of GDP by 2033, where the public share would gradually decline from the current 57% to between 46% and 49%. CONCLUSIONS: Expenditure control through global budgeting, technology assessment and demand-side constraints should be considered although their effectiveness remains inconclusive.",M1

In the department of Bas-Rhin the incidence is increasing by 0.1% per annum in men and by 4.4% in women. The aim is to analyse and predict the trend of lung cancer incidence in Bas-Rhin from 1975 to 2014. METHODS: The incidence data from 1975 to 1999 were extracted from the Bas-Rhin cancer registry. Population estimates (2594 years) were made for the period 1975-2014. Predictions were based on a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: Between 1975 and 1999 the incidence of lung cancer increased by 4.5% p.a. in women. In men it increased by 1.6% p.a. between 1975 and 1989 and then diminished. For the periods 2000-2004, 2005-2009 and 2010-2014 respectively the rates should reach 25.6, 32.9 and 42.8 per 100,000 in women and 117.5, 111.6 and 110.1 per 100,000 in men. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing tobacco smoking among women and a reduction among men could be one of the reasons for the respective increasing and decreasing incidences.",M1
16735291,"Improving <e>projections</e> at the country level: the UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package 2005.BACKGROUND: UNAIDS has developed the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) as a tool for national programmes to use for making national estimates and short term projections of HIV prevalence. EPP provides direct input to Spectrum, which produces incidence, deaths, and AIDS impacts. METHODS: The latest version, EPP 2005, includes substantial methodological improvements over the previous version. These include: (1) parallel, but unique, interfaces for generalised and concentrated epidemics; (2) use of maximum likelihood fitting procedures; (3) a new procedure, known as level fits, adjusting for expansion of national surveillance systems into lower prevalence sites; (4) provisions for handling turnover in at-risk populations, including the reassignment of HIV positive former members to lower risk populations; and (5) user-defined calibration to HIV prevalence levels from general population or other epidemiological surveys. RESULTS: Following regional training in mid 2005, this new version has been applied by many national programmes to make their end of 2005 estimates of HIV infections. UNAIDS has combined these national estimates to form the 2005 global HIV and AIDS estimates. CONCLUSION: EPP 2005 is a substantial improvement over previous versions, forming a solid base for the next round of modifications. Proposed modifications for that next version are presented for the reader's information.",M1
16672043,"Estimating and projecting HIV prevalence and AIDS deaths in Tanzania using antenatal surveillance data.BACKGROUND: The Estimations and <e>Projections</e> Package (EPP 2005) for HIV/AIDS estimates and projects HIV prevalence, number of people living with HIV and new HIV infections and AIDS cases using antenatal clinic (ANC) surveillance data. The prevalence projection produced by EPP can be transferred to SPECTRUM, a demographic projection model, to calculate the number of AIDS deaths. This paper presents estimates and projections of HIV prevalence, new cases of HIV infections and AIDS deaths in Tanzania between 2001 and 2010 using the EPP 2005 and SPECTRUM soft-wares on ANC data. METHODS: For this study we used; the 1985-2004 ANC data set, the 2005 UN population estimates for urban and rural adults, which is based on the 2002 population census, and results of the 2003 Tanzania HIV Indicator Survey. The ANC surveillance sites were categorized into urban and rural areas on the basis of the standard national definitions of urban and rural areas, which led to 40 urban and 35 rural clinic sites. The rural and urban epidemics were run independently by fitting the model to all data and on level fits. RESULTS: The national HIV prevalence increased from 0% in 1981 to a peak of 8.1% in 1995, and gradually decreased to 6.5% in 2004 which stabilized until 2010. The urban HIV epidemic increased from 0% in 1981 peaking at 12.6% in 1992 and leveled to between 10.9% and 11.8% from 2003 to 2010. The rural epidemic peaked in 1995 at 7.0% and gradually declined to 5.2% in 2004, and then stabilized at between 5.1% and 5.3% from 2005 to 2010. New infections are projected to rise steadily, resulting in 250,000 new cases in 2010. Deaths due to AIDS started in 1985 and rose steadily to reach 120,000 deaths in 2010, with more females dying than men. CONCLUSION: The fact that the number of new infections is projected to increase steadily to reach 250,000 per year in 2010 calls for more concerted efforts to combat the spread of HIV infection particularly in the rural areas where the infrastructure needed for prevention programmes such as counseling and testing, condom accessibility and AIDS information is less developed.",M1

Projecting ischaemic heart disease mortality in New Zealand to 2015.AIMS: This study aims to identify how ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality rates in New Zealand have varied between successive cohorts and time periods. This information is then used to project IHD mortality rates and counts (burdens) out to year 2011-15. METHODS: Age/period/cohort models were constructed (5-year periods and 5-year age groups, generating 10-year overlapping cohorts) using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. Data were available from 1956 for the total population and from 1981 for Maori. The <e>projection</e> period was 2001-5 to 2011-15. Uncertainty was quantified as the Bayesian 90% credible interval. RESULTS: IHD mortality rates for all age by gender groups increased from 1956-60 to peak in 1966-70, then declined by more than 60% to current (1996-2000) levels. However, the decline has been much shallower for Maori. This decline has resulted from increasingly favourable period effects since 1971-75 (less marked for Maori). However, no substantive cohort effects have been seen, at least from the 1891 to the 1951 cohort. Our model suggests that, for the first time, a substantive and unfavourable cohort effect may be emerging among recent birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: IHD mortality rates are projected to continue to fall from 2001-05 to 2011-15, albeit more slowly than in the past as the increasing (favourable) period effect is partly offset by an emerging (unfavourable) cohort effect. The result is a relatively small projected decline in absolute IHD mortality burden overall, but an actual increase among Maori.",M1

16448686,"<e>Projection</e> of hazardous air pollutant emissions to future years.Projecting a hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission inventory to future years can provide valuable information for air quality management activities such as prediction of program successes and helping to assess future priorities. We have projected the 1999 National Emission Inventory for HAPs to numerous future years up to 2020 using the following tools and data: the Emissions Modeling System for Hazardous Air Pollutants (EMS-HAP), the National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM), emission reduction information resulting from national standards and economic growth data. This paper discusses these projection tools, the underlying data, limitations and the results. The results presented include total HAP emissions (sum of pollutants) and toxicity-weighted HAP emissions for cancer and respiratory noncancer effects. Weighting emissions by toxicity does not consider fate, transport, or location and behavior of receptor populations and can only be used to estimate relative risks of direct emissions. We show these projections, along with historical emission trends. The data show that stationary source programs under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and mobile source programs which reduce hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions, as well as toxic emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline, have contributed to and are expected to continue to contribute to large declines in air toxics emissions, in spite of economic and population growth. We have also analyzed the particular HAPs that dominate the source sectors to better understand the historical and future year trends and the differences across sectors.",M1

When weighted for population growth, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 2002 projection of future RN shortages indicates a more imminent and stronger decline in RN supply than initially presented. Analysis of national RN survey data from 1977 to 2000 finds recent decreased gains and increased losses from the RN license pool, a decline in RNs working or looking for work in nursing, and RN supply shifts away from bedside nursing.

Given the potential public health demands implied by increasing numbers of elderly drug users, the goal is to project the numbers of current drug users aged 50 years and older in 2020. METHODS: Using the modeling and <e>projection</e> methods of Gfroerer et al (2003) applied to data from the 1999 to 2001 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse, projections were developed for the use of marijuana, nonmedical use of any prescription-type psychotherapeutic drug, and any illicit drug use. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2001 to 2020, past-year marijuana use in persons 50 years and older is forecast to increase from 1.0% to 2.9%. The number of users is expected to increase from 719,000 to almost 3.3 million, reflecting the combined effects of the increase in rate of use and a projected 51.9% increase in the civilian noninstitutionalized population in this age group. Use of any illicit drug will increase from 2.2% (1.6 million) to 3.1% (3.5 million), and nonmedical use of psychotherapeutic drugs will increase from 1.2% (911,000) to 2.4% (almost 2.7 million). CONCLUSIONS: These projections call attention to changes to be considered in planning and to the need for improved knowledge of the biomedical and psychosocial effects of nonmedical drug use on aging and elderly individuals.",M1
16268757,"QSAR applicabilty domain estimation by <e>projection</e> of the training set descriptor space: a review.As the use of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models for chemical management increases, the reliability of the predictions from such models is a matter of growing concern. The OECD QSAR Validation Principles recommend that a model should be used within its applicability domain (AD). The Setubal Workshop report provided conceptual guidance on defining a (Q)SAR AD, but it is difficult to use directly. The practical application of the AD concept requires an operational definition that permits the design of an automatic (computerised), quantitative procedure to determine a models AD. An attempt is made to address this need, and methods and criteria for estimating AD through training set interpolation in descriptor space are reviewed. It is proposed that response space should be included in the training set representation. Thus, training set chemicals are points in n-dimensional descriptor space and m-dimensional model response space. Four major approaches for estimating interpolation regions in a multivariate space are reviewed and compared: range, distance, geometrical, and probability density distribution.",M1
16202148,"The future prospects of Lithuanian family physicians: a 10-year forecasting study.BACKGROUND: When health care reform was started in 1991, the physician workforce in Lithuania was dominated by specialists, and the specialty of family physician (FP) did not exist at all. During fifteen years of Lithuania's independence this specialty evolved rapidly and over 1,900 FPs were trained or retrained. Since 2003, the Lithuanian health care sector has undergone restructuring to optimize the network of health care institutions as well as the delivery of services; specific attention has been paid to the development of services provided by FPs, with more health care services shifted from the hospital level to the primary health care level. In this paper we analyze if an adequate workforce of FPs will be available in the future to take over new emerging tasks. METHODS: A computer spreadsheet simulation model was used to project the supply of FPs in 2006-2015. The supply was projected according to three scenarios, which took into account different rates of retirement, migration and drop out from training. In addition different population <e>projections</e> and enrollment numbers in residency programs were also considered. Three requirement scenarios were made using different approaches. In the first scenario we used the requirement estimated by a panel of experts using the Delphi technique. The second scenario was based on the number of visits to FPs in 2003 and took into account the goal to increase the number of visits. The third scenario was based on the determination that one FP should serve no more than 2,000 inhabitants. The three scenarios for the projection of supply were compared with the three requirement scenarios. RESULTS: The supply of family physicians will be higher in 2015 compared to 2005 according to all projection scenarios. The largest differences in the supply scenarios were caused by different migration rates, enrollment numbers to training programs and the retirement age. The second supply scenario, which took into account 1.1% annual migration rate, stable enrollment to residency programs and later retirement, appears to be the most probable. The first requirement scenario, which was based on the opinion of well-informed key experts in the field, appears to be the best reflection of FP requirements; however none of the supply scenarios considered would satisfy these requirements. CONCLUSION: Despite the rapid expansion of the FP workforce during the last fifteen years, ten-year forecasts of supply and requirement indicate that the number of FPs in 2015 will not be sufficient. The annual enrollment in residency training programs should be increased by at least 20% for the next three years. Accurate year-by-year monitoring of the workforce is crucial in order to prevent future shortages and to maintain the desired family physician workforce.",M1

METHODS: The CORE-Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model was used to predict costs and outcomes for patients with uncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes who remain at established population mean HbA(1c) values in comparison with those for patients who maintain the standard value of 7.0% or the target value of 6.5%. The analysis was run from a societal perspective over a 10-year time horizon. The costs of treating complications and medication costs were retrieved from published sources. Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the discount rate and time horizon. RESULTS: This analysis found that maintaining HbA(1c) at the ADA standard value of 7.0% and the AACE target value of 6.5% in patients with uncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes could achieve total direct medical cost savings of nearly 35 US dollars and 50 billion US dollars , respectively, over 10 years. When indirect cost savings were included, the total savings increased to between nearly 50 billion US dollars and 72 billion US dollars for these respective HbA(1c) targets, corresponding to 4% and 6% of the total annual US health care costs of 1.3 trillion US dollars. Reduced savings were observed with a higher discount rate and shorter time horizon, but savings increased as the time horizon became longer. These cost savings must be weighed against the cost of reaching the HbA(1c) goals and the likelihood of achieving the clinical objectives. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient targeting of financial resources toward the goal of lowering HbA(1c) in line with published guidelines could lead to financial savings in the range from nearly 35 billion US dollars to 72 billion US dollars over the next 10 years.",M1
16080130,"Anticipating change: how many acute care hospital beds will Manitoba regions need in 2020?Being able to anticipate future needs for health services presents a challenge for health planners. Using existing population <e>projections</e>, two models are presented to estimate the demand for hospital beds in regions of Manitoba in 2020. The first, a current-use projection model, simply projects the average use for a recent 3-year period into the future. The second, a 10-year trend analysis, uses Poisson regression to project future demand. The current-use projection suggests a substantial increase in the demand for hospital beds, while the trend analysis projects a decline. The last projections are consistent with ongoing increases in rates of day surgeries and declines in lengths of stay. The current-use projections need to be considered in the context of relatively low occupancy rates in rural hospitals and previous research on appropriateness of stays in acute care hospitals. If measures are taken to ensure more appropriate use of acute care hospital beds in the future, then the current-use projections of bed shortages are not a cause for concern.",M1
16012375,"[Lung cancer mortality among women in France. Trend analysis and <e>projection</e> between 1975 and 2014, with a bayesian age-cohort model]BACKGROUND: With 4,500 deaths in year 2000, female lung cancer mortality rates increased by 3% every year over the last two decades in France. This trend, not observed among males, is attributed to the regular increase of female smoking. In order to answer French Health decider's concerns, we estimated the future female lung cancer mortality rates and numbers of deaths for the next fifteen years, in France and its regions. METHODS: Analyses were based on numbers of female deaths from lung cancer observed between 1975 and 1999, and on past and future population estimates for 1975-2014, at national and regional levels. Mortality rates and numbers of deaths in France and its regions by 5-year periods and 5-year age groups were given in the 1975-1999 death certificate data base, and were projected for 2000-2014. The analysis used a bayesian approach of the age-cohort model with auto-regressive constraints on parameters. Estimated mortality rates were standardized on truncated 20-85 + world population. RESULTS: French female lung cancer mortality increased by 3% every year between 1975 and 1999. In period 1995-1999, truncated 20-85 + mortality rates, and number of deaths per year were respectively 11.4 per 100,000 and 4,000. Mortality rates increased in all regions but variations were maximum in Corsica (+ 314%) and minimum in Auvergne (+ 37%). For the whole of France, the estimated truncated 20-85 + standardized rate, was respectively, 14.1 and 22.5 per 100,000 in period 2000-04 and period 2010-14, which represents a 60% increase between these two time periods. At the regional level, the maximum variation was found in Languedoc-Roussillon (107%), the minimum in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (40%). CONCLUSIONS: The bayesian approach of the age-cohort model is increasingly used because it produces stable projections, without having to include other cancer parameters. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to extend this model by incorporating a tobacco consumption component, in order to assess scenarios based on consumption decreases.",M1
15923454,"Smoking attributable mortality for Taiwan and its <e>projection</e> to 2020 under different smoking scenarios.OBJECTIVES: To estimate smoking attributable mortality (SAM) in Taiwan for the years 2001 through 2020 under scenarios of reductions in smoking rates by 0%, 2%, 4%, and 10% per year. METHOD: The smoking attributable fraction (SAF) was used to calculate SAM from the risk experience in following up a large cohort (86 580 people) in Taiwan. Smoking rates were based on the 2001 National Health Interview Survey and other national surveys. An average 10 year lag was assumed between smoking rates and subsequent mortality. RESULTS: In 2001, 18 803 deaths, or 1 out of 4 deaths (27%), in middle aged men (35-69 years old) were attributable to smoking. SAM has been increasing and will continue to increase if smoking rates remain constant or even if reduced annually by 2%. SAM would begin to decrease only if rates were to be reduced by at least 4% a year. CONCLUSIONS: The projected SAM in this study illustrates the seriousness of smoking caused mortality. Current efforts in tobacco control would lead to a progressive increase in SAM, unless efforts were doubled and smoking rates reduced by more than 4% a year. The urgency in requiring stronger tobacco control programmes to attenuate the staggering death tolls is compelling.",M1

A future land-use <e>projection</e> in the St. Louis metropolitan area from 2005 to 2030 using three economic growth scenarios (base, low, and high) and a long-term precipitation dataset were used to predict the mean annual surface runoff and mean annual NPS pollutant loads in the region. Results show mean annual TN increases of 0.21%, 0.13%, and 0.14% by 2030 compared to 2000 under the base, high, and low scenarios, respectively. TSP and TP showed similar trends with different magnitudes. Corresponding changes in annual mean surface runoff were shown to be lower than expected, which might be attributed to the small-scale conversion pattern of land uses. In the most dramatic change (high growth) scenario, the runoff would increase across time but at varying rates, and temporal pollutant loads would result in a more complicated pattern than in the other scenarios. This is attributed to the complex interactions between event mean concentrations of pollutants and the magnitude of changes in land-use acre-ages. By integrating L-THIA with LEAM, LEAMwq was found to be a useful planning tool to illustrate in a quick and simple manner how future water quality is connected to decision-making on future land-use change.",M1
15893110,"Forecasting versus <e>projection</e> models in epidemiology: the case of the SARS epidemics.In this work we propose a simple mathematical model for the analysis of the impact of control measures against an emerging infection, namely, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R0, were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.",M1

Epidemiologic evidence on changes in lifestyle and risk factors related with breast cancer, and data from migrant studies strongly suggest that breast cancer might further increase. In order to estimate the long-term trend in mortality of breast cancer in Korean women, we analyzed age-specific mortality rates for breast cancer over the past 20 years, and made a <e>projection</e> up to 2020 using a linear regression model with the Poisson distribution. The age-adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer per 100,000 persons were 2.84 in 1983, 4.91 in 1993, and 6.26 in 2003. The predicted expected age-adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer are 6.51 for 2005, 7.37 for 2010, 8.22 for 2015, and 9.07 for 2020, with an estimated annual increment of breast cancer mortality of 0.1704. Accordingly, 1,564 women in 2005 and 3,087 in 2020 will be expected to die of breast cancer in Korea. Compared with the rate in 1983, this indicates a more than 3-fold increase by 2020.

15368833,"Future demand for general practice services: effects of population change and trends in service use.This study investigated three key determinants of demand for general practice services: population growth, population ageing and trends in service use. <e>Projection</e> of future service use on the basis of the two demographic factors yielded a projected growth in number of general practice services of 5.9% by 2006, with a further 6.5% growth by 2011. When trends in service use were taken into account as well as demographics, a lower rate of growth in services was projected, but an increasing proportion of long consultations and an increasing proportion of services for older adult patients. It is concluded that population ageing and population growth will continue to be major drivers of demand for general practice services in the next decade. Patterns of service use will also be a key contributor, with increased use of long consultations suggesting a greater requirement for the general practice workforce than has previously been proposed.",M1
15262565,"Update and <e>projection</e> on HIV/AIDS in Taiwan.The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Taiwan started in 1986, with 5,221 cases of HIV infections, 1,596 cases of AIDS, and 911 deaths reported through 2003. National surveillance data indicate that men who have sex with men accounted for 48.2% of HIV infections, followed by heterosexual men (33.8%) and heterosexual women (6.1%). Only 353 (6.8%) of all HIV cases are females. The average age of HIV-infected persons, AIDS cases, and deaths was 31.2, 36.2, and 39.0 years, respectively. The incidence of HIV infection has increased by approximately 15% every year since 1997. The continuing epidemic will likely burden the national health care system and may result in an estimated socioeconomic loss of U.S. dollars 1.6 billion in 2010, as 15,125 HIV infections and 1,420 deaths from AIDS are projected. To respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Taiwan, the government has been working with nongovernmental organizations to promote HIV testing, conduct various education programs, and reach out to high-risk groups. HIV/AIDS patients are linked to medical care and provided with free highly active antiretroviral treatment. The main challenge is to reduce HIV-related stigma.

In this study, a predictive model was developed to translate changes in fecundity of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a short-term laboratory toxicity test to alterations in population growth rate. The model uniquely combines a Leslie population <e>projection</e> matrix and the logistic equation. Application of the model requires only a life table for the organism of interest, a measure of carrying capacity for the given population, and an estimation of the effect of a stressor on vital rates. The model was applied to investigate population dynamics for fathead minnow exposed to the androgen receptor agonist 17beta-trenbolone. Organismal-level responses for fathead minnows exposed to varying levels of 17beta-trenbolone were used to determine projected alterations in a population existing in a small body of water containing varying concentrations of the androgen. Fathead minnow populations occurring at carrying capacity and subsequently exposed to 0.027 microg/L of 17beta-trenbolone exhibited a 51% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure. Populations at carrying capacity exposed to concentrations of 17beta-trenbolone &gt; or = 0.266 microg/L exhibited a 93% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure.

The number of oncologists and physicians implicated in oncology (organ specialists, radiotherapists and paediatricians) entering the marked in the next few years will not be modified. Consequently, the number of physicians will dramatically decrease in the next 15 years resulting in a 25% global working-age population reduction. Our present analysis indicates that the number of oncologists will not be sufficient to meet future demand. Our data suggests that steps should be taken to stop the ongoing decline in the number of physicians involved in oncology and the decline of physicians in training. Consideration should be given to actions designed to increase the number of oncologists in practise in the years ahead.",M1
15150609,"Estimation and <e>projection</e> of the national profile of cancer mortality in China: 1991-2005.There are no national-level data on cancer mortality in China since two surveys in 1973-1975 and 1990-1992 (a 10% sample), but ongoing surveillance systems, based on nonrandom selected populations, give an indication as to the trends for major cancers. Based on a log-linear regression model with Poisson errors, the annual rates of change for 10 cancers and all other cancers combined, by age, sex and urban/rural residence were estimated from the data of the surveillance system of the Center for Health Information and Statistics, covering about 10% of the national population. These rates of change were applied to the survey data of 1990-1992 to estimate national mortality in the year 2000, and to make projections for 2005. Mortality rates for all cancers combined, adjusted for age, are predicted to change little between 1991 and 2005 (-0.8% in men and +2.5% in women), but population growth and ageing will result in an increasing number of deaths, from 1.2 to 1.8 million. The largest predicted increases are for the numbers of female breast (+155.4%) and lung cancers (+112.1% in men, +153.5% in women). For these two sites, mortality rates will almost double. Cancer will make an increasing contribution to the burden of diseases in China in the 21st century. The marked increases in risk of cancers of the lung, female breast and large bowel indicate priorities for prevention and control. The increasing trends in young age groups for cancers of the cervix, lung and female breast suggest that their predicted increases may be underestimated, and that more attention should be paid to strategies for their prevention and control.",M1
15146660,"[Demographic forecasts of medical workforce supply in France (2000-2050). What numerus clausus for what future?]In France, medical training and graduation of medical doctors are under the full control of the State. A numerus clausus barrier is established between the first year and the second year of medical schools. The first year is open to all students having successfully completed their secondary schooling (18 years old) but the number of those allowed to start the second year is decided every year by the government. Foreign medical graduates can practise only if they have obtained authorization from the State. Theoretically, the authorities have all means for shaping the size of the medical workforce, either in the short term (e.g. by importing foreign medical graduates to fill up vacant posts) or in the long run (by increasing or decreasing the numerus clausus, or student intake, to cope with shortage or oversupply of doctors). In practice, due to various constraints, the issue is far from simple (resistance to change, divergent lobbying forces and, more importantly, lack of relevant information). METHODS: In this study, the forecasting techniques of demography are used to assess the future trends of supply of medical doctors, on the basis of the formula t2 = t1 + e - l t1 is the medical workforce at the beginning of the period t2 is the medical workforce at the end of the period e is the number of doctors entering the medical workforce (new national graduates or foreign graduates) during the period l is the number of doctors leaving the medical workforce (death, retirement, out migration) during the period. Calculations are performed for each 5-year age group and for the successive 5-year periods. At the end of a 5-year period, one obtains the number of professionally active doctors in each 5-year age group and, by addition, the total number of active physicians in the country. The starting point of the <e>projection</e> work is December 31st 2000 when the French medical profession numbered 200,800 (i.e. 334 physicians per 100,000 population). As concerns the inflow e (physicians entering the profesion), calculations are performed step by step: number of students starting the 2nd year of medical schools: two basic hypotheses are adopted as concerns the future intake decided by the government, 8000 and 6000 (Table A) from the numerus clausus barrier (2nd year of medical training) to the 6th year of medical training from the 6th year to graduation (the residency period) from graduation to registering in the Medical Council (effective start of the career) moreover, it is assumed that from 2000 through 2025, for each 5-year period, 1200 foreign medical graduates are allowed to join the national medical workforce; after 2025, this number will decrease to 300. As concerns the outflow l, a  professional life table  is used to determine the numbers of doctors of each age-group who leave the career by death, retirement, outmigration ... during each 5-year period (Table B). CONTEXT: From 1965 onwards, the number of students entering the medical schools grew steadily. The numerus clausus system, established in 1972, became effective five years later. However, due to resistance to change, the number of students allowed to start the 2nd year of medical schools reached a really low level only at mid-80's. In other words, during the period 1974-1994, France experienced a significant  graduate boom . The young doctors graduated during these two decades were in extremely high numbers and fueled a strong feeling of manpower oversupply. But from mid-90's onwards, the annual number of new graduates decreased (as a result of the low numerus clausus decided from mid-80's). In hospitals, post vacancies became frequent. In ambulatory care, medical practitioners encountered great difficulties to find locum tenens. From 2000 onwards, the term of manpower shortage was openly evoked in public debates. Starting 1999, the authorities increased again the numerus clausus which reached 5100 in October 2003. The mood was in favor of an upward trend. As a matter of fact, the numerous physicians graduated during the 1974-1994 boom period will begin to retire around the year 2010 and the French medical profession would sharply decrease without a vigorous growth of the numerous clausus. As started above, this projection work adopts two basic hypotheses as concerns the numerus clausus: the number of medical students allowed into the 2nd year, will progressively increase in October 2007 either to 6000 or to 8000 and will remain constant later on. RESULTS: With a 8000 student intake, the number of physicians (200,800 in 2000) will increase to 209,300 in 2010 then will slowly decrease to 205,900 in 2030. After, it will grow again and reach 229,500 in 2050. With a 6000 student intake, the number of physicians will also increase to 209,300 in 2010, then will rapidly decrease to 173,700 in 2030. The downward trend will stop in 2035. After, a slow growth will take place and the medical profession will number 173,500 in 2050 (Table C and Fig. 1). In other words, if a numerus clausus of 8000 is decided, the large retirement of the 1974-1994 graduate boomers (during the period 2010-2030) will be nearly offset by the newcomers. At the same time, the aging of the medical workforce will be stopped. Instead, a new younging process of the medical profession will take place again after 2020 (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). As it was the case during the early 70's, the younging process or pouring in of new graduates in great numbers may possibly fuel a strong perception of oversupply and lead to a sharp decrease of the numerus clausus after 2020 (sec variants Ib, Ic, IIb, IIc in Table A and C). As the numerus clausus has been increased during the first decade of the century, the two opposite moves (upward and downward) will create once again a phenomenon of  graduate boom . The boom will be far more important with a student intake of 8000 (Table F and Fig. 5) than a student intake of 6000 (Table G and Fig. 7). Even with 8000 students, the boom will not appear if the intake (numerus clausus) is not decreased after 2020. Consequently, if the decision is made today to increase sharply the student intake, we should be sure not to have to decrease it strongly in two or three decades. A less important increase decided today will not totally fill the gap when those graduated during the period 1974-1994 will retire and the national number of physicians will diminish. But such a decision will probably avoid the appearance of a feeling of oversupply in the coming decades and its subsequent problems (decreased student intake and, a decade later, a new graduate boom).",M1

(1964-2004)]During the last 4 decades, the Centre has performed 16 pieces of forecast on the various health professions in France, the majority being devoted to medical doctors. During the 60's, information were scarce, and calculations on both the inflows of future new graduates and the outflows of future deaths and retirements could not reach an acceptable level of relevance. In 1972, a numerus clausus system was established at the beginning of medical training. Moreover, efforts were deployed to collect better data and improve <e>projection</e> techniques. All these factors contributed to raise strongly the quality of the forecasting work. The discrepancies between the projected and actual trends were narrowing, as showed below: [table: see text] The forecasts were based on the demographic projection techniques and the results obtained showed not only the total number of active physicians in the country but equally the distribution by age groups of this total number. The latter element allows the predictions of the aging process of the medical profession as an impact of the present-day policies concerning medical student intake (numerus clausus).",M1

As individual extrapolations have a high degree of uncertainty, five methods with different theoretical bases are employed. Confidence in projections is increased for counties targeted by two or more projection methods. A county is considered at risk if it currently supports three or more sensitive resources, and is projected to experience significant growth by the year 2010 by two or more methods. Analysis designated 19 counties and two cities as at risk, highlighting within a large region the priority areas where state and regional efforts would contribute the most to integrating environmental considerations into the process of land development. The study also found that potentially severe ecological effects of future land-use change are not limited to the outskirts of major urban areas. Recreational demands on smaller communities with mountain and coastal resources are also significant, as are initiatives to promote economic development in rural areas of high ecological quality. This approach provides a comprehensive overview of potential regional development, leading to an objective prioritization of high-risk areas.

The material consisted of cephalometric films of 115 Class III untreated patients (59 females and 56 males, with a mean age of 11.6 +/- 1.7 and 12.7 +/- 1.3 years, respectively) who were observed for a minimum period of 1 year. All subjects were Caucasian and none could achieve an edge to edge occlusion. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify Class III subgroups. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was first applied to the whole sample and later to each of the clusters produced. Good and poor growers were identified on the basis of the change in Wits measurements with <e>projection</e> on the maxillary/mandibular planes bisector. The cut-off point between good and bad growers was a Wits value of 2.5 mm which was the upper limit of the 95 per cent confidence interval of measurement reproducibility.

The discrimination percentage (80 per cent) achieved when the DFA was performed on the whole sample was satisfactory.

For many purposes, however, the relevant variable is the population of a particular age group, rather than the population as a whole. We investigated the precision and bias of a variety of age-group projections at the national and state levels in the United States and for counties in Florida. We also compared the accuracy of state and county projections that were derived from full-blown applications of the cohort-component method with the accuracy of projections that were derived from a simpler, less data-intensive version of the method. We found that age-group error patterns are different for national projections than for subnational projections; that errors are substantially larger for some age groups than for others; that differences in errors among age groups decline as the projection horizon becomes longer; and that differences in methodological complexity have no consistent impact on the precision and bias of age-group projections.",M1

The molecular structures were optimized by HyperChem program using MM+ molecular mechanics and conformational search for the global minimum conformer. Eighty-seven theoretical descriptors were calculated for characterization of molecular structures. The network architecture was optimized, and suitable descriptors were selected applying a novel variable selection method. The 3DNET program was used for the calculation of descriptors and for neural network computations.

14533724,"High coronary heart disease rates among Dutch women of the baby boom, born 1945-1959: age-cohort analysis and <e>projection</e>.BACKGROUND: After a steep decline in older generations, coronary heart disease mortality is stagnating in female cohorts born after the Second World War. We analysed past trends and predicted future health care needs for coronary heart disease in the Dutch population. METHODS: A loglinear age-cohort model relates numbers of deaths and hospital admissions for coronary heart disease to sex, age, birth cohort and population size, and projects age-cohort changes over the future population. Population size, population forecasts and coronary heart disease mortality (period 1970-1999) are from vital statistics. Numbers of hospitalised acute coronary events are from the nationwide hospital register (period 1980-1999). RESULTS: Among men, the rate ratios of deaths and hospital admissions were, respectively, 0.21 (death) and 0.78 (survivors at discharge) in the cohorts born in the period 1948-1962 compared to the period 1918-1922. Among women, the same rate ratios were 0.41 and 1.89. The projection model predicts 22% less deaths from coronary heart disease and 22% more survivors of an infarction in 2015, among men. Among women, there will be 5% less deaths and 70% more survivors of an infarction, most of these being middle age members of the baby boom cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Stagnating all-cause mortality is correlated with an upward trend in coronary heart disease risk in the female baby boomers. Heart health care needs among middle-aged women will increase sharply. These changes are correlated to high lung cancer mortality and high smoking rates in these cohorts.",M1

The modeling results (first-, second-, and third-order sensitivity coefficients) for an ozone episode in central California are shown and discussed. Second-order sensitivity coefficients of ozone concentration with respect to domain-wide NO emissions show reasonable agreement with brute-force results and exhibit less noisy behavior. By using second-order sensitivity coefficients the nonlinear responses are better captured and described.

As were the other <e>projections</e> carried out in the past by the Centre de sociologie et de démographie médicales, the present work is basically a demographic projection. Whereas a projection of national workforce uses the total number of annual new graduates as inflow, a regional projection has to collect other types of data, as new graduates move freely from one region to another. This fundamental difference implies the use of more complex models for predicting the flows of newcomers at regional level. As concerns the outflow, a single table covering retirement and death is used for all regions. The medical profession is a homogeneous group and such a decision is not irrelevant. The second chapter presents briefly the results of the work as concerns one region. In the high variant, the regional number of physicians will continue to increase from 1998 to 2007 or 2008, then it will decrease. In the low variant, the growth will end in 2004 or 2005, followed by a stronger decreasing process. The decrease is caused by the  graduate boom  cohorts (doctors graduated during the 70's and 80's) reaching retirement age. Given the duration of medical training, the decrease will take place even if the numerous clausus (at the start of medical training) rises steadily right now. The decrease in the number of physicians will be accompanied by an aging process: the proportion of senior active doctors will raise and that of junior doctors will diminish. The third chapter evidences the diversity of the various regional trends.",M1

12512219,"Can 401(k) accumulations generate significant income for future retirees?This Issue Brief develops a model that project the proportion of an individual's preretirement income that might be replaced by 401(k) plan accumulations at retirement, under several different projected scenarios. The 401(k) participant behaviors in the model are based on the year-end 2000 database collected by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) and the Investment Company Institute (ICI) in their collaborative effort known as the EBRI/ICI Participant-Directed Retirement Plan Data Collection Project. The most significant factor affecting projected replacement rates at retirement is having access to a 401(k) plan. Projected replacement rates from 401(k) accumulations at retirement are reduced significantly when participants are not offered a 401(k) plan in all portions of their careers. Most 401(k) participants tend to have contributions in any given year. Thus, projecting that participants always have contributions (their own and/or employer contributions) every year raises projected replacement rates, but not by much compared with the importance of being offered a plan to begin with. The model simulations show that participant activities such as taking loans, taking preretirement withdrawals, or cashing out account balances at job change reduce projected 401(k) accumulations and thus replacement rates at age 65. Because loans are forecast to be paid back to the account in full, their effect on replacement rates at retirement in the model is the smallest. Even if equity returns in the future are projected to replicate the worst 50-year segment in the Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) 500 history (1929 to 1978), 401(k) accumulations are still projected to replace significant proportions of projected preretirement income. Another <e>projection</e> scenario forecasts participants experiencing a simulated three-year bear market (negative equity returns) either early in their careers, near the middle of their careers, or at the end of their careers. Forecasts of the effects of bear markets on 401(k) balances show that a bear market in equities is projected to have the largest effect the closer it occurs to age 65 (retirement), even though older participants typically have diversified their portfolios away from equities. A three-year bear market for those early in their careers would reduce median replacement rates from 401(k) accumulations by an estimated 2.9-3.7 percentage points, compared with 13.4-17.7 percentage points for those immediately before retirement. Similarly, a simulated three-year bull market (positive equity returns) is projected to have a larger positive effect on projected account balances and replacement rates the closer it occurs to retirement.",M1
12479501,"An approach to forecasting health expenditures, with application to the U.S. Medicare system.OBJECTIVE: To quantify uncertainty in forecasts of health expenditures. STUDY DESIGN: Stochastic time series models are estimated for historical variations in fertility, mortality, and health spending per capita in the United States, and used to generate stochastic simulations of the growth of Medicare expenditures. Individual health spending is modeled to depend on the number of years until death. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: A simple accounting model is developed for forecasting health expenditures, using the U.S. Medicare system as an example. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Medicare expenditures are projected to rise from 2.2 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) to about 8 percent of GDP by 2075. This increase is due in equal measure to increasing health spending per beneficiary and to population aging. The traditional <e>projection</e> method constructs high, medium, and low scenarios to assess uncertainty, an approach that has many problems. Using stochastic forecasting, we find a 95 percent probability that Medicare spending in 2075 will fall between 4 percent and 18 percent of GDP, indicating a wide band of uncertainty. Although there is substantial uncertainty about future mortality decline, it contributed little to uncertainty about future Medicare spending, since lower mortality both raises the number of elderly, tending to raise spending, and is associated with improved health of the elderly, tending to reduce spending. Uncertainty about fertility, by contrast, leads to great uncertainty about the future size of the labor force, and therefore adds importantly to uncertainty about the health-share of GDP. In the shorter term, the major source of uncertainty is health spending per capita. CONCLUSIONS: History is a valuable guide for quantifying our uncertainty about future health expenditures. The probabilistic model we present has several advantages over the high-low scenario approach to forecasting. It indicates great uncertainty about future Medicare expenditures relative to GDP.",M1

Secondary analysis: <e>projection</e> of the data, based on conservative assumptions, to indicate likely cost effectiveness at 10 years. SETTING: Four centres in the United Kingdom. Screening delivered in primary care settings with follow up and surgery offered in the main hospitals Participants: Population based sample of 67 800 men aged 65-74 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from and costs (screening, follow up, elective and emergency surgery) related to abdominal aortic aneurysm; cost per life year gained. RESULTS: Over four years there were 47 fewer deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysms in the screening group than in the control group, but the additional costs incurred were pound 2.2m. After adjustment for censoring and discounted at 6% the mean additional cost of the screening programme was pound 63.39 ($97.77, euro;100.48) (95% confidence interval pound 53.31 to pound 73.48) per patient. The hazard ratio for abdominal aortic aneurysm was 0.58 (0.42 to 0.78). Over four years the mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio for screening was pound 28 400 ( pound 15 000 to pound 146 000) per life year gained, equivalent to about pound 36 000 per quality adjusted life year. After 10 years this figure is estimated to fall to around pound 8000 per life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Even at four years the cost effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms is at the margin of acceptability according to current NHS thresholds. Over a longer period the cost effectiveness will improve substantially, the predicted ratio at 10 years falling to around a quarter of the four year figure.",M1

CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that demographic changes will Influence future costs of primary care providers through an increasing population size, but not because of ageing. This conclusion is independent of whether high costs in the last year of life are accounted for or not.",M1
12370529,"<e>Projection</e> of the future dimensions and costs of the genital herpes simplex type 2 epidemic in the United States.BACKGROUND: Infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) currently affects approximately 22% of adult Americans and increased markedly in prevalence between the late 1970s and early 1990s. Although some estimates of the costs of prevalent disease due to HSV-2 are available, selection of interventions to prevent HSV-2 infection, as well as evaluation of their potential cost-effectiveness, should take into account projected future costs that will result if the epidemic is left unchecked. GOAL: The goal was to estimate the future health and economic consequences attributable to the HSV-2 epidemic in the absence of interventions to slow the epidemic. STUDY DESIGN: A mathematical model was constructed to project future increases in HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States. The probability of heterosexual transmission of HSV-2 was estimated from cross-sectional estimates of infection prevalence reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Per-infection expected costs were calculated on the basis of data obtained from the published medical literature. RESULTS Without intervention, the prevalence of HSV-2 infection among individuals aged 15 to 39 years was projected to increase to 39% among men and 49% among women by 2025. Annual incidence was projected to increase steadily between 2000 and 2025, from 9 to 26 infections per 1,000 men and from 12 to 32 infections per 1,000 women in this age group. The cost of incident infections in the year 2000 were estimated to be $1.8 billion; the cost of incident infections was predicted to rise to $2.5 billion by 2015 and $2.7 billion by 2025. The projected cumulative cost of incident HSV-2 infections occurring over the next 25 years was estimated to be $61 billion; at a 3% discount rate, this sum has a present value of $43 billion. CONCLUSION: The costs of incident HSV-2 infection in the United States are substantial and can be expected to increase as both the incidence and prevalence of this disease increase in the first half of the century. The level of resource allocation for HSV-2 prevention strategies should reflect the economic benefits that would result from control of this epidemic.",M1
12354410,"Future health care costs--do health care costs during the last year of life matter?While some studies have shown a considerable effect of ageing upon future health care costs, others indicate small or no effects. Moreover, studies have shown that age-related increases in health care costs in part can be explained by high costs in the last year of life. The aim of this study was to project future costs of hospital in-patient care and primary health care services in Denmark on the basis of demographic changes, both with and without account for the high costs in the last year of life. Costs were projected on the basis of a random 19% sample of the Danish population using the cohort-component method. The traditional <e>projection</e> method does not account for the high costs in the last year of life while the 'improved' method does. The Danish population was projected to increase by 8.2% during the period 1995-2020, and health care costs by 18.5% according to the traditional projection method and 15.1% according to the improved one. These results suggest that the high costs in the last year of life does matter in projections of future health care costs and should be taken into account. Furthermore, ageing per se seems to have considerable impact on future health care costs.",M1

A review of population <e>projections</e> for the state.This report reviews population projections produced for the state of California by various organizations: California Department of Finance, the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, UCLA, and the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. Those population projections are used in short- and long-term planning by local, state, and federal government, and private agencies.  The population projection and rates of population growth among these organizations reports that the growth of population in California have been almost equal to that of developing countries though estimations reveal that by the year 2025, the difference between the highest and lowest projection is greater than 10 million people.  Even in short terms which is the product of both differing projections of growth and current estimates of the population of the state, significant differences were still noted.  By the year 2014, the Census Bureau (CB) estimated that Latinos would constitute the largest race/ethnic group in California, while the dependency ratio would significantly increase by the year 2010.  A wide range of current population projection reflects the instability of the demographic future in California.  However, these organizations were able to come up with similar observations on the decline of the future growth rate in California compared to the previous rates, with the increase attributed to natural rise of births rather than migration.  Policy makers must take into consideration the unstable population in California during program development to ensure that funds are maximized to benefit the whole population.",M1
12348891,"UN <e>projections</e> assume fertility decline, mortality increase.This article summarizes the latest findings from the UN Population Division's 1998 review of World Population Estimates and Projections.  The revisions reflect lower future population size and faster rates of fertility and mortality decline.  The medium variant of population projection for 2050 indicates 8.9 billion, which is 458 million lower than projected in 1996 and 924 million lower than projected in 1994.  The changes are due to changes in developing countries.  Africa's changes accounted for over 50% of the change.  The UN medium projection assumes that the desire for fewer children and effective contraceptive practice will continue and that the availability of family planning services will increase.  The revisions are also attributed to the widespread prevalence of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and greater chances for lower fertility in developing countries.  AIDS mortality may decrease average life expectancy in 29 African countries by 7 years.  The UN medium projection assumes a decline in fertility from 2.7 children/woman during 1995-2000 to 2.0 children/woman by 2050.  The UN high variant is 10.7 billion by 2050; the low variant is 7.3 billion.  It is concluded that efforts of national governments and international agencies have contributed to increased access to reproductive health services and subsequent fertility decline.  Future declines will depend on accessibility issues.  Despite declines, world population is still growing by 78 million annually.

To the extent that participants believed they possessed 2 traits to a similar degree within themselves, they tended, through their judgments of others and estimates of population parameters, to claim that the 2 traits were positively correlated in other people; and if they believed they possessed 2 traits to a dissimilar degree within themselves, they tended to claim that the 2 traits were negatively correlated in other people. Further evidence showed that information about the self plays a causal role in the construction of implicit theories, making a unique contribution to the shape of IPTs over and above that of information about another person. The relevance of these data for recent controversies over egocentric social judgment is discussed.",M2
19379090,"Defense mechanisms associated with borderline personality disorder.This study assessed the defensive functioning of 290 criteria-defined borderline patients and compared it to that of 72 patients with other forms of axis II psychopathology. The Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ), a self-report measure with demonstrated criterion validity and internal consistency, was administered to 362 axis II inpatients diagnosed using semistructured interviews of proven reliability. Borderline patients had significantly higher scores than axis II comparison subjects on three of the four defense styles assessed by the DSQ: self-sacrificing, maladaptive action, and image-distorting defenses. They also had significantly higher scores than axis II comparison subjects on eight of the 19 defense mechanisms studied. More specifically, borderline patients had significantly higher scores on one neurotic-level defense (undoing), four immature defenses (acting out, emotional hypochondriasis, passive aggression, and <e>projection</e>), and two image-distorting/borderline defenses (projective identification and splitting). In contrast, axis II comparison subjects had a significantly higher score than borderline patients on one mature defense (suppression). When all significant defenses were considered together, three were found to be significant predictors of a borderline diagnosis: acting out, emotional hypochondriasis, and undoing. This model has both good sensitivity (.95) and positive predictive power (.86). Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the defensive profile of borderline patients is distinct from that of patients with other forms of axis II pathology. They also suggest that the defensive triad of acting out, emotional hypochondriasis, and undoing may serve as a useful clinical marker for the borderline diagnosis, particularly in settings where the base rate of the disorder is high.",M2
19289362,"Like me or like us: is ingroup <e>projection</e> just social projection?Research has shown abundant evidence for social projection, that is, the tendency to expect similarity between oneself and others (Krueger, 1998a, 1998b). This effect is stronger when others constitute an ingroup instead of an outgroup (Robbins &amp; Krueger, 2005). A different line of research has shown evidence for ingroup projection, that is, the tendency to use ingroup instead of outgroup features to define an inclusive category (Wenzel, Mummendey, Weber, &amp; Waldzus, 2003). In this research, we examine whether ingroup (i.e., Germans) projection to an inclusive category (i.e., Europeans) is different from the projection of self-attributes to the same inclusive category. In two studies, German participants rated how typical a series of attributes was for the ingroup, an inclusive category, the self, and an outgroup (i.e., Italians). The attributes varied in their relevance to the groups under consideration. The results showed that ingroup projection is stronger than social projection, but only when typical ingroup attributes are concerned. Moreover, ingroup projection weakened when the image of the ingroup was manipulated to be less positive, while social projection remained stable. These findings imply that ingroup projection is not simply social projection.",M2

18573014,"Identification and the development of competence: a 44-year longitudinal study from late adolescence to late middle age.The role of defense mechanisms in the development of planful competence (J. A. Clausen, 1993) was studied over a period of 44 years in participants from the Oakland Growth Study, who are part of the Intergenerational Studies of the Institute of Human Development. Planful competence was assessed on 4 occasions, from late adolescence (ages 15-18) to late middle age (age 62). The use of the defense mechanisms of denial, <e>projection</e>, and identification was assessed in late adolescence, based on Thematic Apperception Test (H. A. Murray, 1943) stories coded with the Defense Mechanism Manual (P. Cramer, 1991b). In late adolescence, the defense mechanism of identification was found to be positively related to competence, whereas the less mature defense of projection was related to lower levels of competence. For the group as a whole, hierarchical linear modeling (Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992) indicated that competence increased across the adult years, with a modest decline at late middle age. Individual differences for intraindividual change in competence were related to the use of identification: high use of identification in late adolescence was associated with relative stability in adult competence, whereas low use of identification in adolescence predicted changes in adult competence.",M2

In Study 1, a manipulation of felt communal responsiveness toward a partner affected perceptions of the partner's responsiveness to the self, which in turn predicted evaluation of the partner. In Study 2, a manipulation of responsiveness toward a new acquaintance biased perceptions of the acquaintance's responsiveness to the self, which in turn predicted attraction and warmth toward the new acquaintance. In Studies 3 and 5, participants' own felt communal responsiveness toward a friend appeared to bias their perceptions of the friend's communal responsiveness, which in turn predicted self-disclosure, evaluation of the friend (Studies 3 and 5), and support provision (Study 5). Initial projected perceptions of a friend's (Study 3) and of a spouse's (Study 4) communal responsiveness also predicted longitudinal changes in perceivers' communal responsiveness.

According to this model, people project their own care and supportiveness for a partner onto their perceptions of their partner's caring and supportiveness. In 2 dyadic marriage studies, participants' self-reported responsiveness to the needs of a spouse predicted perceptions of the spouse's responsiveness to the self more strongly than did the spouse's self-reported responsiveness. These projected perceptions of responsiveness, in turn, appeared to promote perceivers' relationship satisfaction. These effects were independent of individual differences in attachment, self-esteem, depression, and communal orientation. A daily-diary component suggested that people projected their own chronic responsiveness as well as their daily enacted support onto perceptions of the specific benefits received from their spouses. A 3rd study found that experimentally manipulated feelings of difficulty in recalling examples of own support provision reduced perceptions of partner responsiveness. Results suggest that projection of own responsiveness is an important determinant of perceived social support and is a means by which caring perceivers maintain satisfying and subjectively communal relationships.",M2

METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the 2000 Chronic Illness and Caregiving survey conducted by Harris Interactive Inc. using linear and probit regressions. RESULTS: The hypothesis that persons with chronic medical conditions project their characteristics onto the population of those with chronic medical conditions is strongly supported. The hypothesis that persons without chronic medical conditions stereotype the population of those with chronic medical conditions is weakly supported. DISCUSSION: The findings imply that characterizations of persons with chronic medical conditions vary more among those with chronic medical conditions than among those without, and that those without chronic medical conditions have more homogeneous representations. This difference between those who have chronic medical conditions and those who do not implies a potential for greater variation in support for the particulars of policies addressing chronic medical conditions among those with chronic medical conditions.",M2

16997729,"Nascent body ego: metapsychological and neurophysiological aspects.For Freud, body ego was the organizing basis of the structural theory. He defined it as a psychic <e>projection</e> of the body surface. Isakower's and Lewin's classical findings suggest that the body surface experiences of nursing provide the infant with sensory-affective stimulation that initiates a projection of sensory processes towards the psychic realm. During nursing, somato-sensory, gustatory and olfactory modalities merge with a primitive somatic affect of satiation, whereas auditory modality is involved more indirectly and visual contact more gradually. Repeated regularly, such nascent experiences are likely to play a part in the organization of the primitive protosymbolic mental experience. In support of this hypothesis, the authors review findings from a neurophysiological study of infants before, during and after nursing. Nursing is associated with a significant amplitude change in the newborn electroencephalogram (EEG), which wanes before the age of 3 months, and is transformed at the age of 6 months into rhythmic 3-5 Hz hedonic theta-activity. Sucking requires active physiological work, which is shown in a regular rise in heart rate. The hypothesis of a sensory-affective organization of the nascent body ego, enhanced by nursing and active sucking, seems concordant with neurophysiological phenomena related to nursing.",M2

16318941,"Permeability and demarcation in the psychoanalytic process. Functions of the contact-barrier.Introjection, identification and <e>projection</e> are concepts that designate processes in which something is being put into or taken out of something else. These processes presuppose the overcoming of some form of separation between two entities. The permeability or impermeability of a fictive boundary between the representations of subject and object set the emotional tone of their coexistence. There are moments of complete diffusion, in which subject and object can no longer be differentiated, and moments of autistic enclosure in which the individual can no longer be reached at all. Permeability and demarcation result from the processing of stimuli carried out by the 'contact-barrier', as an ego function. Stimuli of internal, libidinal or aggressive origin, as well as 'impressions' of external origin, are classified and processed with the aid of various kinds of factors arising from coagulated object-relational experiences. Whereas for Freud the contact-barrier regulates the quantity of energy and found a topographical structure, Bion understands the contact-barrier as a psychic function that simultaneously regulates boundary demarcation and making contact. In the psychoanalytic process, the contact-barrier created by patient and analyst regulates the events in the transference and countertransference. An awareness of the struggle for contact and demarcation at the dynamic boundary representations that are constantly being recreated by both partners in the analytic process may be helpful in our clinical work. The author presents an examination of the ways in which patient and analyst make contact and demarcate the boundaries, which provides a better understanding of the dynamics of transference processes.

16087096,"<e>Projection</e> extension for region of interest imaging in cone-beam CT.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: For 3D X-ray imaging during interventions, changes of the imaged object are often restricted to a small part of the field of view, suggesting region of interest (ROI) imaging by irradiating this area only. In this article, we present a novel method for extension of truncated projections in order to avoid truncation artifacts in C-arm based 3D ROI imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method makes use of prior knowledge by combining forward projections of a previously acquired, nontruncated 3D reference image with the truncated ROI projections. Rigid registration between the two datasets is achieved by using a technique based on local cross-correlation. To account for a gray value mismatch between the two data sets due to, e.g., differing beam quality and different contributions of scattered radiation, a linear gray level transformation is applied to the forward-projected reference data. RESULTS: The performance of different gray value transformation schemes is systematically assessed by means of numerical simulations. For various simulated scenarios, the best performing transformation has been identified, providing practical guidelines for selecting a scheme depending on the origin of the gray-level mismatch. Experiments prove the high performance of the developed method. CONCLUSION: The presented technique enables almost artifact-free 3D ROI imaging during interventions. This actually allows for repeated scans at low dose and enables intraprocedural imaging of large objects even with a small detector. However, applicability of the method is limited to scenarios where direct access to a reference image, e.g., a prior CT scan, is available.",M2

The mode of analysis (i.e., nomothetic vs. idiographic) and the order of judgments (i.e., self or group judged first) have no discernable effects. Outgroup projection is positive, but small in size.

Three studies featuring existing individual differences in perceived similarity as well as manipulated perceptions supported the predictions, with similarity yielding increased projection to, and decreased stereotyping of, various in-groups and out-groups.

Two correlational studies yielded evidence that (a) group members tend to perceive their ingroup as relatively prototypical for the inclusive category (projection), (b) members highly identified with both ingroup and inclusive category (dual identity) tend to project most, and (c) relative prototypicality is related to negative attitudes toward the outgroup. The latter relation was further specified in Study 3, manipulating the valence of the inclusive category.

Participants who received high (vs. low) anger feedback rated the target especially high on anger. In addition, participants who received high anger feedback and who were allowed to project their anger had the lowest anger accessibility on a word completion exercise.

Because people's predictions of their own feelings tend to be biased in the direction of their current drive states, we hypothesized that mentally trading places would lead to social projection of transient drive states.

We first show that natural random variations around the collinear and association field models cannot account for these inconsistencies, a fact that motivates the search for more principled explanations. We then develop a model of long-range projection fields that formalizes good continuation based on differential geometry. The analysis implicates curvature(s) in a fundamental way, and the resulting model explains both consistent data and apparent outliers. It quantitatively predicts the (typically ignored) spread in projection distribution, its nonmonotonic variance, and the differences found among individual neurons. Surprisingly, and for the first time, this model also indicates that texture (and shading) continuation can serve as alternative and complementary functional explanations to contour integration. Because current anatomical data support both (curve and texture) integration models equally and because both are important computationally, new testable predictions are derived to allow their differentiation and identification.",M2

12740746,"[Projective identification and denial of pregnancy--considerations of the reasons and background of unrecognized pregnancy also undiagnosed by a physician]BACKGROUND: In denial of pregnancy, the pregnant woman does not consciously perceive the pregnancy and, in extreme cases, awareness occurs only during delivery. The attending physicians also often fail to recognize the pregnancy, even though the somatic complaints leading to consultation with a physician are typically pregnancy associated. This  iatrogenic participation  was described in the earliest historical publications. Different theories are presented in this paper to elaborate this phenomenon. Elementary deficiencies in perception or incompetence do not explain most cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty five women with denial of pregnancy, interviews PSYCHODYNAMIC EXPLANATIONS: Based on the deep-rooted subjective attitude of not being pregnant, the pregnant woman is able to include family, friends, and associates into the denial of pregnancy mindset. In a similar way, she is able to influence her doctor. The woman's autosuggestive wishful notions of not being pregnant receive suggestive confirmation by the physician's misdiagnosis and lead to a continuing denial of pregnancy. PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION: In 1946, M. Klein introduced this term to describe a certain defense mechanism relating to fantasies and accompanying object relationships. The self initially successfully disposes of unwanted aspects, splits them off, and transfers them to another person, to finally reclaim them in a modified form. Certain elements of this psychoanalytical concept can characterize the interaction between physician and pregnant woman, which, in the case of denied pregnancies, does not lead to a diagnosis of pregnancy. Through <e>projection</e>, the pregnant woman is capable of manipulating the physician so that he perceives her, according to her wishes, as not being pregnant and misdiagnoses her correspondingly as  service in return . Opportunities for more mature handling of the denied content in terms of psychological development through accurate diagnosis of the pregnancy are indicated.",M2

Both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and skin conductance level (SCL) were monitored during exposure to ten stress tasks; concurrently, the use of three defense mechanisms was assessed by coding Thematic Apperception Test stories. Autonomic reactivity was found to be related to defenses; the nature of that relation differed across the defenses. DBP, typically found to be associated with cognitive work, was higher in those individuals who used more Identification, a defense that requires greater cognitive activity. The use of <e>Projection</e>, on the other hand, was associated with lower DBP. In addition, the use of Identification showed a tendency to be associated with lower SCL.",M2

The findings show that men and women who rely on the immature defense of denial at age 23 show multiple signs of behavioral immaturity, as well as anxiety. In contrast, extensive use of <e>projection</e> was related to a suspicious, hyperalert personality style, including anxiety and depression, in men, but to a sociable, nonwary, nondepressed style in women.

11417782,"The domain specificity and generality of mental contamination: accuracy and <e>projection</e> in judgments of mental content.In this study we examined individual differences across two tasks requiring people to judge the mental contents of the minds of other people--an opinion prediction task and a knowledge prediction task. The tendency to overproject one's own mental contents in both of these tasks has been interpreted as an instance of mental contamination by Wilson and Brekke (1994). Results demonstrate no domain generality in the process of projecting one's own internal states onto predictions about the internal states of others. Furthermore, projection was efficacious in the opinion prediction task but not in the knowledge prediction task. The differing consequences of mental contamination across these tasks was moderated by the presence of other diagnostic cues that were negatively correlated with the diagnosticity of one's own mental contents in the knowledge prediction task but not in the opinion prediction task. Mental contamination was largely unrelated to cognitive ability or to styles of epistemic regulation. However, predictive accuracy (and its primary determinant--use of other diagnostic cues) was correlated across the two tasks, and was also related to cognitive ability and styles of epistemic regulation. The results are interpreted within the context of two-process models of cognitive functioning (e.g. Evans &amp; Over, 1996; Sloman, 1996).",M2
11341065,"The 'Medea fantasy'. An unconscious determinant of psychogenic sterility.The author begins by pointing out that myths have always been powerful vehicles for the <e>projection</e> of ubiquitous unconscious fantasies. Having noted the importance of certain male protagonists of the Greek myths in Freud's theories, she observes that their female counterparts exert an equal fascination and suggests that the Medea myth as recounted by Euripides can be invoked to elucidate a central unconscious fantasy found to underlie the psychogenic frigidity and sterility of several of her female patients. The manifestation of this 'Medea fantasy' is illustrated by a clinical account in which a dream is analysed. The author next summarises the Medea story as told by Euripides and attempts a psychoanalytic interpretation of it. She draws attention to features of the 'unconscious truth' inherent in the myth that were shared by all the members of her group of patients. A case history then shows how the progressive understanding and working through of the Medea fantasy led to a change in the analysand's experience of femininity and enabled her to have children. It is postulated that both early infantile sexual fantasies and repressed memories of early object-relations traumas such as maternal depression combine with ubiquitous bodily fantasies to produce the unconscious Medea fantasy.",M2
10907100,"The primacy of self-referent information in perceptions of social consensus.People's own responses to a social stimulus (i.e. whether they endorse it or reject it) predict how they expect other people to respond (consensus estimates). This correlation has long been accepted as evidence for social <e>projection</e>. There has been little direct evidence, however, for the assumption that self-referent judgments shape judgments about others. Supporting the projection model, Expt 1 shows that self-referent information is more accessible than consensus estimates. Once they have been made, people's own endorsements and rejections of a stimulus facilitate consensus estimates. In turn, consensus estimates facilitate endorsements (but less so). Judgments about the physical properties of the stimulus facilitate neither type of social judgment. Supporting the view that projection is egocentric, Expt 2 shows that, when making consensus estimates, people rely more on their own endorsements than on the endorsements made by another individual. This self-other difference does not depend on whose endorsements are revealed first or on whether the other person is anonymous or individual.",M2
10818865,"Towards understanding some complex borderline behaviours.This article aims to explore and explain some possible antecedents to behaviours revealed by consumers in mental health settings who evoke strong and often negative responses in nurses and other health professionals. The contemporary exemplar par excellence is people who are diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder. The paper discusses four different but overlapping domains that may contribute to understanding the difficulties many nurses face in relation to working with consumers whose behaviours are complex and distressing. Firstly, these begin with a brief discussion of psychiatric labelling and stereotyping associated with borderline personality disorder. Secondly, the connections between trauma in childhood and psychiatric vulnerability are explored, as nurses and other health professionals sometimes do not appreciate the debilitating and long-term consequences of the survival of childhood abuse or sexual assault. Thirdly, some unconscious defence mechanisms are outlined to partly explain behavioural interactions often displayed by people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Finally, behavioural concomitants of <e>projection</e>, splitting and projective identification are discussed: they include identity diffusion, self-mutilation and suicide attempts. All of these topics are explored to encourage nurses to support consumers to express pain in more constructive ways.",M2

10800016,"The role of the mother-daughter relationship in explaining weight concern.OBJECTIVE: The literature highlights two possible roles for the mother-daughter relationship in the development of weight concern in young girls. The first is simply as a forum for modeling the mother's own concerns and the second is as an interaction between two individuals, which is either protective or facilitative of weight concern. The present study aimed to assess both the modeling and the interactive hypotheses. METHOD: Thirty mothers and their daughters (aged 16-19) completed a questionnaire concerning their weight concern (restrained eating and body dissatisfaction) and their beliefs about aspects of their relationship (daughter's autonomy, mother's autonomy, <e>projection</e>, intimacy, mother's role). RESULTS: The results found no support for the modeling hypothesis, with no significant correlations between the mothers' and daughters' aspects of weight concern. However, the results showed support for the interactive hypothesis. In particular, the daughters were more likely to show restrained eating if their mothers reported a low belief in their own autonomy and if both the mother and daughter rated projection as important in their relationship. Similarly, the daughters were more likely to show body dissatisfaction if their mothers reported a low belief in both their own and their daughter's autonomy and if they rated projection as important. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the role of the mother-daughter relationship may be more complex than simply as a forum for modeling and are discussed in terms of the impact of aspects of the relationship on subsequent psychopathology.",M2

Two independent assessments of ego level were related to IQ and defense mechanism use in a sample of 89 young adults. Whereas IQ and defense were themselves found to be unrelated, both variables predicted ego level: The relation with IQ was linear, whereas the relation with defense was curvilinear. In addition, the relation between defense and ego level varied as a function of IQ level. At low levels of IQ, stronger use of Denial and <e>Projection</e> was associated with higher ego levels.

9717100,"Autism as the defusion of drives.The author's metapsychological view of the dismantling and adhesive identification typical of infantile autism is that these phenomena result from the fate of the death drive and the libido in a situation of thoroughgoing defusion of the drives. He notes that Freud's original idea of the defused death drive was taken up by Ferenczi and then by Klein, who applied it to the situation at the very beginning of life. A clinical illustration is given and the author observes that this view has therapeutic consequences that are also relevant to the work of an institution and to the therapists' countertransference, in terms of the value of sadism and masochism in helping to fuse the drives. Fusion of the drives is presented as an important element of Bion's alpha or container function. This conception also tends to modify the therapist's attitude to the parents of autistic children. In the author's view, the fate of the libidinal component in autism has tended to be disregarded, but accounts for the phenomena of adhesiveness and auto-sensuality; the latter should in his opinion rather be called dismantled erotism, to emphasise the absence of the unifying function of forms of auto-erotism in integration of the self. The author stresses the lack of <e>projection</e> in autistic pathology and discusses its possible reasons.",M2
9672725,"The transmission of trauma across generations: identification with parental trauma in children of Holocaust survivors.OBJECTIVE: This study examines the phenomenology of intergenerational transmission of trauma with the aim of elucidating the interactional process of transmission within an object relations framework. METHOD: The method consisted of systematic textual analysis of semi-structured interviews with six Jewish women born after the war who were children of concentration camp interned Holocaust survivors. RESULTS: Four superordinate themes were identified: heightened awareness of parents' Holocaust survivor status, parenting style, overidentification with parents' experiences and transmission of fear and mistrust. These were found despite the variation in parental communication. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that unconscious processes are at least partially involved in the transmission of trauma. A form of projective identification is proposed as an explanatory mechanism which brings together diverse aspects of the observed phenomena: <e>projection</e> by the parent of Holocaust-related feelings and anxieties into the child; introjection by the child as if she herself had experienced the concentration camps; and return of this input by the child in the form of compliant and solicitous behaviour associated with enmeshment and individuation problems.

Five clusters resulted. The correlates of cluster membership were examined using data from the 50-year longitudinal study of these men. One cluster exhibited the greatest use of mature defenses; the men in this cluster functioned best on all psychosocial and health variables. Two clusters of men used primarily neurotic defenses; these men functioned at an intermediate level on all outcomes. The men in two clusters primarily used immature defenses. The men in one of these clusters used primarily action defenses, whereas the men in the other cluster were the greatest users of <e>projection</e> and fantasy. In general, the men in both these clusters functioned worse than those in the other three. However, the users of action defenses exhibited greater sociopathy, alcohol problems, and marital instability.

In particular, the study supports the DSM-IV distinction of action defenses from other immature defenses.",M2
9327101,"Empathic understanding revisited: conceptualization, controversies, and limitations.Regardless of the controversial philosophical aspects of understanding another human being, it is a useful concept in psychotherapy because understanding of the patient is one of the factors determining the course of therapy. Understanding resulting from empathy refers to the perception of the patient's innermost feelings and meanings, but inevitably represents only an approximation of what the patient truly experiences. It crucially depends on the vicissitudes of interactions between the patient and the therapist. The accuracy of empathic understanding needs to be verified continuously. It is important for therapists to learn to recognize what constitutes their own <e>projection</e> in their understanding of patients. Empathic understanding usually entails an attempt on the part of the therapist to feel to a certain extent the way the patient does. Various degrees of empathic emotional involvement may be suitable for patients with different types of psychopathology. Therapists must be careful as to how they convey their understanding to their patients. Not every patient wants to be understood, many are afraid of being understood, and some are distressed by the therapists' demonstration of understanding.

A new model for projection is presented in this article. People might try to actively suppress thoughts about the possibility that they have undesirable personality traits, but it was hypothesized that this response to threat ultimately causes thoughts about the unwanted traits to become chronically accessible. As a result, those trait concepts will be used to interpret others' behavior. Studies 1-4 showed that those people who both avoid thinking about having threatening personality traits and deny possessing them (repressors) also readily infer those traits from others' behavior. Studies 5-6 provided experimental support for the model. Unfavorable traits were attributed to participants, who, when they were asked or predisposed to not think about the traits, subsequently projected them onto someone else.",M2
9152752,"Projective identification: the analyst's involvement.The author emphasises that what is projected into the analyst is a phantasy of an object relationship that evokes not only thoughts and feelings, but also propensities towards action. From the patient's point of view, the <e>projections</e> represent an attempt to reduce the discrepancy between the phantasy of some archaic object relationship and what the patient experiences in the analytical situation. For the analyst, too, there are impulses to function in ways that lead to a greater correspondence with some needed or desired phantasies. The interaction between the patient's and the analyst's needs may lead to the repetitive enactment of the painful and disturbing kind that is described. It may be very difficult for the analyst to extricate himself (or his patient) from this unproductive situation and recover his capacity for reflective thought, at least for a while. The difficulty is compounded when the projection into the analyst leads to subtle or overt enactments that do not initially disturb the analyst but, on the contrary, constitute a comfortable collusive arrangement, in which the analyst feels his role is congruent with some internal phantasy. It may be difficult to recognise the defensive function this interaction serves for both the patient and the analyst and the more disturbing phantasies it defends against.",M2

METHOD: Eighty-five incarcerated boys (mean age 16.6, SD = 1.2) with mostly violent offenses were studied. The sample was representative of the California Youth Authority population. They received a standard psychiatric screen, a semistructured interview for PTSD, and self-report questionnaires measuring personality traits and defenses. A nonclinical sex- and age-matched group was used for comparing psychometrics. RESULTS: Subjects suffered from PTSD at higher rates than other adolescent community samples and at higher rates than those found in county probation camps. Thirty-two percent fulfilled criteria for PTSD, 20% partial criteria. One half of the subjects described the witnessing of interpersonal violence as the traumatizing event. Psychometric results converged in the predicted way: Subjects with PTSD showed elevated distress, anxiety, depression, and lowered restraint, impulse control, and suppression of aggression; they had high levels of immature defenses such as <e>projection</e>, somatization, conversion, dissociation, and withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD occurs at high rates in delinquents, and this finding has implications for management and treatment.

Empathy can be traced to phylogenesis, it is biologically anchored and in the course of human life (ontogenetic approach) it develops in the social milieu as do our other abilities. It is one of general effective factors of psychotherapy and, in the psychotherapeutic relationship, has both a direct and indirect effect upon the patient (within the hermeneutic process).

9029952,"Undoing the lag in the technique of conflict and defense analysis.When the individual skills of a psychotherapist or psychoanalyst coincide with what serves as a sublimation for the practitioner, the gratification in the clinical work is especially enhanced. If those moments of applied skill also are a part of the specific therapeutic action of that form of treatment, a fortunate combination exists. As Freud expanded the potential of psychoanalytic treatment when he reformulated the theory of anxiety, he also provided access to improved therapeutic actions in the course of analyzing intrapsychic conflict. This meant that some of the sublimations in practicing the earlier techniques no longer coincided with what could be the therapeutic actions characteristic of the more effective analysis of conflict. The lag in adding new technical measures to psychoanalytic methodology is more fully accounted for by a reluctance on the part of some analysts to sacrifice certain traditional sources of sublimated <e>projection</e> in interpretations and to seek other sublimations commensurate with Freud's more advanced view of analyzing defenses.",M2
8657824,"The return of the projected: some thoughts on paranoia and a recent trend in horror films.I have focused on two interrelated changes in horror films of the last twenty-five years: a tendency for the  horror  to become internalized; and the use of what I call  bubbling flesh  to signify the internalized horror. Taking two films--the 1958 Fly and its 1986 remake--and treating them as (paranoid) fantasies, I have explored what I take to be the unconscious meanings of these changes. Although both films present oedipal as well as pre-oedipal conflicts, and although both employ paranoid mechanisms of negation and <e>projection</e> of an unacceptable wish, the earlier film also makes greater use of repression to keep the preoedipal wishes farther from consciousness. The earlier film is also more successful in its projection: In the later film the projective mechanisms fail and the projected returns to its original locus. The particular unacceptable wish that I see as being fundamental to these two films (and perhaps to all horror films) is a radically passive wish for merger with the mother--a merger wish so radical that it can be seen in terms of Gun-trip's  return to the womb  wishes, and so passive that it can be seen as a nearly pure form o Freud's death drive--the drive toward total quiescence and dissolution. I have associated the differences between the two films with changes in society in the past decades, and especially with changes in traditionally conceived gender roles and their associated senses of gender identity. Finally, I have suggested that we view these historical changes not as signs of societal regression but as the beginnings of the failure of one set of defense mechanisms that can possibly allow an opening to try out new strategies.",M2

8543426,"Seduction, persecution, revelation.The author argues that seduction is not primarily a fantasy but a 'real' situation, which lies at the heart of the other two allegedly primal major scenarios: castration and the primal scene. This statement is not to be confused with an event-based realism, as, for this to be achieved, a third category of reality must be postulated. This reality, constantly misconstrued by authors as corresponding to material and psychological reality, is that of the message conveyed and, more specifically in the case of analysis, the enigmatic message. To establish his position the author re-examines Freud's presentation of the Schreber case. The sexual other and his intrusion are the essential points of Freud's analysis in the first part of his study. In the second part, however, desexualisation (in the name of love) and a return to the ego, as the centre of the whole process, both being evident in the 'primary' sentence from which Freud proposes to derive everything: 'I (a man) love him (a man)'. This leads us to a consideration of Fichte's concept of Bekanntmachung, the 'announcement' by the other and to an argument that the message stemming from the other is irreducible to a <e>projection</e> by the subject, within the three domains of primal seduction, paranoia and religious 'revelation'.",M2

Rodewig proceeds on the assumption that a physical ailment can have the character of an object and may thus attain the status of third object. Given the threat posed by dangerous physical illness, the ego has recourse to defence mechanisms such as splitting and separate projective identification of positive and negative object- and self-parts, projecting the omnipotent, idealizing desires onto the therapist and the negative desires onto the ailment itself. In a later stage a de-idealization of the therapist sets in and the latter is identified with the illness so that the illness is then bandied back and forth between patient and analyst. The most challenging technical problem for analysts is avoiding the <e>projection</e> of their own illness and death anxieties onto the patient with a view to resolving them there. Instead, they need to be worked in independently and then given back to the patient devoid of their original virulence. The author illustrates the various facets of the problem with brief reference to various case histories.",M2
7714239,"Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin tracing of commissural fibers to the rat dentate gyrus: evidence for a previously unknown commissural <e>projection</e> to the outer molecular layer.Numerous studies have shown a lamina-specific termination of commissural fibers to the dentate gyrus in the inner molecular layer. However, the exact course and arborization pattern of individual fibers remained unknown. In this study, the commissural fiber tract to the dentate gyrus of the rat has been studied using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), which labels individual axons and their collaterals. Following iontophoretic application of the tracer, anterogradely labeled fibers were followed through the posterior basal fornix and medial fimbria where they formed a dense fiber bundle. Labeled fibers then entered the dentate gyrus close to the medial blade of the granule cell layer where they separated and traversed the hilus. Only in those cases where the injection also involved CA3 pyramidal cells could axons arborizing in the hilus be observed. Typically, fibers that continued into the molecular layer did not arborize in the hilus. Upon their entrance into the molecular layer, these fibers changed direction, gave off several collaterals, and followed a new path parallel to the granule cell layer where they preferentially formed en passant contacts. These commissural fibers to the inner molecular layer terminated in a wide septotemporal (longitudinal) extension. However, a considerable number of fibers reached the outer molecular layer where some of them formed extensive arborizations. Moreover, these commissural fibers to the outer molecular layer appeared to be restricted to the hippocampal lamella, corresponding to the level of the contralateral injection site. These data suggest the existence of three commissural projections to the rat dentate gyrus: (1) commissural fibers to the hilus arising from CA3 neurons, (2) commissural fibers to the inner molecular layer, and, (3) commissural fibers to the outer molecular layer.",M2

Second, the localizations of retrogradely labelled striatopallidal neurons and of clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons (as outlined by the transport of 14C-material) were compared in cats that received four horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin injections into the internal segment of the globus pallidus and three nigral injections of 14C-amino acids into the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Two types of striatonigral neurons located predominantly within the matrix compartment were identified: poorly collateralized aggregated cells distributed in clusters and more numerous collateralized cells distributed outside the clusters. In addition, two cell types were distinguished within each cluster of aggregated neurons. Those innervating the center of the substantia nigra pars reticulata were observed after a single nigral injection of the tracer, whereas those projecting to distinct sites of the substantia nigra pars reticulata along a rostrocaudal axis were observed only after multiple injections. Striatal neurons innervating the internal segment of the globus pallidus were heterogeneously distributed predominantly within the matrix but outside the clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons. Together, these results provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of the matrix and for the complexity of matrix striatonigral connections that send both diverging and converging signals to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.",M2

This technique is particularly indicated with patients who resort to massive projective identification. The aim of interpretation in projection is to allow the patient to rediscover the bond of identity with the part of himself projected into the analyst. It falls into two stages, in the first of which the analyst becomes the spokesman for the 'healthy' part which the patient has projected into the analyst so as to protect it from the invading introjected object with which it is for the time being merged. In a second stage, the analyst may, where appropriate, give a complementary interpretation in which he addresses the analysand by his own name in order to interpret the relationship expressed in the transference through projection and introjection.

8328563,"An empirical study of defense mechanisms in dysthymia.OBJECTIVE: The psychodynamic approach to understanding dysthymia has rarely been empirically tested. In this pilot study the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales were used to examine psychodynamic data from patients with dysthymia and patients with panic disorder in order to test the hypotheses that 1) dysthymic patients would be similar to panic patients in endorsing primarily lower-maturity defense mechanisms, 2) dysthymic patients would use a distinct pattern of defense mechanisms, different from that of panic patients, and 3) dysthymic patients would endorse more frequently than panic patients four individual defenses that tend to handle anger and low self-esteem poorly: devaluation, passive aggression, <e>projection</e>, and hypochondriasis. METHOD: Twenty-two subjects meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for primary early-onset dysthymia and 22 subjects meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for primary panic disorder were interviewed on videotape and rated on the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales. RESULTS: The dysthymic subjects scored significantly higher on narcissistic, disavowal, and action defense levels and on the four individual defenses of devaluation, projection, passive aggression, and hypochondriasis, as predicted, as well as on two additional defenses, acting out and projective identification. Both groups tended to use lower-maturity defense mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The defense mechanism profile identified for dysthymia differs from that for panic disorder and supports particular psychodynamic hypotheses about chronic depression.

8285299,"The context of transference interpretations in analytical group psychotherapy.Transference interpretation varies with the underlying understanding of the concept of transference. We view the phenomena of transference in its multiple connections; its relationship to countertransference, its relationship to a particular kind of remembering that unfolds in sequence rather than in representation and its relationship to working through. The transference is expressed in the context of a  total situation  and in order to unfold, requires a time-space frame which variation will modify the nature of the transference available for interpretation. The analytical frame applied to a group situation creates an environment that promotes rapid and sometimes massive regression. We have introduced the notion of levels of transference to account for the state of self/object differentiation present in the group. This varies with the amount of regression, and depends on the severity of splitting, <e>projection</e> and projective identification. In terms of transferential objects available in the group, we recognize the analyst, other members and the group as a whole. The latter carries the more primitive transference and the underlying phantasy structure of the group transactions. We briefly described some possible errors in the interpretation of transference and their potential consequences.",M2
1593454,"The central <e>projection</e> of electrosensory information in the platypus.1. This is the first detailed description of the projection to the cerebral cortex of afferent information coming from electroreceptors in the bill of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus. 2. In animals anaesthetized with chloralose, with the bill immersed in tap water, applying a potential difference between plate electrodes on either side of the bill produced large amplitude potentials from the surface of a postero-lateral region of cerebral cortex. Response threshold was 300 microV cm-1, somewhat lower than threshold measured for single identified electroreceptors. Electroreceptor threshold was at least three orders of magnitude lower than threshold of mechanoreceptors to electrical stimuli (Gregory, Iggo, McIntyre &amp; Proske, 1989a). 3. Monopolar stimulation of the bill revealed a crossed projection. The map on the cortical surface had the bill oriented dorso-laterally, its base towards the mid-line, the tip on the lateral edge, pointing slightly forwards. The edge of the bill faced backwards. Electrosensory information coming from the edge of the bill appeared to be much more strongly represented than input from the dorsal surface. 4. Weak electrical and mechanical stimuli applied to the bill both evoked large amplitude potentials from the same region of cortex indicating that there was complete overlap between the regions receiving tactile and electrosensory inputs. 5. Inserting microelectrodes into the deeper layers of cortex revealed burst discharges in single cells and groups of cells in response to weak electrical stimulation of the bill. Activity could be recorded over a range of depths from 0.3 to 4 mm, with the majority of responses coming from cells 1-3 mm deep. Histological examination of lesion sites made at 1.1 mm and at 3 mm suggested that cells in the pyramidal and ganglion layers were involved in generating the activity. 6. Some evidence was obtained for interactions at the level of the cerebral cortex between activity generated by tactile and electrosensory inputs. When electrical and mechanical stimuli were both applied to the bill with an interstimulus interval of less than 25 ms, cortical neuronal responses generated by one stimulus were completely suppressed by the other. However no evidence was obtained of a direct convergence at the level of the cortex between the two modalities. 7. Cortical activity could be evoked in response to rapidly changing voltage fields. This observation, together with our earlier finding of a high rate sensitivity of the receptors, emphasizes the high dynamic sensitivity of the system. 8. It is concluded that the electrosensory system of the platypus is closely associated with the sense of touch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M2
1766782,"A study of schizophrenic outpatients with the Defense Mechanism Test.Intrapsychic defensive strategies are allegedly expressed on the Defense Mechanism Test through the presentation, at increasing tachistoscopic exposure times, of a picture in which a central figure is threatened by a peripheral person. Several types of perceptual alterations of the stimulus configuration are coded as defenses in the subjective reports. A number of test variables have already been shown to differentiate significantly between nonclinical controls and nonpsychotic psychiatric patients. In the present study, after a review of the pertinent percept-genetic literature, nonpsychotic patients (n = 57) were compared with a group of schizophrenic outpatients in the active phase (n = 21). As predicted, significantly more schizophrenics than controls were coded for <e>projection</e> and regression and for certain variants of these signs. Four subcodings of repression, three of isolation, the sign of reaction formation, and several variants of identification differentiated in the same direction. Reports in which the central figure was too old and changed from a correct to an incorrect sex attribution were highly characteristic of the schizophrenic sample. No defensive variable was significantly linked with nonpsychotic pathology. Two variants, one of regression and one of identification, allowed a correct diagnostic placement for all schizophrenics and for 82.4% of the nonpsychotic patients. The findings, besides being a further clinical validation of the Defense Mechanism Test, provide a preliminary distinction between high- and low-level defenses. It is suggested that they are congruent with an hierarchical model which implies inclusive nonreflexive relationships between classes of mental disorders.",M2

1987813,"Clarification of projective identification.This paper clarifies the various current usages of the term  projective identification.  The author presents a broad reference model of projective identification based on the work of Ogden. This model divides projective identification into three steps. Step 1 is the <e>projection</e> of a part of oneself onto an external object. Step 1a is the blurring of self and object representations. Step 2 is an interpersonal interaction in which the projector actively pressures the recipient to think, feel, and act in accordance with the projection. Step 3 is the reinternalization of the projection after it has been psychologically processed by the recipient. The different definitions of projective identification are shown to relate to exactly how the term  projection  is conceptualized (in step 1), to whether step 1a is deemed necessary, and to how many of the three steps are required for the definition of projective identification. The author reviews the work of Ogden, Kernberg, Meissner, Sandler, Malin and Grotstein, Porder, and Zinner et al.

In Gestalt group psychotherapy, group members interfere with the process of need identification and satisfaction by distorting their contact with each other through projecting, introjecting, and being confluent.

In formulating interventions, the leader is mindful of the function of boundary disturbances to the group-as-a-whole as well as to individuals.",M2

This pattern contrasts with that of transitive verbs that subcategorize for a single internal argument position, where fronted fillers are obligatorily interpreted as the direct object).

Defensive projection occurs when an unacceptable quality is minimized by distorting this quality in other people used as standards of comparison. Reactive paranoid schizophrenics were expected to show projection as a distortion of social comparison and process paranoid schizophrenics were not. This was tested in terms of a number of thematic qualities that should appear in actual delusions of reactive paranoids but not in those of process paranoids (i.e. more specific social references, attribution of untrustworthiness by men, attribution of hostility by women, concern with female identity in women). The results confirmed these predictions and supported the social-comparison interpretation of projection as a defense in reactive schizophrenics that contributes to the development of delusions.",M2

4066167,"Identification and its vicissitudes.This paper attempts to understand the vicissitudes of identification within the co-ordinates of narcissism and the object relation.

The importance of the structuring function of the introjection and <e>projection</e> mechanisms becomes embodied in the concept of projective identification, which comes to question the postulate of primary narcissism. The theory of projective-introjective identification is an extremely powerful instrument for explaining phenomena, however it obliges one to accept that the first introjections are radically different from the others. They have nothing to do with mourning but rather with primitive mechanisms which question the subject/object polarity and, so this author believes, spring basically from envy. Lastly, it is maintained that envy and libido are factors of a dialectic from which the object relation and the earliest processes of identification, previous to the Oedipus complex, proceed at one and the same time.",M2
