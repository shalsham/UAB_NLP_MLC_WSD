19998572,"Dietary supplement labeling and advertising claims: are clinical studies on the full product required?Whether labeling and advertising claims for multi-ingredient dietary supplements may be based on the testing of individual, key ingredients--rather than the actual product--has caused a good deal of confusion. This confusion stems from the dearth of case law and the open-endedness of Federal Trade Commission (<e>FTC</e>) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on this issue. Nevertheless, the relevant regulatory guidance, case law and self-regulatory case law--when assessed together--indicate that the law allows and even protects  key ingredient claims  (i.e., claims based on efficacy testing of key ingredients in the absence of full product testing). This article provides an overview of the relevant substantiation requirements for dietary supplement claims and then reviews FTC's and FDA's guidance on key ingredient claims; relevant case law; use of key ingredient claims in the advertising of other consumer products; and the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau, Inc.'s (NAD's) approach to evaluating key ingredient claims for dietary supplements. This article concludes that key ingredient claims--provided they are presented in a truthful and non-deceptive manner--are permissible, and should be upheld in litigation and cases subject to industry self-regulation. This article further concludes that the NAD's approach to key ingredient claims provides practical guidance for crafting and substantiating dietary supplement key ingredient claims.",M1

18768461,"Ignoring puff counts: another shortcoming of the Federal Trade Commission cigarette testing programme.OBJECTIVES: To examine reasons behind the failure of the Federal Trade Commission (<e>FTC</e>) to preserve puff count information from standard cigarette testing and to elucidate the importance of puff count to overall tar yields. METHODS: We reviewed industry documents on origins of the FTC test and datasets provided by the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory to the tobacco industry and FTC for reporting purposes. RESULTS: The majority of the tobacco industry argued for  dual reporting  of tar yields-both per cigarette and per puff. Despite a request from the Tobacco Institute in 1967 that puff count information be preserved, documents and recent communications with the FTC indicate that puff number data have not been maintained by the government. In contrast, for the cigarette industry, puff count data are a fundamental and routine part of testing and important to cigarette design. A sample of puff counts for cigarettes tested in 1996 (n = 471) shows that on average 100 mm cigarettes have 18% more puffs taken on them than do 85 mm cigarettes in standard tests (7.66 vs 9.03; p&lt;0.01). The 10th percentile puff count is 6.8 and the 90th percentile is 8.8 for king size; the 10th percentile puff count is 8.2 and the 90th percentile is 10.0 for 100 mm cigarettes, indicating that puff counts can vary substantially among brands. CONCLUSIONS: The FTC has failed to seek or preserve puff count information that the industry finds important. Any standard test of tar and nicotine yields should at minimum preserve puff count information.",M1
18717153,"IFTC v. Evanston: antitrust enforcement of hospital mergers receives a shot in the arm.This article examines the Federal Trade Commission's Evanston decision and assesses its future impact on hospital merger analysis. In finding that a consummated merger of two Chicago-area hospitals violated the antitrust laws, the <e>FTC</e> analyzed the merger using a unilateral effects theory of anticompetitive harm. This theory entails examining the competitive impact on third-party payors as a result of the loss of competition between the merging hospitals, rather than the traditional market share and market structure data relied upon in earlier court decisions. After a detailed discussion of the Evanston decision and the history of hospital merger litigation leading up to it, the authors argue that while the Evanston decision indicates that the government will use unilateral effects analysis in challenging future hospital mergers, this analysis is fraught with litigation challenges. The government's next case will not have the benefit of a strong evidentiary record as in Evanston, thereby making it more difficult for the government to prove its unilateral effects theory.",M1

The article concludes that the policy is consistent with anti-trust principles, consistent with current thinking on the use of organized processes to improve medical care quality, specific enough to provide guidance to physicians wanting to integrate clinically, and general enough to encourage ongoing innovations in physician organization. The FTC should consider stronger sanctions for IPAs and PHOs whose clinical integration is nothing more than a sham intended to provide cover for joint negotiations, should give the benefit of the doubt to organizations whose clinical integration appears to be reasonably consonant with the statements, and should clarify several ambiguities in the statements. Health plans should facilitate IPA and PHO efforts to improve care by rewarding quality and efficiency and by providing clinically integrated organizations with claims information on individual patients. Though creating clinically integrated organizations is difficult and expensive, physicians should recognize that clinical integration can help them both to gain some negotiating leverage with health plans and to improve the quality of care for their patients.",M1

Physicians' discontent stems from the belief that federal policy allows managed care organizations to achieve dominance in health care markets just as it discourages physicians from taking collective action to protect their interests. This article examines two important efforts by organized medicine over a twenty-year interval to alter federal antitrust policy. In 1982, physicians and other professionals sought a special exemption from FTC jurisdiction; beginning in 1998, physicians promoted legislation that would exempt independent practitioners from the antitrust laws for collective bargaining purposes. Both initiatives passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. This article uses an advocacy coalition framework to reinterpret the events and to assess the reasons for legislative failure. The evidence suggests that in both instances, although twenty years apart, consumer groups and federal bureaucrats determined the outcome in favor of corporate medicine.",M1

12037262,"Smoke yields of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in relation to <e>FTC</e> tar level and cigarette manufacturer: analysis of the Massachusetts Benchmark Study.OBJECTIVES: This research assessed the relationship between the deliveries of carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  tar  ratings of US commercial cigarettes. METHODS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the explanatory power of FTC tar, the particular manufacturer, and other cigarette characteristics to predict the yields of four TSNAs (N'-nitrosonornicotine [NNN], 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone [NNK], N'-nitrosoanatabine [NAT], and N'-nitrosoanabasine [NAB]) in 26 US commercial brands tested in the 1999 Massachusetts Benchmark Study. RESULTS: When FTC tar alone was used to predict TSNA yield, the squared correlation coefficient (R(2)) was only 38% for NNN, 76% for NNK, 46% for NAT, and 49% for NAB. Inclusion of manufacturer-specific variables significantly (p &lt; 0.001) increased the estimated R(2) for three of the four species of nitrosamine to: 78% for NNN, 88% for NNK, and 81% for NAT. Inclusion of other cigarette characteristics (filter type, paper permeability, tobacco weight, tip dilution) did not reduce the significance of the manufacturer-specific effects. Federal Trade Commission nicotine and carbon monoxide (CO) yields were no better at predicting TSNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: FTC ratings for tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide do not tell the entire story about the comparative yields of toxic agents in marketed cigarette brands. The significant manufacturer-specific effects suggest that proprietary blending and processing of tobacco matter as well. Public, brand-by-brand disclosure of the yields of TSNA and possibly other smoke constituents appears to be warranted.",M1

10639511,"Doses of nicotine and lung carcinogens delivered to cigarette smokers.BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoke yields of tar and nicotine obtained under the Federal Trade Commission (<e>FTC</e>)-specified machine-smoking protocol (35-mL puff volume drawn for 2 seconds once per minute) may not accurately reflect the delivery of toxins and carcinogens to the smoker. We conducted this study to obtain more realistic estimates of exposure to components of cigarette smoke that affect lung cancer risk. METHODS: We used a pressure transducer system to evaluate puffing characteristics for 133 smokers of cigarettes rated by the FTC at 1.2 mg of nicotine or less (56 smokers of low-yield cigarettes [&lt;/=0.8 mg of nicotine per cigarette] and 77 smokers of medium-yield cigarettes [0.9-1.2 mg of nicotine per cigarette]). We programmed measurements from a randomly chosen subset of 72 of these smokers into a piston-type machine to generate smoke from each smoker's usual brand of cigarettes for assays of nicotine, carbon monoxide, tar, and the lung cancer-causing agents 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and benzo[a]pyrene. The FTC protocol was also used to assess levels of targeted components in the 11 brands most frequently smoked by study subjects. RESULTS: Compared with the FTC protocol values, smokers of low- and medium-yield brands took in statistically significantly larger puffs (48.6 and 44.1 mL, respectively) at statistically significantly shorter intervals (21.3 and 18.5 seconds, respectively), and they drew larger total smoke volumes than specified in the FTC parameters. They received, respectively, 2.5 and 2.2 times more nicotine and 2.6 and 1.9 times more tar than FTC-derived amounts, as well as about twofold higher levels of benzo[a]pyrene and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. Smokers of medium-yield cigarettes compared with smokers of low-yield cigarettes received higher doses of all components. CONCLUSIONS: The FTC protocol underestimates nicotine and carcinogen doses to smokers and overestimates the proportional benefit of low-yield cigarettes. Thus, FTC-based nicotine medication doses prescribed/recommended for smoking cessation may need to be reassessed.",M1

These cases provide an understanding of the more compelling strategies that hospitals are using to offset federal antitrust concerns and the increased number of factors that are being used by the FTC and DOJ to analyze a merger's effect on a market. In particular, the cases illustrate how federal agencies' likelihood of contesting a merger is now based on the merging hospitals' ability to provide strong evidence of substantial savings resulting from a merger.

For this study, 113 smokers evenly distributed across four FTC  tar  yield ranges were recruited, only 72 demonstrated reasonable compliance with the study criteria with regard to sample collections and cigarette brand style consistency. Subjects recorded the number of cigarettes smoked daily and collected a 24-h urine sample and a saliva sample on 3 consecutive days. Nicotine absorption was determined by monitoring urinary excretion of nicotine and its metabolites. In addition, saliva samples were monitored for cotinine using radioimmunoassay (RIA). The correlation of the relationship for nicotine absorbed per cigarette was positive and significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.008) but weaker than in the previous study. Only smokers in the highest yield range showed any statistical difference from smokers in the lower ranges. Our results suggest that FTC nicotine yield is weakly related to nicotine absorption and that smoker-controlled factors exert a great influence on the amount of nicotine absorbed by smokers. Compensation is substantial but incomplete for the minority (by market share) of smokers at the low end of the yield scale. It is uncertain how well any alternative set of machine parameters would predict nicotine absorption for the majority of smokers, even if it were more predictive for the small number of smokers at the lower yield part of the range.",M1

CSET includes a computer controlled 30-port AMESA/Battelle-Geneva smoke generator which exposes cultured mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) to whole smoke. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the neutral red assay and genotoxicity was assessed using the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay. Compared on a per cigarette basis, mainstream smoke from 1R5F and the TOB-HT cigarette was significantly less cytotoxic and genotoxic than the smoke from the 1R4F cigarette. The cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of smoke from the TOB-HT cigarettes was slightly greater than the smoke from the ultra-low  tar  Kentucky 1R5F reference cigarettes. In conclusion, in these assays mainstream whole smoke of the TOB-HT cigarette had slightly greater cytotoxic and genotoxic potential compared with an ultra-low  tar  1R5F Kentucky reference cigarette and significantly less activity compared with the whole mainstream smoke from a low  tar  1R4F Kentucky reference cigarette, representative of the US market average cigarette for <e>FTC</e> yields of  tar , CO and nicotine.",M1

8942136,"Release of spectacle prescriptions: an update.BACKGROUND: Due to the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission's prescription release rule, the patients of optometrists are entitled to a copy of the spectacle prescription following the examination. METHODS: The <e>FTC</e> rule and provisions of various state laws that regulate the release of information from medical records have been reviewed to determine the specific legal requirements that govern the release of spectacle prescriptions. RESULTS: Although the FTC rule does not require specific information to be included in a spectacle prescription, in 19 states specific information is required, and optometrists in all states should include such additional information as they believe will be necessary to ensure that patients receive the appropriate spectacles from a third-party dispenser. In addition, the laws of 29 states require optometrists to release copies or information from patient records on request from the patient, and in 3 states optometry practice acts or board rules require the release of copies of the spectacle prescription, thereby expanding the duty to patients beyond that required by the FTC rule. In states that do not have statutory provisions, court rulings must be consulted to determine the extent of an optometrist's obligation to provide prescription information from records to patients.

20187783,"Tetraiodothyroacetic acid and tetraiodothyroacetic acid nanoparticle effectively inhibit the growth of human follicular thyroid cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is a deaminated analogue of L-thyroxine that blocks the actions of L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine at the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone on integrin alpha v beta 3. Tetrac blocks the proliferative effects of thyroid hormone on tumor cells and the proangiogenesis actions of the hormone. In the absence of thyroid hormone, tetrac also blocks angiogenesis induced by various growth factors. Covalently linked to poly(lactide-co-glycolide), tetrac nanoparticles (tetrac NP) do not gain access to the cell interior and act exclusively at the integrin receptor. Here, the activity of tetrac and tetrac NP against follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>)-236 cells was studied in two models: (1) tumor cell implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system and (2) xenografts in the nude mouse. METHODS: FTC-236 cells (10(6)) were implanted in the CAM (n = 8 each for control, and for tetrac and tetrac NP, both at 1 microg/CAM) and the actions of tetrac and tetrac NP were determined after 8 days on tumor-related angiogenesis and tumor growth. Xenografts of 10(7) FTC-236 cells were implanted in nude mice (n = 8 per group). Tetrac or tetrac NP was administered intraperitoneal (1 mg/kg and 1 mg tetrac equivalent/kg, respectively) every other day for 32 days beginning on day 10, when tumor volume was 200-250 mm(3). Animals were monitored after discontinuation of treatment up to day 40. RESULTS: In the CAM paradigm, tetrac and tetrac NP arrested tumor-related angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the xenograft model, tetrac and tetrac NP promptly and progressively reduced tumor volume (p &lt; 0.01) over 32 days. There was some regrowth of tumor after interruption of tetrac treatment, but at day 40, tumor volume and tumor weight at sacrifice were 45-55% below those of controls (p &lt; 0.01). Animal weight gain was comparable in the control and treatment groups of animals. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrac and tetrac NP effectively arrest FTC-236 cell tumor growth in the CAM and xenograft models, suggesting its potential utility against FTC.",M2
20133453,"Growth activation alone is not sufficient to cause metastatic thyroid cancer in a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma.TSH is the major stimulator of thyrocyte proliferation, but its role in thyroid carcinogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, we used a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice). These mice, harboring a dominantly negative mutation (PV) of the thyroid hormone-beta receptor (TRbeta), exhibit increased serum thyroid hormone and elevated TSH. To eliminate TSH growth-stimulating effect, TRbeta(PV/PV) mice were crossed with TSH receptor gene knockout (TSHR(-/-)) mice. Wild-type siblings of TRbeta(PV/PV) mice were treated with an antithyroid agent, propylthiouracil, to elevate serum TSH for evaluating long-term TSH effect (WT-PTU mice). Thyroids from TRbeta(PV/PV)TSHR(-/-) showed impaired growth with no occurrence of FTC. Both WT-PTU and TRbeta(PV/PV) mice displayed enlarged thyroids, but only TRbeta(PV/PV) mice developed metastatic FTC. Molecular analyses indicate that PV acted, via multiple mechanisms, to activate the integrins-Src-focal adhesion kinase-p38 MAPK pathway and affect cytoskeletal restructuring to increase tumor cell migration and invasion. Thus, growth stimulated by TSH is a prerequisite but not sufficient for metastatic cancer to occur. Additional genetic alterations (such as PV), destined to alter focal adhesion and migration capacities, are required to empower hyperplastic follicular cells to invade and metastasize. These in vivo findings provide new insights in understanding carcinogenesis of the human thyroid.",M2
20056739,"Evaluation of the PAX8/PPARG translocation in follicular thyroid cancer with a 4-color reverse-transcription PCR assay and automated high-resolution fragment analysis.BACKGROUND: Molecular testing of thyroid malignancies, in combination with cytologic and histologic examination, is becoming increasingly attractive as a tool for refining traditional morphologic diagnosis. The molecular changes associated with follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) are point mutations in RAS oncogenes or the presence of PAX8/PPARG (paired box 8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) rearrangement. METHODS: We developed and validated a clinical assay for the detection of PAX8/PPARG rearrangements that uses a 4-color reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay and high-resolution fragment analysis. RESULTS: The RT-PCR assay is applicable for detecting the various described fusion transcripts of PAX8/PPARG in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue and in fine-needle aspirate biopsy washes from thyroid nodules. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 1 abnormal cell in a background of 100-10 000 translocation-negative cells. A comparison of the RT-PCR assay with dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization showed an overall concordance of 95%. With this assay, we obtained a prevalence for the PAX8/PPARG rearrangement in FTC of 62% (13 of 21 cases), compared with a 5% prevalence (3 of 55) for other follicular cell-derived neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of this assay into clinical practice could provide useful information for the diagnosis and possibly for the prognosis and treatment of thyroid cancer in the future.",M2
20032418,"Long-term eradication of locally recurrent invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma after taxane-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy.A 46-year-old woman with history of radioiodine-refractory follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) presented with locally recurrent, high-risk, invasive disease. She was treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which was well tolerated, resulting in complete remission and freedom from residual or recurrent FTC for longer than 5 years until her last follow-up at age 52. This case highlights the possibility of combining taxane-based chemotherapy with definitive radiotherapy (as CRT) for the management of locally aggressive recurrences in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, thereby resulting in rapid and persistent disease eradication. Even in the light of recent data on the potential benefit of novel targeted therapy agents in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, this approach in similar clinical settings deserves future investigation.",M2
20032008,"The role of oestrogen receptor {alpha} in human thyroid cancer: contributions from coregulatory proteins and the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2.Epidemiological, clinical, and molecular studies suggest a role for oestrogen in thyroid cancer. How oestrogen mediates its effects and the consequence of it on clinical outcome has not been fully elucidated. The participation of coregulatory proteins in modulating oestrogen receptor (ER) function and input of crosstalk with the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 was investigated. Oestrogen induced cell proliferation in the follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>)-133 cells, but not in the anaplastic 8305C cell line. Knockdown of the coactivator steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 inhibited FTC-133 basal, but not oestrogen induced, cell proliferation. Oestrogen also increased protein expression of SRC-1 and the ER target gene cyclin D1 in the FTC-133 cell line. ERalpha, ERbeta, the coregulatory proteins SRC-1 and nuclear corepressor (NCoR), and the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 were localised by immunohistochemistry and immnofluorescence in paraffin-embedded tissue from thyroid tumour patients (n=111). ERalpha was colocalised with both SRC-1 and NCoR to the nuclei of the tumour epithelial cells. Expression of ERalpha and NCoR was found predominantly in non-anaplastic tumours and was significantly associated with well-differentiated tumours and reduced incidence of disease recurrence. In non-anaplastic tumours, HER2 was significantly associated with SRC-1, and these proteins were associated with poorly differentiated tumours, capsular invasion and disease recurrence. Totally, 87% of anaplastic tumours were positive for SRC-1. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival indicated that in thyroid cancer, SRC-1 strongly correlates with reduced disease-free survival (P&lt;0.001), whereas NCoR predicted increased survival (P&lt;0.001). These data suggest opposing roles for the coregulators SRC-1 and NCoR in thyroid tumour progression.",M2
20020292,"Long-term outcome of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: experience in a developing country.BACKGROUND: The presentation and outcome of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in developing countries are different from the developed nations. We report the clinicopathologic profile and long-term outcome of DTC in an iodine-deficient area (IDA) in a developing country. METHODS: This retrospective study included 302 patients with DTC operated between 1989 and 2002. These patients had been followed up for a minimum period of 5 years after surgery. Clinicopathological profile, intervention, and follow-up details were noted. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 42 +/- 14 years. Mean follow-up period was 80 +/- 34 (24-196) months. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) was present in 62, 30, and 8% patients, respectively. Mean tumor size was 3.5 cm. Tumor multicentricity was noted in 40% of PTC, 22.2% of FTC, and 25% of PDTC patients. Lymphadenopathy was observed in 45, 10, and 67% patients with PTC, FTC, and PDTC, respectively. Extrathyroidal invasion and distant metastasis were observed in 36.8% (PTC 33%; FTC 36%; PDTC 71%) and 27% (PTC 17%; FTC 44%; PDTC 42%) of cases, respectively. Twenty percent of patients had synchronous metastases. Risk stratification ratio was 1:1.8 (high-risk vs. low-risk). Initial operative procedure was total thyroidectomy in 86.5% cases, and therapeutic lymph node dissection was performed in 37% cases. A total of 77.2% patients received adjuvant radioiodine therapy. Disease recurred in 26.6% of patients (thyroid bed recurrence 1.7%), and 21.2% patients died during follow-up. Overall survival (OS) rate at 10 years in both low-risk and high-risk groups of FTC (80 and 54%) was inferior to PTC (94 and 62%). Five-year OS for PDTC was 50%. Tumor multicentricity was a significant risk factor for OS in the low-risk group, whereas the presence of skeletal metastases and extrathyroidal invasion were significant factors for OS in the high-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Advance stage at presentation and proportionately high rates of FTC and PDTC contribute to poor outcome of DTC in developing countries. Despite dismal outcome, total thyroidectomy seems to prevent thyroid bed recurrence in surviving patients.",M2
19902289,"[Surgery of thyroid carcinoma]The 5 main types of thyroid cancer (papillary, PTC, follicular, <e>FTC</e>, poorly differentiated, PDTC undifferentiated, UTC, medullary, MTC) not only differ regarding morphology, pathogenesis, genetics,and pathophysiology (iodine metabolism, thyroglobulin and calcitonin production), but also concerning tumor biology, metastatic behavior (lymphogenous, locally invasive and hematogenous routes) and prognosis. Knowledge of these features is the basis of the surgical concept of one or two-stage thyroidectomy, the exceptions and the concept of locoregional lymph node dissection. Lymph node surgery plays an important role in those cancers exhibiting mainly lymph node metastases (PTC, MTC) not only due to frequent recurrences but also due to its potential curative intent. Differentiated carcinomas may have an acceptable prognosis despite local invasion of the cervical aerodigestive system, thus resections are justified when technical prerequisites are given.",M2
19835629,"Growth inhibition of thyroid follicular cell-derived cancers by the opioid growth factor (OGF) - opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis.BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of the thyroid gland is an uncommon cancer, but the most frequent malignancy of the endocrine system. Most thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cell. Follicular carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) is considered more malignant than papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human cancers. Opioid Growth Factor (OGF; chemical term - [Met5]-enkephalin) and its receptor, OGFr, form an inhibitory axis regulating cell proliferation. Both the peptide and receptor have been detected in a wide variety of cancers, and OGF is currently used clinically as a biotherapy for some non-thyroid neoplasias. This study addressed the question of whether the OGF-OGFr axis is present and functional in human thyroid follicular cell - derived cancer. METHODS: Utilizing human ATC (KAT-18), PTC (KTC-1), and FTC (WRO 82-1) cell lines, immunohistochemistry was employed to ascertain the presence and location of OGF and OGFr. The growth characteristics in the presence of OGF or the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX), and the specificity of opioid peptides for proliferation of ATC, were established in KAT-18 cells. Dependence on peptide and receptor were investigated using neutralization studies with antibodies and siRNA experiments, respectively. The mechanism of peptide action on DNA synthesis and cell survival was ascertained. The ubiquity of the OGF-OGFr axis in thyroid follicular cell-derived cancer was assessed in KTC-1 (PTC) and WRO 82-1 (FTC) tumor cells. RESULTS: OGF and OGFr were present in KAT-18 cells. Concentrations of 10-6 M OGF inhibited cell replication up to 30%, whereas NTX increased cell growth up to 35% relative to cultures treated with sterile water. OGF treatment reduced cell number by as much as 38% in KAT-18 ATC in a dose-dependent and receptor-mediated manner. OGF antibodies neutralized the inhibitory effects of OGF, and siRNA knockdown of OGFr negated growth inhibition by OGF. Cell survival was not altered by OGF, but DNA synthesis as recorded by BrdU incorporation was depressed by 28% in OGF-treated cultures compared to those exposed to sterile water. The OGF-OGFr axis was detected and functional in PTC (KTC-1) and FTC (WRO 82-1) cell lines. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that OGF and OGFr are present in follicular-derived thyroid cancers, and that OGF serves in a tonically active inhibitory manner to maintain homeostasis of cell proliferation. These results may provide a biotherapeutic strategy in the treatment of these cancers.",M2
19808899,"Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha in thyroid carcinomas.Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is upregulated by hypoxia and oncogenic signalling in many solid tumours. Its regulation and function in thyroid carcinomas are unknown. We evaluated the regulation of HIF-1 alpha and target gene expression in primary thyroid carcinomas and thyroid carcinoma cell lines (BcPAP, WRO, <e>FTC</e>-133 and 8505c). HIF-1 alpha was not detectable in normal tissue but was expressed in thyroid carcinomas. Dedifferentiated anaplastic tumours (ATCs) exhibited high levels of nuclear HIF-1 alpha staining. The HIF-1 target glucose transporter 1 was expressed to a similar level in all tumour types, whereas carbonic anhydrase-9 was significantly elevated in ATCs. In vitro studies revealed a functionally active HIF-1 alpha pathway in thyroid cells with transcriptional activation observed after graded hypoxia (1% O(2), anoxia) or treatment with a hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride. High basal and hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha in FTC-133 cells that harbour a phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) mutation was reduced by introduction of wild-type PTEN. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway using LY294002 inhibited HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 alpha targets in all cell lines, including those with B-RAF mutations (BcPAP and 8505c). In contrast, the effects of inhibition of the RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway were restricted by environmental condition and B-RAF mutation status. HIF-1 is functionally expressed in thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also via growth factor signalling pathways and, in particular, the PI3K pathway. Given the strong association of HIF-1 alpha with an aggressive disease phenotype and therapeutic resistance, this pathway may be an attractive target for improved therapy in thyroid carcinomas.",M2
19735058,"Chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine in progressive medullary and thyroid carcinoma of the follicular epithelium.Nine patients (mean age 53) with metastasizing, progressive, medullary (MTC), thyroid carcinoma and progressive, nonradioiodine accumulating thyroid carcinoma of the follicular epithelium (follicular carcinoma, <e>FTC</e> and papillary carcinoma, PTC) were treated with a combination of paclitaxel and gemcitabine between 2004 and 2006. Tumors were histologically classified as follicular in 5 patients (56%), as papillary in 2 patients (22%), and medullary in 2 patients (22%). Paclitaxel (90-100 mg/m (2)) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m (2)) were applied for two, three, or 6 cycles every three weeks, depending on response and side effects. The effect of therapy was evaluated by radiographic imaging (CT images) and [(18)F]FDG-PET. All patients with papillary, follicular, or medullary thyroid carcinoma had continuous progression during restaging 14.8+/-8.8 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, including one patient with stable disease after 3 cycles, but continuous progression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and gemcitabine are not a valid chemotherapy option, in particular in patients with progressive, nonradioiodine-accumulating follicular thyroid carcinoma, who were already treated by other chemotherapeutic agents.",M2
19552924,"Follicular thyroid cancer cell growth inhibition by proteosome inhibitor MG132.BACKGROUND: Effective therapies for the subset of follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>) patients with aggressive, metastatic disease are lacking. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of proteosome inhibition, an emerging class of chemotherapeutic agents, on metastatic FTC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human metastatic FTC cells (FTC236) were treated in vitro with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (0 to 800 nM). Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates isolated after 2 d. To measure cell growth, we performed an MTT cellular proliferation assay over 6 d. RESULTS: Treatment of FTC236 cells with MG132 led to dose-dependent cell growth inhibition. Increases in inactive, phosphorylated GSK-3beta, and active beta-catenin also were observed. With 800 nM MG132, growth was reduced by 87% at 6 d (P &lt; 0.0001). This reduction in cellular proliferation correlated with the degree of GSK-3beta inhibition. MG132 treatment also caused increased p21(Waf1/Cip1) and decreased cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that growth suppression may occur through cell cycle arrest. CONCLUSION: Growth of metastatic human FTC cells appears to be suppressed by proteosome inhibition. Whether this effect is directly due to cell cycle arrest and inactivation of GSK-3beta signaling is unclear. Nonetheless, these compounds may become novel treatments for aggressive, metastatic FTC.",M2
19534620,"Increasing prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years in Greece: the majority are incidental.BACKGROUND: New cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are diagnosed more frequently worldwide. We investigated trends and differences in clinical and histological characteristics of new DTC cases presenting in one large center. METHODS: During the last 34 years 852 follicular cell-derived DTC cases (83% papillary [PTC], 17% follicular [<e>FTC</e>] carcinoma) presented in the Endocrine Unit of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics in Alexandra Hospital (18.8% men, mean age 42.4 +/- 14.5 years). Patients were classified in three period groups according to year of diagnosis: period 1, 1963-1982; period 2, 1983-1992; and period 3, 1993-2007. We recorded the histological type, age at diagnosis, and, in period 3, the type of pre-existing thyroid disease, the stage, and tumor size. RESULTS: During periods 1, 2, and 3, the mean age at diagnosis was 37.7 +/- 12.3, 42.4 +/- 14.53, and 44.1 +/- 14.9 years (p = 0.001), respectively, and the male to female ratio was similar. The prevalence of FTC was 22.7%, 28.1%, and 6.5%, respectively. In period 3, 51.6% of the PTCs were microcarcinomas (microPTC) &lt;or=10 mm; these patients tended to be older (p = 0.09). Microcarcinomas were more frequent among patients operated for pre-existing multinodular goiter (MNG) or prominent hot nodule compared to pre-existing single cold nodule (p &lt; 0.001, Pearson chi(2)). In period 3, 88% of the microPTC diagnoses were incidental. Of the incidental microPTCs detected in MNG, 25% had capsular invasion, 4.5% had lymph node involvement, and 3.6% had soft tissue involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the prevalence of FTC during the last decade in our center in Greece was very low due to correction of iodine deficiency and a relative increase in the prevalence of microPTC. More than 50% of PTC diagnosed during the last decade were microPTCs that were detected incidentally in older persons with preexisting MNG or a prominent hot nodule. This is one of the highest, if not the highest percentage of microPTCs that were incidentally detected. Despite many of these having features of invasiveness, most appear to remain clinically silent. Research is needed to identify factors predisposing microPTCs to evolve from a subclinical to a clinically apparent form.",M2
19509478,"Inhibitory effects of retinoic acid on invasiveness of human thyroid carcinoma cell lines in vitro.BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with metastasized thyroid carcinoma is not optimistic, necessitating the search for new treatment options. AIM: Beneficial effects of retinoic acid (RA) have been suggested in thyroid cancer differentiation and the present study was performed to investigate the anti-metastatic potential of RA in respect of important determinants of metastatic behavior in thyroid carcinoma, focusing on the role of invasion-associated proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell lines <e>FTC</e>- 133 and XTC.UC1, and anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines C643 and HTH74 were studied. All cell lines were cultured with alltrans- RA (ATRA) or the solvent ethanol. Invasion and adhesion potency in vitro was studied by transwell experiment and short-term adhesion assay. The involvement of invasion-associated proteins, urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA receptor (uPAR), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and E-cadherin, were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: In vitro invasion assay revealed that ATRA treatment could reduce the invasive potency in all the thyroid cancer cell lines, with the most significant effect in anaplastic cancer cells. Short-term adhesion assay suggested that ATRA increases cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) in C643, HTH74 and XTC.UC1, probably through a transcriptional and translational regulation of some attachment molecules. RT-PCR andWestern blot both revealed diminished expression of uPAR in all four carcinoma cell lines. In C643 and HTH74 cell lines, the expression of uPA was reduced and the expression of E-cadherin was increased, whereas the MMP-2 expression was not significantly down-regulated in ATRA-treated group. In ATRA-treated FTC-133 and XTC.UC1 cell lines, MMP-2 expression was decreased, but no significant changes in uPA and E-cadherin expression were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the influence of ATRA on both important determinants of metastatic behavior ( de-adhesion  and proteolysis) in thyroid carcinoma cell lines, especially in anaplastic cancer cells. These findings may add to the explanations for beneficial effects of RA in the treatment of metastatic thyroid carcinomas.",M2
19500506,"[Relationship between micro-lymphatic vessel density and lymphatic metastasis in follicular thyroid carcinoma]AIM: To investigate the relationship between micro-lymphatic vessel density (MLVD) and lymphatic metastasis in follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>).

The relationship between MLVD and lymphatic metastasis was analyzed. RESULTS: MLVD and MVD in follicular thyroid carcinoma were closely related with lymphatic metastasis. At the same time, the cancer embolus in the micro-lymphatic vessel was significantly related with the lymphatic metastasis (P&lt;0.01).

19480010,"Urokinase receptor, MMP-1 and MMP-9 are markers to differentiate prognosis, adenoma and carcinoma in thyroid malignancies.The identification of high-risk patients with thyroid cancer and the preoperative differentiation between follicular adenoma and carcinoma remain clinically challenging. Our study was conducted to analyze whether the quantification of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) and transcription factor binding to the u-PAR promoter improve prognostic predictability and differential diagnosis of thyroid tumors. Tumor/normal tissue was collected from 69 prospectively followed patients with thyroid carcinomas (papillary, medullary, follicular and anaplastic, PTC, MTC, <e>FTC</e> and ATC) or follicular adenomas. U-PAR, MMP-1, MMP-7 and MMP-9 amounts were determined by ELISA, and transcription factor binding was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Binding of transcription factors to the u-PAR promoter was observed, but not associated with u-PAR expression. Carcinomas except MTC expressed significantly more u-PAR/MMPs than adenomas/normal tissues, this being associated with advanced pT- or M-stages. MMP-1 and MMP-9 were significantly higher in follicular carcinomas than in adenomas. In carcinomas, high u-PAR-gene expression correlated significantly with high MMP-9, the latter being associated with MMP-7 in normal tissues. Poor survival in differentiated tumors was associated in trend (p = 0.07); poor survival of all patients (p = 0.043) and especially of patients with carcinomas of follicular origin (including ATC), but not medullary carcinomas, were significantly associated with high u-PAR-protein (p = 0.015). Quantification of u-PAR is of prognostic relevance in thyroid carcinomas of non-c-cell origin, and u-PAR in part may be regulated nontranscriptionally in thyroid cancers. This is the first study to suggest MMP-1/-9 as significant differentiation markers between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma.",M2
19474675,"Follicular thyroid carcinoma in an iodine-replete endemic goiter region: a prospectively collected, retrospectively analyzed clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for presence of lymph node or distant metastases in patients with follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>) at the time of diagnosis and whether there is a relationship between the type of tumor invasion and metastases. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: FTC often presents distant metastases at the initial diagnosis. As distant metastases are independent prognostic factors in a patient's survival, determination of clinicopathologic characteristics for patients who are at higher risk for developing metastases is of greater clinical importance. METHODS: The prognostic significance of gender (male vs. female), age (&lt;or=40 years vs. &lt;40 years), tumor size (&lt;or=40 mm vs. &gt;40 mm), number of lesions (uni- vs. multifocality), type of invasion (minimally invasive vs. widely invasive), and oncocytic changes (with vs. without) were analyzed in 207 patients, according to presence of lymph node and distant metastases at the time of initial surgery. According to the type of invasion, the carcinoma-specific survival and the disease-free survival of minimally invasive (MI) and widely invasive (WI) FTC were estimated and compared. RESULTS: None of the 127 patients with MI growth presented with lymph node metastases but 9.4% distant metastases. Overall risk factors for the presence of lymph node metastases at the initial diagnosis were multifocality (P = 0.02) and widely invasion (P = 0.0001) and for distant metastases age &gt;45 years (P = 0.007), tumor size larger than 40 mm (P = 0.03) and widely invasion (P = 0.0001).WI-FTC patients show larger tumors (P = 0.0001), older age (P = 0.0001), and are presented more frequently in recurrent goiter disease (P = 0.0001). The estimated 10 years carcinoma-specific survival and disease-free survival for MI-tumors were significantly better than for WI-tumors (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy is recommended in all patients with FTC because of early distant metastases. Patients with WI-FTC need a more aggressive surgical treatment because of higher tendency for lymph node metastases. MI-FTC has an excellent prognosis with no sign of lymph node metastases, which emphasizes a limited need for nodal surgery.",M2

Few data are available with respect to the optimal management of patients with small follicular thyroid carcinomas. It was the aim to compare risk-profile and outcome of patients with small papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTC</e>) &lt;or=1 cm. PATIENTS, METHODS: 1594 patients with thyroid cancer were attended at our department between 1995 and 2006. For the subgroup of 383 patients with small PTC and FTC &lt;or=1 cm a comparative correlation of multifocality, extrathyroidal growth, lymph node spread, distant metastasis, local recurrence and survival was performed. Patients were monitored for a mean follow-up time of six years. RESULTS: A total of 361 patients had PTC and 22 FTC &lt;or=1 cm. At presentation the mean age of the 306 women and 77 men was 49 +/- 13 years. An ablative radioiodine therapy was performed in 77% and 100% of patients with small PTC and FTC, respectively. Multifocality (14% vs. 9%), extrathyroidal growth (10% vs. 5%), lymph node spread (14% vs. 5%), local recurrence (0.5% vs. 0%) and progressive disease (1% vs. 0%) were more common in patients with small PTC than FTC, whereas the corresponding values for distant metastasis were 2% vs. 5%, respectively; however, these figures did not reach statistical significance. Eight patients with papillary microcarcinomas died because of nonthyroidal diseases. CONCLUSION: Our data show no statistically significant differences in the risk-profile and outcome of patients with small PTC and FTC &lt;or=1 cm. Therefore, the decision for or against radioiodine ablation in patients with small differentiated thyroid carcinomas should be discussed individually.",M2

In vitro, six differentiated (FTC133, FTC236, HTC, HTC-TSHr, XTC, and TPC1) and three anaplastic (C643, Hth74, Kat4.0) TC cell lines were evaluated for basal as well as TSH (1-100 mU/ml) and EGF stimulated (1-100 ng/ml) endostatin. RESULTS: Endostatin was detected in all TC and more than half of the NT. Endostatin expression was more frequent and intense in differentiated as compared to anaplastic TC. In vitro, basal endostatin secretion varied between 33 +/- 5 pg/ml (FTC236) and 549 +/- 65 pg/ml (TPC1) and was doubled in <e>FTC</e>, when the  primary  (FTC133) was compared with the metastasis (FTC236). Some cell lines showed TSH-induced (e.g., 60% in XTC) or EGF-induced (e.g., 120% in TPC1) upregulation of endostatin secretion, while others did not, despite documented receptor expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates endostatin expression in TC, metastasis and--less frequently and intensely--in NT, suggesting a possible association to tumor progression. In vitro, endostatin secretion of some cell lines is regulated by TSH and EGF, however the individual differences deserve further functional studies. These results support rather tumor-specific than histotype-specific expression and regulation of endostatin in TC.",M2
18813971,"Risk factors for lateral cervical lymph node involvement in follicular thyroid carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Metastases from follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) are usually blood borne and far less to lymph nodes (LN). The present study was designed to evaluate the factors that are associated with LN metastases in patients operated on for FTC. METHODS: A retrospective review of 70 patients (25 men; mean age, 47 (range, 14-92) years) operated on between January 1995 and December 2005 for FTC was undertaken. All patients had histopathology study of the regional LN and postoperative radioiodine scintigraphy. According to LN invasion, they were divided into two groups in which various parameters were compared. RESULTS: The length of follow-up was 52 (range 17-108) months. A total of 375 LN were examined from ipsilateral neck side and 87 LN from the contralateral side. LN metastases were found in five (7%) cases: all ipsilateral. Comparing data from the patients with and without LN metastases, respectively, age was 60 and 47 years (p = 0.12), male/female ratio was 1/4 and 24/41 (p = 0.44), tumor size was 68 and 37 mm (p &lt; 0.01), tumor differentiation (well/moderate) was 3/2 and 25/19 (p = 0.89), distant metastases were detected in 1 and 8 cases (p = 0.72) .The tumor size was &gt;40 mm in 35 (50%) patients. All patients with LN metastases were found in this group (5/35; 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Follicular thyroid carcinoma results in metastases to regional lymph nodes in 7% of cases but only to the ipsilateral neck side. Tumor size is the only factor that impacts it. We do not recommend lymph node dissection in follicular thyroid carcinomas &lt;4 cm.",M2
18813801,"Gene-specific promoter hypermethylation without global hypomethylation in follicular thyroid cancer.Genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation at CpG promoters are common in cancer. To date, little is known about global methylation changes in follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>). Two independent quantitative methods, bisulphite Pyrosequencing of Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements-1 (LINE-1) and LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) were used to quantify genome-wide methylation in 21 FTC and corresponding normal thyroid tissues. Unexpectedly global methylation was not found significantly altered in tumors compared to normal thyroid by either LINE-1 (p=0.57) or LUMA (p=0.42), whilst the promoter of a tumor suppressor that is often epigenetically dysregulated, RASSF1A was found to be significantly hypermethylated by Pyrosequencing (p=0.0001). Moreover, allelic imbalance at the RASSF1A locus was observed in 15/21 of the tumors. mRNA expression of RASSF1A was significantly lower in tumors compared to corresponding normal tissues (p=0.0002). In summary, the epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A is a frequent event in FTC, but is not coupled to changes in global methylation.",M2
18774544,"CD147 expression as a significant prognostic factor in differentiated thyroid carcinoma.CD147 is 1 of the molecules involved in regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The goal of this study was to analyze the expression of CD147 in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) tissues as well as its association with the clinicopathologic features of DTC patients and its prognostic significance. During our research, CD147 expression in 156 patients who underwent operation for DTC [100 with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and 56 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>)] were examined by immunostaining on paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. Then, the association of CD147 expression with clinicopathologic characteristics and patients' prognosis was analyzed. As a result, CD147 was expressed in cancerous lesions but not in normal tissues. Overall, 55 of 156 (35.26%) cases showed low CD147-positive expression, 52 of 156 (33.33%) showed intermediate CD147-positive expression, and 49 of 156 (31.41%) showed high CD147-positive expression. Positive CD147 staining was associated significantly with various clinicopathologic features, such as extrathyroidal invasion (P = 0.02), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01), and depth of tumor invasion (P &lt; 0.01). Patients with low CD147 expression showed better survival rates than those with intermediate and high expression (90.91% for low expression, 82.69% for intermediate expression, and 65.31% in high expression, respectively; P &lt; 0.05 for analyses). Using Cox regression analysis of the 156 patients, high expression of CD147, extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, and the pathologic grading of tumor invasion seemed to be independent prognostic indicators (P &lt; 0.01, P = 0.02, P &lt; 0.01, and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Therefore, we conclude that the expression of CD147 may be useful to predict the prognosis of DTC patients.",M2
18727708,"Down-regulation of NR4A1 in follicular thyroid carcinomas is restored following lithium treatment.INTRODUCTION: The identification of follicular thyroid adenoma-associated transcripts will lead to a better understanding of the events involved in pathogenesis and progression of follicular tumours. Using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression, we identified five genes that are absent in a malignant follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) library, but expressed in follicular adenoma (FTA) and normal thyroid libraries. METHODS: NR4A1, one of the five genes, was validated in a set of 27 normal thyroid tissues, 10 FTAs and 14 FTCs and three thyroid carcinoma cell lines by real time PCR. NR4A1 can be transiently increased by a variety of stimuli, including lithium, which is used as adjuvant therapy of thyroid carcinoma with (131)I. We tested if lithium could restore NR4A1 expression. The expression of other genes potentially involved in the same signalling pathway was tested. To this end, lithium was used at different concentration (10 mm or 20 mm) and time (2 h and 24 h) and the level of expression was tested by quantitative PCR. We next tested if Lithium could affect cell growth and apoptosis. RESULTS: We observed that NR4A1 expression was under-expressed in most of the FTCs investigated, compared with expression in normal thyroid tissues and FTAs. We also found a positive correlation between NR4A1 and FOSB gene expression. Lithium induced NR4A1 and FOSB expression, reduced CCDN1 expression, inhibited cell growth and triggered apoptosis in a FTC cell line. CONCLUSIONS: NR4A1 is under-expressed in most of FTCs. The loss of expression of both NR4A1 and the Wnt pathway gene FOSB was correlated with malignancy. This is consistent with the hypothesis that its loss of expression is part of the transformation process of FTCs, either as a direct or indirect consequence of Wnt pathway alterations. Lithium restores NR4A1 expression, induces apoptosis and reduces cell growth. These findings may explain a possible molecular mechanism of lithium's therapeutic action.",M2
18694518,"Multiple giant scalp metastases of a follicular thyroid carcinoma.BACKGROUND: The occurrence of skin metastases are rare events in the course of a follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and usually indicate advanced tumor stages. The scalp is the most affected area of these metastases. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 76 year old Woman with multiple giant scalp metastases of a follicular carcinoma. These metastases had been resected and wounds had been closed with mesh graft. The 14-months follow up is presented. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate another case with multicentric form. Because of its location and size a primary wound closure was not possible. A healing could be reached using vacuum therapy and mesh graft transplantation.",M2
18559722,"Immunohistochemical distinction of follicular thyroid adenomas and follicular carcinomas.OBJECTIVES: To use immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of proteins encoded by genes that were differentially expressed in follicular thyroid adenomas (FAs) vs follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTCs</e>) to distinguish benign vs malignant follicular thyroid lesions. Multiple gene microarray studies suggest that benign and malignant follicular thyroid neoplasms have different gene expression profiles. DESIGN: Immunohistochemical analysis of thyroid neoplasms, including FA (n = 62), FTC (n = 62), and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (n = 58), using tissue microarrays. We evaluated antibodies galectin-3, autotaxin, intestinal trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153). We analyzed data for quantitative differences in IHC intensity and the percentage of positive cells between FAs and combined follicular carcinomas. Sensitivity and specificity analysis are reported, along with a dual-protein clinical algorithm. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Adults with known follicular and papillary thyroid lesions that were surgically resected during the past 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of individual and combined antibodies for detecting benign from malignant lesions. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis showed IHC validation of the gene expression differences noted in previously published microarray reports. A significantly higher percentage of FTC cells stained with galectin-3, EMMPRIN, and GADD153. Galectin-3 and EMMPRIN also showed a significantly higher intensity of staining in FTC cells. Compared with malignant lesions, TFF3 stained a greater cell percentage in FAs. Galectin-3 (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.62) and EMMPRIN (sensitivity, 0.63; specificity, 0.49) had the most promising diagnostic potential with a dual-protein sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.70. Autotaxin and GADD153 had overall higher sensitivities (0.88 and 0.82, respectively) but very poor specificities (0.02 and 0.21, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Protein expression data validate the pooled gene expression results that differentiate FTC from FA. Our results show promise for multiple-protein IHC analysis algorithms and their diagnostic ability. Future studies should focus on clinical translation of these molecular differences for the diagnosis of follicular thyroid neoplasms.",M2
18497954,"The cellular localization of autotaxin impacts on its biological functions in human thyroid carcinoma cells.Autotaxin (ATX/NPP2) shows a nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase and lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity and is a member of a family of structurally-related mammalian ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphate/phosphodiesterases (E-NPP1-3). ATX is unique among E-NPP as it is secreted and not membrane-bound as are NPP1 and -3. The ATX gene activity is significantly higher in undifferentiated anaplastic (UTC) as compared to follicular (<e>FTC</e>) and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) or goiter tissues. ATX also enhances the motility of thyroid tumor cells. We bio-engineered stable transfectants of the human thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-238 expressing either bioactively-secreted (sATX) or membrane-anchored ATX (mATX) to identify the biological functions of ATX which critically depend on the E-NPP member being secreted and provide insight into the effects of high local ATX concentrations and cellular responses. An increased cell motility was exclusively observed with FTC-238 sATX transfectants, whereas membrane-anchored ATX appeared to impair motility. We identified IL-1beta as an upstream suppressor of ATX expression in FTC-238, ATX-mediated motility in FTC-238 and stable transfectants, with IL-1beta having the strongest motility-suppressive effect on FTC-238 sATX clones. sATX and mATX strongly increased the anchorage-independent colony formation of FTC-238 but the size and number of colonies formed in the soft agar were significantly smaller in FTC-238 mATX versus the FTC-238 sATX clones. The cancer-testis antigen BAGE was identified as a novel target gene of ATX in FTC-238. Transcript levels for BAGE were 6-fold higher in FTC-238 mATX versus sATX clones. Increased BAGE transcript levels were also detected in tissues of patients with UTC versus FTC, PTC or goiter tissues. In summary, enhanced tumor cell motility and tumorigenic capacity critically depended on sATX in thyroid carcinoma cells. Irrespective of its compartmentalization, the cancer-testis antigen BAGE was identified as a novel target gene of ATX in FTC-238 and a potential new tissue marker in UTC tissues, which we had previously shown to express high levels of ATX.",M2
18418222,"Sustained clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in thyroid carcinoma.The limited therapeutic options available for patients with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTC</e>) necessitates the development of novel therapies. Identification of somatic rearrangements of the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene in PTC have improved our understanding of thyroid tumorigenesis. Sunitinib is active against the RET kinase and has both antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. Its role in the treatment of patients with thyroid carcinoma has yet to be evaluated in clinical trials. Two patients with progressive metastatic thyroid carcinoma (case 1: PTC, and case 2: FTC) were enroled in a phase I clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography (PET) in the monitoring of response to sunitinib. Tumour biopsies and PET were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after the commencement of sunitinib. Activation of the RET kinase pathway was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis of total phosphorylated tyrosine and downstream signalling targets of the RET pathway. Both patients demonstrated sustained clinical responses to sunitinib over a duration of 4 years. In case 1, (PTC) PET confirmed evidence of a partial metabolic response, and IHC and western blot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the RET kinase pathway posttreatment. In case 2, (FTC) PET confirmed stable disease after sunitinib. IHC staining of the tumour showed low total phosphorylated tyrosine staining at baseline which did not change after treatment. These case studies highlight potential activity of sunitinib in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Sunitinib seems to be a promising agent in the treatment of thyroid cancers and this requires validation in future clinical trials.",M2
18317715,"[Lymph node dissection in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer]BACKGROUND: There is still unresolved debate about the optimal surgical management of papillary (PTC) and follicular (<e>FTC</e>) thyroid cancer regarding lymph node dissection. So far the German guidelines recommend the same extent of surgery for both tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is based on 626 patients with PTC and 191 with FTC from a group of 1062 own patients with thyroid malignancies. The extent of surgery, tumor size, and pN status were analysed. The results were compared with those in the current literature. RESULTS: Tumors &lt; or = 20 mm in size were found significantly more often in PTC than FTC (69.6% vs 28.3%, P&lt;0.05). Positive lymph nodes were found significantly more often in PTC than FTC as well (33.2% vs 5.2%, P&lt;0.05). In PTC up to 10 mm and from 11 mm to 20 mm in size, 16% and 34.4% of patients, respectively, showed positive lymph nodes. In FTC positive lymph nodes occurred only in tumors &gt;25 mm. CONCLUSION: Due to prevalence and importance of lymph node metastasis differing between PTC and FTC, we recommend treating both tumor entities differently. For PTC a more extended lymph dissection is necessary, even in tumors &lt; or = 20 mm. In small FTC it seems adequate to limit the operation to thyroidectomy without prophylactic lymph dissection.",M2
18316623,"Discovery and validation of protein abundance differences between follicular thyroid neoplasms.Distinguishing between benign follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) and malignant follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) by cytologic features alone is not possible. Molecular markers may aid distinguishing FTA from FTC in patients with indeterminate cytology. The aim of this study is to define protein abundance differences between FTC from FTA through a discovery (proteomics) and validation (immunohistochemistry) approach. Difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting were performed on protein extracts from five patients with FTC and compared with six patients with FTA. Individual gel comparisons (i.e., each FTC extract versus FTA pool) were also performed for the five FTC patients. Immunohistochemical validation studies were performed on three of the identified proteins. Based on DIGE images, 680 protein spots were matched on individual gels. Of these, 102 spots showed statistically significant differences in abundance between FTC and FTA in the individual gel analyses and were therefore studied further. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify 54 of these protein spots. Three candidates involved in protein folding (heat shock protein gp96, protein disulfide isomerase A3, and calreticulin) were studied by immunohistochemistry. Moderate calreticulin immunohistochemical staining was the best single marker with a high negative predictive value (88%); combining all three markers (any marker less than moderate staining) had the best positive predictive value (75%) while still retaining a good negative predictive value (68%). With DIGE, we identified 54 proteins differentially abundant between FTC and FTA. Three of these were validated by immunohistochemistry. These findings provide further insights into the diagnosis, prognosis, and pathophysiology of follicular-derived thyroid neoplasms.",M2
18306168,"Frizzled-1 is down-regulated in follicular thyroid tumours and modulates growth and invasiveness.The mechanisms of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) transformation and progression are not well understood. Previously, we detected LOH at 7q21 in all FTCs examined, indicating that loss of genetic material in that region is a common trait in these lesions. To analyse the effects of LOH on gene expression, we performed an analysis of the mRNA expression levels of six different genes, located at 7q21.1-7q21.3. A total of 23 lesions, including eight follicular hyperplasias (FHs), eight follicular adenomas (FAs), two FTCs and five papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) were analysed. The Frizzled-1 (FZD-1) gene, located at 7q21.13, showed the lowest levels of mRNA expression. Down-regulation of FZD-1 expression was also confirmed in an independent series of 69 follicular neoplastic lesions compared to 25 PTCs, analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. In vitro studies showed that FZD-1 expression was also markedly reduced at both protein and mRNA levels in three FTC-derived cell lines (FRO, WRO and FTC-133), while it was normal in the three PTC-derived cell lines (Ca300, Ca301 and K1) examined. We demonstrated that over-expression of FZD-1 in 3 FTC-derived cells decreased invasiveness and proliferation rate, indicating a possible pathogenetic role. In addition, FZD-1 RNA interference in the PTC-derived cell line K1 increased invasiveness. Our data indicated that FZD-1 is involved in growth of follicular tumours and may be considered as a novel marker of this type of tumour.",M2
18279615,"[Operation strategy for follicular thyroid carcinoma]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: The operation strategies for follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), a kind of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, are controversial. This study was to summarize the prognosis of FTC patients after operation, and explore the optimal operation pattern. METHODS: Clinical data of 176 FTC patients who underwent operation at Cancer Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from Jan. 1956 to Dec. 2004 were analyzed. Of the 176 patients, 21 underwent total thyroidectomy, 155 underwent partial thyroidectomy. RESULTS: The overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 88.9%, 82.4%, and 79.0%. Lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and pathologic type (widely invasive follicular carcinoma, WIFTC/minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, MIFTC) had significant influences on the prognosis (P&lt;0.01). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 85.7%, 80.9%, and 80.9% in total thyroidectomy group and 89.0%, 83.2%, and 78.1% in partial thyroidectomy group (P&gt;0.05). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrence rates were significantly higher in total thyroidectomy group than in partial thyroidectomy group (0 vs. 3.2%, 4.8% vs. 6.4%, 4.8% vs. 7.7%, P&lt;0.05). The overall lymph node metastasis rate was 11.9%. The occult metastasis rate in 21 stage cN0 patients was 19.0%. Among 21 cases of lymph node metastasis, 16 (76.2%) were located in region VI. The lymph node metastasis rate was significantly higher in WIFTC group than in MIFTC group (21.1% vs. 5.7%, P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest total thyroidectomy for the patients with WIFTC or distant metastasis, and unilateral lobectomy and isthmectomy for the patients with MIFTC. Neck dissection is not necessary for stage cN0 patients, but routine follow-up is necessary for WIFTC patients.",M2

18235983,"Follicular histotypes of oncocytic thyroid carcinomas do not carry mutations of the BRAF hot-spot.BACKGROUND: The BRAF V600E mutation is the most prevalent genetic aberration in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and it is found exclusively in RET/PTC-negative tumors. In oncocytic (Hürthle cell, oxyphilic) thyroid tumors, the presence of RET/PTC rearrangements is associated with either the conventional papillary histotype or the  solid  Hürthle cell tumors, whereas all predominantly follicular oncocytic carcinomas do not harbor RET/PTC chimeras. Although 12% of tumors of the follicular variant of PTC carry BRAF mutations, none of the few oncocytic follicular thyroid adenomas (oncoAd) or carcinomas (oncoFTC) published worldwide tested positive. An aspired molecular-based classification of oncocytic thyroid tumors is in need of additional evidence on BRAF mutations in the follicular histotype. METHODS: A series of 44 oncocytic thyroid tumors with well-documented clinicopathological data was subjected to BRAF mutation analysis (complete exon 15) by automated sequencing. RESULTS: The series of oncocytic thyroid tumors consisted of 21 adenomas (oncoAds: 17 females, 4 males; mean age, 54.5 years; range, 27-80 years), 20 follicular carcinomas (oncoFTCs: 14 females, 6 males; mean age, 61.4 years; range, 39-80 years), and 3  classic  papillary carcinomas (oncoPTCs: 3 females; mean age, 58.1 years; range, 46-70 years; 3x T2 tumors). The follicular variants of oncocytic cancers are divided into 11x T2, 5x T3, and 4x T4 tumor stages (International Union Against Cancer [UICC] TNM 5th edition). None of the 44 neoplasms of the presented series demonstrated genetic alterations in the BRAF hot-spot region (exon 15, codons 599-601). Congruently, 0/10 oncoAd and 0/20 oncoFTC described in the literature so far carried BRAF V600E mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the evidence that, in contrast to follicular variants of oncoPTCs, predominantly follicular oncocytic thyroid tumors harbor neither RET/PTC rearrangements nor BRAF mutations. Furthermore, the findings support the concept that oncocytic neoplasms of the thyroid gland are oncocytic counterparts of the respective histotype (adenoma, <e>FTC</e>, PTC, or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) rather than a separate tumor entity. Molecular characterization of oncocytic thyroid malignancies for RET/PTC or BRAF genetic alterations may help with (preoperative) classification and prognostic evaluation of these tumors.",M2
18064485,"Serum levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in thyroid cancer patients.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that cytokines and their antagonists are important in the pathogenesis of various malignancies. While there are several reports on interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene polymorphism and tissue expression, there is only little data available on the impact of IL-1ra serum levels. Therefore, we performed a prospective study, analyzing IL-1ra in thyroid cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured preoperative IL-1ra serum levels of 52 consecutive patients with thyroid cancer, 15 with benign adenoma and 27 healthy volunteers. The final histological diagnosis revealed 21 patients with papillary and 8 patients with follicular carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), while 12 cases of medullary and 11 cases of anaplastic carcinoma (ATC) were observed. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, serum concentrations of IL-1ra were significantly higher in ATC and FTC patients. Concerning gender differences, this effect reached significance only in women with ATC and FTC. Except for the stage IV disease in ATC, there was no correlation between IL-1ra levels and International Union Against Cancer staging. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study indicate that IL-1ra may play an important role in the development of ATC and FTC. Future efforts should focus on the possible application of IL-1ra as a biomarker for the above-mentioned thyroid malignancies.",M2
18018567,"[Strategy for the surgical treatment of the well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in our hospital]Well differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) consists of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). Although both cancers are excellent prognosis, there are different in carcinogenesis by some genes, criteria of pathological diagnosis and transforming pattern between PTC and FTC. So the strategy for surgical treatment of them should be discussed separately. The patient with PTC less than 45 years old whose tumor is localized in a unilateral lobe without extra thyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis should be performed a unilateral lobectomy with central node dissection (D1). PTC patient over 45 years old except micro PTC case (T1a N0, M0) is recommended total thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection (D2 or D3). Encapsulated FTC is not necessary prophylactic lymph node dissection and only preformed unilateral lobectomy.

17911173,"Lack of mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha and beta genes but frequent hypermethylation of the TRbeta gene in differentiated thyroid tumors.CONTEXT: It remains inconclusive whether mutations in thyroid hormone receptor (TR) genes naturally occur in thyroid cancer and whether these genes could be suppressors of this cancer. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine further mutations of TRalpha and TRbeta genes in thyroid cancer and also to examine their methylation as an epigenetic silencing mechanism in thyroid cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Instead of using a cDNA sequencing approach used in previous studies, we used genomic DNA to sequence directly the coding regions of the TRalpha and TRbeta genes to search mutations in various differentiated thyroid tumors and used methylation-specific PCR to analyze promoter methylation of these genes. Allelic zygosity status at TRbeta was also analyzed. RESULTS: We found no TRalpha gene mutation in 17 papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) and 11 follicular thyroid cancers (<e>FTCs</e>), and no TRbeta gene mutation in 16 PTCs and 12 FTCs. We also found no methylation of the TRalpha gene in 33 PTCs, 31 FTCs, 20 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs), and 10 thyroid tumor cell lines. In contrast, we found hypermethylation of the TRbeta gene in 10 of 29 (34%) PTCs, 22 of 27 (81%) FTCs, five of 20 (25%) follicular thyroid adenomas, and three of 10 (30%) thyroid tumor cell lines, with the highest prevalence in FTC. We additionally examined loss of heterozygosity at TRbeta and found it in three of nine (33%) PTCs and three of nine (33%) FTCs. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation is not common in TR genes, whereas hypermethylation of the TRbeta gene as an alternative gene silencing mechanism is highly prevalent in thyroid cancer, particularly FTC, consistent with a possible tumor suppressor role of this gene for FTC.",M2
17653791,"Distribution of Na+/I- symporter in thyroid cancers in an iodine-deficient population: an immunohistochemical study.BACKGROUND: There are significant differences in the prevalence and behavior of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) in the iodine-deficient areas (IDA) and iodine-sufficient areas (ISA) of the world. The sodium iodide symporter (NIS), mediates active transport of iodide across the basolateral aspect of the thyroid follicular cell. However, no study had specifically addressed the issue of expression of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in thyroid cancer specimens from IDA. The aim of the present study was to find an expression pattern of NIS in DTC in an iodine-deficient population, and to correlate it with histological subtypes, i.e., papillary carcinoma (PTC), follicular carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDTC), as well as with clinicopathological risk factors and iodine ((131)I) uptake by distant metastases. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 39 cases of thyroid cancer (41 samples) including PTC (15), FTC (10), PDTC (9), anaplastic cancer (5), and resected metastases (2). Expression was correlated with the patient's age, sex, tumor size, presence or absence of extrathyroidal invasion, distant and lymph node metastases, and whole body radioiodine scan. RESULTS: Overall, 61.8% of DTC patients showed NIS expression. There was no significant difference in expression rate between PTC (73.3%) and FTC (70.0%). However, expression was significantly less in PDTC (33.3%). There was no correlation between NIS expression and any clinicopathological risk factor (p &gt; .05). The results of NIS expression were not concordant with (131)I uptake by metastases in 4 of 10 cases. (131)I uptake was absent in one case despite the finding that a metastatic site itself showed NIS expression in that case, whereas in the remaining 9 cases (131)I uptake was present although three cases did not show NIS expression. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, overall expression of NIS was comparable to other studies from ISA. We conclude that expression may not accurately predict radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake by metastases.",M2

The expression levels of 26 potential markers of malignancy were determined in a panel of 75 follicular thyroid tumors by a TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR approach. Logistic regression analysis (LRA) was used for gene selection and generation of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms. An algorithm based on the expression levels of five genes (TERT, TFF3, PPARgamma, CITED1, and EGR2) could effectively predict high-risk disease with a specificity of 98.5%. The metastatic potential could be predicted in all four cases with apparently benign or minimally invasive (MI) disease at the time of diagnosis, but poor long-term outcome. In addition, a second model was produced by implementing two genes (TERT and TFF3), which was able to distinguish adenomas from de facto carcinomas. When this model was tested in an independent series of atypical adenomas (AFTA) and MI-FTCs, 16 out of 17 AFTAs were classified as 'benign', while MI-FTCs with vascular invasion (sometimes referred to as 'moderately invasive') and/or large tumor size tended to classify in the 'malignant' group. The reported models can be the foundation for the development of reliable preoperative diagnostic and prognostic tests that can guide the therapeutic approach of follicular thyroid neoplasms with indeterminate cytology.",M2
17638058,"Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid arising more often from follicular carcinoma than papillary carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a rare and highly malignant tumor, has long been thought to arise from well-differentiated carcinoma (WDC) such as follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The purpose of this study was to test this notion by examining whether and, if so, how often ATC harbors the oncogenes that are commonly associated with WDC, such as RAS in FTC and BRAF in PTC. METHODS: We analyzed the mutation hotspots of BRAF (codon 600) and N-, K-, and H-RAS (codons 12, 13, and 61) in 16 ATCs. We also examined two genes, PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) and TP53 (exons 5-9), both of which have been reported in ATCs. RESULTS: The results showed that approximately 31% (5 of 16) of ATCs harbored N-RAS mutation, 6% (1 of 16) had mutated BRAF, and approximately 56% (9 of 16) had mutated TP53. As to the three ATCs that had coexisted PTCs, mutated BRAF was detected in all PTC components but only in one ATC, while mutated PIK3CA was found in only one PTC component but not in the ATC. CONCLUSION: A number of ATCs arise from WDCs, more often from RAS-mutant tumors than from BRAF-mutant tumors, implying that particular attention should be paid to the WDC harboring RAS mutation.",M2
17521005,"Significance of tumor capsular invasion in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas.This study examines the influence of tumor capsular invasion on the biological behavior of papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and the prognosis of surgically treated patients. This retrospective cohort study included 350 cases of PTC or FTC from a university teaching hospital. Patient charts were randomly selected and reviewed. The study population was divided into PTC and FTC groups. Each group was subdivided into CI+ (with tumor capsular invasion) and CI- subgroups (without tumor capsule or without capsular invasion). The long-term prognosis was assessed using the American Joint Committee on Cancer pTNM staging and the prognostic index was elaborated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. There were 284 women and 66 men (ages 19-89 years, mean of 44) with an incidence of 53.1 per cent for CI+ tumors. There were no significant differences between the PTC subgroups regarding the short-term clinical outcome and the long-term prognosis. Although patients with CI+ FTC showed lower incidence of lymph node metastasis than patients with CI- FTC, the FTC subgroups were comparable regarding the short-term clinical outcome and the long-term prognosis. Our results suggest that presence of tumor capsular invasion does not adversely influence biological behavior or survival of PTC or FTC. Moreover, the presence of tumor capsular invasion appears to not have significance for the long-term prognosis of patients with PTC or FTC.",M2
17426084,"High prevalence and mutual exclusivity of genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/akt pathway in thyroid tumors.CONTEXT: Genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and their role in thyroid tumor pathogenesis in Chinese people remain undefined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the major genetic alterations and their relationship in the PI3K/Akt pathway in differentiated thyroid tumors in a Chinese cohort. DESIGN: We used real-time quantitative PCR for the analysis of PIK3CA copy gain and direct DNA sequencing for the detection of PIK3CA, RAS, and PTEN mutations on genomic DNA isolated from 234 thyroid tumors, including 31 follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>), 141 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and 62 follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA). RESULTS: We found PIK3CA copy gain (defined as four or more copies) in nine of 31 FTC (29%), 20 of 141 PTC (14%), and five of 62 FTA (8%); PIK3CA gene mutations in four of 31 FTC (13%), one of 141 PTC (1%), and none of 62 FTA (0%); Ras mutations in three of 31 FTC (10%) and none of the 141 PTC and 62 FTA; and PTEN mutations in two of 31 FTC (6%) and none of 62 FTA (0%). Collectively, nine of 31 FTC (29%) vs. none of 62 FTA (0%) (P &lt; 0.01) harbored one of the mutations, and when PIK3CA copy gain was included, 16 of 31 FTC (52%) vs. five of 62 FTA (8%) (P &lt; 0.01) harbored any genetic alteration in the PI3K/Akt pathway. Mutual exclusivity was seen among all these PI3K/Akt pathway-related genetic alterations in all thyroid tumors except for two cases that harbored two genetic alterations. CONCLUSION: These data from a Chinese cohort provide further genetic evidence suggesting that dysregulated PI3K/Akt pathway plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of thyroid tumors, particularly FTC.",M2
17387744,"Clinicopathologic features and BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis in cutaneous metastases from well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas.BACKGROUND: Cutaneous metastases from well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas are rare and are usually identified in patients with widely disseminated disease. Occasionally, thyroid carcinomas can present as cutaneous metastases for which the primary site needs to be determined. Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) commonly have BRAF(V600E) mutation. A series of 16 cutaneous metastases were analyzed from well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas to learn more about the clinicopathologic features and BRAF(V600E) mutation status. METHODS: Eleven cases of PTC and 5 of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) metastatic to the skin were evaluated. All cutaneous metastases were studied histologically and with thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor immunostains. All tumor samples were analyzed for mutations at nucleotide 1799 in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. RESULTS: Two patients with FTC presented with cutaneous metastases. Fourteen of 16 patients died of disease and 2 were alive with disease at follow-up. The histologic features of the cutaneous metastases were generally characteristic of the primary tumor; however, 2 of the 11 PTC metastases demonstrated cytoplasmic clearing not typical of classic PTC. BRAF(V600E) mutation (T1799A) was detected in 5 of 11 cases of PTC and in none of the 5 FTCs. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous metastases from PTC may show prominent clear cell change requiring differentiation from clear cell hidradenoma, clear cell dermatofibroma, malignant melanoma with prominent clear cell change, and cutaneous metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. BRAF(V600E) mutation is identified in a subset of cutaneous metastases from PTC. Cutaneous metastases from PTC and FTC are associated with a very poor prognosis.",M2
17171498,"Mitochondrial DNA mutations in differentiated thyroid cancer with respect to the age factor.INTRODUCTION: Increased numbers of mitochondria in differentiated thyroid cancer and, most strikingly, mutations in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in older people have led to speculation that mtDNA mutations might contribute to aging or accumulate in postmitotic tissues with age. Mutation analyses of mtDNA in papillary (PTCs) and follicular (<e>FTCs</e>) thyroid carcinomas have been limited to date. The significance and frequency of mtDNA mutations in PTC and FTC are therefore controversial, as is age dependence. METHODS: We analyzed eight sample pairs of PTC and six of FTC tissue with the corresponding normal thyroid tissue. DNA was extracted from frozen and formaldehyde-fixed tissue using the QIAmp Tissue Kit. Sequence differences in the mtDNA between tumor and normal tissue were detected using appropriate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products for heteroduplex analysis in a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Wave System (Transgenomic). Mutations were confirmed and identified by sequencing the PCR products of conspicuous chromatograms. The samples were obtained from 346 patients with PTC and 105 patients with FTC. We analyzed the whole mitochondrial genome from seven PTC and three FTC tumors along with the corresponding normal thyroid tissue. 3/7 PTC samples showed two heteroplasmic mutations and one polymorphism; all 3 FTCs showed homoplasmic and/or heteroplasmic mutations. RESULTS: All but one of these tumors are well documented in the mitochondrial database MITOMAP. MtDNA mutations were found in all three patients aged 45 years and older. There was no correlation, however, in this small group to clinical prognostic factors for recurrence and especially for survival in differentiated thyroid carcinomas, such as histology, tumor size, lymph node metastases, distant metastases, and gender, most likely because of the short follow-up. While univariate analysis of the findings in the whole cohort of 346 patients with PTC suggested that age is a significant prognostic factor for survival (P = 0.0237) but not for recurrence (P = 0.65), this was not the case in the 105 patients with FTC. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found accumulation of mutations in two older patients with PTC and one patient with FTC (all three patients older than 45 years had mtDNA mutations), the low frequency of these mutations in the small group of 10 analyzed patients did not correlate with statistically validated clinical prognosticators for recurrence or survival, especially not with age. The low power of our data are therefore not able to support or refute the hypothesis that these mtDNA mutations are related to age-dependent tumor progression in the thyroid or that they  may be involved in thyroid tumorigenesis.

17103065,"Prognostic factors in papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma: their implications for cancer staging.BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) are two distinct histological types of thyroid carcinoma but have often been studied and staged as a collective group, known as differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). However, this may not be an optimal approach to cancer staging. METHODS: A total of 760 patients with DTC, comprising 589 (77.5%) with PTC and 171 with (22.5%) FTC, being managed at our institution from 1961 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Their clinicopathological features, treatment modalities received, and postoperative outcome were analyzed. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors related to cancer-specific survival (CSS) for PTC and FTC. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between PTC and FTC in terms of age &gt;/=50 years at diagnosis (P = .040), tumor size (P &lt; .001), lymph node metastases (P &lt; .001), distant metastases (P &lt; .001), extrathyroidal extension (P &lt; .001), multifocality (P = .002), capsular invasion (P &lt; .001), extent of thyroid resection (P &lt; .001), radioiodine ablation (P &lt; .001), and external-beam irradiation (P = .003). Although PTC and FTC had similar 10-year and 15-year CSS (P = .846), each possessed its own set of independent prognostic factors for CSS. Age at diagnosis and completeness of resection were independent prognostic factors in both PTC and FTC. CONCLUSIONS: There were marked differences in clinicopathologic features, treatment, and prognostic factors between the two histologic types of DTC. Different staging systems should be evaluated and validated for PTC and FTC individually in the future.",M2
17054470,"Detection of BRAFV600E mutation on fine needle aspiration specimens of thyroid nodule refines cyto-pathology diagnosis, especially in BRAF600E mutation-prevalent area.BACKGROUND: Between 10 and 30% of the fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of thyroid nodules are diagnosed as 'indeterminate'. A molecular diagnostic method is needed to reduce unnecessary surgery in this group. In Korea, most thyroid cancer is the classic papillary type and the BRAF(V600E) mutation is highly prevalent. AIM: To evaluate the role of pre-operative detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation in the FNAB specimens of thyroid nodules in a BRAF(V600E) mutation-prevalent geographical area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 137 specimens of FNAB (107 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC); 3 follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTC</e>); 2 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas; 25 benign lesions), both direct DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP were used for detecting the BRAF(V600E) mutation. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated. We analysed the association between BRAF(V600E) mutation and the clinico-pathological parameters. RESULTS: The BRAF(V600E) mutation was present in 93 (83%) of 112 thyroid cancers. Direct DNA sequencing showed a sensitivity of 83.0% and a specificity of 96.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR-RFLP were 78.6% and 80.0%, respectively. Among 25 cases with indeterminate FNAB cytology, 8 patients had malignant lesions (5 PTC and 3 FTC). Three (60%) of 5 PTCs and 1 out of 17 benign lesions had BRAF(V600E) mutation (only one false positive case and the definitive pathology showed atypical nodular hyperplasia that could be a premalignant lesion). The diagnostic accuracy of this molecular method in only the 25 indeterminate nodules was 76% (19/25). No mutation was found in 3 FTCs. Among 107 PTCs, there was no significant association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation with the known risk factors. CONCLUSION: Detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in FNAB specimens refines the FNAB-cytology diagnosis, especially in a BRAF(V600E) mutation-prevalent area. Direct DNA sequencing was a more reliable method than PCR-RFLP for detecting the BRAF(V600E) mutation with a high sensitivity and specificity.",M2
16943578,"Antisense p53 decreases production of VEGF in follicular thyroid cancer cells.Inactivating mutations of wild-type p53 (WTp53) tumor suppressor gene are common in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and are associated with poor prognosis. Mutated p53 (MTp53) has been implicated with angiogenesis. Therefore, the potential of MTp53 knockout by oligodeoxyribonucleotide phosphorothioates (ODNs) to affect VEGF production of undifferentiated thyroid cancer cells with a recessive MTp53 mutation was evaluated. Transient transfection with 20 bp ODNs complementary to portions of exon 10 of p53 and a negative control ODN (HIV-RT) were carried out in <e>FTC</e>-133 cells. In vitro secretion of VEGF protein was quantified by EIA and correlated to cell numbers, which was evaluated by in vitro MTT assay. Transfection of undifferentiated thyroid cancer cells with ODN reduced VEGF secretion of FTC-133 cells following transfection by 34% as compared to the negative control (cells transfected with ODN-HIV; p = 0.03). These results suggest that transient MTp53 knockout with ODNs complementary to p53 nucleotide sequences impair secretion of VEGF in the undifferentiated thyroid cancer cell line FTC-133.",M2
16900519,"Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a clinicopathologic study of a problematic entity.BACKGROUND: There is continuous debate regarding the optimal classification, prognosis, and treatment of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC). The objective of this study was to assess the behavior of FVPTC, especially its encapsulated form, and shed more light on its true position in the classification scheme of well differentiated thyroid carcinoma. METHODS: All patients with FVPTC, follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA), and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) who were diagnosed between 1980 and 1995 were reviewed and reclassified according to the currently accepted definition of FVPTC. The tumors were separated into encapsulated and nonencapsulated (infiltrative/diffuse) types. Encapsulated tumors were subdivided further into tumors with or without capsular/vascular invasion. These different subtypes of FVPTC were correlated with outcome and with other clinicopathologic parameters. RESULTS: After review by 4 pathologists, 78 patients were included in the study. Sixty-one of 78 patients (78%) had encapsulated tumors (18 invasive, 43 noninvasive), and 17 patients had nonencapsulated tumors (infiltrative/diffuse). The gender distribution, age at presentation, and tumor size did not differ between patients with encapsulated and nonencapsulated FVPTC. Patients who had encapsulated FVPTC had a significantly lower rate of marked intratumor fibrosis (18%), extrathyroid extension (5%), and positive margins (2%) compared with patients who had nonencapsulated tumors (88%, 65%, and 50% respectively; P &lt; .0001). Regional lymph node metastases were present in 14 of 78 patients (18%), and no patients had distant metastases. The lymph node metastatic rate was significantly higher in patients who had nonencapsulated tumors (11 of 17 patients; 65%) compared with patients who had encapsulated neoplasms (3 of 61 patients; 5%; P &lt; .0001). In addition, lymph node metastases were not detected in any noninvasive, encapsulated FVPTCs. With a median follow-up of 10.8 years, only 1 patient developed a recurrence, which occurred in an encapsulated FVPTC that had numerous invasive foci. None of the patients with noninvasive, encapsulated FVPTCs developed recurrences, including 31 patients who underwent lobectomy alone, with a median follow-up of 11.1 years. CONCLUSIONS: FVPTC appeared to be a heterogeneous disease composed of 2 distinct groups: an infiltrative/diffuse (nonencapsulated) subvariant, which resembles classic papillary carcinoma in its metastatic lymph node pattern and invasive growth, and an encapsulated form, which behaves more like FTA/FTC. Patients who had noninvasive, encapsulated FVPTCs did not develop lymph node metastases or recurrences and could be treated by lobectomy alone. If the current findings are confirmed, then strong consideration should be given to reclassifying encapsulated FVPTC as an entity that is close to the FTA/FTC class of tumors.",M2
16822819,"A limited set of human MicroRNA is deregulated in follicular thyroid carcinoma.CONTEXT: Although the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and its relation to follicular adenoma (FA) remains unclear, detailed understanding of FTC carcinogenesis would facilitate addressing the scientific and clinical challenges, given that there are morphological and molecular similarities between FTC and the frequently occurring FA. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small, noncoding RNAs implicated in development and cancer and may lend novel clues to FTC genesis. For the latter process, a deregulated miRNA can orchestrate the aberrant expression of several hundred target genes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify deregulated miRNAs in FTC. DESIGN: We used two high-density expression arrays to identify miRNAs and their target genes that are differentially expressed between FTC and FA. Validation was done by quantitative RT-PCR. We further functionally characterized the effect of deregulated miRNAs in vitro using HEK293T, FTC133, and K5 cell lines. PATIENTS: In total, 45 primary thyroid samples (23 FTC, 20 FA, four normal control thyroid) were analyzed. RESULTS: Two specific miRNAs, miR-197 and miR-346, were significantly overexpressed in FTC. In vitro overexpression of either miRNA induced proliferation, whereas inhibition led to growth arrest. Overexpression of miR-197 and miR-346 repressed the expression of their predicted target genes in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that miR-197 and miR-346 contribute to FTC carcinogenesis. Both miRNAs and their target genes might potentially provide for novel molecular markers and act as novel targets for treatment by interference, which could potentially normalize the deregulated profile of many downstream target genes.",M2
16740767,"Dual epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition with NVP-AEE788 for the treatment of aggressive follicular thyroid cancer.PURPOSE: Patients with radioiodine-resistant follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>) have a poor prognosis, if metastasized, with currently available treatment modalities. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their receptors (EGFR and VEGFR) have been reported to be overexpressed in FTC and have been implicated in FTC development. We hypothesized that inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR and VEGFR by treatment with NVP-AEE788 (AEE788), a novel dual specific EGFR and VEGFR inhibitor, either alone or in combination with paclitaxel, would inhibit the growth of FTC xenografts in an orthotopic nude mouse model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To confirm previous reports, EGF and EGFR expression and vascularity were analyzed in human samples of FTC, Hürthle cell carcinoma, and normal thyroid tissues. EGFR expression in four FTC cell lines was measured using Western blotting. The antitumor effect of AEE788 on FTC cells in vitro was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and Western blotting. The effect of AEE788, alone and in combination with paclitaxel, on FTC tumor growth in an orthotopic nude mouse model was also investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR and VEGFR signaling status, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and microvessel density was done. RESULTS: EGF, EGFR, and vascularity were increased in human thyroid tumor samples and EGFR was increased in FTC cells. AEE788 inhibited FTC cell growth in vitro and reduced the phosphorylation status of EGFR, VEGFR, and two downstream targets, AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase, in FTC cells. AEE788 alone and, to a greater extent, AEE788 plus paclitaxel suppressed FTC tumor growth in the thyroids of nude mice. CONCLUSION: Dual inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR by AEE788 could represent a novel approach to the treatment of radioiodine-resistant FTC.",M2
16740752,"Diagnosis of suspicious thyroid nodules using four protein biomarkers.PURPOSE: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, a standard method for thyroid nodule diagnosis, cannot distinguish between benign follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) and malignant follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). Previously, using expression profiling, we found that a combination of transcript expression levels from DDIT3, ARG2, C1orf24, and ITM1 distinguished between FTA and FTC. The goal of this study was to determine if antibody markers used alone or in combination could accurately distinguish between a wider variety of benign and malignant thyroid lesions in fixed sections and FNA samples. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry was done on 27 FTA, 25 FTC, and 75 other benign and malignant thyroid tissue sections using custom antibodies for chromosome 1 open reading frame 24 (C1orf24) and integral membrane protein 1 (ITM1) and commercial antibodies for DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) and arginase II (ARG2). FNA samples were also tested using the same antibodies. RNA expression was measured by quantitative PCR in 33 thyroid lesions. RESULTS: C1orf24 and ITM1 antibodies had an estimated sensitivity of 1.00 for distinguishing FTA from FTC. For the expanded analysis of all lesions studied, ITM1 had an estimated sensitivity of 1.00 for detecting malignancy. Because all four cancer biomarkers did well, producing overlapping confidence intervals, not one best marker was distinguished. Transcript levels also reliably predicted malignancy, but immunohistochemistry had a higher sensitivity. Malignant cells were easily detected in FNA samples using these markers. CONCLUSIONS: We improved this diagnostic test by adding C1orf24 and ITM1 custom antibodies and showing use on a wider variety of thyroid pathology. We recommend that testing of all four cancer biomarkers now be advanced to larger trials. Use of one or more of these antibodies should improve diagnostic accuracy of suspicious thyroid nodules from both tissue sections and FNA samples.",M2
16735983,"Workup of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) includes three main entities: papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), and Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC). A thorough knowledge of the natural history and presentation of these carcinomas is vital to the thyroid surgeon. METHODS: This review details the preoperative workup of patients having or suspected to have WDTC. We review the history, physical examination, laboratory, and radiographic evaluations that optimally prepare the surgeon to determine the ideal surgical thyroid and neck treatment for patients with WDTC. RESULTS: A fiberoptic evaluation of the larynx is integral to the physical examination, and a laryngeal assessment is performed for all patients who will undergo thyroid surgery. It must be noted that vocal cord paralysis can be subtle and does not always present with clear dysphagia or voice change. Ultrasound and FNA are the primary tools of preoperative assessment. Given that patients with preoperative FNA positive for papillary cancer are expected to have clinically significant nodal disease in one third of cases, radiographic evaluation must be appropriately aggressive. The combination of US and CT allows assessment of the central and lateral neck nodes and the thyroid's relationship to central neck viscera. CONCLUSIONS: The overriding principle in the surgical treatment of WDTC is that the surgeon recognizes and encompasses all gross disease in the thyroid and neck nodes at first surgery. The extent of thyroidectomy is tailored not only to the patient's risk group and gross operative findings but also to the progress of the specific surgery in terms of parathyroid and recurrent laryngeal nerve preservation.",M2
16619520,"Antisense p53 oligonucleotides inhibit proliferation and induce chemosensitivity in follicular thyroid cancer cells.BACKGROUND: The potential of MTp53 knockout by oligodesoxyribonucleotide phosphothioates (ODNs) to affect proliferation, apoptosis and chemosensitivity in undifferentiated thyroid cancer (UTC) cells with a recessive MTp53 mutation was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transient transfections with ODNs complementary to p53 and control ODN (HIV-RT) were carried out in <e>FTC</e> 133 cells. In vitro proliferation was evaluated by cell counting of 10 random fields and by the MTT assay. A single pulse of 100 microg/ml Cytarabine was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional day. Chemosensitivity was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic and necrotic cells versus viable cells by flow cytometry (FACS). RESULTS: Transfection of UTC cells with ODN decreased the cell number by up to 70% (p &lt; 0.002). The proliferation rate also decreased up to 35% (p &lt; 0.03), without inducing apoptosis. ODNs rendered FTC cells sensitive to treatment with Cytarabine, inducing apoptosis in 35% of cells, as compared to 17% of cells transfected with the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV (ODN-HIV) and less than 10% of non-transfected cells (p &lt; 0.05).

16583356,"High-level expression, activation, and subcellular localization of p38-MAP kinase in thyroid neoplasms.The p38 family of MAP kinases (p38-MAPKs) is involved in regulating the proliferation, survival, and migration of various cancer cells. The present study has investigated the expression, subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and activity of p38-MAPKs in normal and tumoural human thyroid tissues and in thyroid cell lines. The expression and nucleo-cytosolic compartmentalization of the alpha-isoform of p38-MAPKs (p38alpha-MAPK) were studied by western blotting in the WRO and B-CPAP cell lines, which are derived from human follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas, respectively, and in the non-transformed rat thyroid cell lines FRTL-5 and PCCL3. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression and subcellular localization of p38alpha-MAPK, and of the phosphorylated forms of p38-MAPKs (P-p38-MAPKs) in human toxic adenomas (TAs), follicular adenomas (FAs), papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTCs</e>). The activity of p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs was revealed by immunohistochemical detection of their typical phosphorylated substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3). p38alpha-MAPK was expressed in all cell lines and this expression was restricted to the cytosolic compartment. p38 MAPK activity was involved in regulating DNA synthesis in B-CPAP cells. p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs were strongly expressed in PTC and FTC cells, although only in the cytoplasm, whereas they were only very weakly expressed in FA cells, and absent in adjacent normal tissues. They were also expressed at a high level in TAs, but they were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally, phospho-MK2/3 immunostaining followed very similar patterns to those of p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs. Taken together, these results show for the first time that the p38-MAPK signalling cascade is functional in two types of differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid. The observation that p38-MAPK hyper-expression occurs in FTC, but not in FA, may provide an additional diagnostic tool for malignancy in some thyroid nodules.",M2
16570574,"Expression of c-kit, Flk-1, and Flk-2 receptors in benign and malignant tumors of follicular epithelial origin.BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of physiologic as well as pathologic angiogenesis. The response of VEGF to endothelial cell mitogenesis and survival, as well as angiogenesis and microvascular permeability, is mainly mediated through its receptor-2, VEGFR2 (kinase domain receptor or fetal liver kinase-1, KDR or Flk-1). This study aimed to detect the expression of VEGFR2 in various forms of thyroid tumors. In addition, the expression of Flk-2 (receptor for Flt-3) and c-Kit (receptor for steel locus factor), which shows strong similarity to Flk-1, was also examined in thyroid tumors. METHODS: RT-PCR analyses of c-Kit and immunohistochemical staining of c-Kit, Flk-1, and Flk-2 were performed in archived samples of 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 9 follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), 12 follicular adenoma (FA), and 7 nodular goiter (NG) samples. The data were correlated to clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: By RT-PCR analyses, c-Kit expression was detected in 22% (4/18) of PTC, 22% (2/9) of FTC, 25% (3/12) of FA, and 57% (4/7) of NG samples. However, positive immunostaining signals of c-Kit were only observed in 17% (3/18) of PTC samples, and not in the others. Similarly, Flk-1 expression was only detected by immunohistochemistry in 67% (12/18) of PTC and 43% (3/7) of NG samples, and not in the others. Interestingly, the expression of Flk-2 was found in 89% (16/18) of PTC, 89% (8/9) of FTC, 75% (9/12) of FA, and 29% (2/7) of NG samples. An inverse relationship of thyroid cancer size with Flk-2 expression was found. CONCLUSION: Flk-2 expression was detected in various forms of thyroid tumors and increased Flk-2 expression was correlated with thyroid tumors with increased transforming activity, suggesting that Flk-2 is involved in pathogenic development of thyroid malignancy. Similarly, Flk-1 expression was also found in some thyroid tumors, while the expression of c-Kit-mediated pathways may not play a major role in thyroid tumorigenesis.",M2
16506015,"How to define follicular thyroid carcinoma?The appropriate diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) still depends on its histological discrimination from follicular adenoma (including the distinction of benign from malignant oncocytic variants), papillary thyroid carcinoma (particularly from the follicular variants) and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

In the present study, we demonstrated that human thyrocytes express all 3 Aurora kinases (A, B and C) at both protein and mRNA level and this expression is cell cycle-regulated. An increase in the protein level of the 3 kinases was found, with respect to normal human thyrocytes (HTU5), in the human cell lines derived from follicular (<e>FTC</e>-133), papillary (B-CPAP) and anaplastic (8305C) thyroid carcinomas, but not in cells derived from a follicular adenoma (HTU42). These observations were mirrored in RT-PCR experiments for Aurora-A and B. In contrast, Aurora-C mRNA levels were not significantly different among the different cell types analyzed, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanism(s) modulate its expression. The expression at the protein level of all 3 Aurora kinases was significantly higher in 3 thyroid papillary carcinomas with respect to normal matched tissues obtained from the same patients. Similar modifications, at the mRNA level, could be observed in 7 papillary carcinoma tissues for Aurora-A and B, but not for Aurora-C. In conclusion, we demonstrated that normal human thyrocytes express all 3 members of the Aurora kinase family, and their expression is amplified in malignant thyroid cell lines and tissues. These results suggest that the Aurora kinases may play a relevant role in malignant thyroid cancers, and may represent a putative therapeutic target for thyroid neoplasms.",M2
16444351,"[Pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular)]Differentiated thyroid cancers (papillary--PTC and follicular--<e>FTC</e>) are the most common endocrine malignancies. The recent progresses in the understanding of PTC and FTC pathogenesis are summarized in this review. In PTC, a single mutation of BRAF (the gene for the B-type Raf kinase) (V600E) is responsible for the disease in 40-50% of patients, especially in older people and is associated with a poorer clinicopathological outcome. Due to these characteristics, its use as a specific diagnostic and prognostic marker for PTC in cytological specimens is being implemented. Another important cause of PTC is rearrangements of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor (RET/PTC), which represent a recombination of the promoter and N-terminal domain of a partner gene with the C-terminal region of the RET gene, resulting in a chimeric gene with a protein product containing a constitutively activated RET tyrosine kinase, responsible for 20-30% patients, specially the younger or after radiation. The pathogenesis of FTC is less understood. A chromosomal translocation between the transcription factor PAX8 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARgamma) occurs in 30-50% of patients; however, the presence of PAX8-PPARgamma is also demonstrated in follicular adenomas. Therefore, there is no complete evidence that PAX8-PPARgamma is the cause of FTC. Another finding in FTC is mutations on the RAS gene, which excludes PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements. Several genes, as TRgamma, PTEN, PKAR1A, DDIT3, ARG2, ITM1 and C1orf24--some discovered by techniques of differential gene expression--, have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of FTC.",M2
16430717,"Association of HLA DQ4-DR8 haplotype with papillary thyroid carcinomas.OBJECTIVE: The association of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system with thyroid carcinomas is not clear. We sought to relate HLA alleles to susceptibility to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and also to clinical and pathological characteristics of PTC patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The distribution of HLA in 181 unrelated Caucasian patients with PTC was compared to the HLA distribution in 315 normal controls, 31 patients with follicular carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), 29 patients with lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) and 50 patients with multinodular goitre (MNG), using a microlymphocytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, patients with PTC showed a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DQ4 [12.8%vs. 3.5%, P=0.0005, P(corrected) (P(c))=0.0032, odds ratio (OR)=4.058, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.820-9.045] and HLA-DR8 (10.9%vs. 4.3%, P=0.013, P(c) &gt; 0.05, OR=2.752, 95% CI=1.275-5.940). DQ4 and DR8 were also significantly increased in patients with MNG (DQ4, 16.3%; DR8, 16.3%) compared to controls (DQ4, P=0.0019, P(c)=0.011, OR=5.420, 95% CI=1.978-14.852; DR8, P=0.0044, P(c)=0.062). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) for these two alleles was present in controls (D=0.0130, P=9.7e-57) and in MNG patients (D=0.0730, P=4.6e-19) but not in PTC patients (D=0.038, P&gt;0.05). In the subgroup of PTC subjects with concomitant 0thyroidal neoplasias (n=27), there was a significant (P&lt; 0.05) increase in the frequency of B57 (18.5%), DR11 (56.5%) and DQ3 (81.8%) compared to PTC patients without coexistent neoplasias (2.0%, 21% and 47%, respectively). No significant differences of HLA allele distribution was found in relation to PTC histology, age at diagnosis (&gt; 45 or &lt;or45 years), gender or tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging. In patients with FTC, the frequency of DR17 (FTC=51.6%; controls =; P=0.0009; P(c)=0.0138) was significantly increased compared to controls. Patients with LT showed a higher frequency of the DR11 allele (48.3%) than controls (DR11=21.3%; P=0.0028, P(c)=0.039, OR=3.445, 95% CI=1.568-7.567). CONCLUSIONS:We have typed the largest series of patients with thyroid carcinomas reported to date, and found that DR8 and DQ4 are independent susceptibility markers for PTC.",M2
16369995,"Clinically significant prognostic factors for differentiated thyroid carcinoma: a population-based, nested case-control study.BACKGROUND: Different scoring systems currently are being used to stratify patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) into risk groups. DTC is usually subdivided into papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). The objective of the current study was to identify those factors that predict long-term unfavorable prognosis and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the TNM staging system. METHODS: The authors conducted a nested case-control study within the cohort of all patients (n=5123) diagnosed with DTC in Sweden between 1958-1987 who survived at least 1 year after diagnosis. One control, matched by age at diagnosis, gender, and calendar period, was randomly selected for each case (patients who died of DTC). All patients were classified at the time of diagnosis according to the TNM staging system. The effect of prognostic factors on DTC mortality was evaluated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients with widely invasive FTC experienced a significantly higher mortality compared with PTC patients. The grade of differentiation was found to influence mortality significantly. Patients with TNM Stage IV disease had a higher mortality rate compared with patients with Stage II disease (odds ratio [OR]=9.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.7-14.6). Patients with lymph node metastases experienced a higher mortality (OR=2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-4.1) and patients with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis were found to have a nearly 7-fold higher mortality rate (OR=6.6; 95% CI, 4.1-10.5). Incomplete surgical excision was associated with higher mortality, particularly in patients with Stage I disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the following were found to be clinically significant prognostic factors for patients with DTC: histopathologic subgroup, TNM staging including lymph node metastases and distant metastases, and completeness of the surgical excision.",M2
16352687,"The Ras effector NORE1A is suppressed in follicular thyroid carcinomas with a PAX8-PPARgamma fusion.CONTEXT: The Ras effector NORE1A (RASSF5A) is a putative tumor suppressor and is inactivated in several human cancers. NORE1A has not been studied in thyroid cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether NORE1A is involved in follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>) development. DESIGN: We analyzed NORE1A expression in 25 FTCs, eight follicular thyroid adenomas, and seven normal thyroid tissues by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR. The results were evaluated in relation to RASSF1A expression, RAS mutations, and PAX8-PPARgamma fusions assessed in the same material. NORE1A promoter methylation was assessed by the combined bisulfite restriction endonuclease assay. RESULTS: Although the NORE1A mRNA levels of the majority of the tumors were similar to those in the normal controls, the cases harboring a PAX8-PPARgamma translocation (n = 6) exhibited dramatically reduced NORE1A expression (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, RAS mutations (n = 5) and NORE1A down-regulation were mutually exclusive. A significant reduction in the expression of the NORE1A homolog and the bona fide tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A was observed, but with weak correlation to the respective NORE1A values. No NORE1A promoter methylation was detected in the 32 thyroid tumors analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments demonstrate the suppression of NORE1A, a known Ras effector, in PAX8-PPARgamma carrying FTCs.",M2
16290057,"Expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoform transcripts in thyroid tumours.AIM: This study was aimed to determine p73 status in thyroid tumours. METHODS: Differential expression of the TAp73, DeltaTAp73 transcripts was measured in a panel of 60 thyroid malignancies by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: By comparison to normal thyroid tissue surrounding the tumours, we observed significant downregulation of TP73 transcripts in adenomas and in differentiated carcinomas. Correlations were found in normal tissue specimens between the expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 transcripts and that of p53, p14ARF p16INK4a, but these correlations were lost in carcinomas (PTC or <e>FTC</e>). CONCLUSIONS: We have found significant variations of TAp73, DeltaNp73, p53, p14ARF p16INK4a, expressions and correlations between the expressions of those different genes in thyroid cancer.",M2
16244545,"Follicular thyroid carcinoma: the role of histology and staging systems in predicting survival.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk factors including tumor histomorphology for survival specific to follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and to apply commonly employed staging systems in predicting survival for patients with FTC. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: FTC is usually analyzed collectively with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in risk group analysis. Risk factors and risk group analysis are important in the management of patients with FTC, although current published therapeutic guidelines call for total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine (I) ablation for all FTC patients. METHODS: Over a 40-year period, 156 patients surgically treated for FTC with an average follow-up of 14.4 years were retrospectively studied after histologic reclassification according to the type and degree of invasiveness of the tumor. Potential risk factors for survival were calculated using multivariate analysis, and the prognostic accuracy of AMES risk group stratification, UICC/AJCC pTNM staging, Degroot classification, and MACIS scoring schemes in predicting survival was compared. RESULTS: Seventeen (11%) patients had distant metastases at presentation, and bilateral thyroid resection was performed for 131 (84%) patients. Seventeen (11%) patients died of recurrent or metastatic disease. The overall and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates at 10 years were 79% and 88%, respectively. None of the patients with minimally invasive (n = 49) or angioinvasive (n = 23) carcinomas died compared with 17 of 84 patients with widely invasive carcinomas (P = 0.0007). Using the Cox proportional hazards model, old age, the presence of distant metastases, and incomplete tumor excision were independent prognostic factors for survival. For patients who underwent curative treatment, old age and widely invasive carcinoma were risk factors for poor survival. All staging systems studied accurately predicted CSS, and the pTNM UICC/AJCC staging system yielded the best prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly adopted staging systems can be applied specifically to patients with FTC. The distinction of FTC in minimally invasive and widely invasive carcinoma based on the extent of invasiveness rather than vascular invasion is important in identifying low-risk FTC patients for a more conservative management.",M2
16189643,"Increased expression of valosin-containing protein (p97) is correlated with disease recurrence in follicular thyroid cancer.BACKGROUND: Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome-degradation pathway, which works in proliferation and antiapoptosis in human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that VCP expression levels correlated with the recurrence and prognosis of several human cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. In this study, the correlation of VCP expression with the prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma was examined. METHODS: VCP expression in 332 patients who underwent operation for differentiated thyroid carcinoma--257 with papillary thyroid carcinoma and 75 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>)--was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The staining intensity in tumor cells was categorized as weaker than (low expression), equal to (intermediate expression), or stronger than (high expression) that in endothelial cells in noncancerous tissue. RESULTS: One hundred ten (33.5%) cases showed low VCP expression, 117 (28.0%) showed intermediate expression, and 101 (30.8%) showed high expression. VCP expression significantly correlated with histological subtype (P &lt; .05) and lymph node metastasis (P &lt; .01). However, it correlated with neither any clinicopathologic factor nor prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma. VCP expression correlated with extrathyroidal extension (P &lt; .05), pT classification (P &lt; .05), and lymph node metastasis (P &lt; .01) in FTC. Patients with low VCP expressing FTC showed better disease-free and overall survival rates than those with intermediate or high expression (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed VCP expression and extracapsular extension to be independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in cases of FTC. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of VCP expression in FTC was demonstrated.",M2
16091757,"Oncofoetal fibronectin--a tumour-specific marker in detecting minimal residual disease in differentiated thyroid carcinoma.Supposedly, thyrocyte-specific transcripts such as thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) were proposed to be useful for the diagnosis of circulating tumour cells in patients suffering from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). However, several research groups reported blood-borne Tg transcripts in healthy individuals. This study determines in particular the origin of Tg mRNA in nucleated blood cells and analyses whether other tumour-associated sequences are absent in leukocytes, but widely expressed in DTC. Therefore, expression analyses for Tg, TSH-R, cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and oncofoetal fibronectin (onfFN) were carried out using cDNAs derived from (1) leukocyte fractions, (2) 18 follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTCs</e>) and 48 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and (3) leukocytes of two thyrocyte-depleted individuals treated for C-cell carcinoma of the thyroid. Expression of onfFN was additionally analysed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and by quantitative fluorescence-based real-time PCR. Tg and TSH-R expression was demonstrated not only in both athyroid individuals, but in all leukocyte subgroups tested, while hTERT was absent in resting CD4+ cells and only weakly expressed in the CD8+ group. CK 19 was notable in each leukocyte population except for resting CD14(+), as well as for activated and resting CD19+ cells. All blood cell fractions proved negative for onfFN mRNA, whereas its presence in thyroid carcinoma was 78/98% (FTC/PTC). Threshold cycle values were calculated at: porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) = 25.95+/-0.73 (FTC)/24.55+/-5.43 (PTC) (P = 0.2878); onfFN = 25.48+/-3.15 (FTC)/21.44+/-3.44 (PTC) (*P = 0.0001). Finally, onfFN transcripts were detected in blood samples of six out of nine patients with known DTC metastases, demonstrating a reliable assay functionality. We propose that real-time RT-PCR of onfFN mRNA is superior to other markers in monitoring minimal residual disease in DTC with regard to both assay sensitivity and specificity.",M2
16086077,"A subset of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma harbors the PAX8-PPARgamma translocation.The occurrence of the PAX8-PPARgamma fusion gene is thought to be restricted to follicular tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) of the thyroid (FTA and <e>FTC</e>). Using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), together with recombinant tissue-type polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, we detected the PAX8-PPARgamma translocation in 4 of 8 cases of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) exclusively or almost exclusively (&gt;95%) composed of follicles. The 4 tumors with the translocation were larger and apparently more invasive than the remaining tumors, but the series is too small to allow a statistically meaningful comparison of the data. Our findings show that follicular thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may also harbor the PAX8-PPARgamma fusion gene and indicate that a subset of FVPTC shares some molecular features of FTA and FTC.",M2
16000845,"Significance of an insular component in follicular thyroid carcinoma with distant metastasis at initial presentation.Risk factors for distant metastasis were studied in 82 patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). Metastases to either the lung or bone existing at the time of presentation were confirmed by I-131 radio-iodine uptake in 10 patients. FTC with an insular component was found in eight patients. Univariate analysis of 14 possible risk factors showed 7 to be statistically significant: insular component, poorly differentiated carcinoma, trabecular component, serum thyroglobulin level before surgery, patient age at the time of presentation, solid component, and vascular invasion (ranked by p values). After further analysis of the interrelation of the factors and of the logistic regression curves, we concluded that presence of an insular component and patient age were the only independent risk factors. Distant metastasis was not detected in any of the 27 patients &lt; or = 49 yr old. Among the 55 older patients (&gt; or = 50 yr old), 5 of the 49 (10%) without an insular component and 5 of the 6 (83%) with an insular component had distant metastasis. The remaining older patient with an insular component but without distant metastasis showed a gradual increase in thyroglobulin levels after total thyroidectomy.",M2
15972966,"Follicular thyroid tumors with the PAX8-PPARgamma1 rearrangement display characteristic genetic alterations.Follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTC</e>) arise through oncogenic pathways distinct from those involved in the papillary histotype. Recently, a t(2;3)(q13;p25) rearrangement, which juxtaposes the thyroid transcription factor PAX8 to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma1, was described in FTCs. In this report, we describe gene expression in 11 normal tissues, 4 adenomas, and 8 FTCs, with or without the PAX8-PPARgamma1 translocation, using custom 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays. Results were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of 65 thyroid tissues and by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis revealed a pattern of 93 genes discriminating FTCs, with or without the translocation, that were morphologically undistinguishable. Although the expression of thyroid-specific genes was detectable, none appeared to be differentially regulated between tumors with or without the translocation. Differentially expressed genes included genes related to lipid/glucose/amino acid metabolism, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis. Surprisingly, several PPARgamma target genes were up-regulated in PAX8-PPARgamma-positive FTCs such as angiopoietin-like 4 and aquaporin 7. Moreover many genes involved in PAX8-PPARgamma expression profile presented a putative PPARgamma-promoter site, compatible with a direct activity of the fusion product. These data identify several differentially expressed genes, such as FGD3, that may serve as potential targets of PPARgamma and as members of novel molecular pathways involved in the development of thyroid carcinomas.",M2
15947104,"Action of thiazolidinediones on differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of normal and transformed thyrocytes in culture.Differentiating drugs may be able to re-sensitize thyroid carcinomas to radioiodine therapy. Substituted thiazolidinediones (TZDs) belong to the group of oral anti-diabetic drugs that also possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and, potentially, differentiating effects on several cancer cell lines. Some of the effects are mediated via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). We investigated the effect of troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone on differentiation in normal porcine thyrocytes and in the follicular carcinoma cell lines <e>FTC</e> 133 and FTC 238. Differentiation was investigated by measuring 125I uptake and the expression of sodium-iodide symporter and thyroglobulin proteins. The TZDs were tested in the presence of retinol and retinoic acid. Additionally, proliferation was evaluated by [3H]thymidine uptake and cell number and apoptosis by annexin V-labeling. Controls included tocopherol and unsubstituted thiazolidinedione and co-incubation of the TZDs with the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662. PPAR-gamma and retinol X receptor (RXR)-alpha were investigated by immunocytochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR. Cells derived from the metastasis showed greater responses than cells derived from the primary tumor. Troglitazone showed greater effects than the other TZDs. Troglitazone significantly increased 125I uptake and apoptosis and decreased [3H]thymidine uptake and cell number. The amount of the sodium iodide-symporter in the membrane fraction was significantly increased, while that of thyroglobulin was not influenced by the treatment. Inclusion of antagonist did not abolish these effects. No synergistic effect with any retinoid was detected. All transformed cells expressed PPAR-gamma and RXR-alpha but TZDs did not change their expression. Troglitazone appears to be suited for the re-differentiation treatment of dedifferentiated thyroid carcinoma because its action is twofold. On the one hand it increases differentiation and on the other hand it inhibits proliferation.",M2
15930290,"Antivascular therapy of human follicular thyroid cancer experimental bone metastasis by blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular growth factor receptor phosphorylation.Patients suffering from bone metastases of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) have a poor prognosis because of the lack of effective treatment strategies. The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) associated with increased vascularity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FTC and subsequent bone metastases. We hypothesized that inhibiting the phosphorylation of the EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) by AEE788, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR, in combination with paclitaxel would inhibit experimental FTC bone lesions and preserve bone structure. We tested this hypothesis using the human WRO FTC cell line. In culture, AEE788 inhibited the EGF-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR, VEGFR2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt in culture. AEE788, alone and in combination with paclitaxel, inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. When WRO cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice, tumor and endothelial cells within the lesions expressed phosphorylated EGFR, VEGFR, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase that were inhibited by the oral administration of AEE788. Therapy consisting of orally given AEE788 and i.p. injected paclitaxel induced a high level of apoptosis in tumor-associated endothelial cells and tumor cells with the inhibition of tumor growth in the bone and the preservation of bone structure. Collectively, these data show that blocking the phosphorylation of EGFR and VEGFR with AEE788 combined with paclitaxel can significantly inhibit experimental human FTC in the bone of nude mice.",M2
15856429,"The prognostic value of primary tumor size in papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma.BACKGROUND: A delay in the diagnosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma often leads to larger tumors, higher prevalence rates of distant metastasis, and earlier cause-specific deaths. Threshold tumor diameters for extrathyroidal growth, lymph node spread, and distant metastasis in papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) remain to be defined. METHODS: A comparative correlation of primary tumor size and extrathyroidal growth, lymph node spread, and distant metastasis was performed for 500 institutional patients who received surgery for PTC or FTC. RESULTS: There were 366 patients with PTC (73.2%) and 134 patients with FTC (26.8%). Multifocality (23.5% vs. 9.0%; P &lt; 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (40.2% vs. 19.4%; P &lt; 0.001) were more common in the patients with PTC than in those with FTC. Patients with FTC were older at first diagnosis (51.6 vs. 47.0 years; P = 0.01) compared with the patients with PTC. The FTC tumors were almost twice as large (39.9 vs. 20.6 mm; P &lt; 0.001), and patients had a higher prevalence of distant metastasis (17.9% vs. 6.3%; P &lt; 0.001). When primary tumor diameter was accounted for, cumulative risks of extrathyroidal growth and lymph node metastasis were higher in patients with PTC than in patients with FTC (P &lt; 0.001; log-rank test). In striking contrast, the cumulative risk of distant metastasis was the same for PTC and FTC tumors of equal size (P = 0.89; log-rank test) and increased once the primary tumor size was &gt; 20 mm. Pulmonary metastasis was an earlier event than bone metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggested that earlier intervention is warranted to keep suspicious thyroid nodules from growing &gt; 20 mm (or greater than T1) and spreading to distant organs.",M2
15839624,"Metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology: a report of 3 cases.BACKGROUND: Follicular thyroid carcinomas (<e>FTCs</e>) usually have a benign clinical course, with an excellent long-term prognosis and a propensity for vascular invasion. The most common sites of metastases are lung and bone. Only a few reports are available on fine needle aspiration biopsy findings from metastatic lesions of FTC. CASES: A 68-year-old man presented with a thyroid mass and skin nodule on the scalp. Skin nodule aspiration revealed metastatic FTC. A 52-year-old woman and 60-year-old man were investigated for chronic anemia. As part of the routine investigation, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed from the posterior iliac crest and diagnosed as metastatic FTC. Further questioning revealed that the patients had undergone thyroidectomy 10 and 13 years earlier. The aspiration material in all 3 cases revealed epithelial cell clusters with marginal (fire-flare) vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Cytologic diagnosis of metastatic FTC has been reported rarely. Marginal (fire-flare) vacuoles aid in making the diagnosis of metastatic FTC.",M2
15785241,"Troglitazone, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, induces antiproliferation and redifferentiation in human thyroid cancer cell lines.Troglitazone is a potent agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) that is a ligand-activated transcription factor regulating cell differentiation and growth. PPARgamma may play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis since PAX8-PPARgamma1 chromosomal translocations are commonly found in follicular thyroid cancers. We investigated the antiproliferative and redifferentiation effects of troglitazone in 6 human thyroid cancer cell lines: TPC-1 (papillary), <e>FTC</e>-133, FTC-236, FTC-238 (follicular), XTC-1 (Hürthle cell), and ARO82-1 (anaplastic) cell lines. PPARgamma was expressed variably in these cell lines. FTC-236 and FTC-238 had a rearranged chromosome at 3p25, possibly implicating the involvement of the PPARgamma encoding gene whereas the other cell lines did not. Troglitazone significantly inhibited cell growth by cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. PPARgamma overexpression did not appear to be a prerequisite for a response to treatment with troglitazone. Troglitazone also downregulated surface expression of CD97, a novel dedifferentiation marker, in FTC-133 cells and upregulated sodium iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA in TPC-1 and FTC-133 cells. Our investigations document that human thyroid cancer cell lines commonly express PPARgamma, but chromosomal translocations involving PPARgamma are uncommon. Troglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, induced antiproliferation and redifferentiation in thyroid cancer cell lines. PPARgamma agonists may therefore be effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with thyroid cancer that fails to respond to traditional treatments.",M2
15757202,"Analysis of nm23-H1 protein immunoreactivity in follicular thyroid tumors.Immunohistochemical analysis employing a monoclonal antibody nm23-H1 (the antibody against nm-23 protein) was performed on archival material, consisting of 12 cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>), 57 cases of follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) and 17 cases of nodular goiter (NG). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactions for nm-23H1 were observed in cells of FTCs, FTAs and NGs. In oxyphilic adenomas cytoplasmic staining was observed. Eleven (91.7%) cases of FTC, 55 (98.2%) cases of FTA and 14 (82.4%) cases of NG were found to be positive for nm23-H1 protein. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean percentage values of immunopositive cells between carcinomas and adenomas. A significant increase in the number of cases with high percentage (more than 50) of positive cells was found in both carcinomas (FTCs) and adenomas (FTAs)--mainly microfollicular ones, in comparison with nodular goiter. It can be concluded that highly positive immunoreaction for the nm23-H1 protein in the cells of carcinomas (FTCs) and microfollicular adenomas indicates for a high proliferation rate of these tumors.",M2
15753667,"Thyroid cancers express CD-40 and CD-40 ligand: cancers that express CD-40 ligand may have a greater risk of recurrence in young patients.The immune response might suppress thyroid cancer recurrence. Although the factors that control this are unknown, CD-40 and CD-40 ligand might be important. To test this, we stained 36 papillary (PTC) and four follicular (<e>FTC</e>) thyroid carcinomas for CD-40 (n = 37) and CD-40 ligand (n = 36) and graded staining from absent (grade 0) to intense (grade 3). Follicular cells of the majority of thyroid tumors expressed CD-40 (30/37, 81%) and CD-40 ligand (15/24, 69%). Cancers from young patients (&lt; or =21 years of age) that expressed CD-40 contained more numerous lymphocytes/high-power field (36 +/- 11) than cancers that failed to express CD-40 (4 +/- 3, p = 0.01), but there was no correlation with clinical outcome. Among young patients, CD-40 ligand expression was more intense in multifocal (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.2, p = 0.037), aggressive (1.14 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.2, p = 0.05) and recurrent tumors (1.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.2, p = 0.05) and associated with reduced disease-free survival (p = 0.03). We conclude that the majority of thyroid cancers express CD-40 and CD-40 ligand.

We present a case of solitary lytic skull metastasis of a FTC in a 30-year-old woman. The patient presented with bulging on the left side of the head. Neuro-imaging techniques showed a lesion with an osteolytic component in the left frontal region. After a left frontal craniectomy the tumour was removed totally. The histopathological examination revealed a well-differentiated FTC metastasis and a complete total thyroidectomy was subsequently performed. The patient was given thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy followed by whole body iodine-131 (I131) internal radiation.",M2
15713710,"Genetic classification of benign and malignant thyroid follicular neoplasia based on a three-gene combination.Thyroid carcinoma is a common endocrine cancer with a favorable prognosis if subjected to timely treatment. However, the clinical identification of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) among patients with benign thyroid nodules is still a challenge. Preoperative fine needle aspiration-based cytology cannot always differentiate follicular carcinomas from benign follicular neoplasias. Because current methods fail to improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules, new molecular-based diagnoses should be explored. We conducted a microarray-based study to reveal the genetic profiles unique to FTC and follicular adenomas (FAs), to identify the most parsimonious number of genes that could accurately differentiate between benign and malignant follicular thyroid neoplasia. We confirmed our data by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in two independent validation sets with a total of 114 samples. We were able to identify three genes, cyclin D2 (CCND2), protein convertase 2 (PCSK2), and prostate differentiation factor (PLAB), that allow the accurate molecular classification of FTC and FA. Two independent validation sets revealed that the combination of these three genes could differentiate FTC from FA with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 94.7%, and accuracy of 96.7%. In addition, our model allowed the identification of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma with an accuracy of 85.7%. Three-gene profiling of thyroid nodules can accurately predict the diagnosis of FTC and FA with high sensitivity and specificity, thus identifying promising targets for further investigation to ultimately improve preoperative diagnosis.",M2
15546898,"Silencing of the maternally imprinted tumor suppressor ARHI contributes to follicular thyroid carcinogenesis.The two most common subtypes of thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and papillary thyroid carcinoma, have been extensively studied, but our fundamental understanding of the molecular events in thyroid epithelial oncogenesis is still limited. Unreported data from our previous published global gene expression analysis revealed that the tumor suppressor gene aplysia ras homolog I (ARHI) is frequently underexpressed in FTCs. In this study, we elucidated the frequency and mechanism of ARHI silencing in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasia. We demonstrated that underexpression of ARHI occurs principally in FTCs (P = 0.0018), including its oncocytic variant (11 of 13), even at minimally invasive stage but not classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (two of seven) or follicular adenoma (FA) (three of 14). FTCs show strong allelic imbalance with reduction in copy number/loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 69%, compared with less than 10% for FAs. In combination with our LOH data, bisulfite sequencing in a subset of samples revealed that FA displays a symmetric methylation pattern, likely representing one unmethylated allele and one presumptively imprinted allele, whereas FTC shows a virtually complete methylation pattern, representing LOH of the nonimprinted allele with only the hypermethylated allele remaining. Furthermore, we showed that pharmacologic inhibition of histone deacetylation but not demethylation could reactivate ARHI expression in the FTC133 FTC cell line. Therefore, our data suggest that silencing of the putative maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene ARHI, primarily by large genomic deletion in conjunction with hypermethylation of the genomically imprinted allele, serves as a key early event in follicular thyroid carcinogenesis.",M2
15379724,"The PAX8/PPAR gamma fusion oncogene as a potential therapeutic target in follicular thyroid carcinoma.Follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) accounts for approximately 20% of all thyroid cancers, and up to 40% of the deaths associated with this disease. Current treatment approaches include surgery, followed by radioactive iodine therapy. However, a significant proportion of locally advanced and metastatic FTC fails to concentrate iodine. Because traditional chemotherapeutic agents have not been shown to alter outcomes in this disease, novel therapeutic strategies are needed for advanced disease. Recently, a genomic rearrangement has been identified in up to 50% of FTC, involving a translocation event between chromosome regions 3p25 and 2q13. This translocation fuses the thyroid-specific transcription factor PAX8 gene with the PPARgamma gene, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. We have confirmed that this Pax8/PPARgamma fusion gene (designated PPFP) is an oncogene, which accelerates cell growth, reduces rates of apoptosis and permits anchorage independent and contact uninhibited growth of a thyroid cell line. The action of PPFP arises, at least in part, through its activity as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the wild-type PPARgamma transcription factor. Although the mechanism by which PPFP impairs PPARgamma activity remains unknown at this time, it is likely to be mediated by competition for the genomic PPARgamma response elements, the endogenous ligand, or various cofactors, including the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Consequently, modulation of PPFP activity might be possible through the use of PPARgamma agonists, RXR-agonists, or specific modulators of PPFP itself. Alternatively, modulation of several down-stream regulatory pathways may become possible, as the consequences of PPARgamma inhibition become better known. PPFP represents a potential novel target for the management of advanced FTC.",M2
15337802,"Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas show distinctly different microarray expression profiles and can be distinguished by a minimum of five genes.PURPOSE: We have previously conducted independent microarray expression analyses of the two most common types of nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma, namely papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). In this study, we sought to combine our data sets to shed light on the similarities and differences between these tumor types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarray data from six PTCs, nine FTCs, and 13 normal thyroid samples were normalized to remove interlaboratory variability and then analyzed by unsupervised clustering, t test, and by comparison of absolute and change calls. Expression changes in four genes not previously implicated in thyroid carcinogenesis were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on these same samples, together with eight additional FTC tumors. RESULTS: PTCs showed two distinct groups of genes that were either over- or underexpressed compared with normal thyroid, whereas the predominant changes in FTCs were of decreased expression. Five genes could collectively distinguish the two tumor types. PTCs showed overexpression of CITED1, claudin-10 (CLDN10), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) but showed no change in expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1) or -2 (CAV2); conversely, FTCs did not express CLDN10 and had decreased expression of IGFBP6 and/or CAV1 and CAV2. CONCLUSION: PTC and FTC show distinctive microarray expression profiles, suggesting that either they have different molecular origins or they diverge distinctly from a common origin. Furthermore, if verified in a larger series of tumors, these genes could, in combination with known tumor-specific chromosome translocations, form the basis of a valuable diagnostic tool.",M2
15256783,"Is thyroid follicular cancer in Japanese caused by a specific t(2; 3)(q13; p25) translocation generating Pax8-PPAR gamma fusion mRNA?A recent western study reports that t(2; 3)(q13; p25) translocation resulting in the expression of the Pax8-PPAR gamma fusion gene in patients with thyroid follicular carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) occurs with high incidence (63%). Furthermore, the products of the fusion gene were shown to suppress the function of PPAR gamma in a predominantly negative manner, conferring them with an oncogenic potential. We examined the expression of this fusion gene in FTC in Japanese patients. From 1989 to 2000, six cases with FTC were surgically treated at our institute. In these carcinoma samples, the expression of mRNAs for the Pax8-PPAR gamma fusion product was analyzed by nested RT-PCR. Their expression was also studied in other thyroid nodules (12 adenomatous goiters, 12 follicular adenomas, 12 papillary carcinomas and 12 normal thyroid tissues) obtained at surgery during the same period. Pax8-PPAR gamma fusion mRNA was not detected in any FTC samples nor in the other samples. Furthermore, none of the 6 FTCs, one follicular adenoma or one normal thyroid analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) exhibited Pax8-PPAR gamma gene fusion. These findings are in contrast to previous reports and indicate that ethnic background may affect the translocation.",M2
15142359,"Doxorubicin induces Fas-mediated apoptosis in human thyroid carcinoma cells.Doxorubicin remains the most extensively used drug in the chemotherapy of thyroid cancer. However, drug resistance often limits the efficacy of chemotherapy in clinical practice. Several anticancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effect by triggering Fas-mediated apoptosis in some cell types. However, no investigations have been conducted to determine whether doxorubicin causes apoptosis in thyroid carcinomas. In the present study, we assessed the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of doxorubicin on two thyroid cancer cell lines (<e>FTC</e> 238 and FTC 133). Cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin were evaluated by a 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2yl) 2-5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was quantified by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V/flow cytometric analysis and by DNA fragmentation. Fas expression was measured by flow cytometric analysis. After a 24-hour incubation, doxorubicin induces a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the two cell lines. Treatment with doxorubicin (0.5 and 1 microM) for 24 hours induced cell apoptosis and upregulated Fas expression. A significant correlation was found between the fluorescence intensity values obtained with annexin V staining and those observed for Fas expression (r = 0.996; p &lt; 0.001 or r = 0.957; 0.02 &lt; p &lt; 0.05 for FTC 238 or FTC 133 cells, respectively). In conclusion, doxorubicin exerts its cytotoxic effects, at least partly, through Fas-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells. These results may have clinical implications for thyroid cancer therapy.",M2
15085203,"A preoperative diagnostic test that distinguishes benign from malignant thyroid carcinoma based on gene expression.Accurate diagnosis of thyroid tumors is challenging. A particular problem is distinguishing between follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) and benign follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA), where histology of fine-needle aspirates is not conclusive. It is often necessary to remove healthy thyroid to rule out carcinoma. In order to find markers to improve diagnosis, we quantified gene transcript expression from FTC, FTA, and normal thyroid, revealing 73 differentially expressed transcripts (P &lt; or = 0.0001). Using an independent set of 23 FTCs, FTAs, and matched normal thyroids, 17 genes with large expression differences were tested by real-time RT-PCR. Four genes (DDIT3, ARG2, ITM1, and C1orf24) differed between the two classes FTC and FTA, and a linear combination of expression levels distinguished FTC from FTA with an estimated predictive accuracy of 0.83. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for DDIT3 and ARG2 showed consistent staining for carcinoma in an independent set 59 follicular tumors (estimated concordance, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, [0.59, 0.93]). A simple test based on a combination of these markers might improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules, allowing better treatment decisions and reducing long-term health costs.",M2
15080786,"Human thyroid carcinoma cell lines show different retinoic acid receptor repertoires and retinoid responses.OBJECTIVE: Disturbed expression of retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RAR/RXR) contributes to the pathogenesis and tumor progression of epithelial carcinomas. DESIGN: To examine whether altered responses to retinoids may correlate with differences in RA receptor equipment, retinoid effects were examined in human thyroid carcinoma cell lines of various differentiation stages in culture and after xenotransplantation onto rodent models. METHODS: Cell growth was assessed by the MTT test, mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot and quantitative competitive RT-PCR, and type I 5'-deiodinase (5'DI) activity was measured by in vitro deiodination assay. Nude rats and mice were used for xenotransplantation experiments. RESULTS: All-trans-RA and RAR-selective synthetic retinoids stimulated activity and mRNA expression of the thyroid differentiation marker 5'DI in the follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line <e>FTC</e>-133. In the less differentiated FTC-238 cells, stimulation of 5'DI activity was less pronounced than in FTC-133 cells, and a reduced level of RAR beta mRNA was detected. In the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines HTh 74 and C 643, the activity of 5'DI was not increased by retinoids, and expression of RAR alpha mRNA was reduced. Proliferation of FTC-133 and FTC-238 cells was decreased by all-trans-RA. Pretreatment of FTC-133 with RA resulted in a reduced tumor growth in xenotransplantation experiments as compared with untreated control cells. This reduction was less pronounced in the case of FTC-238 cells. Thus, retinoid therapy might be applied to treat follicular thyroid carcinomas. However, tumor-specific RAR repertoires need to be analyzed as a prerequisite for successful intervention with appropriate, probably receptor-selective retinoids.",M2
15068629,"Changing trends of incidence and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma in lower Franconia, Germany, from 1981-1995.BACKGROUND: A population-based registry (PBR) in Lower Frankonia in southern Germany was conducted to evaluate the changes of incidence and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma (TC) in this area. METHODS: The study comprised 476 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) from Lower Franconia (1.3 x 10(6) inhabitants) registered between 1981 and 1995 at the Regional Tumor Center. The incidence was assessed with respect to gender, age, histology, tumor stage, lymph node involvement and distant metastases in 5-year intervals (1981-1985, 1986-1990, and 1991-1995). RESULTS: An increasing rate of papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC and a decreasing rate of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) were observed over the three time periods (1981-1985, 1986-1990, and 1991-1995). The overall incidence revealed no significant change with time for both females from 3.22 to 3.25 and 3.73 and males (1.07 to 1.54 and 1.69) between the three time periods. There was a significant improvement in outcome of patients with DTC with respect to life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Iodine prophylaxis does influence the distribution of the histologic types of thyroid cancer and leads to an increase in the ratio of papillary versus follicular carcinoma. Our study supports the hypothesis that the benefits of correcting iodine deficency outweigh the risks of iodine supplementation.",M2
15028317,"Differentiated thyroid cancer and outcome in iodine deficiency.AIMS: Factors influencing prognosis and long-term outcome of thyroid cancer have been described by several groups. We wished to asses the previously described prognostic factors in a moderately iodine deficient region in Hungary. METHODS: Four hundred and fifty-four out of 492 patients who had surgery for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC, 386 cases) and follicular thyroid cancer (<e>FTC</e>, 106 cases) between 1971 and 1998 were analyzed. Survival curves were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The 10 and 20-year survival rates were 87.9 and 84% for PTC, and 78.2 and 78.2% for FTC. In PTC, extrathyroidal invasion (p&lt;0.0001), lymph node metastasis (p&lt;0.0001), distant metastasis (p&lt;0.0001), and age over 40 years (p=0.002) were significant adverse predictors. In FTC, extrathyroidal invasion (p=0.003) distant metastases (p&lt;0.0001), and age over 40 years (p=0.011) were significant adverse predictors. CONCLUSION: Iodine intake did not appear to influence survival. The incidence of follicular cancer, which has less favourable prognosis, was higher in iodine deficient regions. This supports the importance of iodine supplementation in these areas.",M2
15027890,"Prognostic factors of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer: differences in an iodine-replete endemic goiter region.Papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) are known as differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Nevertheless, according to the UICC/AJCC (TNM) classification PTC and FTC are frequently analyzed as one cancer. The aim of this study is to show differences in outcome and specific prognostic factors in an iodine-replete endemic goiter region. Six hundred and three patients with DTC treated within a 35-year-period were retrospectively analyzed with respect to carcinoma-specific survival. Prognostic factors were tested for their significance using univariate and multivariate analysis. The histological type (PTC versus FTC) was found to be a highly significant factor - carcinoma-specific survival both in univariate (P&lt;0.001) and multivariate analyses (P=0.003) was significantly different. Univariate analysis revealed patients' age, extra-thyroid tumor spread, lymph node and distant metastases, increasing tumor size, and the tall cell variant to be significant prognostic factors for PTC patients. Age &gt; or =45 years, positive lymph nodes and increasing tumor size were confirmed as independent prognostic factors. Univariate analysis of FTC patients revealed age at presentation, gender, extrathyroidal tumor spread, lymph node and distant metastases, increasing tumor size, multifocality, widely invasive tumor growth and oxyphilic variant to be factors bearing prognostic significance. The presence of distant metastases and increasing tumor size could be identified as independent prognostic factors for FTC patients. This study shows distinctive differences in prognostic factors of PTC and FTC: independent factors predicting poor prognosis are age &gt; or =45 years, positive lymph nodes and increasing tumor size for PTC, and distant metastases and increasing tumor size for FTC. PTC and FTC patients should be analyzed and reported separately.",M2
15027116,"Expression, regulation and function of autotaxin in thyroid carcinomas.Autotaxin (ATX/NPP2) is a tumor cell motility-stimulating factor that displays both a nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase activity and a recently described lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity. The precise function of ATX in tumor cells and the role of ATX in thyroid carcinoma remains unclear. We have quantified ATX mRNA expression in thyroid carcinoma cell lines and in tissues of patients with thyroid carcinomas. ATX gene activity was significantly higher in undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines (UTC) and tumor tissues as compared to follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) cell lines, FTC tissues or goiter tissues that were used as a control. In the thyroid carcinoma cell line 1736, EGF and bFGF stimulated ATX mRNA expression, whereas the cytokines IL-4, IL-1beta and TGF-beta reduced ATX transcriptional levels. FTC-133 cells, stably transfected with an expression vector for ATX, showed a higher lysoPLD activity, a higher proliferation rate and an increased migratory behavior. In addition, ATX also displayed a paracrine stimulatory effect on the motility of different thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Overexpression of ATX in the stably transfected FTC-133 resulted in down-regulation of CD54/ intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene expression and augmented gene activity of the pro-angiogenic chemokine IL-8. We conclude that ATX may be regarded as a new tissue marker for undifferentiated human thyroid carcinoma cells. ATX increases the proliferation and migration of thyroid carcinoma cell lines and may also affect the angiogenic potential of thyroid carcinoma cells. Further studies are needed to provide insight into the role of ATX in the normal and neoplastic thyroid gland.",M2
15022277,"Follicular thyroid carcinoma: histology and prognosis.BACKGROUND: Follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) is the second most common thyroid malignancy after papillary thyroid carcinoma. The authors studied the clinical course of 132 patients with FTC to determine whether there was a direct relation between the histologic degree of invasion, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. METHODS: The 132 patients in the study population underwent 182 thyroid carcinoma-related operations, and their mean follow-up was 7.5 years (median:,6 years; range, 0-39 years). The following criteria were used to define malignant follicular neoplasms: 1) minimally invasive, tumor invasion through the entire thickness of the tumor capsule; 2) moderately invasive, tumor with angioinvasion (with or without capsular invasion); and 3) widely invasive, broad area or areas of transcapsular invasion of thyroid and extrathyroidal tissue. Forty-five of 119 patients (37.8%) presented with minimally invasive FTC (capsular invasion only), 50 patients (42%) presented with moderately invasive FTC (angioinvasion with or without capsular invasion), and 24 patients (20%) presented with widely invasive FTC. At presentation, 12 patients (9%) had distant metastases, and 8 patients (6%) had lymph node metastases. RESULTS: Excluding 12 patients who presented with distant metastases, 21 patients (16%) developed recurrent metastases 6 months after their initial treatment. Among 45 patients with capsular invasion only, 6 patients (13%) developed recurrent or persistent disease, and 5 patients (11%) died. Of the 50 patients who had angioinvasion with or without capsular invasion, 10 patients (20%) developed recurrent or persistent disease, and 7 patients (14%) died. Patients who had angioinvasion with or without capsular invasion had a less favorable prognosis compared with patients who had capsular invasion only (P &lt; 0.0001). Among patients who had widely invasive FTC, 9 of 24 patients (38%) developed recurrent disease, and 8 patients (33%) died; in addition, 7 of the other 24 patients (29%) had persistent disease and died. The overall death rate for patients with widely invasive FTC was 62%. Patients with persistent disease had a poorer prognosis compared with patients who had recurrent disease (P &lt; 0.0001). Twenty-eight patients (21%) in the entire group died of FTC. CONCLUSIONS: In the current retrospective investigation, the authors demonstrate that patients with minimally invasive FTC (capsular invasion only) had a slightly better survival rate at 5 years (98%) compared with patients who had angioinvasion with or without capsular invasion (80%) and had better survival compared with patients who had widely invasive FTC (38%). Other (but not all) reports in the literature support the findings that FTC with angioinvasion is more aggressive than FTC with only capsular invasion yet is less aggressive than widely invasive FTC. The authors conclude that FTC no longer should be classified as either minimally invasive or widely invasive; rather, they recommend classifying FTC as minimally invasive, moderately invasive, or widely invasive, because prognosis varies according to these groupings.",M2
14973173,"Differentiated thyroid carcinomas from children and adolescents express IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R). Cancers with the most intense IGF-I-R expression may be more aggressive.Adult thyroid cancers express IGF and IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R), but the clinical impact is not clear. No previous study examined any childhood thyroid cancers that are well-differentiated and have a favorable prognosis. We used immunohistochemistry to determine IGF-I and IGF-I-R in 23 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) and 6 follicular thyroid cancers (<e>FTC</e>) from children and adolescents. IGF-I was detected in 45% and IGF-I-R in 43% of cancers. IGF-I and IGF-I-R were found more often in PTC (IGF-I = 9/23, IGF-I-R = 8/19) than normal surrounding thyroid (IGF-I = 0/10, p = 0.032 and IGF-I-R = 0/10, p = 0.030). There were too few FTC to support independent statistical analysis, but IGF-I was found in 4 of 6 FTC (0/10 normal), and IGF-I-R was found in 2 of 4 FTC (0/10 normal). IGF-I-R staining was more intense in aggressive (invasive, metastatic, recurrent, or persistent) than indolent tumors (confined to the gland, p = 0.029). Over time, six tumors recurred, five of which expressed IGF-I-R. Overall recurrence risk was significantly greater for tumors that expressed IGF-I-R (p = 0.05) but only approached statistical significance (p = 0.08) when disease-free survival was determined. We conclude that differentiated thyroid cancers of children and adolescents express IGF-I and IGF-I-R. Tumors that express IGF-I-R are more likely to show aggressive clinical features (invasion beyond the capsule, metastasis, or recurrence) and persistence despite treatment.",M2
14752883,"Differentiated thyroid carcinoma in childhood and adolescence-clinical course and role of radioiodine.BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in childhood has a good prognosis despite a high incidence of relapse. The use of radioactive iodine (RAI) has not been well established. PROCEDURE: This is a review of 60 patients less than 21 years of age; mean follow-up was 14 years. RESULTS: Patients had a higher relapse rate with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) than with follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>): 24.5 vs. 9.1%. Compared with 997 patients with age &gt; or = 21, patients &lt;21 years of age had a higher female to male ratio (7.6 vs. 3.9), higher incidence of nodal metastasis (45 vs. 28%), and lung metastasis (15 vs. 7.8%), and improved 10-year cause-specific survival (CSS) (98.3 vs. 89.5%). The 10-year rates of CSS, local-regional failure-free survival (LRFFS), and distant metastasis failure-free survival (DMFFS) for the young patients were 98.3, 79.3, and 90.7%, respectively. In patients with no distant metastasis at presentation, RAI improved 10-year LRFFS (71.9 vs. 86.5%; P = 0.04). At last follow-up, 10 of 12 patients (80%) with local-regional (LR) relapse and five of nine patients (55.6%) with distant metastasis were rendered disease-free. No patient has experienced a second malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of DTC in young patients was good. Patients with LR relapse and distant metastasis had a high rate of remission after treatment. RAI treatment can reduce the rate of LR relapse in patients with no distant metastasis and result in complete remission in half of those with distant metastasis. No patient experienced a second malignancy.",M2
14735198,"Chromosomal imbalances associated with anaplastic transformation of follicular thyroid carcinomas.The genetic alterations that underlie the progression of follicular thyroid carcinoma towards anaplasia are still largely uncharacterised.

We found: (i) when considering that a 'direct' transformation of FTC towards anaplasia occurs, the defined significantly important alterations were the increase of gains at 3q (P&lt;0.05) and 20q (P&lt;0.01), and the increase of losses at 7q (P&lt;0.05) and Xp (P&lt;0.01); (ii) regarding poorly differentiated carcinomas as an intermediate independent entity in the anaplastic transformation of follicular cancers, evidenced as important alterations towards anaplasia, were the proportional decrease in copy sequences at 7p, 7q, 12q and 13q resulting from the significant decrease of DNA gains at 7p and 12q (P&lt;0.05), and the significant increase of losses at 7q and 13q (P&lt;0.05). These results unveil the chromosomal regions where genes of interest in thyroid anaplastic transformation are to be located, and demonstrate that different gene dosage copy sequence imbalances are associated to the 'direct' pathway of transformation of follicular into anaplastic cancers and to the progressive FTC --&gt; PDTC --&gt; ATC pathway.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Forty-eight cytologic smears of the thyroid were divided into 3 groups according to the results of postoperative histopathologic examination: hyperplastic nodules in nodular goiter (NG) (20), follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) (20) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>) (8). They were silver stained. The slides were analyzed with a computerized system for image analysis. Nearly 20 variables describing AgNORs were calculated (related to the area of the dots, number of dots and intranuclear localization of the dots). RESULTS: Only assessment of the total area of AgNORs in the nucleus allowed distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. It was possible to determine the cutoff value of the total area of AgNORs in the nucleus (3.00 microns 2), limiting FTC from other lesions (observed ranges: NG, 1.64-2.87 microns 2; FTA, 1.81-2.85 microns 2; FTC, 3.01-3.97 microns 2). Evaluation of the mean number of AgNORs per nucleus did not improve the diagnosis of malignancy.

We investigated an expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in differentiated (DTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) and correlated the results with TNM categories and the clinical follow-up. METHODS: Tissue and blood samples of 32 patients with papillary (PTC), 17 patients with follicular (<e>FTC</e>), and 7 patients with ATC were obtained during operation and subjected to CK20 RT-PCR. RESULTS: An expression of CK20 transcripts was detected in 47% of the tissue samples of PTC, 71% of the FTC, and 14% of the ATC. Patients with CK20-positive FTC had a significantly better outcome than patients with CK20-negative FTCs (P=.0016). Disseminated tumor cells were found in 9 of 22 (41%) blood samples of patients with CK20-positive carcinomas. The detection of CK20 transcripts in peripheral blood correlated with tumor categories. Four of 8 (50%) patients with DTC and circulating tumor cells developed local or distant recurrence compared with 3 of 13 (23%) patients with CK20-positive carcinomas and CK20-negative blood samples. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CK20 might be a suitable differentiation marker in thyroid carcinomas. In patients with CK20-positive tumors, those with CK20-positive blood samples had a poorer prognosis. We suggest that patients with thyroid cancer with positive CK20 blood samples should be evaluated for further adjuvant therapies after surgery.",M2
14518260,"[Transfection of follicular thyroid gland carcinoma cells with human TSH receptor changes growth, invasion and adhesion]TSH is the classic stimulator of thyroid cell function. Clinically, treatment with thyroxin to suppress TSH decreased the risk of thyroid cancer recurrence and improved patient survival.

Wild type FTC lack TSH receptors and do not depend on TSH for growth. However, they contain thyroglobulin, have intact thyroid functions and response to TSH. We tested growth, invasion, and adhesion of transfected tumor cells (FTC-TSHr) compared to parental cells. All transfected FTC-TSHr expressed TSHr mRNA. Compared to wild type cells invasion and growth of TSHr-transfected FTC were significantly inhibited (p &lt; 0.001). All FTC adhered best to collagen IV and fibronectin. Compared to parental cells adhesion of unstimulated FTC-TSHr was significantly enhanced (p &lt; 0.001).

The goal of the current study was to add to the body of knowledge regarding local and distant metastases of thyroid malignancies. METHODS: The authors performed multivariate analysis of 573 patients who underwent surgery between November 1994 and May 2002 for follicular (<e>FTC</e>; n = 100), papillary (PTC; n = 236), or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; n = 237) at a university hospital. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, extrathyroidal extension consistently evolved as the key risk factor for both lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. This correlation was most pronounced in MTC and least pronounced in FTC. The risk of lymph node metastasis also increased with reoperative status in patients with MTC and with primary tumor diameter in patients with MTC (tumor diameter &gt; 10 mm) and patients with PTC (tumor diameter &gt; 20 mm). In the PTC group, lymph node metastasis was more common among patients younger than age 45. In the MTC group, extrathyroidal growth and distant metastasis were associated exclusively with lymph node metastasis. Lymph node metastasis was the only secondary risk factor for distant metastasis. In the analysis of risk factors for distant metastasis in the FTC and PTC groups, no interaction was found between extrathyroidal growth and lymph node metastasis. This finding suggests that extrathyroidal growth and lymph node metastasis of FTC and PTC, and presumably also MTC, represent separate mechanisms and routes of distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for both local residual disease and distant metastases should be intensified in the high-risk population of patients whose primary tumors exhibit large diameters, extrathyroidal growth, or lymph node metastasis.",M2
12845654,"Incidence and survival of Swedish patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.Papillary (PTC) and follicular (<e>FTC</e>) thyroid cancers are rare disorders but are, nevertheless, among the most common cancers in individuals below 40 years of age. From the population-based Swedish Cancer Registry we identified 3,588 individuals with PTC and 1,966 with FTC during 1958-87. Histopathology was determined by examining the original histopathology reports. The relative survival ratio (RSR) was used as the measure of patient survival. Incidence of both PTC and FTC was higher among women, especially for PTC and particularly during the fertile part of female life. Incidence of PTC increased significantly over time, a trend that was not observed for FTC. Five-year relative survival appeared to be higher for patients diagnosed with PTC compared to FTC, although this difference was almost completely explained by the confounding effect of age. Patients with PTC experience lower mortality during the period 7-20 years after diagnosis. Excess mortality was lower among women, although the magnitude of the difference varied with age and histopathology. In contrast to our perceptions based on clinical practice, we observed no difference in excess mortality between patients diagnosed with PTC and FTC during the years immediately after diagnosis (where the majority of deaths occur). Our data suggest that there may exist a subgroup of thyroid tumors with superior prognosis diagnosed in women during the fertile part of female life. Sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of these tumors.",M2
12843186,"The heat shock protein 90-binding geldanamycin inhibits cancer cell proliferation, down-regulates oncoproteins, and inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in thyroid cancer cell lines.Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) serves as a chaperone protein and plays a critical role in tumor cell growth and/or survival. Geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of HSP90, is cytotoxic to several human cancer cell lines, but its effect in thyroid cancer is unknown. We, therefore, investigated the effect of geldanamycin on cell proliferation, oncoprotein expression, and invasion in human thyroid cancer cell lines. We used six thyroid cancer cell lines: TPC-1 (papillary), <e>FTC</e>-133, FTC-236, FTC-238 (follicular), XTC-1 (Hürthle cell), and ARO (anaplastic). We used the dimethyl-thiazol-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a clonogenic assay, an apoptotic assay, and a Matrigel invasion assay. We evaluated oncoprotein expression using Western blots and flow cytometry. After 6 d of treatment with 50 nM geldanamycin, the percent inhibition of growth was 29.4% in TPC-1, 97.5% in FTC-133, 96.7% in FTC-236, 10.8% in FTC-238, 70.9% in XTC-1, and 45.5% in ARO cell lines. In the FTC-133 cell line, geldanamycin treatment decreased clonogenicity by 21% at a concentration of 50 nM; geldanamycin induced apoptosis and down-regulated c-Raf-1, mutant p53, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression; geldanamycin inhibited EGF-stimulated invasion. In conclusion, geldanamycin inhibited cancer cell proliferation, down-regulated oncoproteins, and inhibited EGF-induced invasion in thyroid cancer cell lines.",M2
14652809,"Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility in the histopathology of follicular thyroid carcinoma.We evaluated the interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility in the histopathology of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). Forty-one anonymous FTC pathology slides were independently reviewed by 5 pathologists, and 31 of them were also evaluated twice by the same pathologist. A final consensus diagnosis (FCD) was made at the end of the study. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was determined as the kappa statistic for qualitative data and intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative data. The agreement between the 5 observers' initial diagnosis and the FCD was 0.69, 0.41, 0.35, 0.28 and 0.11, respectively, strongly suggesting a leadership phenomenon. The FCD classified 30 cases as malignant, including 24 cases diagnosed as FTC. There was unanimous agreement about 13 of the 24 FTCs. Diagnostic reproducibility was found to be acceptable for the nonminimally invasive FTC. Diagnostic discrepancies occurred in 57% of the seven cases classified as minimally invasive FTC by the FCD. FCD excluded malignancy in 11 cases including 6 atypical adenomas. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for FTC diagnosis was 0.23 (standard error [SE], 0.04) and 0.68, respectively. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the presence of vascular invasion was 0.20 (SE, 0.04) and 0.51, respectively, contrasting with a moderate to substantial level of agreement when considering the number of vascular invasion. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for nucleus optical clearing were slight and moderate, respectively. The importance of the study is the confirmation that diagnostic reproducibility of minimally invasive FTC is low and that this has clinical implications, and also implications for the design of studies into the treatment and outcome of FTC.",M2
14605010,"sFlt-1 gene therapy of follicular thyroid carcinoma.Tumor progression largely depends on blood supply and neovessel formation, and angiogenesis is emerging as a promising target for cancer therapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major proangiogenic molecule, stimulates angiogenesis via promoting endothelial proliferation, survival and migration. VEGF has been found to be up-regulated in various types of tumors and to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Inhibition of VEGF or its signaling pathway has been shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the present study, we tested the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of soluble VEGF receptor-1 [soluble Flt (sFlt)-1] on the growth of follicular thyroid carcinoma (<e>FTC</e>). We constructed a 293 embryonic kidney cell line (293-Flt1-3d) that expresses sFlt-1, which is composed of the first three extracellular domains of Flt-1. The 293-Flt1-3d cells inhibited the in vitro growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a paracrine manner. The in vivo antitumor and antiangiogenic activities of the 293-Flt1-3d cells were tested. When 293-Flt1-3d cells were inoculated at a site remote to the FTC-133 tumor transplant, the growth of FTC-133 tumors were inhibited by 70.37%, as compared with the control treatment with 293 cells expressing control gene LacZ. Immunohistochemical analysis of microvessel densities in treated tumors demonstrated that 293-Flt1-3d cells robustly suppressed intratumoral angiogenesis. Our data suggest that a mammalian cell-mediated approach could effectively deliver sFlt-1 gene therapy and inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth.",M2
