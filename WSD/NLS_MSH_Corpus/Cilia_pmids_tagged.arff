20592197,"Retinal degeneration and failure of photoreceptor outer segment formation in mice with targeted deletion of the Joubert syndrome gene, Ahi1.Vertebrate photoreceptors have a modified cilium composed of a basal body, axoneme and outer segment. The outer segment includes stacked membrane discs, containing opsin and the signal transduction apparatus mediating phototransduction. In photoreceptors, two distinct classes of vesicles are trafficked. Synaptic vesicles are transported down the axon to the synapse, whereas opsin-containing vesicles are transported to the outer segment. The continuous replacement of the outer segments imposes a significant biosynthetic and trafficking burden on the photoreceptors. Here, we show that Ahi1, a gene that when mutated results in the neurodevelopmental disorder, Joubert syndrome (JBTS), is required for photoreceptor sensory <e>cilia</e> formation and the development of photoreceptor outer segments. In mice with a targeted deletion of Ahi1, photoreceptors undergo early degeneration. Whereas synaptic proteins are correctly trafficked, photoreceptor outer segment proteins fail to be transported appropriately or are significantly reduced in their expression levels (i.e., transducin and Rom1) in Ahi1(-/-) mice. We show that vesicular targeting defects in Ahi1(-/-) mice are cilium specific, and our evidence suggests that the defects are caused by a decrease in expression of the small GTPase Rab8a, a protein required for accurate polarized vesicular trafficking. Thus, our results suggest that Ahi1 plays a role in stabilizing the outer segment proteins, transducin and Rom1, and that Ahi1 is an important component of Rab8a-mediated vesicular trafficking in photoreceptors. The retinal degeneration observed in Ahi1(-/-) mice recapitulates aspects of the retinal phenotype observed in patients with JBTS and suggests the importance of Ahi1 in photoreceptor function.",M1
20530210,"The small GTPases ARL-13 and ARL-3 coordinate intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis.Intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery mediates the bidirectional movement of cargos that are required for the assembly and maintenance of <e>cilia</e>. However, little is known about how IFT is regulated in vivo. In this study, we show that the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-like protein 13 (ARL-13) encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of the human Joubert syndrome causal gene ARL13B, localizes exclusively to the doublet segment of the cilium. arl-13 mutants have shortened cilia with various ultrastructural deformities and a disrupted association between IFT subcomplexes A and B. Intriguingly, depletion of ARL-3, another ciliary small GTPase, partially suppresses ciliogenesis defects in arl-13 mutants by indirectly restoring binding between IFT subcomplexes A and B. Rescue of arl-13 mutants by ARL-3 depletion is mediated by an HDAC6 deacetylase-dependent pathway. Thus, we propose that two conserved small GTPases, ARL-13 and ARL-3, coordinate to regulate IFT and that perturbing this balance results in cilia deformation.",M1
20526328,"Ciliary entry of the kinesin-2 motor KIF17 is regulated by importin-beta2 and RanGTP.The biogenesis, maintenance and function of primary <e>cilia</e> are controlled through intraflagellar transport (IFT) driven by two kinesin-2 family members, the heterotrimeric KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP complex and the homodimeric KIF17 motor. How these motors and their cargoes gain access to the ciliary compartment is poorly understood. Here, we identify a ciliary localization signal (CLS) in the KIF17 tail domain that is necessary and sufficient for ciliary targeting. Similarities between the CLS and classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) suggest that similar mechanisms regulate nuclear and ciliary import. We hypothesize that ciliary targeting of KIF17 is regulated by a ciliary-cytoplasmic gradient of the small GTPase Ran, with high levels of GTP-bound Ran (RanGTP) in the cilium. Consistent with this, cytoplasmic expression of GTP-locked Ran(G19V) disrupts the gradient and abolishes ciliary entry of KIF17. Furthermore, KIF17 interacts with the nuclear import protein importin-beta2 in a manner dependent on the CLS and inhibited by RanGTP. We propose that Ran has a global role in regulating cellular compartmentalization by controlling the shuttling of cytoplasmic proteins into nuclear and ciliary compartments.",M1
20526327,"Nuclear transport receptor goes moonlighting.The importin-beta-like transport receptors and RanGTP govern selective transport of proteins into the nucleus. It has now been shown that importin-beta2 (alternatively called transportin1) also selectively targets the motor protein Kif17 to primary <e>cilia</e>. In analogy to the nucleus, RanGTP in the intraciliary compartment mediates dissociation of Kif17 from its transport receptor and thereby completes import.",M1
20512148,"DYRK1B-dependent autocrine-to-paracrine shift of Hedgehog signaling by mutant RAS.Synergism between the RAS and Hedgehog (HH) pathways has been suggested for carcinogenesis in the pancreas, lung and colon. We investigated the molecular cross-talk between RAS and HH signaling and found that, although mutant RAS induces or enhances SHH expression and favors paracrine HH signaling, it antagonizes autocrine HH signal transduction. Activated RAS can be found in primary <e>cilia</e>, the central organelle of HH signal transduction, but functions in a cilium-independent manner and interferes with Gli2 function and Gli3 processing. In addition, the cell-autonomous negative regulation of HH signal transduction involves the RAS effector molecule dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B). In line with a redirection of autocrine toward paracrine HH signaling by a KRAS-DYRK1B network, we find high levels of GLI1 expression restricted to the stromal compartment and not to SHH-expressing tumor cells in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",M1

20498083,"Regulation of a heterodimeric kinesin-2 through an unprocessive motor domain that is turned processive by its partner.<e>Cilia</e> are microtubule-based protrusions of the plasma membrane found on most eukaryotic cells. Their assembly is mediated through the conserved intraflagellar transport mechanism. One class of motor proteins involved in intraflagellar transport, kinesin-2, is unique among kinesin motors in that some of its members are composed of two distinct polypeptides. However, the biological reason for heterodimerization has remained elusive. Here we provide several interdependent reasons for the heterodimerization of the kinesin-2 motor KLP11/KLP20 of Caenorhabditis elegans cilia. One motor domain is unprocessive as a homodimer, but heterodimerization with a processive partner generates processivity. The  unprocessive  subunit is kept in this partnership as it mediates an asymmetric autoregulation of the motor activity. Finally, heterodimerization is necessary to bind KAP1, the in vivo link between motor and cargo.",M1
20498047,"Tubulin polyglutamylation is essential for airway ciliary function through the regulation of beating asymmetry.Airway epithelial <e>cilia</e> protect the mammalian respiratory system from harmful inhaled materials by providing the force necessary for effective mucociliary clearance. Ciliary beating is asymmetric, composed of clearly distinguished effective and recovery strokes. Neither the importance of nor the essential components responsible for the beating asymmetry has been directly elucidated. We report here that the beating asymmetry is crucial for ciliary function and requires tubulin glutamylation, a unique posttranslational modification that is highly abundant in cilia. WT murine tracheal cilia have an axoneme-intrinsic structural curvature that points in the direction of effective strokes. The axonemal curvature was lost in tracheal cilia from mice with knockout of a tubulin glutamylation-performing enzyme, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like protein 1. Along with the loss of axonemal curvature, the axonemes and tracheal epithelial cilia from these knockout (KO) mice lost beating asymmetry. The loss of beating asymmetry resulted in a reduction of cilia-generated fluid flow in trachea from the KO mice. The KO mice displayed a significant accumulation of mucus in the nasal cavity, and also emitted frequent coughing- or sneezing-like noises. Thus, the beating asymmetry is important for airway ciliary function. Our findings provide evidence that tubulin glutamylation is essential for ciliary function through the regulation of beating asymmetry, and provides insight into the molecular basis underlying the beating asymmetry.",M1
20479231,"Primary <e>cilia</e> regulate Gli/Hedgehog activation in pancreas.Previous studies have suggested that defects in pancreatic epithelium caused by activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway are secondary to changes in the differentiation state of the surrounding mesenchyme. However, recent results describe a role of the pathway in pancreatic epithelium, both during development and in adult tissue during neoplastic transformation. To determine the consequences of epithelial Hh activation during pancreas development, we employed a transgenic mouse model in which an activated version of GLI2, a transcriptional mediator of the pathway, is overexpressed specifically in the pancreatic epithelium. Surprisingly, efficient Hh activation was not observed in these transgenic mice, indicating the presence of physiological mechanisms within pancreas epithelium that prevent full Hh activation. Additional studies revealed that primary cilia regulate the level of Hh activation, and that ablation of these cellular organelles is sufficient to cause significant up-regulation of the Hh pathway in pancreata of mice overexpressing GLI2. As a consequence of overt Hh activation, we observe profound morphological changes in both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas. Increased Hh activity also induced the expansion of an undifferentiated cell population expressing progenitor markers. Thus, our findings suggest that Hh signaling plays a critical role in regulating pancreatic epithelial plasticity.",M1
20473291,"Lack of cadherins Celsr2 and Celsr3 impairs ependymal ciliogenesis, leading to fatal hydrocephalus.Ependymal cells form the epithelial lining of cerebral ventricles. Their apical surface is covered by <e>cilia</e> that beat in a coordinated fashion to facilitate circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The genetic factors that govern the development and function of ependymal cilia remain poorly understood. We found that the planar cell polarity cadherins Celsr2 and Celsr3 control these processes. In Celsr2-deficient mice, the development and planar organization of ependymal cilia are compromised, leading to defective CSF dynamics and hydrocephalus. In Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutant ependyma, ciliogenesis is markedly impaired, resulting in lethal hydrocephalus. The membrane distribution of Vangl2 and Fzd3, two key planar cell polarity proteins, was disturbed in Celsr2 mutants, and even more so in Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutants. Our findings suggest that planar cell polarity signaling is involved in ependymal cilia development and in the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus, with possible implications in other ciliopathies.",M1
20462968,"Nephrocystin-3 is required for ciliary function in zebrafish embryos.Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in the first three decades of life. It is characterized primarily by renal cysts with extrarenal involvements of the eye and brain. Ten recessive genes responsible for NPHP have been identified by positional cloning. This discovery supported a unifying theory of renal cystic disease, which states that all proteins mutated in cystic kidney diseases of human, mice, or zebrafish are expressed in primary <e>cilia</e> of renal epithelial cells. Mutations in nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3) are the cause of human nephronophthisis type 3 and polycystic kidney disease (pcy) mouse mutants. To study the functional role of NPHP3 in normal embryonic development and in the pathogenesis of cystic kidney disease, we characterized the zebrafish ortholog nphp3 by morpholino oligo (MO)-mediated knockdown. When nphp3 function was suppressed by either of the two MOs blocking the translation of the protein or the splicing of mRNA, zebrafish embryos displayed hydrocephalus and pronephric cysts. Knockdown of nphp3 also led to situs inversus phenotypes due to defective cilia at Kupffer's vesicle. We showed that nphp3 genetically interacts with nphp2/inversin and human NPHP3 localizes to primary cilia in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Like nphp2/inversin, nphp3 knockdown affected morphogenic cell movement during gastrulation, suggesting nphp3 is essential to regulate convergent extension. Thus nphp3, cooperating with nphp2/inversin, plays an essential role related to ciliary function, and the knockdown provides an animal model that may be used for studies of the pathogenesis and therapy for this disease.",M1
20457130,"The LIM protein Ajuba is required for ciliogenesis and left-right axis determination in medaka.<e>Cilia</e> are microtubule-based organelles that are present on the surfaces of almost all vertebrate cells. Most cilia function as sensory or molecular transport structures. Malfunctions of cilia have been implicated in several diseases of human development. The assembly of cilia is initiated by the centriole (or basal body), and several centrosomal proteins are involved in this process. The mammalian LIM protein Ajuba is a well-studied centrosomal protein that regulates cell division but its role in ciliogenesis is unknown. In this study, we isolated the medaka homolog of Ajuba and showed that Ajuba localizes to basal bodies of cilia in growth-arrested cells. Knockdown of Ajuba resulted in randomized left-right organ asymmetries and altered expression of early genes responsible for left-right body axis determination. At the cellular level, we found that Ajuba function was essential for ciliogenesis in the cells lining Kupffer's vesicle; it is these cells that induce the asymmetric fluid flow required for left-right axis determination. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role for Ajuba in the regulation of vertebrate ciliogenesis and left-right axis determination.",M1
20441589,"Convergent evolution of RFX transcription factors and ciliary genes predated the origin of metazoans.BACKGROUND: Intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes, which are critical for the development and function of <e>cilia</e> and flagella in metazoans, are tightly regulated by the Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors (TFs). However, how and when their evolutionary relationship was established remains unknown. RESULTS: We have identified evidence suggesting that RFX TFs and IFT genes evolved independently and their evolution converged before the first appearance of metazoans. Both ciliary genes and RFX TFs exist in all metazoans as well as some unicellular eukaryotes. However, while RFX TFs and IFT genes are found simultaneously in all sequenced metazoan genomes, RFX TFs do not co-exist with IFT genes in most pre-metazoans and thus do not regulate them in these organisms. For example, neither the budding yeast nor the fission yeast possesses cilia although both have well-defined RFX TFs. Conversely, most unicellular eukaryotes, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have typical cilia and well conserved IFT genes but lack RFX TFs. Outside of metazoans, RFX TFs and IFT genes co-exist only in choanoflagellates including M. brevicollis, and only one fungus Allomyces macrogynus of the 51 sequenced fungus genomes. M. brevicollis has two putative RFX genes and a full complement of ciliary genes. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of RFX TFs and IFT genes were independent in pre-metazoans. We propose that their convergence in evolution, or the acquired transcriptional regulation of IFT genes by RFX TFs, played a pivotal role in the establishment of metazoan.",M1
20439993,"The immunological synapse: a focal point for endocytosis and exocytosis.There are many different cells in the immune system. To mount an effective immune response, they need to communicate with each other. One way in which this is done is by the formation of immunological synapses between cells. Recent developments show that the immune synapse serves as a focal point for exocytosis and endocytosis, directed by centrosomal docking at the plasma membrane. In this respect, formation of the immunological synapse bears striking similarities to <e>cilia</e> formation and cytokinesis. These intriguing observations suggest that the centrosome may play a conserved role in designating a specialized area of membrane for localized endocytosis and exocytosis.",M1
20431476,"VHL-gene deletion in single renal tubular epithelial cells and renal tubular cysts: further evidence for a cyst-dependent progression pathway of clear cell renal carcinoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease.Inheritance of a mutant allele of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to develop renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Von Hippel-Lindau gene inactivation in single renal tubular cells has indirectly been showed by immunohistochemical staining for the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha target gene product carbonic anhydrase IX. In this study we were able to show von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion in carbonic anhydrase IX positive nonneoplastic renal tubular cells, in epithelial cells lining renal cysts and in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma of a von Hippel-Lindau patient. This was carried out by means of laser confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization. Carbonic anhydrase IX negative normal renal tubular cells carried no von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that the von Hippel-Lindau gene product is necessary for the maintenance of primary <e>cilia</e> stability in renal epithelial cells and that disruption of the cilia structure by von Hippel-Lindau gene inactivation induces renal cyst formation. In our study, we show a significant shortening of primary cilia in epithelial cells lining renal cysts, whereas, single tubular cells with a von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion display to a far lesser extent signs of cilia shortening. Our in vivo results support a model in which renal cysts represent precursor lesions for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and arise from single renal tubular epithelial cells owing to von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion.",M1
20421870,"Primary <e>cilia</e> organization reflects polarity in the growth plate and implies loss of polarity and mosaicism in osteochondroma.Primary cilia are specialized cell surface projections found on most cell types. Involved in several signaling pathways, primary cilia have been reported to modulate cell and tissue organization. Although they have been implicated in regulating cartilage and bone growth, little is known about the organization of primary cilia in the growth plate cartilage and osteochondroma. Osteochondromas are bone tumors formed along the growth plate, and they are caused by mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes. In this study, we show the organization of primary cilia within and between the zones of the growth plate and osteochondroma. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we found that in both tissues, primary cilia have a similar formation but a distinct organization. The shortest ciliary length is associated with the proliferative state of the cells, as confirmed by Ki-67 immunostaining. Primary cilia organization in the growth plate showed that non-polarized chondrocytes (resting zone) are becoming polarized (proliferating and hypertrophic zones), orienting the primary cilia parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bone. The alignment of primary cilia forms one virtual axis that crosses the center of the columns of chondrocytes reflecting the polarity axis of the growth plate. We also show that primary cilia in osteochondromas are found randomly located on the cell surface. Strikingly, the growth plate-like polarity was retained in sub-populations of osteochondroma cells that were organized into small columns. Based on this, we propose the existence of a mixture ('mosaic') of normal lining (EXT(+/-) or EXT(wt/wt)) and EXT(-/-) cells in the cartilaginous cap of osteochondromas.",M1
20421426,"Pcdp1 is a central apparatus protein that binds Ca(2+)-calmodulin and regulates ciliary motility.For all motile eukaryotic <e>cilia</e> and flagella, beating is regulated by changes in intraciliary calcium concentration. Although the mechanism for calcium regulation is not understood, numerous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is a key axonemal calcium sensor. Using anti-CaM antibodies and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii axonemal extracts, we precipitated a complex that includes four polypeptides and that specifically interacts with CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. One of the complex members, FAP221, is an orthologue of mammalian Pcdp1 (primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1). Both FAP221 and mammalian Pcdp1 specifically bind CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. Reduced expression of Pcdp1 complex members in C. reinhardtii results in failure of the C1d central pair projection to assemble and significant impairment of motility including uncoordinated bends, severely reduced beat frequency, and altered waveforms. These combined results reveal that the central pair Pcdp1 (FAP221) complex is essential for control of ciliary motility.",M1

20413791,"Capture of particles by direct interception by <e>cilia</e> during feeding of a gastropod veliger.Ciliary feeders vary in the arrangement of ciliary bands and mechanisms of capture of food. Some larvae use opposed parallel bands of preoral (prototroch) and postoral (metatroch) cilia. Hypotheses for the mechanism of particle capture include filtration by adhesion to a cilium that overtakes a particle (direct interception), but until now unequivocal evidence for this mechanism has been lacking. Here, high-speed video recordings of veliger larvae of the gastropod Lacuna vincta demonstrated direct interception of particles by prototrochal cilia. Adhesion between cilium and particle was seen when a prototrochal cilium tugged a diatom chain into the food groove while in contact with one part of the chain. In several recorded events, a prototochal cilium overtook a particle during its effective stroke and subsequently pulled the particle inward with its recovery stroke; thereupon, the particle was deposited onto the food groove and transported to the mouth. Captures varied, however. In some cases the particle was intercepted multiple times in one capture event; in others, several cilia passed a particle without interception. Particles occasionally remained in the area of recovery strokes, indicating retention without continuing adhesion to a cilium. In three events, a particle lost from prototrochal cilia was intercepted and moved into the food groove by metatrochal cilia. Particles as wide as or wider than the food groove were also captured and transported but were not ingested.",M1
20412742,"[Centrosomes, mitotic spindle and cancer: find the odd one out!]Centrosomes are essential protagonists during cell division through microtubule nucleation and spindle formation which are key to the harmonious distribution of sister chromatids in the two daughter cells. However, during the past decade, a wealth of new observations has extended their role beyond mitosis, particularly in the asymmetrical partition of cell fate determinants. Remarkably, asymmetric centrosome inheritance per se, through the segregation of differently aged mother -centrioles, seems to regulate the differential behaviour of daughter cells, in part through asynchronous expression of primary <e>cilia</e>, governing the response to environmental signals. It is thus understandable why any quantitative or qualitative dysfunction of centrioles contributes to genomic -instability and thus -tumorigenesis.",M1
20398886,"Discovery and functional analysis of a retinitis pigmentosa gene, C2ORF71.Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited ocular disorders characterized by progressive photoreceptor cell loss, night blindness, constriction of the visual field, and progressive visual disability. Homozygosity mapping and gene expression studies identified a 2 exon gene, C2ORF71. The encoded protein has no homologs and is highly expressed in the eye, where it is specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells. Two mutations were found in C2ORF71 in human RP patients: A nonsense mutation (p.W253X) in the first exon is likely to be a null allele; the second, a missense mutation (p.I201F) within a highly conserved region of the protein, leads to proteosomal degradation. Bioinformatic and functional studies identified and validated sites of lipid modification within the first three amino acids of the C2ORF71 protein. Using morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown c2orf71 expression in zebrafish results in visual defects, confirming that C2ORF71 plays an important role in the development of normal vision. Finally, localization of C2ORF71 to primary <e>cilia</e> in cultured cells suggests that the protein is likely to localize to the connecting cilium or outer segment of photoreceptor cells.",M1
20395968,"The primary cilium: a signalling centre during vertebrate development.The primary cilium has recently stepped into the spotlight, as a flood of data show that this organelle has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. <e>Cilia</e> are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialized for hedgehog signal transduction. The formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway.

The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction.",M1
20393563,"Functional genomic screen for modulators of ciliogenesis and cilium length.Primary <e>cilia</e> are evolutionarily conserved cellular organelles that organize diverse signalling pathways. Defects in the formation or function of primary cilia are associated with a spectrum of human diseases and developmental abnormalities. Genetic screens in model organisms have discovered core machineries of cilium assembly and maintenance. However, regulatory molecules that coordinate the biogenesis of primary cilia with other cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking and cell-cell adhesion, remain to be identified. Here we report the results of a functional genomic screen using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify human genes involved in ciliogenesis control. The screen identified 36 positive and 13 negative ciliogenesis modulators, which include molecules involved in actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Further investigation demonstrated that blocking actin assembly facilitates ciliogenesis by stabilizing the pericentrosomal preciliary compartment (PPC), a previously uncharacterized compact vesiculotubular structure storing transmembrane proteins destined for cilia during the early phase of ciliogenesis. The PPC was labelled by recycling endosome markers. Moreover, knockdown of modulators that are involved in the endocytic recycling pathway affected the formation of the PPC as well as ciliogenesis. Our results uncover a critical regulatory step that couples actin dynamics and endocytic recycling with ciliogenesis, and also provides potential target molecules for future study.",M1
20392268,"Osteocyte primary cilium and its role in bone mechanotransduction.Bone is a dynamic tissue that adapts to its local loading environment. Mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical forces into biochemical signals, is important for maintaining bone health and homeostasis. It is less clear, however, what the cellular mechanosensor(s) are that sense and initiate these signaling cascades. Primary <e>cilia</e> are solitary rigid structures that extend from the cell body into the extracellular space and as a consequence are prime candidates for mechanosensing in bone.

20392267,"Role of the polycytin-primary <e>cilia</e> complex in bone development and mechanosensing.Pkd1 encodes PC1, a transmembrane receptor-like protein, and Pkd2 encodes PC2, a calcium channel, which interact to form functional polycystin complexes that are widely expressed in many tissues and cell types. The study of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), caused by inactivating mutations of PKD1 or PKD2 genes, has elucidated the functions of polycystins and their interdependence on primary cilia in renal epithelial cells. We have found that Pkd1 and Pkd2, as well as primary cilia, are present in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In addition, we have found that loss of polycystin-1 (Pkd1) function in mice results in abnormal bone development and osteopenia due to the impaired differentiation of osteoblasts. It is likely that the polycytin/primary cilia complex responds to a multitude of environmental clues affecting skeletal development and bone formation postnatally.

20388734,"Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the centriole from protein components.Centrioles are highly conserved structures that fulfil important cellular functions, such as nucleation of <e>cilia</e> and flagella (basal-body function) and organisation of pericentriolar material to form the centrosome. The evolution of these functions can be inferred from the distribution of the molecular components of extant centrioles and centrosomes. Here, we undertake an evolutionary analysis of 53 proteins known either for centriolar association or for involvement in cilia-associated pathologies. By linking protein distribution in 45 diverse eukaryotes with organism biology, we provide molecular evidence to show that basal-body function is ancestral, whereas the presence of the centrosome is specific to the Holozoa. We define an ancestral centriolar inventory of 14 core proteins, Polo-like-kinase, and proteins associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Meckel-Gruber syndrome. We show that the BBSome is absent from organisms that produce cilia only for motility, predicting a dominant and ancient role for this complex in sensory function. We also show that the unusual centriole of Caenorhabditis elegans is highly divergent in both protein composition and sequence. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation between the presence of specific centriolar proteins and eye evolution. This correlation is used to predict proteins with functions in the development of ciliary, but not rhabdomeric, eyes.",M1
20385848,"Hydrodynamic synchronization of colloidal oscillators.Two colloidal spheres are maintained in oscillation by switching the position of an optical trap when a sphere reaches a limit position, leading to oscillations that are bounded in amplitude but free in phase and period. The interaction between the oscillators is only through the hydrodynamic flow induced by their motion. We prove that in the absence of stochastic noise the antiphase dynamical state is stable, and we show how the period depends on coupling strength. Both features are observed experimentally. As the natural frequencies of the oscillators are made progressively different, the coordination is quickly lost. These results help one to understand the origin of hydrodynamic synchronization and how the dynamics can be tuned. <e>Cilia</e> and flagella are biological systems coupled hydrodynamically, exhibiting dramatic collective motions. We propose that weakly correlated phase fluctuations, with one of the oscillators typically processing the other, are characteristic of hydrodynamically coupled systems in the presence of thermal noise.",M1
20368623,"Intraflagellar transport molecules in ciliary and nonciliary cells of the retina.The assembly and maintenance of <e>cilia</e> require intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process mediated by molecular motors and IFT particles. Although IFT is a focus of current intense research, the spatial distribution of individual IFT proteins remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of IFT proteins in retinal cells by high resolution immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. We report that IFT proteins are differentially localized in subcompartments of photoreceptor cilia and in defined periciliary target domains for cytoplasmic transport, where they are associated with transport vesicles. IFT20 is not in the IFT core complex in photoreceptor cilia but accompanies Golgi-based sorting and vesicle trafficking of ciliary cargo. Moreover, we identify a nonciliary IFT system containing a subset of IFT proteins in dendrites of retinal neurons. Collectively, we provide evidence to implicate the differential composition of IFT systems in cells with and without primary cilia, thereby supporting new functions for IFT beyond its well-established role in cilia.",M1

Synchronization is only observed when the shafts supporting the paddles have some flexibility. The phase difference in the synchronized state depends on the symmetry of the paddles.

We also use a simple analytic theory based on far-field approximations to derive scaling laws for the synchronization time as a function of paddle separation.",M1

20351061,"Olfactory response termination involves Ca2+-ATPase in vertebrate olfactory receptor neuron <e>cilia</e>.In vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), odorant-induced activation of the transduction cascade culminates in production of cyclic AMP, which opens cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in the ciliary membrane enabling Ca(2+) influx. The ensuing elevation of the intraciliary Ca(2+) concentration opens Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels, which mediate an excitatory Cl(-) efflux from the cilia. In order for the response to terminate, the Cl(-) channel must close, which requires that the intraciliary Ca(2+) concentration return to basal levels. Hitherto, the extrusion of Ca(2+) from the cilia has been thought to depend principally on a Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger. In this study, we show using simultaneous suction pipette recording and Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fluorescence measurements that in fire salamander ORNs, withdrawal of external Na(+) from the solution bathing the cilia, which incapacitates Na(+)-Ca(2+)exchange, has only a modest effect on the recovery of the electrical response and the accompanying decay of intraciliary Ca(2+) concentration. In contrast, exposure of the cilia to vanadate or carboxyeosin, a manipulation designed to block Ca(2+)-ATPase, has a substantial effect on response recovery kinetics. Therefore, we conclude that Ca(2+)-ATPase contributes to Ca(2+) extrusion in ORNs, and that Na(+)-Ca(2+)exchange makes only a modest contribution to Ca(2+) homeostasis in this species.",M1

These microtubule-based organelles are important in brain development and neurogenesis; however, their function in mature neurons is unknown. Cilia express a complement of proteins distinct from other neuronal compartments, one of which is the somatostatin receptor subtype SST(3). We show here that SST(3) is critical for object recognition memory in mice. sst3 knock-out mice are severely impaired in discriminating novel objects, whereas they retain normal memory for object location. Further, systemic injection of an SST(3) antagonist (ACQ090) disrupts recall of familiar objects in wild-type mice. To examine mechanisms of SST(3), we tested synaptic plasticity in CA1 hippocampus. Electrically evoked long-term potentiation (LTP) was normal in sst3 knock-out mice, while adenylyl cyclase/cAMP-mediated LTP was impaired. The SST(3) antagonist also disrupted cAMP-mediated LTP. Basal cAMP levels in hippocampal lysate were reduced in sst3 knock-out mice compared with wild-type mice, while the forskolin-induced increase in cAMP levels was normal. The SST(3) antagonist inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP increases, whereas the SST(3) agonist L-796,778 increased basal cAMP levels in hippocampal slices but not hippocampal lysate. Our results show that somatostatin signaling in neuronal cilia is critical for recognition memory and suggest that the cAMP pathway is a conserved signaling motif in cilia. Neuronal cilia therefore represent a novel nonsynaptic compartment crucial for signaling involved in a specific form of synaptic plasticity and in novelty detection.",M1
20308558,"Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Primary <e>cilia</e> are microtubule-based membrane projections located at the surface of many cells. Defects in primary cilia formation have been implicated in a number of genetic disorders, such as Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that polarized vesicular transport involving Rab8 and its guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Rabin8 is essential for primary ciliogenesis. Here we report that Rabin8 is a direct downstream effector of Rab11, which functions in membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes. Rab11, in its GTP-bound form, interacts with Rabin8 and kinetically stimulates the guanine nucleotide-exchange activity of Rabin8 toward Rab8. Rab11 is enriched at the base of the primary cilia and inhibition of Rab11 function by a dominant-negative mutant or RNA interference blocks primary ciliogenesis. Our results suggest that Rab GTPases coordinate with each other in the regulation of vesicular trafficking during primary ciliogenesis.",M1
20305650,"Coupling between hydrodynamic forces and planar cell polarity orients mammalian motile <e>cilia</e>.In mammals, motile cilia cover many organs, such as fallopian tubes, respiratory tracts and brain ventricles. The development and function of these organs critically depend on efficient directional fluid flow ensured by the alignment of ciliary beating. To identify the mechanisms involved in this process, we analysed motile cilia of mouse brain ventricles, using biophysical and molecular approaches. Our results highlight an original orientation mechanism for ependymal cilia whereby basal bodies first dock apically with random orientations, and then reorient in a common direction through a coupling between hydrodynamic forces and the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Vangl2, within a limited time-frame. This identifies a direct link between external hydrodynamic cues and intracellular PCP signalling. Our findings extend known PCP mechanisms by integrating hydrodynamic forces as long-range polarity signals, argue for a possible sensory role of ependymal cilia, and will be of interest for the study of fluid flow-mediated morphogenesis.",M1
20305649,"Vangl2 directs the posterior tilting and asymmetric localization of motile primary <e>cilia</e>.Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that project into the extracellular space, function in the perception and integration of environmental cues, and regulate Hedgehog signal transduction. The emergent association of ciliary defects with diverse and pleiotropic human disorders has fuelled investigations into the molecular genetic regulation of ciliogenesis. Although recent studies implicate planar cell polarity (PCP) in cilia formation, this conclusion is based on analyses of proteins that are not specific to, or downstream effectors of PCP signal transduction. Here we characterize zebrafish embryos devoid of all Vangl2 function, a core and specific component of the PCP signalling pathway. Using Arl13b-GFP as a live marker of the ciliary axoneme, we demonstrate that Vangl2 is not required for ciliogenesis. Instead, Vangl2 controls the posterior tilting of primary motile cilia lining the neurocoel, Kupffer's vesicle and pronephric duct. Furthermore, we show that Vangl2 is required for asymmetric localization of cilia to the posterior apical membrane of neuroepithelial cells. Our results indicate a broad and essential role for PCP in the asymmetric localization and orientation of motile primary cilia, establishing directional fluid flow implicated in normal embryonic development and disease.",M1
20300952,"Centrioles: active players or passengers during mitosis?Centrioles are cylinders made of nine microtubule (MT) triplets present in many eukaryotes. Early studies, where centrosomes were seen at the poles of the mitotic spindle led to their coining as  the organ for cell division . However, a variety of subsequent observational and functional studies showed that centrosomes might not always be essential for mitosis. Here we review the arguments in this debate. We describe the centriole structure and its distribution in the eukaryotic tree of life and clarify its role in the organization of the centrosome and <e>cilia</e>, with an historical perspective. An important aspect of the debate addressed in this review is how centrioles are inherited and the role of the spindle in this process. In particular, germline inheritance of centrosomes, such as their de novo formation in parthenogenetic species, poses many interesting questions. We finish by discussing the most likely functions of centrioles and laying out new research avenues.",M1

20231443,"Molecular components of signal amplification in olfactory sensory <e>cilia</e>.The mammalian olfactory system detects an unlimited variety of odorants with a limited set of odorant receptors. To cope with the complexity of the odor world, each odorant receptor must detect many different odorants. The demand for low odor selectivity creates problems for the transduction process: the initial transduction step, the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP, operates with low efficiency, mainly because odorants bind only briefly to their receptors. Sensory cilia of olfactory receptor neurons have developed an unusual solution to this problem. They accumulate chloride ions at rest and discharge a chloride current upon odor detection. This chloride current amplifies the receptor potential and promotes electrical excitation. We have studied this amplification process by examining identity, subcellular localization, and regulation of its molecular components. We found that the Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1 is expressed in the ciliary membrane, where it mediates chloride accumulation into the ciliary lumen. Gene silencing experiments revealed that the activity of this transporter depends on the kinases SPAK and OSR1, which are enriched in the cilia together with their own activating kinases, WNK1 and WNK4. A second Cl(-) transporter, the Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger SLC4A1, is expressed in the cilia and may support Cl(-) accumulation. The calcium-dependent chloride channel TMEM16B (ANO2) provides a ciliary pathway for the excitatory chloride current. These findings describe a specific set of ciliary proteins involved in anion-based signal amplification. They provide a molecular concept for the unique strategy that allows olfactory sensory neurons to operate as efficient transducers of weak sensory stimuli.",M1
20219615,"Molecular advances in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.Autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of inherited kidney disease that results in renal failure. The understanding of the pathogenesis of ADPKD has advanced significantly since the discovery of the 2 causative genes, PKD1 and PKD2. Dominantly inherited gene mutations followed by somatic second-hit mutations inactivating the normal copy of the respective gene result in renal tubular cyst formation that deforms the kidney and eventually impairs its function. The respective gene products, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, work together in a common cellular pathway. Polycystin-1, a large receptor molecule, forms a receptor-channel complex with polycystin-2, which is a cation channel belonging to the TRP family. Both polycystin proteins have been localized to the primary cilium, a nonmotile microtubule-based structure that extends from the apical membrane of tubular cells into the lumen. Here we discuss recent insights in the pathogenesis of ADPKD including the genetics of ADPKD, the properties of the respective polycystin proteins, the role of <e>cilia</e>, and some cell-signaling pathways that have been implicated in the pathways related to PKD1 and PKD2.",M1

20210445,"Use of optical tweezers to probe epithelial mechanosensation.Cellular mechanosensation mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of disease states. Specifically in renal tubules, the primary cilium and associated mechanosensitive ion channels are hypothesized to play a role in water and salt homeostasis, with relevant disease states including polycystic kidney disease and hypertension. Previous experiments investigating ciliary-mediated cellular mechanosensation have used either fluid flow chambers or micropipetting to elicit a biological response. The interpretation of these experiments in terms of the  ciliary hypothesis  has been difficult due the spatially distributed nature of the mechanical disturbance-several competing hypotheses regarding possible roles of primary cilium, glycocalyx, microvilli, cell junctions, and actin cytoskeleton exist. I report initial data using optical tweezers to manipulate individual primary <e>cilia</e> in an attempt to elicit a mechanotransduction response-specifically, the release of intracellular calcium. The advantage of using laser tweezers over previous work is that the applied disturbance is highly localized. I find that stimulation of a primary cilium elicits a response, while stimulation of the apical surface membrane does not. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the primary cilium mediates transduction of mechanical strain into a biochemical response in renal epithelia.",M1
20207729,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome-associated small GTPase ARL6 (BBS3) functions at or near the ciliary gate and modulates Wnt signaling.The expansive family of metazoan ADP-ribosylation factor and ADP-ribosylation factor-like small GTPases is known to play essential roles in modulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal functions. Here, we present the crystal structure of ARL6, mutations in which cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS3), and reveal its unique ring-like localization at the distal end of basal bodies, in proximity to the so-called ciliary gate where vesicles carrying ciliary cargo fuse with the membrane. Overproduction of GDP- or GTP-locked variants of ARL6/BBS3 in vivo influences primary cilium length and abundance. ARL6/BBS3 also modulates Wnt signaling, a signal transduction pathway whose association with <e>cilia</e> in vertebrates is just emerging. Importantly, this signaling function is lost in ARL6 variants containing BBS-associated point mutations. By determining the structure of GTP-bound ARL6/BBS3, coupled with functional assays, we provide a mechanistic explanation for such pathogenic alterations, namely altered nucleotide binding. Our findings therefore establish a previously unknown role for ARL6/BBS3 in mammalian ciliary (dis)assembly and Wnt signaling and provide the first structural information for a BBS protein.",M1

Attached spirochetes form a vestment, a wriggling fringe of motile cells at the edge of the plasma membrane of unidentified cellulolytic protist cells in the hypertrophied hindgut of the digestive system of Mastotermes darwiniensis, the large wood-feeding termite from northern Australia. From the membrane extend both undulipodia and a complex of comparably sized (10-12 microm x 0.2-0.3 microm) ectosymbiotic spirochetes that resembles unruly ciliated epithelium. In the intestines are helical (swimming) and round-body morphotypes. Round bodies (RBs) are slow or immotile spirochetes, propagules known to revert to typical swimming helices under culture conditions favorable for growth. The surfaces of both the spirochete gram-negative eubacteria and the parabasalid protists display distinctive attachment structures. The attached hypertrophied structures, some of which resemble ciliate kinetids, are found consistently at sites where the spirochete termini contact the protist plasma membranes.",M1
20203249,"Contrary effects of octopamine receptor ligands on behavioral and neuronal changes in locomotion of lymnaea.The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis moves along the sides and bottom of an aquarium, but it can also glide upside down on its back below the water's surface. We have termed these two forms of locomotion  standard locomotion  and  upside-down gliding,  respectively. Previous studies showed that standard locomotion is produced by both <e>cilia</e> activity on the foot and peristaltic contraction of the foot muscles, whereas upside-down gliding is mainly caused by cilia activity. The pedal A neurons are thought to receive excitatory octopaminergic input, which ultimately results in increased cilia beating. However, the relationship between locomotory speed and the responses of these neurons to octopamine is not known. We thus examined the effects of both an agonist and an antagonist of octopamine receptors on locomotory speed and the firing rate of the pedal A neurons. We also examined, at the electron and light-microscopic levels, whether structural changes occur in cilia following the application of either an agonist or an antagonist of octopamine receptors to the central nervous system (CNS). We found that the application of an octopamine antagonist to the CNS increased the speed of both forms of locomotion, whereas application of octopamine increased only the firing rate of the pedal A neurons. Microscopic examination of the cilia proved that there were no changes in their morphology after application of octopamine ligands. These data suggest that there is an unidentified octopaminergic neuronal network in the CNS whose activation reduces cilia movement and thus locomotory speed.",M1
20189389,"Tubulin glutamylation regulates ciliary motility by altering inner dynein arm activity.How microtubule-associated motor proteins are regulated is not well understood. A potential mechanism for spatial regulation of motor proteins is provided by posttranslational modifications of tubulin subunits that form patterns on microtubules. Glutamylation is a conserved tubulin modification [1] that is enriched in axonemes. The enzymes responsible for this posttranslational modification, glutamic acid ligases (E-ligases), belong to a family of proteins with a tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) homology domain (TTL-like or TTLL proteins) [2]. We show that in <e>cilia</e> of Tetrahymena, TTLL6 E-ligases generate glutamylation mainly on the B-tubule of outer doublet microtubules, the site of force production by ciliary dynein. Deletion of two TTLL6 paralogs caused severe deficiency in ciliary motility associated with abnormal waveform and reduced beat frequency. In isolated axonemes with a normal dynein arm composition, TTLL6 deficiency did not affect the rate of ATP-induced doublet microtubule sliding. Unexpectedly, the same TTLL6 deficiency increased the velocity of microtubule sliding in axonemes that also lack outer dynein arms, in which forces are generated by inner dynein arms. We conclude that tubulin glutamylation on the B-tubule inhibits the net force imposed on sliding doublet microtubules by inner dynein arms.",M1
20179356,"Individuals with mutations in XPNPEP3, which encodes a mitochondrial protein, develop a nephronophthisis-like nephropathy.The autosomal recessive kidney disease nephronophthisis (NPHP) constitutes the most frequent genetic cause of terminal renal failure in the first 3 decades of life. Ten causative genes (NPHP1-NPHP9 and NPHP11), whose products localize to the primary <e>cilia</e>-centrosome complex, support the unifying concept that cystic kidney diseases are  ciliopathies . Using genome-wide homozygosity mapping, we report here what we believe to be a new locus (NPHP-like 1 [NPHPL1]) for an NPHP-like nephropathy. In 2 families with an NPHP-like phenotype, we detected homozygous frameshift and splice-site mutations, respectively, in the X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3 (XPNPEP3) gene. In contrast to all known NPHP proteins, XPNPEP3 localizes to mitochondria of renal cells. However, in vivo analyses also revealed a likely cilia-related function; suppression of zebrafish xpnpep3 phenocopied the developmental phenotypes of ciliopathy morphants, and this effect was rescued by human XPNPEP3 that was devoid of a mitochondrial localization signal. Consistent with a role for XPNPEP3 in ciliary function, several ciliary cystogenic proteins were found to be XPNPEP3 substrates, for which resistance to N-terminal proline cleavage resulted in attenuated protein function in vivo in zebrafish. Our data highlight an emerging link between mitochondria and ciliary dysfunction, and suggest that further understanding the enzymatic activity and substrates of XPNPEP3 will illuminate novel cystogenic pathways.",M1

Driven largely by an ever increasing number of discoveries of genetic defects in primary cilia during the past decade, cilia were catapulted from a long lasting existence in obscurity into the bright spotlight in cell biology and medicine. The study by O'Toole et al. in this issue of the JCI adds a novel  enzymatic  facet to the rapidly growing information about these little cellular tails, by demonstrating that defects in the XPNPEP3 gene, which encodes mitochondrial and cytosolic splice variants of X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3, can cause nephronophthisis-like ciliopathy. Future studies are in order now to elucidate the cystogenic pathways affected by disrupted enzymatic function of XPNPEP3 in cilia-related cystogenic diseases.",M1
20176505,"Multiple uses of Lys63-polyubiquitination in the ciliate Sterkiella histriomuscorum.Poly-ubiquitination through Lys63, a post-translational modification system, is emerging as a mechanism implicated in a variety of non-proteolytic functions in eukaryotic cells. This modification is mainly carried out via a unique complex formed between a canonical ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), Ubc13, and an E2-variant, Uev. To date, a wealth of functional information has been obtained mostly from animals and yeast. Here, we show that the ciliate Sterkiella histriomuscorum harbors a Ubc13 gene that encodes a putative protein exhibiting 60-64% identity with Ubc13 from organisms of diverse eukaryotic phyla. A yeast double-hybrid assay and 3D-structure modelling gave evidence that ShUbc13 is able to physically interact with ShUev; the existence of such a complex in a ciliate attests for its ancient origin. Western blotting reveals that Ubc13 is present in different stages of the vegetative cycle of S. histriomuscorum. Immunolocalization of Ubc13 and K63 polyubiquitinated proteins shows three main locations, namely the nucleus, <e>cilia</e> and plasma membrane. Possible functions of ShUbc13 and K63 polyubiquitination in this single-celled organism are considered with reference to current knowledge. In particular their likely involvement in DNA replication and DNA damage response is especially discussed.",M1
20172860,"Uromodulin is expressed in renal primary <e>cilia</e> and UMOD mutations result in decreased ciliary uromodulin expression.Uromodulin (UMOD) mutations are responsible for three autosomal dominant tubulo-interstitial nephropathies including medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 (MCKD2), familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy and glomerulocystic kidney disease. Symptoms include renal salt wasting, hyperuricemia, gout, hypertension and end-stage renal disease. MCKD is part of the 'nephronophthisis-MCKD complex', a group of cystic kidney diseases. Both disorders have an indistinguishable histology and renal cysts are observed in either. For most genes mutated in cystic kidney disease, their proteins are expressed in the primary cilia/basal body complex. We identified seven novel UMOD mutations and were interested if UMOD protein was expressed in the primary renal cilia of human renal biopsies and if mutant UMOD would show a different expression pattern compared with that seen in control individuals. We demonstrate that UMOD is expressed in the primary cilia of renal tubules, using immunofluorescent studies in human kidney biopsy samples. The number of UMOD-positive primary cilia in UMOD patients is significantly decreased when compared with control samples. Additional immunofluorescence studies confirm ciliary expression of UMOD in cell culture. Ciliary expression of UMOD is also confirmed by electron microscopy. UMOD localization at the mitotic spindle poles and colocalization with other ciliary proteins such as nephrocystin-1 and kinesin family member 3A is demonstrated. Our data add UMOD to the group of proteins expressed in primary cilia, where mutations of the gene lead to cystic kidney disease.",M1
20169535,"Inv acts as a molecular anchor for Nphp3 and Nek8 in the proximal segment of primary <e>cilia</e>.A primary cilium is an antenna-like structure extending from the surface of most vertebrate cells. It is structurally divided along its vertical axis into sub-compartments that include the ciliary tip, the shaft, the ciliary necklace segment, the transitional zone and the basal body. We recently discovered that the shaft of the primary cilia has a distinct molecular compartment, termed the  Inv compartment , which is characterized by the accumulation of Inv at the base of primary cilia. Inv was discovered as a causative gene in inv mutant mice. It was later found to be responsible for the infantile type of nephronophthisis (NPHP2). Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive kidney disease. Nine causative genes have been identified, with all examined products thought to function in cilia, basal body and/or centrioles. However, their exact intra-ciliary localization and relationship have not been clear. Here, we report that products of Nphp3 and Nek8 (the mouse orthologs of the causative genes for NPHP3 and NPHP9, respectively) localize to the Inv compartment. We also show that Inv is essential for the compartmental localization of Nphp3 and Nek8, whereas localization of Inv does not require Nphp3 or Nek8. Nphp1 and Nphp4 also localize at the proximal region of the cilium, but not in Inv compartment. Our results indicate that Inv acts as an anchor for Nphp3 and Nek8 in the Inv compartment, and suggest that Inv compartment is a candidate site for intra-ciliary interaction of Inv, Nphp3 and Nek8.",M1
20164345,"<e>Cilia</e> organize ependymal planar polarity.Multiciliated epithelial cells, called ependymal cells, line the ventricles in the adult brain. Most ependymal cells are born prenatally and are derived from radial glia. Ependymal cells have a remarkable planar polarization that determines orientation of ciliary beating and propulsion of CSF. Disruption of ependymal ciliary beating, by injury or disease, results in aberrant CSF circulation and hydrocephalus, a common disorder of the CNS. Very little is known about the mechanisms guiding ependymal planar polarity and whether this organization is acquired during ependymal cell development or is already present in radial glia. Here we show that basal bodies in ependymal cells in the lateral ventricle walls of adult mice are polarized in two ways: (1) rotational; angle of individual basal bodies with respect to their long axis and (2) translational; the position of basal bodies on the apical surface of the cell. Conditional ablation of motile cilia disrupted rotational orientation, but translational polarity was largely preserved. In contrast, translational polarity was dramatically affected when radial glial primary cilia were ablated earlier in development. Remarkably, radial glia in the embryo have a translational polarity that predicts the orientation of mature ependymal cells. These results suggest that ependymal planar cell polarity is a multistep process initially organized by primary cilia in radial glia and then refined by motile cilia in ependymal cells.",M1
20159594,"Broad-minded links cell cycle-related kinase to <e>cilia</e> assembly and hedgehog signal transduction.Recent findings indicate that mammalian Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal transduction occurs within primary cilia, although the cell biological mechanisms underlying both Shh signaling and ciliogenesis have not been fully elucidated. We show that an uncharacterized TBC domain-containing protein, Broad-minded (Bromi), is required for high-level Shh responses in the mouse neural tube. We find that Bromi controls ciliary morphology and proper Gli2 localization within the cilium. By use of a zebrafish model, we further show that Bromi is required for proper association between the ciliary membrane and axoneme. Bromi physically interacts with cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK), whose Chlamydomonas homolog regulates flagellar length. Biochemical and genetic interaction data indicate that Bromi promotes CCRK stability and function. We propose that Bromi and CCRK control the structure of the primary cilium by coordinating assembly of the axoneme and ciliary membrane, allowing Gli proteins to be properly activated in response to Shh signaling.",M1
20157713,"Muscular waves contribute to gliding rate in the freshwater gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis.This study revises the mechanisms of ciliary locomotion and demonstrates muscular contribution to locomotion rate in Lymnaea stagnalis. L. stagnalis sticks to the substratum by the foot sole and moves smoothly with no visible contractions of the foot. A ciliated epithelium covering the sole is underlain by smooth muscle cells containing giant mitochondria. It is shown here that slow (basal) locomotor activity (measured as the flow rate of physiological saline over isolated sole) appears spontaneously or is induced by 10(-8)-10(-7) M 5-HT. 5-HT (10(-7)-10(-4) M) facilitates locomotor activity dose-dependently, and KCN (an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration) decreases these effects to the basal level. 5-HT and KCN have no effect on the frequency of ciliary beat (stroboscopic measurements), and blockers of anaerobic glycolysis inhibit ciliary motility. Under anaerobic conditions locomotion of a snail is slow and insensitive to 5-HT in contrast to that in aerobic environments. It is concluded that glycolysis supplies energy to ciliated cells and respiration to sole muscle cells; 5-HT stimulates ciliary beating in an all-or-none fashion and muscular waves in a dose-dependent manner; <e>cilia</e> provide slow (basal) gliding, and locomotory rate up to 80% above the basal level is determined by muscular waves.",M1
20154143,"Kinetics of hedgehog-dependent full-length Gli3 accumulation in primary <e>cilia</e> and subsequent degradation.Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vertebrates depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT) within primary cilia. The Hh receptor Patched is found in cilia in the absence of Hh and is replaced by the signal transducer Smoothened within an hour of Hh stimulation. By generating antibodies capable of detecting endogenous pathway transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3, we monitored their kinetics of accumulation in cilia upon Hh stimulation. Localization occurs within minutes of Hh addition, making it the fastest reported readout of pathway activity, which permits more precise temporal and spatial localization of Hh signaling events. We show that the species of Gli3 that accumulates at cilium tips is full-length and likely not protein kinase A phosphorylated. We also confirmed that phosphorylation and betaTrCP/Cul1 are required for endogenous Gli3 processing and that this is inhibited by Hh. Surprisingly, however, Hh-dependent inhibition of processing does not lead to accumulation of full-length Gli3, but instead renders it labile, leading to its proteasomal degradation via the SPOP/Cul3 complex. In fact, full-length Gli3 disappears with faster kinetics than the Gli3 repressor, the latter not requiring SPOP/Cul3 or betaTrCP/Cul1. This may contribute to the increased Gli3 activator/repressor ratios found in IFT mutants.",M1

Although genetically heterogeneous, these diseases share several loci that affect cilia and/or basal body proteins, but the functions and interactions of these gene products are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs) of C. elegans express the putative transmembrane protein MKS-3, which localized to the distal end of their dendrites and to the cilium base but not to the cilium itself. Localization of MKS-3 and other known MKS and NPHP proteins partially overlapped. By analyzing mks-3 mutants, we found that ciliogenesis did not require MKS-3; instead, cilia elongated and cilia-mediated chemoreception was abnormal. Genetic analysis indicated that mks-3 functions in a pathway with other mks genes. Furthermore, mks-1 and mks-3 genetically interacted with a separate pathway (involving nphp-1 and nphp-4) to influence proper positioning, orientation, and formation of cilia. Combined disruption of nphp and mks pathways had cell nonautonomous effects on C. elegans sensilla. Taken together, these data demonstrate the importance of mutational load on the presentation and severity of ciliopathies and expand the understanding of the interactions between ciliopathy genes.",M1
20145001,"Molecular mechanisms of protein and lipid targeting to ciliary membranes.<e>Cilia</e> are specialized surface regions of eukaryotic cells that serve a variety of functions, ranging from motility to sensation and to regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The discovery that a number of human diseases, collectively known as ciliopathies, result from defective cilium function has expanded interest in these structures. Among the many properties of cilia, motility and intraflagellar transport have been most extensively studied. The latter is the process by which multiprotein complexes associate with microtubule motors to transport structural subunits along the axoneme to and from the ciliary tip. By contrast, the mechanisms by which membrane proteins and lipids are specifically targeted to the cilium are still largely unknown. In this Commentary, we review the current knowledge of protein and lipid targeting to ciliary membranes and outline important issues for future study. We also integrate this information into a proposed model of how the cell specifically targets proteins and lipids to the specialized membrane of this unique organelle.",M1
20144999,"The perennial organelle: assembly and disassembly of the primary cilium.Primary <e>cilia</e> contain signaling receptors of diverse classes, and ciliary dysfunction results in a variety of developmental defects. Thus, primary cilia are thought to have an important role in sensing and transducing cellular signals. Although there is clear evidence demonstrating that these organelles are assembled and disassembled dynamically as cells progress through the cell cycle, the mechanisms by which the cell cycle controls the assembly and disassembly of the primary cilium remain poorly understood. In this Commentary, we review the basic cellular mechanisms that underlie the early stages of cilium assembly and discuss how the cell cycle communicates with the ciliation program. A commonly held view is that ciliation occurs exclusively in cells that have exited the cell cycle and entered quiescence or differentiation. However, this concept is at odds with the finding that, during development, many actively proliferating cells require cilia-mediated signaling pathways to instruct their developmental fate. Here, we reassess the quiescence-centric view of ciliation by reviewing historic and current literature. We discuss ample evidence that cilia are in fact present on many proliferating cells, and that a transient peak of ciliation before the G1-S transition might be tightly coupled to entry into the DNA replication phase. Finally, we touch on the relationship between the ciliation and cell-division cycles and the tissue distribution of primary cilia in order to highlight potential roles for the primary cilium in restraining cells from the hyperproliferative state that contributes to cancer.",M1

However, examination of the literature shows that evidence of sensory functions of motile cilia and flagella is widespread in studies of invertebrates, and extends as back as far as 1899. In this Opinion article, I review the recent and historical findings that motile cilia have a variety of sensory functions, and discuss how this concept has in fact been evolving for the past century.",M1

In most epithelial cells, microtubules are noncentrosomal, align along the apico-basal axis and the centrosome templates a cilium. It follows that cells undergoing mesenchyme-to-epithelium transitions must reorganize their microtubule network extensively, yet little is understood about how this process is orchestrated. In particular, the pathways regulating the apical positioning of the centrosome are unknown, a central question given the role of <e>cilia</e> in fluid propulsion, sensation and signaling. In zebrafish, neural progenitors undergo progressive epithelialization during neurulation, and thus provide a convenient in vivo cellular context in which to address this question. We demonstrate here that the microtubule cytoskeleton gradually transitions from a radial to linear organization during neurulation and that microtubules function in conjunction with the polarity protein Pard3 to mediate centrosome positioning. Pard3 depletion results in hydrocephalus, a defect often associated with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow that has been linked to cilia defects. These findings thus bring to focus cellular events occurring during neurulation and reveal novel molecular mechanisms implicated in centrosome positioning.",M1
20108498,"Rare case of Alstrom syndrome with empty sella and interfamilial presence of Bardet-Biedl phenotype.Alstrom syndrome is an extremely rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by a group of signs and symptoms including infantile onset dilated cardiomyopathy, blindness, hearing impairment/loss, obesity, diabetes, hepatic and renal dysfunction. Since the first description of the syndrome in 1959, there have never been reported cases of Alstrom syndrome with the occurrence of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome in their relatives, this case suggesting a close genetic link between these two ciliopathies. The presence of empty sella seems to be a rare morphologic finding in Alstrom syndrome although it has been documented in few Bardet-Biedl cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 20 -year-old caucasian male with hearing and visual loss, short stature, insulin resistant diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic and renal dysfunction, hypertension, and alopecia. By studying his family medical records we identified two relatives with suggestive clinical findings for Bardet Biedl syndrome. CONCLUSION: Analyzing the clinical traits of these patients we found that retinopathy, nephropathy and central obesity were present in all patients, suggesting a main anomaly in ciliary function controlling photoreception, renal and metabolic processes. The occurrence of similar clinical cases within a family further demonstrates the existence of a common pathologic cilliary mechanism, a genetic basis of phenotypic variability in seemingly monogenic disease and a functional link between rare disorders and common traits with overlapping clinical manifestations. Genetic studies in such patients may provide new data regarding the consequences of defective <e>cilia</e> and a possible identification of new gene mutations.",M1
20106869,"The retinitis pigmentosa protein RP2 links pericentriolar vesicle transport between the Golgi and the primary cilium.Photoreceptors are complex ciliated sensory neurons. The basal body and periciliary ridge of photoreceptors function in association with the Golgi complex to regulate the export of proteins from the inner segment to the outer segment sensory axoneme. Here, we show that the retinitis pigmentosa protein RP2, which is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Arl3, localizes to the ciliary apparatus, namely the basal body and the associated centriole at the base of the photoreceptor cilium. Targeting to the ciliary base was dependent on N-terminal myristoylation. RP2 also localized to the Golgi and periciliary ridge of photoreceptors, which suggested a role for RP2 in regulating vesicle traffic and docking. To explore this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of RP2 depletion and the expression of a constitutively active form of Arl3 (Q71L) on pericentriolar vesicle transport. Kif3a, a component of intraflagellar transport (IFT), is important in <e>cilia</e> maintenance and transport of proteins through the connecting cilium in photoreceptors. Similar to Kif3a and Arl3 depletion, loss of RP2 led to fragmentation of the Golgi network. Depletion of RP2 and dysregulation of Arl3 resulted in dispersal of vesicles cycling cargo from the Golgi complex to the cilium, including the IFT protein IFT20. We propose that RP2 regulation of Arl3 is important for maintaining Golgi cohesion, facilitating the transport and docking of vesicles and thereby carrying proteins to the base of the photoreceptor connecting cilium for transport to the outer segment.",M1

We performed a proteome analysis of the olfactory epithelium (OE) membrane proteome and identified so far uncharacterized membrane proteins as candidate channels. One of the most abundant membrane proteins in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) was Tmem16b, a member of a recently identified family of CaCCs. In addition to former studies performed on Tmem16b, we show here that Tmem16b expression is highly specific for the OE, in contrast to the closely related Tmem16a, which shows a broad expression pattern in secretory epithelial cells. Native Tmem16b is localized in the cilia of the OSNs, which is in agreement with previous electrophysiological recordings.",M1
20098415,"Planar polarization of node cells determines the rotational axis of node <e>cilia</e>.Rotational movement of the node cilia generates a leftward fluid flow in the mouse embryo because the cilia are posteriorly tilted. However, it is not known how anterior-posterior information is translated into the posterior tilt of the node cilia. Here, we show that the basal body of node cilia is initially positioned centrally but then gradually shifts toward the posterior side of the node cells. Positioning of the basal body and unidirectional flow were found to be impaired in compound mutant mice lacking Dvl genes. Whereas the basal body was normally positioned in the node cells of Wnt3a(-/-) embryos, inhibition of Rac1, a component of the noncanonical Wnt signalling pathway, impaired the polarized localization of the basal body in wild-type embryos. Dvl2 and Dvl3 proteins were found to be localized to the apical side of the node cells, and their location was polarized to the posterior side of the cells before the posterior positioning of the basal body. These results suggest that posterior positioning of the basal body, which provides the posterior tilt to node cilia, is determined by planar polarization mediated by noncanonical Wnt signalling.",M1
20097287,"The role of primary <e>cilia</e> in neuronal function.The  ciliopathies  are a newly defined group of disorders characterized by defects in the structure or function of the cellular primary cilium. Patients with these disorders display variably expressive fibrocystic renal disease, retinal blindness, polydactyly, obesity, and brain dysgenesis as well as neurocognitive impairments. Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy defined by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, oculomotor apraxia, intermittent hyperventilation, and mental retardation. Recent evidence suggests important roles for the primary cilium in mediating a host of extracellular signaling events such as morphogen, mitogen, homeostatic and polarity signals. Based upon the clinical features of ciliopathies and cilia mediated signaling pathways, the data support a role for the primary cilium in modulating neurogenesis, cell polarity, axonal guidance and possibly adult neuronal function.",M1
20096584,"Identification of signaling pathways regulating primary cilium length and flow-mediated adaptation.The primary cilium acts as a transducer of extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling [1, 2]. Its regulation, particularly with respect to length, has been defined primarily by genetic experiments and human disease states in which molecular components that are necessary for its proper construction have been mutated or deleted [1]. However, dynamic modulation of cilium length, a phenomenon observed in ciliated protists [3, 4], has not been well-characterized in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that decreased intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) or increased cyclic AMP (cAMP), and subsequent protein kinase A activation, increases primary cilium length in mammalian epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Anterograde intraflagellar transport is sped up in lengthened <e>cilia</e>, potentially increasing delivery flux of cilium components. The cilium length response creates a negative feedback loop whereby fluid shear-mediated deflection of the primary cilium, which decreases intracellular cAMP, leads to cilium shortening and thus decreases mechanotransductive signaling. This adaptive response is blocked when the autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) gene products, polycystin-1 or -2, are reduced. Dynamic regulation of cilium length is thus intertwined with cilium-mediated signaling and provides a natural braking mechanism in response to external stimuli that may be compromised in PKD.",M1
20093939,"Iatrogenic conjunctival entrapment of cilium and scleral ulceration after subtenon steroid injection.PURPOSE: To report the presence of an asymptomatic cilium in the subconjunctival area and an adjacent sterile scleral ulcer, together as a complication of subtenon injection of steroids, and the resolution of the ulcer despite the in situ cilium. METHODS: Medical management of a 51-year-old man, who was a known case of ankylosing spondylitis, with a 3-mm scleral ulcer located in the inferior palpebral area with one adjacent fully embedded cilium at the probable site of subtenon injection given for suspected acute iridocyclitis. RESULTS: On altering the medication, the ulcer resolved completely. This occurred despite the in situ cilium, which did not act as a nidus for infection or inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <e>cilia</e> did not adversely affect the outcome of treatment of the adjacent ulcer. Therefore, if there is no exposure of the entrapped cilium through the conjunctiva, as was in this case, conservative management of the ulcer and not trying to remove the cilium seems to be a good alternative as opposed to reports in literature, which warrant its removal in most cases.",M1
20093497,"Hepato-renal pathology in pkd2ws25/- mice, an animal model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.Polycystic liver diseases, the most important of which are autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney diseases, are incurable pathological conditions. Animal models that resemble human pathology in these diseases provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms of cystogenesis and to test potential treatments. Here we demonstrate that Pkd2ws25/- mice, an animal model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, developed hepatic cysts. As assessed by micro-computed tomography scanning of intact livers and by light microscopy of hepatic tissue, hepatic cystic volumes increased from 12.82+/-3.16% (5- to 8-month-old mice) to 21.58+/-4.81% (9- to 12-month-old mice). Renal cystogenesis was more severe at early stages of disease: in 5- to 7-month-old mice, cystic volumes represented 40.67+/-5.48% of kidney parenchyma, whereas in older mice cysts occupied 31.04+/-1.88% of kidney parenchyma. Mild fibrosis occurred only in liver, and its degree was unchanged with age. Hepatic cysts were lined by single or multiple layers of squamous cholangiocytes. Cystic cholangiocyte <e>cilia</e> were short and malformed, whereas in renal cysts they appeared normal. In Pkd2ws25/- mice, mitotic and apoptotic indices in both kidney and liver were increased compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, Pkd2ws25/- mice exhibit hepatorenal pathology resembling human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and represent a useful model to study mechanisms of cystogenesis and to evaluate treatment options.",M1

The primary (or sensory) cilium of photoreceptors mediates polarized trafficking of proteins for efficient phototransduction. Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) is a cilia-centrosomal protein mutated in &gt;70% of X-linked RP cases and 10%-20% of simplex RP males. Accumulating evidence indicates that RPGR may facilitate the orchestration of multiple ciliary protein complexes. Disruption of these complexes due to mutations in component proteins is an underlying cause of associated photoreceptor degeneration. Here, we highlight the recent developments in understanding the mechanism of cilia-dependent photoreceptor degeneration due to mutations in RPGR and PGR-interacting proteins in severe genetic diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), Joubert syndrome, and Senior-Loken syndrome, and explore the physiological relevance of photoreceptor ciliary protein complexes.",M1
20085719,"Force generation and dynamics of individual <e>cilia</e> under external loading.Motile cilia are unique multimotor systems that display coordination and periodicity while imparting forces to biological fluids. They play important roles in normal physiology, and ciliopathies are implicated in a growing number of human diseases. In this work we measure the response of individual human airway cilia to calibrated forces transmitted via spot-labeled magnetic microbeads. Cilia respond to applied forces by 1), a reduction in beat amplitude (up to an 85% reduction by 160-170 pN of force); 2), a decreased tip velocity proportionate to applied force; and 3), no significant change in beat frequency. Tip velocity reduction occurred in each beat direction, independently of the direction of applied force, indicating that the cilium is  driven  in both directions at all times. By applying a quasistatic force model, we deduce that axoneme stiffness is dominated by the rigidity of the microtubules, and that cilia can exert 62 +/- 18 pN of force at the tip via the generation of 5.6 +/- 1.6 pN/dynein head.",M1

Our design is based on a collection of self-assembled colloidal rotors that  walk  along surfaces in the presence of a rotating magnetic field. These rotors are held together solely by magnetic forces that allow for reversible assembly and disassembly of the chains.

20080492,"Situs inversus in Dpcd/Poll-/-, Nme7-/- , and Pkd1l1-/- mice.Situs inversus (SI) is a congenital condition characterized by left-right transposition of thoracic and visceral organs and associated vasculature. The usual asymmetrical positioning of organs is established early in development in a transient structure called the embryonic node. The 2-<e>cilia</e> hypothesis proposes that 2 kinds of primary cilia in the embryonic node determine left-right asymmetry: motile cilia that generate a leftward fluid flow, and immotile mechanosensory cilia that respond to the flow. Here, we describe 3 mouse SI models that provide support for the 2-cilia hypothesis. In addition to having SI, Dpcd/Poll(-/-) mice (for: deleted in a mouse model of primary ciliary dyskinesia) and Nme7(-/-) mice (for: nonmetastatic cells 7) had lesions consistent with deficient ciliary motility: Hydrocephalus, sinusitis, and male infertility developed in Dpcd/Poll(-/-) mice, whereas hydrocephalus and excessive nasal exudates were seen in Nme7(-/-) mice. In contrast, the absence of respiratory tract lesions, hydrocephalus, and male infertility in Pkd1l1(-/-) mice (for: polycystic kidney disease 1 like 1) suggested that dysfunction of motile cilia was not involved in the development of SI in this line. Moreover, the gene Pkd1l1 has considerable sequence similarity with Pkd1 (for: polycystic kidney disease 1), which encodes a protein (polycystin-1) that is essential for the mechanosensory function of immotile primary cilia in the kidney. The markedly reduced viability of Pkd1l1(-/-) mice is somewhat surprising given the absence of any detected abnormalities (other than SI) in surviving Pkd1l1(-/-) mice subjected to a comprehensive battery of phenotype-screening exams. However, the heart and great vessels of Pkd1l1(-/-) mice were not examined, and it is possible that the decreased viability of Pkd1l1(-/-) mice is due to undiagnosed cardiovascular defects associated with heterotaxy.",M1

Ciliary mutant mice show defects in brain patterning, progenitor proliferation, and specification of adult neural stem cells.

20067783,"PCP effector gene Inturned is an important regulator of <e>cilia</e> formation and embryonic development in mammals.The PCP effector gene Inturned regulates planar cell polarity (PCP) and wing hair formation in Drosophila wings. In order to understand the roles for Inturned in mammalian embryonic development, we generated a null mutant allele for the mouse homologue of Inturned (Intu) via gene-targeting in ES cells. Mouse Intu null mutants are homozygous lethal at midgestation, exhibiting multiple defects including neural tube closure defects, abnormal dorsal/ventral patterning of the central nervous system and abnormal anterior-posterior patterning of the limbs resulting in severe polydactyly (7-9 digits each limb). The developmental processes affected by the Intu mutation are under the control of Hh signaling through Gli-family transcription factors. We found that in Intu mutant embryos the expression of Gli1 and Ptch1, two direct transcriptional targets of Hh signaling, is down-regulated, and the proteolytic processing of Gli3 is compromised. We further demonstrate that Intu plays significant roles in the formation of primary cilia both during embryonic development and in cultured fibroblasts. Finally, a cytoplasmic GFP-Intu fusion protein efficiently rescues the ciliogenic defects in Intu mutant cells. In conclusion, we show that PCP effector gene Intu is an important regulator of cilia formation, Hh signal transduction, and embryonic development in mammals.",M1

20048263,"The cytoplasmic tail of fibrocystin contains a ciliary targeting sequence.Sensory functions of primary <e>cilia</e> rely on ciliary-localized membrane proteins, but little is known about how these receptors are targeted to the cilium. To further our understanding of this process, we dissected the ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) of fibrocystin, the human autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease gene product. We show that the fibrocystin CTS is an 18-residue motif localized in the cytoplasmic tail. This motif is sufficient to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to cilia of ciliated cells and targets GFP to lipid rafts if the cells are not ciliated. Rab8, but not several other Rabs implicated in ciliary assembly, binds to the CTS in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Dominant-negative Rab8 interacts more strongly than wild-type or constitutively active Rab8, and coexpression of this dominant-negative mutant Rab8 blocks trafficking to the cilium. This suggests that the CTS functions by binding regulatory proteins like Rab8 to control trafficking through the endomembrane system and on to the cilium.",M1
20032110,"Study of the olfactory epithelium in the developing sturgeon. Characterization of the crypt cells.In acipenserids, crypt cells (CCs) have only been observed in juvenile specimens, and it has not been clarified whether they differentiate along with olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) during the lecithotrophic stage or during later development stages. Furthermore, no detailed optical microscopy (OM) or electron microscopy study on the development of CCs has been published to date. In the present study, we used OM and electron microscopy to follow the development of CCs in Acipenser naccarii from hatching to the establishment of exogenous feeding. Based on these observations, we can affirm that CCs are present from the first few posthatching (PH) days. CCs appear with their nucleus close to the basal lamina of the epithelium and enveloped by supporting cells. In addition, from the beginning of day 2 PH, we observed cells with highly similar characteristics to those of CCs (absence of knob, abundant mitochondria and filamentous material in apical cytoplasm, numerous microtubules, and envelopment by supporting cells) but with <e>cilia</e> still remaining on their noninvaginated apical surface. We conclude that these cells may correspond to immature CCs in which the crypt, the final feature of their morphological differentiation, has not yet formed.",M1
20024659,"Ependymal cells: biology and pathology.The literature was reviewed to summarize the current understanding of the role of ciliated ependymal cells in the mammalian brain. Previous reviews were summarized. Publications from the past 10 years highlight interactions between ependymal cells and the subventricular zone and the possible role of restricted ependymal populations in neurogenesis. Ependymal cells provide trophic support and possibly metabolic support for progenitor cells. Channel proteins such as aquaporins may be important for determining water fluxes at the ventricle wall. The junctional and anchoring proteins are now fairly well understood, as are proteins related to <e>cilia</e> function. Defects in ependymal adhesion and cilia function can cause hydrocephalus through several different mechanisms, one possibility being loss of patency of the cerebral aqueduct. Ependymal cells are susceptible to infection by a wide range of common viruses; while they may act as a line of first defense, they eventually succumb to repeated attacks in long-lived organisms. Ciliated ependymal cells are almost certainly important during brain development. However, the widespread absence of ependymal cells from the adult human lateral ventricles suggests that they may have only regionally restricted value in the mature brain of large size.",M1
20017937,"Primary ciliogenesis defects are associated with human astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells.BACKGROUND: Primary <e>cilia</e> are non-motile sensory cytoplasmic organelles that have been implicated in signal transduction, cell to cell communication, left and right pattern embryonic development, sensation of fluid flow, regulation of calcium levels, mechanosensation, growth factor signaling and cell cycle progression. Defects in the formation and/or function of these structures underlie a variety of human diseases such as Alström, Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, Meckel-Gruber and oral-facial-digital type 1 syndromes. The expression and function of primary cilia in cancer cells has now become a focus of attention but has not been studied in astrocytomas/glioblastomas. To begin to address this issue, we compared the structure and expression of primary cilia in a normal human astrocyte cell line with five human astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines. METHODS: Cultured normal human astrocytes and five human astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines were examined for primary cilia expression and structure using indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Monospecific antibodies were used to detect primary cilia and map the relationship between the primary cilia region and sites of endocytosis. RESULTS: We show that expression of primary cilia in normal astrocytes is cell cycle related and the primary cilium extends through the cell within a unique structure which we show to be a site of endocytosis. Importantly, we document that in each of the five astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines fully formed primary cilia are either expressed at a very low level, are completely absent or have aberrant forms, due to incomplete ciliogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The recent discovery of the importance of primary cilia in a variety of cell functions raises the possibility that this structure may have a role in a variety of cancers. Our finding that the formation of the primary cilium is disrupted in cells derived from astrocytoma/glioblastoma tumors provides the first evidence that altered primary cilium expression and function may be part of some malignant phenotypes. Further, we provide the first evidence that ciliogenesis is not an all or none process; rather defects can arrest this process at various points, particularly at the stage subsequent to basal body association with the plasma membrane.",M1
20017434,"[Examination of function and structure of respiratory <e>cilia</e> of adult patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)--comparison of nasal and bronchial mucosa (pilot of CILIARY STUDY)]INTRODUCTION: Borderline between upper and lower respiratory tract pathology is probably artificial (bronchial asthma). Also inflammation of bronchial mucosa during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is likely combined with inflammatory involvement of nasal mucosa. Ciliary edge of respiratory epithelium is very important part of mucosa layer. AIM: To investigate and compare nasal and bronchial ciliary beat frequency (CBF), degree of nasal and bronchial ciliary dyskinesia, presence of ciliary akinesia and incidence of spinocellular metaplasia in the both mucosa localities among of stable COPD patients (pts). METHOD: Nasal and bronchial mucosa were obtained in the course of bronchoscopy examination of COPD pts in general intravenous anesthesia. Native samples of mucosa tissue were assessed by digital high-speed video microscopy (1,000x magnification). Paired t-test was used to evaluate differences in average frequencies. Significance level was alpha = 0.05. Mode was used to describe  index of dyskinesia , as a measure of association was used K coefficient. MATERIAL: Seventeen COPD pts (6 weeks free of exacerbation) at the age 47-80 (average 64.2 years +/- 9.7) were examined (13 male), average FEV1 61% predic. value (21-81, +/- 15). All patients were active smokers (average 42 pack years +/- 22.8) and all suffered from bronchitic (daily sputum production) phenotype of COPD. RESULTS: We did not find any difference in average ciliary beat frequencies between nose (6.0 Hz +/- 1.3) and bronchus (5.9 +/- 1.3) locality (p = 0.427). We find weak association between nose and bronchus in  ciliary akinesia  (kappa = 0.282) but medium association in  metaplasia  (kappa = 0.485), in index of dyskinesia (kappa = 0.733). CONCLUSION: We did not find in our data any difference in nasal and bronchial ciliary beat frequencies and we found medium association between nasal and bronchial spinocellular metaplasia and index of ciliary dyskinesia.

20016779,"Smoking is associated with shortened airway <e>cilia</e>.BACKGROUND: Whereas cilia damage and reduced cilia beat frequency have been implicated as causative of reduced mucociliary clearance in smokers, theoretically mucociliary clearance could also be affected by cilia length. Based on models of mucociliary clearance predicting that cilia length must exceed the 6-7 microm airway surface fluid depth to generate force in the mucus layer, we hypothesized that cilia height may be decreased in airway epithelium of normal smokers compared to nonsmokers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cilia length in normal nonsmokers and smokers was evaluated in aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded endobronchial biopsies, and air-dried and hydrated samples were brushed from human airway epithelium via fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In 28 endobronchial biopsies, healthy smoker cilia length was reduced by 15% compared to nonsmokers (p&lt;0.05). In 39 air-dried samples of airway epithelial cells, smoker cilia length was reduced by 13% compared to nonsmokers (p&lt;0.0001). Analysis of the length of individual, detached cilia in 27 samples showed that smoker cilia length was reduced by 9% compared to nonsmokers (p&lt;0.05). Finally, in 16 fully hydrated, unfixed samples, smoker cilia length was reduced 7% compared to nonsmokers (p&lt;0.05). Using genome-wide analysis of airway epithelial gene expression we identified 6 cilia-related genes whose expression levels were significantly reduced in healthy smokers compared to healthy nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Models predict that a reduction in cilia length would reduce mucociliary clearance, suggesting that smoking-associated shorter airway epithelial cilia play a significant role in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung disease.",M1

However, the genetic and cell biological control of ciliogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the zebrafish iguana gene is required for differentiation of primary cilia. iguana encodes a zinc finger and coiled-coil containing protein, previously implicated in Hedgehog signaling. We now argue that aberrant Hedgehog activity in iguana -deficient zebrafish arises from their profound lack of primary cilia. By contrast, the requirement of iguana for motile cilia formation is less obligatory. In the absence of iguana function, basal bodies can migrate to the cell surface and appear to engage with the apical membrane. However, formation of ciliary pits and axonemal outgrowth is completely inhibited. Iguana localizes to the base of primary and motile cilia, in the immediate vicinity or closely associated with the basal bodies. These findings identify the Iguana protein as a novel and critical component of ciliogenesis.",M1

Motility is generated by the orchestrated activity of thousands of dynein motors, which drive interdoublet sliding. A key regulator of motor activity is the dynein regulatory complex (DRC), but detailed structural information is lacking. Using cryoelectron tomography of wild-type and mutant axonemes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we visualized the DRC in situ at molecular resolution. We present the three-dimensional structure of the DRC, including a model for its subunit organization and intermolecular connections that establish the DRC as a major regulatory node.

19968984,"Secreted frizzled-related protein disrupts PCP in eye lens fiber cells that have polarised primary <e>cilia</e>.Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling polarises cells along tissue axes. Although pathways involved are becoming better understood, outstanding issues include; (i) existence/identity of cues that orchestrate global polarisation in tissues, and (ii) the generality of the link between polarisation of primary cilia and asymmetric localisation of PCP proteins. Mammalian lenses are mainly comprised of epithelial-derived fiber cells. Concentrically arranged fibers are precisely aligned as they elongate along the anterior-posterior axis and orientate towards lens poles where they meet fibers from other segments to form characteristic sutures. We show that lens exhibits PCP, with each fiber cell having an apically situated cilium and in most cases this is polarised towards the anterior pole. Frizzled and other PCP proteins are also asymmetrically localised along the equatorial-anterior axis. Mutations in core PCP genes Van Gogh-like 2 and Celsr1 perturb oriented fiber alignment and suture formation. Suppression of the PCP pathway by overexpressing Sfrp2 shows that whilst local groups of fibers are often similarly oriented, they lack global orientation; consequently when local groups of fibers with different orientations meet they form multiple, small, ectopic suture-like configurations. This indicates that this extracellular inhibitor disrupts a global polarising signal that utilises a PCP-mediated mechanism to coordinate the global alignment and orientation of fibers to lens poles.",M1

A hypothesis is detailed suggesting that all polypeptides which enter the cilium, both membrane and axonemal, do so in association, first, with cytoplasmic vesicles which exocytose adjacent to the ciliary basal body, and then with the ciliary membrane. Axonemal proteins are moved to the ciliary tip by peripheral association with the inner aspects of the ciliary membrane by cannonical ciliary IFT. At the tip, some polypeptides are released for axonemal assembly, and others are budded off as part of vesicular exosomes into the environment. It is proposed that the cilium, in addition to being a sensory and motile organelle, is also a secretory organelle.",M1

19958609,"In vivo effects of citric acid/zwitterionic surfactant cleansing solution on rabbit sinus mucosa.BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis that is refractory to medical or surgical intervention may involve a particularly resistant form of infection known as a bacterial biofilm that is recalcitrant to antibiotics secondary to physical barrier characteristics. Recently, a novel sinus cleansing solution, citric acid/zwitterionic surfactant (CAZS) was shown to be extremely effective in disrupting biofilms in vitro. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of CAZS on sinonasal epithelium In vivo compared with normal saline. METHODS: Indwelling catheters were placed into the right maxillary sinus of New Zealand white rabbits. CAZS solution or normal saline (10 mL) was instilled at a rate of 20 mL/minute into the sinus followed by aspiration. Rabbits were killed 1, 3, and 6 days after treatment. Mucosa from both maxillary sinuses was harvested and evaluated for physiological activity (ciliary beating) as well as morphological integrity of the epithelium by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: One day after treatment, beating <e>cilia</e> was evident with morphological analysis shown intact epithelium with 80-85% denudation of cilia compared with saline. Three days after treatment, ciliary activity was again noted with morphological evidence of persistent denuded cilia. By day 6 after treatment, the epithelium had regenerated cilia over the apical surface. Throughout the recovery period beating cilia was evident in CAZS-treated sinuses. CONCLUSION: This study shows that although CAZS acutely denudes respiratory cilia, the remaining cilia are active. Additionally, the epithelial barrier appears intact with active ciliogenesis, and reciliation of the mucosal surface occurring 6 days after treatment.",M1
19958467,"Multiple primary <e>cilia</e> modulate the fluid transcytosis in choroid plexus epithelium.Functional defects in cilia are associated with various human diseases including congenital hydrocephalus. Previous studies suggested that defects in cilia not only disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generated by motile cilia in ependyma lining the brain ventricles, but also cause increased CSF production at the choroid plexus. However, the molecular mechanisms of CSF overproduction by ciliary dysfunction remain elusive. To dissect the molecular mechanisms, choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) were isolated from porcine brain. These cells expressed clusters of primary cilia on the apical surface. Deciliation of CPECs elevated the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and stimulated basolateral-to-apical fluid transcytosis, without detrimental effects on other morphological and physiological features. The primary cilia possessed neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor 2. In deciliated cells, the responsiveness to NPFF was reduced at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, CPECs expressed NPFF precursor along with NPFFR2. An NPFFR antagonist, BIBP3226, increased the fluid transcytosis, suggesting the presence of autocrine NPFF signaling in CPECs for a tonic inhibition of fluid transcytosis. These results suggest that the clusters of primary cilia in CPECs act as a sensitive chemosensor to regulate CSF production.",M1
19948480,"Lateral transport of Smoothened from the plasma membrane to the membrane of the cilium.The function of primary <e>cilia</e> depends critically on the localization of specific proteins in the ciliary membrane. A major challenge in the field is to understand protein trafficking to cilia. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway protein Smoothened (Smo), a 7-pass transmembrane protein, moves to cilia when a ligand is received. Using microscopy-based pulse-chase analysis, we find that Smo moves through a lateral transport pathway from the plasma membrane to the ciliary membrane. Lateral movement, either via diffusion or active transport, is quite distinct from currently studied pathways of ciliary protein transport in mammals, which emphasize directed trafficking of Golgi-derived vesicles to the base of the cilium. We anticipate that this alternative route will be used by other signaling proteins that function at cilia. The path taken by Smo may allow novel strategies for modulation of Hh signaling in cancer and regeneration.",M1
19944778,"Effects of p-Aminosalicylic acid on the neurotoxicity of manganese on the dopaminergic innervation of the <e>cilia</e> of the lateral cells of the gill of the bivalve mollusc, Crassostrea virginica.The lateral cilia of the gill of Crassostrea virginica are controlled by a dopaminergic-serotonergic innervation. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter causing cilio-inhibition. High levels of manganese are neurotoxic to people, causing Manganism, a Parkinson-like disease. Clinical interventions for Manganism have not been very successful. Recently, p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was reported as an effective treatment of severe Manganism in humans; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Previously, we reported that manganese treatments caused disruption of the dopaminergic innervation of gill of C. virginica. Here we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of PAS, EDTA or Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and examined whether co-treating animals with PAS could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. Beating rates of the lateral cilia of the gill were measured by stroboscopic microscopy. Pre-treating gill preparations with PAS or EDTA blocked the neurotoxic effects of manganese, while ASA did not. In other experiments, animals exposed to three day treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of the dopaminergic, cilio-inhibitory system, which was decreased by co-treatment with PAS. The study shows that PAS protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of action of PAS in alleviating Manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities than its anti-inflammatory actions.",M1

In this case, the hydrodynamics is governed by the viscosity rather than inertia and special elements have to be introduced into the system for mixing and pumping of fluids. Here we report on the realization of an effective pumping device that mimics a ciliated surface and imitates its motion to generate fluid flow. The artificial biomimetic cilia are constructed as long chains of spherical superparamagnetic particles, which self-assemble in an external magnetic field. Magnetic field is also used to actuate the cilia in a simple nonreciprocal manner, resulting in a fluid flow. We prove the concept by measuring the velocity of a cilia-pumped fluid as a function of height above the ciliated surface and investigate the influence of the beating asymmetry on the pumping performance. A numerical simulation was carried out that successfully reproduced the experimentally obtained data.",M1

Although core protein components are highly conserved, the variations in Hh signal transduction mechanisms exhibited by existing model systems (Drosophila, fish, and mammals) are difficult to understand. We characterized the Hh pathway in planarians. Hh signaling is essential for establishing the anterior/posterior axis during regeneration by modulating wnt expression. Moreover, RNA interference methods to reduce signal transduction proteins Cos2/Kif27/Kif7, Fused, or Iguana do not result in detectable Hh signaling defects; however, these proteins are essential for planarian ciliogenesis. Our study expands the understanding of Hh signaling in the animal kingdom and suggests an ancestral mechanistic link between Hh signaling and the function of cilia.",M1

Primary <e>cilia</e> are known to play a pivotal role in this process. In humans, genetic disorders of ciliogenesis cause serious congenital diseases. A comprehensive mechanism that regulates ciliogenesis has not been proposed so far. Here, we show that EED, a core member of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes and a presumed player in many epigenetic processes, is required for ciliogenesis and subsequent LR patterning in the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. Moderate knockdown of oleed, a medaka homolog of EED, preferentially caused situs inversus. In the affected embryo, the cilia in Kupffer's vesicle showed various defects in their structure, position and motility. Furthermore, we demonstrated that oleed maintains the expression of Noto, which, in mice, regulates ciliogenesis and LR patterning. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of epigenetic plasticity in LR patterning through ciliogenesis.",M1

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: One hundred and seven eyes of 61 patients were enrolled in this study and were divided into three groups: the epiblepharon group (n = 59), the entropion group (n = 17), and the age-matched control group for the epiblepharon group (n = 31). Impression cytologic specimens were obtained from nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctiva of the epiblepharon and control groups immediately after the induction of general anesthesia. In the entropion group, these were obtained before and one month after surgical correction. Conjunctival changes were graded using the Tseng method and goblet cell densities were compared. RESULTS: Cytologic scores were significantly higher in the epiblepharon group than in the control group (P &lt; .001), and goblet cell densities of nasal and temporal conjunctiva were significantly lower in the epiblepharon group than in the control group (P = .044 and P = .018, respectively). In the entropion group, postoperative scores were significantly lower than preoperative scores in both conjunctival areas (P = .033 and P = .003, respectively). No statistically significant difference was found between nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the three groups.

CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old man with bilateral cataracts underwent phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in the right eye. Three months later, he was found to have an eyelash within the right anterior chamber. The patient opted to leave his asymptomatic right eye alone. Four years later, he was referred to our hospital for review of his intraocular foreign body. He had remained asymptomatic with bilateral 6/6 vision, and without pain, photophobia or monocular diplopia. He declined surgery to remove the foreign body and opted for annual review. DISCUSSION: Intraocular implantation of <e>cilia</e> is a rare surgical complication following cataract surgery. The reaction of the eye to cilia has been reported to be variable and unpredictable, varying from absolute lack of reaction to endophthalmitis. Careful preoperative preparation can prevent similar incidents with potential complications. The position of the cilium is an important consideration. In contrast to other organic materials, a cilium is relatively inert and is rarely associated with infection. Acute inflammation most commonly occurs within days or after a few months, although the eye can tolerate the cilium for many years. Some ophthalmologists prefer observation, particularly when there is no inflammation present. We believe that each patient should be considered on an individual basis. The decision to remove an intraocular eyelash remains controversial and should be considered at the onset of inflammatory or infective clinical signs.",M2

In the present study, the prevalence of DF in seborrheic blepharitis patients and controls was investigated. In addition, the associations between the presence of DF and host factors (age, sex) were analyzed. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was done involving 500 cases. In all, 6000 <e>cilia</e> from 170 patients with seborrheic blepharitis and 330 patients with normal eyes were examined for DF. Twelve eyelash samples were epilated from each patient and examined under the light microscope. RESULTS: DF was found in 28.8% (49/170) of patients with blepharitis and in 26.7% (88/330) of controls. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The overall prevalence was 27.4% (137/500) in all patients. Although the prevalence of DF increased with increasing age, no significant difference was found between the age groups. There was also no statistically significant difference for DF prevalence between males (28.9%; 71/246) and females (24.1%; 61/254).

After topical anesthesia a blue-green argon laser was used with 1 watt power, for 0.20 seconds, with 100 micrometer beam diameter. The beam was directed coaxially to the lash follicle to create a 2-3 mm crater and vaporization was observed. After crater formation, the laser parameters were changed to 1.2 watt power, for 0.20 seconds, with 200 micrometer beam diameter, to destroy residual follicular tissue. Up to five lashes were treated in one session. At the end of each session an antibiotic ointment was used t.i.d. for a week. RESULTS: Patients have been followed for 4-12 months (mean 6 months). Recurrences have been seen in 15 of 60 eyelids (25%). Laser treatment has been used with the same protocol for the cases with recurrence and results have been successful in eight of them. Postoperatively severe pain, hemorrhage, scar formation, neovascularization of lid margin, or infection were not seen in any patient.

The cilium was discovered years later following an injury. A cilium was noted to extend through the cornea into the anterior chamber barely touching the anterior lens capsule. Although the lens surface directly directly adjacent to the foreign body was clear, an anterior capsule lens opacification and area of posterior syncechia were noted at the 3 o'clock meridian. The eye was quiet with no cell or flare noted. The vision was 20/20.",M2
1191534,"Intra-epidermal carcinoma of the eyelid margin.Twenty-two cases of intra-epidermal carcinoma of the ciliary margin have been diagnosed in a 15-year survey. The clinical appearance is variable, resembling in some instances a benign warty lesion, and in others a fully developed squamous cell carcinoma. As the lesion grows it produces keratotic plugging of the lash follicles and nodules on the lid margin; in due course this results in loss of the related <e>cilia</e>. When dermal invasion occurs the resultant squamous cell carcinoma is potentially dangerous because of the involvement of the adnexal structures, which on the ciliary margins are particularly large and penetrate deeply into the lid substance. Adequate biopsy which includes at least one lash follicle is essential for accurate diagnosis, and treatment requires complete excision with a reasonable margin for safety. Of the twenty-two patients, nineteen were male and three female; fourteen of the men involved had handled oils and greases for prolonged periods.",M2
