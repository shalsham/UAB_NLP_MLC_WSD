20381125,"Summer fluxes of atmospheric greenhouse gases N2O, CH4 and CO2 from mangrove soil in South China.The atmospheric fluxes of N(2)O, <e>CH</e>(4) and CO(2) from the soil in four mangrove swamps in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, South China were investigated in the summer of 2008. The fluxes ranged from 0.14 to 23.83 micromol m(-2)h(-1), 11.9 to 5168.6 micromol m(-2)h(-1) and 0.69 to 20.56 mmol m(-2)h(-1) for N(2)O, CH(4) and CO(2), respectively. Futian mangrove swamp in Shenzhen had the highest greenhouse gas fluxes, followed by Mai Po mangrove in Hong Kong. Sha Kong Tsuen and Yung Shue O mangroves in Hong Kong had similar, low fluxes. The differences in both N(2)O and CH(4) fluxes among different tidal positions, the landward, seaward and bare mudflat, in each swamp were insignificant. The N(2)O and CO(2) fluxes were positively correlated with the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphate, total iron and NH(4)(+)-N contents, as well as the soil porosity. However, only soil NH(4)(+)-N concentration had significant effects on CH(4) fluxes.",M1
20201616,"Analysis of the gene 3 region sequences of Chinese field strains of Transmissible gastroenteritis virus.The genome of Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) displays genetic diversity especially in gene 3 region. Sequence and comparative analysis of 3a and 3b genes of eight Chinese field strains with reference TGEV strains indicated that these strains shared 87.0-100% and 51.5%-100% identities at the nucleotide level, respectively, and 86.1%-100% and 66.2%-100% identities at the amino acid level, respectively. Moreover, in one of the strains (<e>CH</e>/SDQ/08), a 51 nt deletion in the gene 3 region was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the eight Chinese strains were more closely related to TGEV strains H165, H16, Miller M6, Miller M60, TS, and CHV than to other reference strains. In addition, this study indicated the presence of different TGEV strains within the same pig herds in China.",M1
19955641,"Similar evolution in delta 13CH4 and model-predicted relative rate of aceticlastic methanogenesis during mesophilic methanization of municipal solid wastes.Similar evolution was obtained for the stable carbon isotope signatures delta (13)<e>CH</e>(4) and the model-predicted relative rate of aceticlastic methanogenesis during mesophilic methanization of municipal solid wastes. In batch incubations, the importance of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis changes in time. Initially, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominated, but increasing population of Methanosarcina sp. enhances aceticlastic methanogenesis. Later, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis intensified again. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the relative contribution of hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic pathways of methane generation during mesophilic batch anaerobic biodegradation of the French and the Chinese Municipal Solid Wastes (FMSW and CMSW). Taking into account molecular biology analysis reported earlier three groups of methanogens including strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens, strictly aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta sp.) and Methanosarcina sp., consuming both acetate and H(2)/H(2)CO(3) were considered in the model. The total organic and inorganic carbon concentrations, methane production volume, methane and carbon dioxide partial pressures values were used for the model calibration and validation. Methane isotopic composition (delta (13)CH(4)) evolution during the incubations was used to independently validate the model results. The model demonstrated that only the putrescible solid waste was totally converted to methane.",M1
19930936,"[Textual research on the Chinese names of three medicinal plants from Chaenomeles Lindl]Mugua was commonly used Chinese Materia Medica in past generations, the original plant of that is the same as the Chenomeles speciosa (Sweet) Nakai from the Rosaceae family; Mingzha in ancient times was misunderstood as and mixed with Mugua used as a herb, which comes from <e>Ch</e>. sinensis (Thouin) Kochne; Tiegenghaitang was used, as an ornamental flower before the Qing dynasty, the original plant of that corresponds with Ch. japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. In the attached images of Zhiwumingshitukao of the Qing dynasty, the name of Mugua was transposed. It has affected Japanese and some Chinese scholars in succession, which lead to the confused situation that mistook Mugua as the Chinese name of Ch. sinensis (Thouin) Kochne as well as Tiegenghaitang as the Chinese name of Ch. speciosa (Sweet) Nakai in current literature. It is proposed that it be decided to change the Chinese name of Ch. sinensis (Thouin)Koehne to Mugua, Ch. sinensis (Thouin) Koehne to Mingzha as well as Ch. japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. to Tiegenghaitang.",M1
19760096,"Two novel SNPs in the coding region of the bovine PRDM16 gene and its associations with growth traits.As a zinc-finger protein, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) controls brown fat determination by stimulating brown fat-selective genes expression while suppressing the expression of genes selective for white fat cells, whose mutations were associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemogenesis in human and murine model of leukemia. To date, no polymorphisms of PRDM16 gene in bovine had been reported. Herein, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing methods were employed to screen the genetic variation within PRDM16 gene in 1031 Chinese indigenous bovine. The results revealed two novel silent mutations: XM_001788152: m.1641T&gt;C (547aa), 1881G&gt;A (627aa). Hence, we described the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLP methods for detecting these mutations, respectively. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with PvuII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-C allele varied from 0.044 to 0.506 in four Chinese native breeds. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with HaeIII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-G allele were 0.474, 0.494, 0.576 and 0.906 for Jiaxian (JX), Nanyang (NY), Qinchuan (QC) and Chinese Holstein (<e>CH</e>) population. Significant statistical differences between genotypic frequencies implied that both of the polymorphic loci were significantly associated with cattle breeds by the chi square test (chi2 = 190.058, P &lt; 0.001 and chi2 = 118.239, P &lt; 0.001 for PvuII; chi2 = 209.842, P &lt; 0.001 and chi2 = 108.711, P &lt; 0.001 for HaeIII). The associations of the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLPs of bovine PRDM16 loci with growth traits were analyzed in Nanyang breed. The two SNPs were associated with body weight and average daily gain in Nanyang aged 12 months, individuals with genotype TT and AA showed significantly better body weight (P &lt; 0.05) and average daily gain (P &lt; 0.01) at 12 months, respectively.",M1
19718537,"Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria in China.BACKGROUND: Neonatal screening is helpful to prevent serious disability and sufferings caused by congenital or inherited disease. This study was to review the status of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (<e>CH</e>) and phenylketonuria (PKU) in China. METHODS: We analyzed data of neonatal screening for CH and PKU in the past two decades which were obtained from the national network of neonatal screening centers collected by the National Center for Clinical Laboratory. RESULTS: Of 18.8 million newborns screened from 1985 to 2007, 9198 were identified with CH, giving a prevalence of 1/2047. In 19.0 million newborns screened in the same period, 1638 had PKU, with a prevalence of 1/11 572. An increasing number of neonates have been subjected to neonatal screening in China annually during this period. Data from Zhejiang Neonatal Screening Center showed that the recall rate of neonates suspected with CH and PKU was 95.52% in 2007. Confirmatory tests were performed and treatments were initiated in most of the neonates with CH and PKU within a month after birth. CONCLUSIONS: More governmental support at different levels is needed to make neonatal screening more efficient. The screening should be improved with a satisfactory control system including shorter time of report and a higher recall rate.",M1
19544648,"[Antibody detection and sequencing analysis of hepatitis E virus in human population, swine and chicken in Sichuan region in China]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the seroprevalence of HEV infection and genotype. METHODS: ELISA were used for detecting anti-HEV IgG of the serum samples, the nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-nPCR) was used for detecting HEV RNA in patient serum and swine bile samples. All samples were collected in 2005-2007 in some districts in Sichuan province. The primers used for genotyping were the ORF2 region of HEV genome. RESULTS: The anti-HEV IgG was detected positive in childrens 6.10% (41/672), adults 42.26% (280/ 661), swines 88.89% (32/36), chickens negative (0/59). 1 case of 15 serum samples of anti-HEV IgM positive and 3 of 54 swine bile samples were positive for HEV RNA by RT-PCR.Sequence analysis of 4 isolates has 92.1% to 98.6% nucleotide sequence homology. These isolates from human and swine were identified closely related to <e>Ch</e>-T21 strain 90.1%-96.9% sequence homology, which belonged to HEV genotype 4B. CONCLUSIONS: The swine were the risk factors in the spread of hepatitis E virus.",M1
19515201,"Diversity and activity of methanotrophs in alkaline soil from a Chinese coal mine.Culture-independent molecular biological techniques, including 16S rRNA gene and functional gene clone libraries and microarray analyses using pmoA (encoding a key subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase), were applied to investigate the methanotroph community structure in alkaline soil from a Chinese coal mine. This environment contained a high diversity of methanotrophs, including the type II methanotrophs Methylosinus/Methylocystis, type I methanotrophs related to Methylobacter/Methylosoma and Methylococcus, and a number of as yet uncultivated methanotrophs. In order to identify the metabolically active methane-oxidizing bacteria from this alkaline environment, DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments using (13)<e>CH</e>(4) were carried out. This showed that both type I and type II methanotrophs were active, together with methanotrophs related to Methylocella, which had previously been found only in acidic environments. Methylotrophs, including Methylopila and Hyphomicrobium, were also detected in soil DNA and after DNA-SIP experiments. DNA sequence information on the most abundant, active methanotrophs in this alkaline soil will facilitate the design of oligonucleotide probes to monitor enrichment cultures when isolating key alkaliphilic methanotrophs from such environments.",M1
19470539,"Life-cycle assessment of the municipal solid waste management system in Hangzhou, China (EASEWASTE).With the purpose of assessing the environmental impacts and benefits of the current municipal solid waste management system and two modified systems, EASEWASTE, a life-cycle-based model, was used to evaluate the waste system of Hangzhou city in China. An integrated model was established, including waste generation, collection, transportation, treatment, disposal and accompanying external processes. The results showed that <e>CH</e>(4) released from landfilling was the primary pollutant contributing to global warming, and HCl and NH(3) from incineration contributed most to acidification. Material recycling and incineration with energy recovery were important because of the induced savings in material production based on virgin materials and in energy production based on coal combustion. A modified system in which waste is transported to the nearest incinerators would be relatively better than the current system, mainly due to the decrease of pollution from landfilled waste and the increase in energy production from waste avoiding energy production by traditional power plants. A ban on free plastic bags for shopping was shown to reduce most environmental impacts due to saved oil resources and other materials used in producing the plastic bags. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. LCA methodology and a model like EASEWASTE are very suitable for evaluating the overall environmental consequences, and can be used for decision support and strategic planning in developing countries such as China where pollution control has become increasingly important with the rapid increase of waste generation as well as the increasing public awareness of environmental protection.",M1
19457167,"Comparison of the distribution patterns of BK polyomavirus lineages among China, Korea and Japan: implications for human migrations in northeast Asia.BKV is widespread among humans, infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. Based on the serological or phylogenetic method, BKV isolates worldwide are classified into four subtypes (I-IV), with subtypes I and IV further divided into several genetically-distinct subgroups. Since, similarly to JCV, a close relationship exists between BKV lineages and human populations, BKV should be useful as a marker to trace human migrations. To elucidate ancient human migrations in northeast Asia, urine samples were collected from immunocompetent elderly patients in Shanghai, China; Anyang, South Korea; and various locations in Japan. Partial and complete BKV genomes from these samples were amplified and sequenced using PCR, and the determined sequences were classified into subtypes and subgroups by phylogenetic and SNP analyses. In addition, based on an SNP analysis, the major subtype I subgroup (I/c) was classified into two subdivisions, I/c/<e>Ch</e> and I/c/KJ. The distribution patterns of BKV subgroups and subdivisions among the three regions were compared. Some aspects of the subgroup and subdivision distribution were more similar between Korea and Japan, but others were more similar between China and Korea or between China and Japan. Based on these findings, we inferred various northeast Asian migrations. Most of the JCV-based inferences of northeastern Asian migrations were consistent with those based on BKV, but the previously suggested migration route from the Asian continent to the Japanese archipelago seemed to need revision.",M1
19456822,"Hepatitis B virus subgenotype C2 is the most prevalent subgenotype in northeast China.The geographical distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes and their clinical implications in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B in the Heilung-kiang province of northeast China were investigated. Nested PCR and multiplex PCR were performed with genotype-specific primers and with subgenotype-specific primers to identify genotypes and subgenotypes from serum samples of 412 HBV infections including 69 with acute self-limited hepatitis (ASH) and 343 with chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>). A total of 361 samples were genotyped and 304 were further subgenotyped. The most common HBV genotype was C (93.63%, 338/361), with subgenotype group C2 (83.73%, 283/338) predominating. Genotype B was also found and subgenotype B2 predominated within this genotype. Out of 69 infected patients with ASH, 48 were identified as genotype C and all belonged to subgenotype C2. Of 343 infected patients with CH, 313 were genotyped and 256 were subgenotyped; amongst these, C2 (91.80%, 235/256), B2 (7.42%, 19/256) and mixed subgenotypes B2 and C2 (0.78%, 2/256) were found. In HBV subgenotype C2 infections, ASH had a higher ratio of women than CH patients. These results show that HBV subgenotypes C2 and B2 were found in Heilung-kiang province of northeast China. In ASH and CH groups, the distributions of subgenotypes were coincident with C2, the predominant subgenotype. Analysis of the association between subgenotype and the outcomes of HBV infection was inconclusive in our study.",M1
19411273,"Methane emission by plant communities in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: a new experimental study of alpine meadows and oat pasture.Recently, plant-derived methane (<e>CH</e>(4)) emission has been questioned because limited evidence of the chemical mechanism has been identified to account for the process. We conducted an experiment with four treatments (i.e. winter-grazed, natural alpine meadow; naturally restored alpine meadow eight years after cultivation; oat pasture and bare soil without roots) during the growing seasons of 2007 and 2008 to examine the question of CH(4) emission by plant communities in the alpine meadow. Each treatment consumed CH(4) in closed, opaque chambers in the field, but two types of alpine meadow vegetation reduced CH(4) consumption compared with bare soil, whereas oat pasture increased consumption. This result could imply that meadow vegetation produces CH(4). However, measurements of soil temperature and water content showed significant differences between vegetated and bare soil and appeared to explain differences in CH(4) production between treatments. Our study strongly suggests that the apparent CH(4) production by vegetation, when compared with bare soil in some previous studies, might represent differences in soil temperature and water-filled pore space and not the true vegetation sources of CH(4).",M1
19349127,"Genetic variation analysis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolated in China from 2002 to 2007 based on ORF5.The complete open reading frame 5 (ORF5) sequences of 34 field porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates from China in 2002-2007 were detected and compared with the different variable Chinese isolates S1, <e>CH</e>-1a, HB-1, HB-2 and JXA1. The results showed that all isolates were of type 2 PRRSV and could be assigned to two clusters. The isolates in cluster sg1 was high similar with the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXA1, while sg2 clustered with type 2 PRRSV isolate VR2332. It was interesting that the isolate SH02 which was isolated from Shanghai in 2002 has 98.8% identity with JXA1 emerged in 2006. And the ZJJ07 isolate was found to be a natural recombinant between a Chinese highly pathogenic SY0608 isolate and a VR-2332 derivative NH04 isolate. Analysis of the potential glycosylation sites indicated that they were frequently mutated and formed five putative N-linked glycosylation (NGS) sites patterns based on N30, 33-35, 44 and 51 in those isolates. It indicated that the highly variable PRRSV strain with different NGS patterns spread widely in China. The great genetic diversity could be taken into consideration for the control and prevention of this disease.",M1
19283876,"Penn State Worry Questionnaire: structure and psychometric properties of the Chinese version.The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) is a measure of worry phenomena and has been demonstrated valid in cross-cultural populations. The present study examined the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of PSWQ (<e>Ch</e>-PSWQ) in a Chinese college sample (n=1243). Exploratory factor analysis of the Ch-PSWQ revealed a two-factor solution (engagement of worry and absence of worry). Confirmatory factor analysis and model comparison supported that the model of one factor with method effect provided the best fit to the data. The Ch-PSWQ and its factors evidenced good internal consistency and both convergent and discriminate validity. The present study supports the opinion that the second factor of PSWQ not only contains the component of evaluating pathological worry, but also might represent other traits.",M1
19139840,"Development and genetic mapping of SSR markers in foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.].SSR markers are desirable markers in analysis of genetic diversity, quantitative trait loci mapping and gene locating. In this study, SSR markers were developed from two genomic libraries enriched for (GA)n and (CA)n of foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.], a crop of historical importance in China. A total of 100 SSR markers among the 193 primer pairs detected polymorphism between two mapping parents of an F(2) population, i.e.  B100  of cultivated S. italica and  A10  of wild S. viridis. Excluding 14 markers with unclear amplifications, and five markers unlinked with any linkage group, a foxtail millet SSR linkage map was constructed by integrating 81 new developed SSR markers with 20 RFLP anchored markers. The 81 SSRs covered nine chromosomes of foxtail millet. The length of the map was 1,654 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 16.4 cM. The 81 SSR markers were not evenly distributed throughout the nine chromosomes, with <e>Ch</e>.8 harbouring the least (3 markers) and Ch.9 harbouring the most (18 markers). To verify the usefulness of the SSR markers developed, 37 SSR markers were randomly chosen to analyze genetic diversity of 40 foxtail millet accessions. Totally 228 alleles were detected, with an average 6.16 alleles per locus. Polymorphism information content (PIC) value for each locus ranged from 0.413 to 0.847, with an average of 0.697. A positive correlation between PIC and number of alleles and between PIC and number of repeat unit were found [0.802 and 0.429, respectively (P &lt; 0.01)]. UPGMA analysis revealed that the 40 foxtail millet cultivars could be grouped into five clusters in which the landraces' grouping was largely consistent with ecotypes while the breeding varieties from different provinces in China tended to be grouped together.",M1
19904469,"Newborn screening in China: phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism and expanded screening.This study was to investigate the current status of neonatal screening in China, to further clarify the incidences of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and congenital hypothyroidism (<e>CH</e>). From 2000 to 2007, a total of 17,961,826 newborns had been screened for HPA and 1527 cases were detected, giving a HPA prevalence of 1:11,763. At the same time, 18,284,745 newborns had also been tested for CH, with 8918 cases being detected (1:2050). It is remarkable that the mean number of newborns screened per year had increased 5 times between 2000 and 2007. In Shanghai, 116,000 newborns were screened using tandem mass spectrometry and 6 different were detected. The overall prevalence of an inborn errors of metabolism identified was 1 in 5800 healthy newborns, with hyperphenylalaninemia being the most common. Neonatal screening had developed rapidly in China in recent years, and a pilot study using tandem mass spectrometry has been started. The biggest challenge is still to increase coverage to the entire country, especially in the mid-western area.",M1
19022476,"Spatial variations on methane emissions from Zoige alpine wetlands of Southwest China.This study was aimed to understand the spatial variation of <e>CH</e>(4) emissions from alpine wetlands in Southwest China on a field-scale in two phenological seasons, namely the peak growing season and the spring thaw. Methane emission rates were measured at 30 plots, which included three kinds of environmental types: dry hummock, Carex muliensis and Eleocharis valleculosa sites. There were highly spatial variations of methane emissions among and within different environmental types in both phenological seasons. Mean methane emission rates ranged from 1.1 to 37.0 mg CH(4) m(-2) h(-1) in the peak growing season and from 0.004 to 0.691 mg CH(4) m(-)(2) h(-1) in the spring thaw. In the peak growing season, coefficients of variation (CV) averaged 38% among environmental types and 64% within environmental types; while in the spring thaw, CV were on the average 61% among environmental types and 96% within environmental types. The key influencing factors were the standing water table and the plant community height in the peak growing season, while in the spring thaw, no significant correlations between factors and methane emissions were found.",M1
18837293,"Disease progression patterns of SHIV-KB9 in rhesus macaques of Chinese origin in comparison with Indian macaques.OBJECTIVE: To develop a model of SHIV-KB9/Chinese origin rhesus (<e>Ch</e> Rh) macaques for vaccine research and to compare the pathogenesis of SHIV-KB9 in Ch Rh macaques with that reported in Indian rhesus (Ind Rh) macaques. METHODS: Seven mamu-A*01 negative Ch Rh macaques were inoculated intravenously with 1-10000 MID50 of SHIV-KB9. The monkeys were monitored for viral load, CD4, CD8, SHIV-specific antibody and virus genetic variation. The results were compared with those previously observed in Ind Rh macaques. RESULTS: As compared to that observed in Ind Rh macaques, SHIV-KB9 in Ch Rh macaques displayed three identical disease progression patterns. However, the primary pattern was not identical between the two subspecies. The level of plasma viremia differed in SHIV-KB9-infected Ch Rh macaques which exhibited different outcomes from those in Ind Rh macaques. Generally, the values of viral load and the maintenance of CD4+ T cells were associated with humoral responses. Otherwise, the viral genetic distances (divergence, diversity) were larger in animals (M419, M425) with their CD4+ T cells profoundly depleted. CONCLUSION: The model of SHIV-KB9/Ch Rh macaques displays a relatively slow progression to AIDS compared with Ind Rh macaques, which may more accurately reflect the potential of candidate vaccines in humans.",M1
18801591,"Sequential accumulation of the mutations in core promoter of hepatitis B virus is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in Qidong, China.BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) that might be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the high-risk area Qidong, China. METHODS: DNA sequences of HBV basal core promoter (BCP) and the overlapping X gene were determined in 58 HCC and 71 chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>) patients. In addition, a consecutive series of plasma samples from 15 HCC cases were employed to compare the CP/X sequences before and after the occurrence of HCC. RESULTS: T1762/A1764 double mutation was frequently found in Qidong patients, regardless of clinical status (65.5% in HCC and 73.2% in CH, P&gt;0.05). Unexpectedly, the adjacent T1766/A1768 mutation significantly increased the risk of HCC (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the prevalence of triple mutations in BCP was significantly higher in patients with HCC than those with CH (P&lt;0.05). The longitudinal study demonstrated that the mutations in BCP were gradually accumulated during the development of HCC. Colony formation assay showed while A1764 mutation alone did not alter the colony-inhibitory activity of HBx, double or triple mutations largely abrogated this effect. CONCLUSIONS: The complex mutation involving T1766/A1768 was closely related to HCC. The enhanced risk of HCC caused by BCP variants could be attributable partially to the aberrant activity of HBx.",M1
18726170,"High prevalence of hepatitis B virus pre-S mutation and its association with hepatocellular carcinoma in Qidong, China.We investigated the frequency and the clinical relevance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S mutations in Qidong, China. The results showed HBV pre-S mutants were detected in 48.4% (47/97) of patients with HBV infection. Both pre-S deletion and pre-S2 start codon mutations were more frequently found in HCC than in <e>CH</e> patients (51.1% vs. 18.0%, P &lt; 0.01 and 21.2% vs. 8.0%, P = 0.06). In most cases, pre-S mutants coexisted with the wild-type HBV strain. Longitudinal observation clearly revealed that in four of five cases, HBV deletion mutants emerged during the course of HBV infection and eventually became the predominant or exclusive viral population at the stage of HCC. Thus, it was concluded that HBV pre-S mutations were highly prevalent and closely related to HCC in Qidong. Our results also provided direct evidence that pre-S deletion mutants were not acquired from the beginning of infection but arose de novo during the progression of liver disease.",M1
18646462,"Identification of a newly isolated avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus variant in China exhibiting affinity for the respiratory tract.Twelve infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates obtained from commercial chickens in China between 2005 and 2006 were characterized by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the sequencing of the entire S1 gene. CK/<e>CH</e>/LSD/05I--an IBV variant, which was unlike the nephropathogenic IBV isolates found in China--exhibited an affinity for the respiratory tract. The variant was identified by phylogenic analysis and basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches of the entire S1 gene and by the vaccination-challenge test that was performed using heterologous strains. Further, it was demonstrated that the commercially used H120 vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against this variant; however, the attenuated heterologous IBV tl/CH/LDT3/03 P120, whose parent virus was isolated in China, showed a better efficacy of protection against CK/CH/LSD/05I. This study thus may demonstrate that the use of a combination of commercially available vaccines or of attenuated heterologous strains would provide satisfactory protection against the variant CK/CH/LSD/05I. In addition, the study also revealed that IBV strains exhibiting different pathogenicities were found cocirculating in the chicken flock in China.",M1
18599996,"[Effect of apoB polymorphism on plasma lipid levels and cerebral hemorrhage in Changsha Han Chinese]OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of apoB polymorphism on plasma lipid levels and cerebral hemorrhage in (<e>CH</e>) Changsha Han Chinese. METHODS: One hundred thirty CH patients and 100 normal people were involved. C7673T polymorphism of apoprotein B was analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-PFLP); and the triglyceride(TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL) levels were examined by oxidase method. The serum level of lipoprotein(a) was determined by immunology method. RESULTS: (1) Allele T frequencies of apoB C7673T in CH patients and the control group were 0.108 and 0.040, respectively. Allele T frequencies of apoB C7673T in the CH patients were significantly higher than those in the control group (P&lt; 0.01). (2) In the CH patients, the levels of TC and LDLjC of the T/C gene type were significantly higher than those of the C/C gene type, while the levels of HDLjC of the T/C gene type were significantly lower than those of the C/C gene type (P&lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: ApoB C7673T polymorphism may be related to cerebral hemorrhage, and the changing blood lipid level may increase the susceptibility of CH.",M1
18538976,"Measuring the symptom experience of Chinese cancer patients: a validation of the Chinese version of the memorial symptom assessment scale.The purpose of this study was to translate the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) into Chinese and evaluate the psychometric properties of this version. The original MSAS is a 32-item, patient-rated measure that was developed to assess common cancer-related physical and psychological symptoms with respect to frequency, intensity, and distress. In this study, a two-phase design was used. Phase I involved iterative forward-backward translation, testing of content validity (CVI) and a pretest. Phase II established the psychometric properties of the Chinese version MSAS (MSAS-<e>Ch</e>). Results showed that the MSAS-Ch achieved content relevancy CVI of 0.94 and semantic equivalence CVI of 0.94. Pretesting was performed in 10 cancer patients, and the results revealed adequate content coverage and comprehensibility of the MSAS-Ch. A convenience sample of 370 patients undergoing cancer therapy or at the early post-treatment stage was recruited for psychometric evaluation. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the construct validity of the MSAS-Ch, with a good fit between the factor structure of the original version and our present sample data (goodness-of-fit indices all above 0.95). The internal consistency reliability of subscales and total MSAS-Ch was moderately high, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.87. The test-retest intraclass correlation results for the subscale and total MSAS-Ch ranged from 0.68 to 0.79. The subscale scores of MSAS-Ch were moderately correlated with the scores on various validation measurements that assessed psychological distress, pain, and health-related quality of life (r = 0.46-0.65, P &lt; 0.01), confirming that they were measurements of similar constructs. The validity of the construct validity was also supported by comparing the MSAS-Ch scores for subpopulations that varied clinically. Inpatients and patients with poorer performance status scored higher on the MSAS-Ch subscale and total scores than outpatients and patients with higher performance status (P &lt; 0.05). Our study shows that the MSAS-Ch has adequate psychometric properties of validity and reliability, and can be used to assess symptoms during cancer therapy and at the early post-treatment stage in Chinese-speaking patients.",M1
18472391,"A psychometric study of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children in the Chinese setting.OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychometric properties of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-<e>Ch</e>) in the context of a Chinese setting. METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the construct validity of the Chinese version of the TEA-Ch among a group of 232 children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Test-retest reliability was tested on a random sub-sample of 20 children at a 4-week interval. Clinical discrimination was also examined by comparing children with and without ADHD (22 in each group) on the performances of the TEA-Ch. RESULTS: The current Chinese sample demonstrated a three-factor solution for attentional performance among children without ADHD, namely selective attention, executive control/switch, and sustained attention (chi(2)(24)=34.56; RMSEA=.044; p=.075). Moreover, the whole test demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability at a 4-week interval among a small sub-sample. Children with ADHD performed significantly more poorly than healthy controls in most of the subtests of the TEA-Ch. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that the test items remain useful in China, a culture very different from that in which the test originated. Finally, the TEA-Ch also presents several advantages when compared to other conventional objective measures of attention.",M1
18388844,"The association between patient satisfaction and quality of life in Chinese lung and liver cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction has been accorded increased importance in evaluating the quality of health care. However, only a few studies have examined factors associated with patient satisfaction in cancer populations, with no data currently available in Chinese oncology populations. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the longitudinal course of the relationship between patient satisfaction and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 253 liver cancer patients and 334 lung cancer patients were assessed during their first outpatient visit (baseline) and at 2 follow-up interviews (FU1 and FU2). QoL was measured by the Chinese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Scale [FACT-G (<e>Ch</e>)]. Patient satisfaction was assessed by the Nine-Item Chinese Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ChPSQ-9) and the cognitive subscale of the Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS-Cog). Linear mixed effects (LME) models were fitted to identify predictors of patient satisfaction and QoL. RESULTS: Results of LME analyses showed no significant between-group differences in psychosocial, satisfaction, and QoL measures over time (all P &gt; 0.05). Age [beta = -0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.03 to 0.00, P &lt; 0.05] and optimism (beta = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.30, P &lt; 0.001) predicted MISS-Cog and ChPSQ-9, respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, only ChPSQ-9 (beta = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.18, P &lt; 0.001) predicted QoL scores. No significant association between MISS-Cog and QoL was found. CONCLUSIONS: General emotional support from health professionals (ChPSQ-9) was a more effective predictor of QoL than was a measure of informational support (MISS-Cog) among these patients. Because expectations of clinical care likely vary by culture, and nature and stage of disease, measures of patient satisfaction that address both informational and care expectations are important.",M1
18385771,"Applying stable isotope probing of phospholipid fatty acids and rRNA in a Chinese rice field to study activity and composition of the methanotrophic bacterial communities in situ.Methanotrophs in the rhizosphere play an important role in global climate change since they attenuate methane emission from rice field ecosystems into the atmosphere. Most of the <e>CH</e>(4) is emitted via transport through the plant gas vascular system. We used this transport for stable isotope probing (SIP) of the methanotrophs in the rhizosphere under field conditions and pulse-labelled rice plants in a Chinese rice field with CH(4) (99% (13)C) for 7 days. The rate of (13)CH(4) loss rate during (13)C application was comparable to the CH(4) oxidation rate measured by the difluoromethane inhibition technique. The methanotrophic communities on the roots and in the rhizospheric soil were analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), cloning and sequencing of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene. Populations of type I methanotrophs were larger than those of type II. Both methane oxidation rates and composition of methanotrophic communities suggested that there was little difference between urea-fertilized and unfertilized fields. SIP of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA-SIP) and rRNA (RNA-SIP) were used to analyze the metabolically active methanotrophic community in rhizospheric soil. PLFA of type I compared with type II methanotrophs was labelled more strongly with (13)C, reaching a maximum of 6.8 atom-%. T-RFLP analysis and cloning/sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that methanotrophs, especially of type I, were slightly enriched in the 'heavy' fractions. Our results indicate that CH(4) oxidation in the rice rhizosphere under in situ conditions is mainly due to type I methanotrophs.",M1

Seventy-nine and forty-nine Chinese children with CH were enrolled for molecular analysis of the TSHR gene and TTF-1 gene, respectively. One hundred normal children were evaluated as control. The coding regions of TSHR and TTF-1 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Sequencing of the TSHR gene revealed a compound heterozygous variants (Pro52Thr/Val689Gly) and a heterozygous variant (Gly245Ser) in 2 of 79 patients. In 30 patients and 33 controls the normal cytosine at position 2181 in exon 10 of TSHR gene was replaced by a guanineCresulting in the replacement of Asp (727) by Glu. In 47 patients and 50 controls, the normal thymidine at position 561 in exon 7 of TSHR gene was replaced by a cytosine. This substitution did not change the amino acid in position 187. Sequencing of the TTF-1 gene revealed no mutation or polymorphism in 49 patients and 100 controls. In conclusion, three heterozygous variants (Pro52Thr, Gly245Ser, Val689Gly) of TSHR gene were firstly detected in Chinese children with CH. There were polymorphisms in exon 10 at nucleotide 2181 (C/G) and in exon 7 at nucleotide 561 (T/C) in TSHR gene. No mutation or polymorphism was detected in the coding region of TTF-1 gene. The mutation/variant of TSHR and TTF-1 genes is relatively rare in Chinese children with CH.",M1
18214664,"Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of membrane protein genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolates in China.Six porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were isolated from the fecal samples of piglets infected with PEDV in 2006 in China. The membrane (M) protein genes of six PEDV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), then cloned, sequenced, and compared with each other as well as those ten PEDV reference strains. The M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates consisted of 692 nucleotides containing a single open reading frame (ORF) of 681 nucleotides, which encoded a 226aa-long peptide. The conserved intergenic motif (ATAAAC), as previously recognized in Br1/87, was found in the 5 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates. The hexamer motif was also found in CV777, JMe2, LZC, and QH. The M protein of six isolates had three main transmembrane domains (aa20-38, aa43-65, aa75-97). The M protein of one isolate, <e>CH</e>/IMT/06, had one potential glycosylation site, but those of the other five isolates had two. The glycosylation sequence Asn-Phe-Thr was highly conserved in the M proteins of six PEDV isolates. The six PEDV isolates showed nucleotide sequence homology between 98.8 and 100% and deduced amino acid sequence homology between 98.2 and 100% with each other. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of M protein genes between the six PEDV isolates and ten reference PEDV strains varied from 97.2 to 99.4% and 96.9 to 100%, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic relationship of M protein genes, six Chinese PEDV isolates composed of a separate cluster including one Chinese strain JS-2004-02, however, not including the Chinese strain LJB/03. These results demonstrated that there was a new genotype of PEDV prevailing in China.",M1
18166227,"Mercury in human hair and blood samples from people living in Wanshan mercury mine area, Guizhou, China: an XAS study.Human hair and blood samples from persons living in the town of Wanshan, a mercury mine area in Guizhou Province of China, were collected and the quantitative speciation and structural information of Hg and S in hair samples and of Hg in erythrocyte and serum samples were studied using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Least-squares fitting of the X-ray absorption near-edge spectra found that inorganic mercury is the major mercury species in hair samples (91.74%), while inorganic and methyl mercury are both about 50% of total mercury in RBC and serum samples, which is in agreement with the data obtained by acidic extraction, fractionation of Hg(2+) and <e>CH</e>(3)Hg(+) and quantification by ICP-MS. Curve-fitting analysis revealed that the Hg-S bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.248+/-0.002 nm and 3.10, respectively, while the S-Hg bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.236+/-0.002 nm and 4.05. The Hg-S bond length and coordination number in RBC were 0.251+/-0.003 nm and 4.09, respectively, while they were 0.228+/-0.002 nm and 4.08 in serum, respectively.

17936045,"Evaluation of the protection conferred by commercial vaccines and attenuated heterologous isolates in China against the CK/<e>CH</e>/LDL/97I strain of infectious bronchitis coronavirus.Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes tremendous economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Different serotypes of this virus show little cross-protection. The present study investigated the genotypic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains and reference IBVs based on S1 gene comparisons and the protection provided by vaccination with commercial vaccines and attenuated homologous and heterologous strains. Phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of S1 showed that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type virus might be a new serotype compared to vaccine strains and other types of IBV isolates in China. Protection efficacy was evaluated by morbidity, mortality, and virus re-isolation from the challenged chicks. Complete protection by IBV vaccination was provided by the homologous strain but sufficient respiratory protection was not provided by the commercial vaccines. Heterologous strains against CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge and the development of a vaccine against CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV will be necessary to control infectious bronchitis disease in poultry. Further development of the attenuated CK/CH/LDL/97I strain may provide a valuable contribution towards this goal.",M1

METHODS: 482 patients with chronic HBV infection, belonging to 4 nationalities, including 225 asymptomatic carriers (ASC), 158 chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>), 57 liver cirrhosis (LC), 42 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), from 4 areas of Guizhou province were examined. HBV A1896 and T1762/A1764 mutations were determined by direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). HBV genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP based on S gene. The relationship among these mutations and genotype and the progression of liver disease were studied by multi-normal logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A1896 and T1762/A1764 mutations were detected 23.03% and 29.67% among 482 patients. These mutations were more prevalent in Hans than in Dong, Miao and Buyi minorities (P &lt; 0.01, respectively). The mutations of A1896 and T1762/ A1764 were more commonly seen in HBeAg negative than in HBeAg positive patients (P &lt; 0.01, respectively). The mutation of T1762/A1764 was significantly higher in genotype C than in genotype B (P &lt; 0.01). There were significantly statistical differences in the detective rate of A1896 and T1762/ A1764 mutations between patients with HCC, LC and CH, ASC. The distribution of these mutations in Guiyang (31.79% and 41.06%) was higher than in Zunye (10.94%, 14.06%), Duyun (8.64%, 11.11%) or Kaili (2.86%, 2.86%). However, there was no statistical difference by multi-normal logistic regression analysis after controlling the influence of HBeAg statu, genotype and clinical types.

METHODS: In Sino-MONICA Project, acute stroke events were registered in a standardized way in men and women aged 35 - 74 years in Beijing from 1984 to 2000. Death even was defined as death within 28 days after stroke onset. From January 1 1984 to December 31 2000, 13,556 patients were registered, and 3905 died within 28 days of stroke onset. RESULTS: (1) The overall case-fatality within 28 days after stroke was 28.8% from 1984 to 2000, and the case-fatality were 63.2% for cerebral infarction (CI) and 34.8% for cerebral haemorrhage (<e>CH</e>) respectively. (2) The case-fatality for stroke declined 1.51% (P &lt; 0.01) in men and 1.83% (P &lt; 0.01) in women annually during 1984 to 2000, and the decline rate for CH and CI were 1.48% and 0.51% per year respectively. (3) The case-fatality ratio between men and women was 1:1.13 (P &lt; 0.01). The case fatality for stroke was higher in rural area (38.7%) than in urban area (26.3%) (P &lt; 0.01), and higher for recurrent stroke (36.1%) than for initial stroke (25.2%) (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 28-day case-fatality after stroke onset decreased continually in the population aged 35 - 74 in Beijing during 1984 to 2000. The biggest contribution was from the decline of case-fatality of cerebral haemorrhage of stroke. In order to decrease the incidence of stroke, promoting the quality of health care and secondary prevention for stroke will be necessary, especially in rural area.",M1
17588741,"Quality of life as a predictor of cancer survival among Chinese liver and lung cancer patients.The utility of quality of life (QoL) scores in predicting cancer survival remains inconclusive because of methodological and/or statistical heterogeneity. We examined whether QoL scores predicted survival among Chinese liver (n=176) and lung cancer (n=358) patients. Cox proportional hazards models examined if QoL and psychosocial variables predicted survival after fully adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. The results showed that global QoL scores did not predict survival in either patient group. Less advanced cancer stage (HR=2.574, p&lt;0.05) was associated with longer survival in liver cancer. Longer survival in lung cancer was predicted by younger age (HR=1.016, p&lt;0.05), less advanced cancer stage (HR=1.978, p&lt;0.001), having had treatment before baseline (HR=0.671, p&lt;0.05), better physical well-being (HR=0.941, p&lt;0.001) and better appetite (HR=0.888, p&lt;0.001).

17517465,"Emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O from freshwater marsh in northeast of China.The wetlands play an important role in carbon storage, especially at high latitudes, at which they store nearly one-third of global soil carbons. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of CO(2), <e>CH</e>(4) and N(2)O in the long-term, especially effects of freeze-thaw cycles on these gases emissions in freshwater marsh ecosystems. In this paper, we collected greenhouse gas emission data from a freshwater marsh area in China for 4 years, evaluated their release variables and speculated on their potential atmospheric impact. For this paper, we report on the CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O emission rates recorded from June 2002 to November 2005 in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. We measured their interannual variations and fluctuations, as well as factors affecting their emissions, and estimated their regulation and freeze-thaw cycle impacts. Our results revealed obvious CO(2) and CH(4) emission fluctuations during the winter months, and during the freeze-thaw cycle, and a strong interannual variation during the growing season. Overall, we documented a close relationship between the CO(2) and CH(4) emissions, implicating some regulatory commonality. We determined that the marsh was a N(2)O sink during the winter, but a significant source of N(2)O during the freeze-thaw cycle as the temperature increased, especially in early summer. During the thaw-freeze period, the N(2)O levels were positively correlated with the water depth. Additionally, water depth greatly governed the interannual variation of the N(2)O emissions from the marshes during the thaw-freeze period.",M1
17507207,"Changes in microbial community structure and function within particle size fractions of a paddy soil under different long-term fertilization treatments from the Tai Lake region, China.Greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emission from paddy soils impacts global climate change. Soil particle size fractions (PSFs) of different sizes act as soil microhabitats for different kinds of microbial biota with varying conditions of redox reactions and soil organic matter (SOC) substrates. It is crucial to understand the distribution of soil microbial community structure within PSFs and linkage to the GHG production from paddy soils of China. The change of bacterial and methangenic archaeal community and activity relating to <e>CH</e>(4) and CO(2) production with PSFs under different fertilizer applications was studied in this paper. The fertilization trial was initiated in a paddy soil from the Tai Lake region, Jiangsu, China with four treatments of non-fertilized (NF), fertilized with inorganic fertilizers only (CF), inorganic with pig manure (CFM) and inorganic with straw return (CFS), respectively since 1987, and the PSFs (&lt;2 microm, 2-20 microm, 20-200 microm, and 200-2000 microm) were separated by a low energy sonication dispersion procedure from undisturbed samples. Analysis of bacterial community within different size particles was conducted by PCR-DGGE. The results indicated significant variation of bacterial community structure within different PSFs. The methane was predominantly produced in the coarser fractions, while more species and higher diversity of bacteria survived in the size of &lt;2 microm fractions, in which the bacterial community structure was more significantly affected by fertilizer application practices than in the other coarser fractions. Higher bacterial species richness and more diversities in the smallest size fractions was due to the vicinity between microbes, access to carbon resource outside the microaggregates, and smaller pore size as protective agent suitable habitats for microbes rather than high SOC. Whereas, higher CO(2), CH(4) production and methanogenic archaeal community in coarser fractions may be contributed to storage of labile organic carbon in these fractions. It indicated that availability of SOC in PSFs is mainly factor affected survival of methanogenic archaeal community structure, whereas, bacterium community habitation more affected by physical protection of their location in PSFs. Their activity greatly depended on liability of SOC access to PSFs. Fertilizer application caused more change of bacteria community in clay fraction and greatly increased bacterium and methanogen activity in coarser fractions but only a slight effect on methanogenic archaeal community in the particle size fractions.",M1
17503212,"The composition, trend and impact of urban solid waste in Beijing.This paper provides an overview of the trend of generation, composition, and management of municipal solid waste, and estimates the carbon emissions arising from municipal solid waste management in Beijing. The correlation analysis conducted shows that the generation of municipal solid waste in Beijing has been growing steadily, showing high correlations (r &gt; 0.9) to the total GDP, per capita income, and the population. Food waste showed an increasing trend since 1990. Compared with the results of an investigation in 1990, ash and woodchips content in 2003 declined from 56% to 17%, while the percentage of paper and plastic increased from 10% to 29% over the same period. The calorific value of the municipal waste also increased, from 2,686 kJ/kg in 1990 to 4,667 kJ/kg in 2003, indicating that the waste is suitable for incineration. Currently, the source separation ratio of municipal waste is approximately 15%. About 94% of all the collected solid waste goes to the landfill while 4% is composted and 2% is incinerated. A moderate garbage collection fee is applied to both permanent and temporary residents in Beijing, but the willingness to pay for solid waste collection and treatment is still low. Under current treatment mode, the total amounts of carbon emission from waste disposal sites and incineration increased with the increase of municipal solid waste, from 29.8 Gg in 1990 to 84.5 Gg in 2003, including 83.3 Gg of <e>CH</e>(4) and 22.0 Gg of CO(2).

To more fully understand the extent of genetic diversity of PRRSV in China, we analyzed and compared the GP5 sequences of 42 PRRSV isolated from 1996 to 2006 in mainland China. We found that all of the Chinese isolates examined belong to the North American (NA) type. Among them two highly diverse subgroups were clearly demarcated on the NA-genotype phylogenetic tree. All the subgroup 1 isolates were found to be high variable in the primary neutralizing epitope and the viruses were geographically restricted to regions in southeast China. The subgroup 2 isolates shared a high identity with MLV vaccine and its parent virus VR-2332. These results may contribute to the knowledge of PRRSV epidemiology in China, and may help to explain the low efficiency of MLV or killed <e>CH</e>-1a vaccine to protect the subgroup 1 virus infected pigs, and the great genetic diversity should be taken into consideration for control and preventive measures.",M1
17376881,"Clinical and virological characteristics of hepatitis B virus subgenotypes Ba, C1, and C2 in China.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes Ba, C1 (Cs), and C2 (Ce) are the most prevalent HBV variants in China. To investigate the virological characteristics of these subgenotypes and their clinical implications, we enrolled a cohort of 211 patients in the Guangdong Province of China, including 132 with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (<e>CH</e>), 32 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 47 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to clinical examination, liver function test, and ultrasonograph results. Overall, HBV Ba was found in 51.2% (108/211), HBV C1 in 33.6% (71/211), and HBV C2 in 15.2% (32/211) of the cases. The distribution of HBV genotype C was greater among patients in the LC and HCC groups than among patients in the CH group, while the distribution of HBV genotype B was greater among the CH patients than among the LC and HCC patients. No significant differences in clinical features were found among patients with HBV Ba, C1, and C2. Virologically, HBV C1 had the strongest association with the A1762T G1764A double mutation, while the mutation at position 1896 resulting in A (1896A) was uncommon. In contrast, HBV Ba had the highest frequency of 1896A but the lowest of A1762T G1764A, and HBV C2 had intermediate frequencies of these mutations. Mutations of 1653T and 1753V were specifically associated with HBV C2 and C1, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that the 1653T, 1753V, and A1762T G1764A mutations and patient age significantly increased the risk of HCC development. In conclusion, HBV Ba, C1, and C2 have different mutation patterns in the enhancer II/core promoter/precore region. Therefore, genotyping and detecting the 1653T and 1753V mutations, in addition to the A1762T G1764A double mutation, might have important clinical implications as predictive risk factors for hepatocarcinogenesis.",M1
17362632,"[A study in the Guizhou area on pre-S region mutations of hepatitis B virus]OBJECTIVE: To study the relationships between hepatitis B virus (HBV ) pre-S region mutations and their genotypes and the stages of liver disease of the patients. METHODS: The entire HBV pre-S1 and pre-S2 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified products were digested by NlaIII restriction enzyme. A detecting method for pre-S2 start codon mutation was established according to the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Pre-S region deletion was revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Fourteen sera having pre-S deletions or pre-S2 start codon mutations and wild strains were directly sequenced. HBV genotypes were determined by RFLP based on S-gene PCR products. One hundred sixty serum samples were collected from patients with HBV related diseases and they were determined by the above methods. The relationships between HBV pre-S region mutations and their genotypes and the stages of liver disease of the patients were analysed. RESULTS: Of the 160 sera, genotype B and C were identified in 81 and 79 respectively. The detected ratios of pre-S2 start codon and pre-S deletion mutations were significantly higher in genotype C than in genotype B (43.04% vs 1.23%, 36.71% vs 19.75%, P&lt;0.05, respectively). The detection rates of pre-S2 start codon mutation were significantly different in different groups: from 50.00% (HCC), 39.47% (LC), 8.00% (<e>CH</e>), to ASC (0). The detection rates of pre-S deletion mutations among patients with HCC (53.13%), LC (42.11%), CH (18.00%) and ASC (7.50%) also varied significantly. The results obtained from sequencing and PCR-RFLP/PAGE were completely compatible. Multivariate analysis indicated that genotype C (OR=6.26, P&lt;0.01) and advanced liver disease (OR=11.99, P&lt;0.01) were significant variables for pre-S mutations development. CONCLUSION: The pre-S2 start codon and pre-S deletion mutations are more common in genotype C than in genotype B. These mutations are closely related to the progression of liver disease.",M1

We compared trace gas emissions from S. alterniflora with those from a native C(3) plant, Phragmites australis, by establishing brackish marsh mesocosms to experimentally assess the effects of plant species (S. alterniflora vs. P. australis), flooding status (submerged vs. non-submerged), and clipping (plants clipped or not) on trace gas emissions. The results show that trace gas emission rates were higher in S. alterniflora than P. australis mesocosms due to the higher biomass and density of the former, which could fix more available substrates to the soil and potentially emit more trace gases. Meanwhile, trace gas emission rates were higher in non-submerged than submerged soils, suggesting that water might act as a diffusion barrier in the brackish marsh mesocosms. Interestingly, methane (<e>CH</e>(4)) emission rates were lower in clipped non-submerged mesocosms than in non-clipped submerged mesocosms, but nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions were enhanced. CH(4) emissions were significantly correlated with the plant biomass and stem density (R(2)&gt;0.48, P&lt;0.05) for both species, suggesting that both the two species might play important roles in CH(4) production and transport and also act as suppliers of easily available substrates for the methanogenic bacteria in wetland ecosystems. N(2)O emissions, however, were not significantly correlated with plant biomass and density (P&gt;0.05).",M1
17258505,"Oral mucositis and quality of life of Hong Kong Chinese patients with cancer therapy.Oral mucositis associated with cancer therapy often has devastating impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), affecting multiple spheres of daily and psychosocial functioning. This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed at describing the severity and distress of oral mucositis, as well as QoL of Hong Kong Chinese patients treated with cancer therapy, and identifying the extent to which oral mucositis correlated with QoL. A convenience sample of 38 in-patients and 50 out-patients with solid tumors and during the peak phase of oral mucositis was recruited. The severity and distress of oral mucositis were assessed by a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 (mild) to 4 (very severe) and 5-point rating scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much), respectively. The QoL was assessed by the Chinese version Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaires (<e>Ch</e>-FACT-G). The mean+/-SD severity and distress scores of oral mucositis were 2.1+/-0.9 and 1.6+/-1.2, respectively. The total mean+/-SD scores of physical, social/family, emotional, and functional subscales of the Ch-FACT-G were 15.1+/-5.9, 16.3+/-4.1, 15.7+/-4.5, and 11.9+/-6.8 separately. The physical subscale of the Ch-FACT-G significantly correlated with the severity (r=0.305, P&lt;0.01) and the distress (r=0.355, P&lt;0.01) of oral mucositis. A significantly mild positive correlation was also found between the emotional subscale of the Ch-FACT-G and the severity of oral mucositis (r=0.314, P&lt;0.01). Subjects receiving radiotherapy reported a lower range of total social/family, emotional, and functional subscale scores than that of those receiving chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy, but these differences were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, QoL, especially the functional sphere, was compromised for patients with oral mucositis. The data also support the correlations between oral mucositis and the physical sphere of QoL, as well as oral mucositis and the emotional sphere of QoL.",M1
17205280,"Change in quality of life in Chinese women with breast cancer: changes in psychological distress as a predictor.INTRODUCTION: The effect of fluctuating psychological distress on quality of life (QoL) scores is not well delineated. We examined how changes in psychological distress affected change in QoL over time in 259 Chinese women recovering from breast cancer (BC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women were interviewed during their first postoperative outpatient visit for chemotherapy (Baseline), at 3 months (FU1), and at 6 months after Baseline (FU2). Respondents completed the Chinese version of the FACT-G version-3 scale [FACT-G (<e>Ch</e>)]. Psychological distress was assessed using three categorical measures of depression, mood, and boredom. Linear mixed effects (LME) models examined whether changes in psychological distress predicted subsequent changes in QoL. RESULTS: Respondents' mood improved significantly over time from baseline to FU2 (Baseline/FU2: standardized beta = -0.266, p &lt; 0.005; FU1/FU2: standardized beta = -0.243, p &lt; 0.005). Changes in depression scores consistently predicted subsequent changes in overall (standardized beta = 4.96; 95% CI, 3.749, 6.171, p &lt; 0.001), physical (standardized beta = 1.752; 95% CI, 1.209, 2.294, p &lt; 0.001), and functional (standardized beta = 0.872; 95% CI, 0.308, 1.436, p &lt; 0.001) QoL scores. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of change in psychological distress significantly impacted physical and functional, but not social QoL in Chinese BC patients. These data highlight the need to address psychological and physical distress as part of the drive to improve physical and functional QoL for women with BC.",M1
17091368,"Quality of life and pain in Chinese lung cancer patients: Is optimism a moderator or mediator?OBJECTIVE: To clarify if optimism exerts a primarily moderating or mediating influence on the pain-QoL association in Chinese lung cancer patients. METHODS: About 334 Chinese lung cancer patients were interviewed at baseline during the first outpatient visit (Baseline), at 4 months after Baseline (FU1), and at 8 months after Baseline (FU2). Respondents completed the Chinese version of the FACT-G version-3 scale (FACT-G (<e>Ch</e>)). Optimism and pain were assessed using two 11-point self-rated items. Linear mixed effects (LME) models tested the moderating and mediating effects of optimism on QoL. RESULTS: Optimism, pain, and QoL were most strongly correlated at FU1. LME models failed to show any moderating effect by optimism on the pain-QoL association (standardized beta = -0.049, 95% CI -0.097 to 0.001). After adjustment for age, cancer stage, and disease recurrence, a modest mediating effect was observed for optimism on the pain-QoL association over the duration of the study (standardized beta = 0.047; Sobel test z = -4.317, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Optimism qualifies as a mediator between pain and QoL suggesting that pessimistic lung cancer patients are likely to experience greater QoL decrements in response to pain in the early post-diagnostic period. Effective pain control may be enhanced by inclusion of interventions that facilitate optimistic perspectives in patients. This study lends further support to the view that lung cancer patients' psychological needs are important in both pain control and QoL.",M1
17037075,"[Sequence analysis of integration sites of reticuloendotheliosis virus LTR in fowlpox vaccine virus genomes]By use of genomic DNA prepared from 5 fowlpox virus (FPV) vaccines made in China (from Shandong, Beijing, Liaoning, Zhejing and Shanghai respectively) as the templates, reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) LTR was amplified in PCR with a pair of primers synthesized according to the sequences flanking the integrated REV-5'LTR in FPV genomes published in US and Australia. Sequence analysis indicated that the REV-5'LTR integration sites in genomes of all 5 Chinese PFV vaccine products were identical to American and Australian FPV vaccines with integrated REV-5' LTR. Among the 5 FPV vaccine products made in China, 3 productes Vac-B-<e>Ch</e>, Vac-D-Ch and Vac-E-Ch had the integrated REV-5' LTR sequences of 223bp with 100% homology to that in American vaccine Vac-3-Am and Australian vaccine Vac-M3-Au. The integrated 505bp REV-LTR sequences in another Chinese products Vac-A-Ch and Vac-C-Ch had 99.6% homology to the integrated REV-LTR of American vaccine Vac-1-Am and Australian vaccine Vac-S-Au. However, REV-5'LTR integrated in all 5 FPV vaccines made in China gave only 75.4%-91.5% homology to LTR of a Chinese field strain HA9901 of REV. Based on the above results, it is reasonable to speculate that the virus stocks for the 5 Chinese FPV vaccine products were rather originally imported with their integrated REV LTR than recombinated with LTR of REV local field strains in China.",M1
17023025,"Dynamics of methane emissions from a freshwater marsh of northeast China.In this paper, <e>CH</e>(4) flux was measured from Nov. 2002 to Oct. 2005, to estimate CH(4) emissions in winter and during freeze-thaw period, and interannual variation in CH(4) emissions in freshwater marsh in northeast China. The results showed that there was an obvious CH(4) emission (0.1-2.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in the freshwater marsh in winter. Flux of CH(4) in winter (November to March the next year) was about 3.8%, 5.5%, and 2.2% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Emission of CH(4) significantly increased during the freeze-thaw period (April-June), and was about 30.8%, 20.9%, and 20.6% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Standing water depth greatly governed interannual variation of CH(4) emissions from marshes during the thaw-freeze period. Interannual variation of CH(4) emissions was significant during the growing season (p&lt;0.05). Standing water depth during April to June was a primary factor, which affected the interannual variation of CH(4) flux during the growing season. Precipitation during the preceding non-growing season affected CH(4) emission indirectly via standing water depth.",M1
16990149,"Infectious bronchitis virus: S1 gene characteristics of vaccines used in China and efficacy of vaccination against heterologous strains from China.The entire S1 protein genes of eight infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine strains used in China were compared with those of the IB virus isolates present in the field in China. The nucleotide and amino acid similarities between the eight IB vaccine strains and the field strain, tl/<e>CH</e>/LDT3/03, which was isolated from a teal (Anas sp.), were not more than 81.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 genes showed that the vaccines and field strains belonged to different clusters and showed larger evolutionary distances, and indicated that they were of different genotypes. Four out of the eight vaccines, in addition to the Massachusetts type vaccine H120, were used for protection tests against challenge by the IB virus isolate tl/CH/LDT3/03. This revealed that each of the five IB vaccines induced poor protection against the teal isolate, as assessed by respiratory protection, clinical signs and mortality, indicating the necessity of developing vaccines from local strains for IB control in China.",M1
16737728,"Removal of methyl chloroform in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China.The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (<e>CH</e>(3)CCl(3)) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH(3)CCl(3) emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH(3)CCl(3) emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH(3)CCl(3) due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH(3)CCl(3) fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions. Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH(3)CCl(3) in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH(3)CCl(3) ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2)d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH(3)CCl(3). In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH(3)CCl(3) when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2)d(-1). However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH(3)CCl(3) whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH(3)CCl(3) depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH(3)CCl(3) flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH(3)CCl(3). Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH(3)CCl(3) and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH(3)CCl(3).",M1
16478446,"Diversity and ubiquity of thermophilic methanogenic archaea in temperate anoxic soils.Temperate rice field soil from Vercelli (Italy) contains moderately thermophilic methanogens of the yet uncultivated rice cluster I (RC-I), which become prevalent upon incubation at temperatures of 45-50 degrees C. We studied whether such thermophilic methanogens were ubiquitously present in anoxic soils. Incubation of different rice field soils (from Italy, China and the Philippines) and flooded riparian soils (from the Netherlands) at 45 degrees C resulted in vigorous <e>CH</e>(4) production after a lag phase of about 10 days. The archaeal community structure in the soils was analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) targeting the SSU rRNA genes retrieved from the soil, and by cloning and sequencing. Clones of RC-I methanogens mostly exhibited T-RF of 393 bp, but also terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) of 158 and 258 bp length, indicating a larger diversity than previously assumed. No RC-I methanogens were initially found in flooded riparian soils. However, these archaea became abundant upon incubation of the soil at 45 degrees C. Thermophilic RC-I methanogens were also found in the rice field soils from Pavia, Pila and Gapan. However, the archaeal communities in these soils also contained other methanogenic archaea at high temperature. Rice field soil from Buggalon, on the other hand, only contained thermophilic Methanomicrobiales rather than RC-I methanogens, and rice field soil from Jurong mostly Methanomicrobiales and only a few RC-I methanogens. The archaeal community of rice field soil from Zhenjiang almost exclusively consisted of Methanosarcinaceae when incubated at high temperature. Our results show that moderately thermophilic methanogens are common in temperate soils. However, RC-I methanogens are not always dominating or ubiquitous.",M1
16397751,"Genetic diversity of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus strains isolated in China between 1995 and 2004.Twenty-six avian infectious bronchitis (IB) viruses (IBV) were isolated from outbreaks in chickens in China between 1995 and 2004. They were characterized by comparison with twenty-six Chinese reference strains and five other IBV strains. Chinese IBVs, which were mainly nephropathogenic, were placed into seven genotypes. Fourteen Chinese IBV isolates were placed in genotype I, having small evolutionary distances from each other. Genotype II included 6 strains that were isolated in the 1990s in China. Genotype III consisted of eight Chinese isolates that showed close relationship with Korean IBV isolates. Another eight IBV isolates clustered in genotype IV and showed larger evolutionary distances. The Massachusetts serotype was present in China in 1990s and was in a separate genotype. Two isolates, HN99 and CK/<e>CH</e>/LHN/00I, which might be a reisolation of vaccine strains, clustered into genotype VI. Four Chinese IBV isolates formed another genotype and showed larger evolutionary distances from other Chinese IBV genotypes (genotype VII). IBVs in same genotypes showed more than 90% amino acid sequence similarities, whereas most of the viruses in different genotypes showed less than 90%. The results showed that IBVs in China came from genetic changes both in IBV populations that existed before the advent of vaccination and in the viruses that were introduced through live vaccines. IBVs showing various genetic differences are cocirculating in China.",M1
16313772,"[Risk factors of familial gallstone disease: study of 135 pedigrees]OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of both inheritable and epidemiological factors in the pathogenesis of familial gallstone disease in pedigrees. METHODS: 135 pedigrees, with 695 members aged &gt; or = 18 (18 - 83, with a mean of 50 +/- 14), 282 males and 413 females, including 370 patients, at least one patient existing in every generation, were investigated. Inquiry was carried out to collect the personal and medical history. Physical examination and ultrasonography were conducted. Blood samples were collected to detect the total cholesterol (TCh), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-<e>Ch</e>), and apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB. The concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Ch) was calculated by the formula: Tch-TG/5 + HDL-Ch. The inheritable characteristics and heritability were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of gallstone disease was 53.24%, 56.66% among the females, significantly higher than that among the males (48.23%, P = 0.03). The heritability in the first-degree relatives was 138% +/- 7%, and the concordance rate of monozygotic twins was 100%. The significant risk factors were female gender (P = 0.03), body mass index (P &lt; 0.01) and diet (P &lt; 0.008). The history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes were correlated to gallstone disease (P = 0.008, &lt; 0.008, and 0.03 respectively). Serum HDL-Ch and ApoA1 concentrations were lower in the stone group than in the non-stone group (P = 0.003 and 0.005 respectively). There were no significant differences in TCh, TG, LDL-Ch, and ApoB between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of familial gallstone disease, characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance. Female gender, obesity, diet, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes may be the risk factors of gallstone disease. Dyslipidemia is a characteristic of gallstone disease.",M1
16286258,"HBV genotype characterization and distribution in patients with HBV-related liver diseases in Zhejiang Province, P.R. China: possible association of co-infection with disease prevalence and severity.BACKGROUND: There are 8 well-documented genotypes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) at this time point. Genotyping can be accomplished based on a partial sequence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome such as the pre-S or S gene. Several methods have been developed and used for HBV genotyping including direct sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism, line probe assay and enzyme-linked immunoassay. Recently, a novel, rapid and cost-effective genotyping method based on PCR amplification assay using type-specific primers that can identify all six major genotypes has been developed. This study was undertaken to characterise HBV genotypes and investigate the association between the prevalence of different genotypes and the severity of HBV-induced liver diseases. METHODS: Serum samples from carriers of HBV and patients with HBV-related liver diseases from Zhejiang Province were screened for viral serological markers using commercially available radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Serum HBV DNA load was determined by real-time detection PCR. A type-specific primer based the nested-PCR method was employed in the HBV genotyping. The genotype results obtained were confirmed by direct sequencing of nested PCR amplicons of the pre-S region. Ten samples of each genotype (B and C) were sequenced. RESULTS: The survey on a cohort of 125 HBV carriers in and around Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province showed the existence of HBV genotypes A (0.8%), B (48%), C (40.8%), D (0.8%), mixed B and C (9.6%) and an absence of E and F genotypes. Distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with liver diseases revealed a statistically insignificant higher prevalence of genotype B in mild chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>). Among the three genotypes B, C and mixed B/C infections 11 (73.3%), 3 (20%) and 1 (6.7%), (P&lt;0.05), respectively in subjects with moderate CH, genotype B was significantly predominant. The infection patterns for genotypes B, C and B/C mixed in (i) liver cirrhosis (LC) 4 (23.5%), 10 (58.8%) and 3 (17.7%) and (ii) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2 (28.6%), 5 (71.4%) and 0 (0.0%) respectively revealed a marked association of C genotype with liver disease; however, the association was statistically insignificant (P&gt;0.05). Differences in positive rate of HBeAg for the three genotypes B, 16 (30.8%), C, 27 (51.9%), and mixed B/C, 9 (17.3%) were significant (P&lt;0.05), with genotype C showing predominance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show an interesting distribution of HBV A-D genotypes in Zhejiang Province. Furthermore, our results indicate a novel and markedly high prevalence of mixed B/C genotype infections in subjects with severe CH and LC, and a possible association of mixed B/C infections with the severity of liver diseases in this region of Mainland China.",M1
16257759,"The investigation of chemical structure of coal macerals via transmitted-light FT-IR microspectroscopy.The Late Permian coals from South China are characterized by high content of the unique maceral  barkinite  and elemental hydrogen, typically produce high yields of tar, and exhibit significant oil-producing potential.  Barkinite  has been identified as suberinite for a long time, but now many Chinese workers have concluded that  barkinite  is not suberinite, rather it is a distinct maceral. The term  barkinite  was formally certified and named by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision of PR China in 1991, 1995, and 1999, however, it has not been recognized as a scientific term by international coal geologists and the ICCP. Transmitted-light FT-IR microspectroscopy and curve-fitting analysis were used to investigate the chemical structure of  barkinite ; at the same time, parallel studies were also carried out on vitrinite, fusinite, and sporinite. In comparison with other maceral types, the micro-FT-IR spectra of  barkinite  are characterized by very strong intensities of aliphatic <e>CH</e>(x) stretching vibrations at 3000-2800 cm(-1) and deformations at 1460-1450 cm(-1), less intense bands from aromatic CC ring stretching at 1610-1600 cm(-1) and aromatic CH out-of-plane deformations at 900-700 cm(-1). The aliphatic side-chains in the molecular structure of  barkinite  are longer and less branched. In addition, there also appear intense aliphatic ether COC and alcohol CO stretching bands at 1100-1000 cm(-1), notable aromatic CH stretching vibrations at 3050-3030 cm(-1), weak OH stretching bands of water in the 3600-3200 cm(-1) range, and rare acid CO group absorption at 1740-1700 cm(-1). Collectively the IR spectral characteristics indicate that  barkinite  is composed of great numbers of long chain aliphatics, a fewer of aromatics and rare of oxygenate components. The chemical structure of  barkinite  show that the high tar yields and the relatively high oil-producing potential of the Late Permian coals from South China are attributable to the high  barkinite  content in the Leping coals and the great numbers of long chain aliphatic substances contained in this maceral.",M1

METHODS: The dried blood samples were collected on filter paper. The levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, and the serum levels of TSH, triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) were detected by chemiluminescence. Infants with CH confirmed by neonatal screening were treated with levothyroxine (L-T(4)) initiated with 4-6 g/kg x d(-1 )for 2-3 years. Growth, development and intelligence status, scintigraphy or ultrasonography of thyroid, and bone age were investigated to evaluate the efficacy of therapy during follow-ups. RESULT: A total of 1112784 neonates were screened for CH during 1999-2004 with a coverage rate of 63.5%. Of the 6750 suspected CH cases, 6335 (93.8%) were recalled. 764 cases of CH were confirmed with an average incidence rate of 1 case CH per 1457 newborns (1/1457). 244 of 764 patients were followed-up for more than 1.5-2 years. All of them received thyroid by scintigraphy or ultrasonography. Among them 189 cases were found with normal gland, 35 with hypogenetic gland, 11 with ectopic gland, and the remaining 9 didn't show any image of thyroid. The average score of development quotient (DQ) was 106. 9. Among them, the DQ score was less than 85 in 2 cases, less than 90 in 9 cases, less than 100 in 28 cases, and in 68 cases the DQ was greater than 100. The bone age of 122 CH infants was evaluated with the X-ray radiography. In 90 cases of them,the bone age was normal, and 32 cases had progressed from development delay to normal. The height and weigh measured in all 106 cases had reached the related age criteria. The evaluation indicated that 55 cases were found with primary CH, 169 with temporary CH and 20 with subclinical CH. CONCLUSION: Neonatal screening for CH and regular treatment for CH patients are important for attaining normal body development and intelligence development of patients.",M1

METHODS: Serum samples from 190 HBV DNA positive patients with chronic HBV infection,including 52 asymptomatic HBV carriers (ASC), 56 chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>), 32 fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), 22 liver cirrhosis (LC), and 28 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were collected and tested for HBV genotypes by type-specific primers. RESULTS: A simple and precise genotyping system based on PCR using type-specific primers was developed for the determination of genotypes of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Of the 190 patients, 140 (73.7%) were genotype B and 42 (22.1%) were genotype C. Genotype B was more prevalent in the FHF and HCC patients than in the ASC patients; the ALT value was significantly higher in genotype B than in genotype C patients. The rate of anti-HBe was significantly higher in genotype B than in genotype C except in the patients of the ASC group. CONCLUSION: The system we used seems to be a useful tool for the molecular diagnosis of HBV infection and for large-scale surveys. Genotype B, genotype C and BC combination exist in Hubei province, and genotype B is the major genotype in this area especially in FHF and HCC patients.",M1

METHODS: The first step is mensurating the concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with the method of time-distinguished fluorometry immunoassay. If the result is positive, then it is necessary to mensurate the serum TSH, free triiodothyronine (FT3),free thyroxin (FT4) with chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and execute clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 68 confirmed congenital hypothyroidism patients among the 106,224 samples from Apr.1997 to Dec.2003 in Hunan province. The positive rate was 1/1,562, which was obviously higher than the national average value (1/3,009). CONCLUSION: First, neonatal screening is the key to prevent mental retardation through early diagnosing and treating CH. Second, the probability of suffering CH is high in Hunan province. Third, the positive rate is relative to the development of science and technology, while the accumulated rate is better to reflect the real incidence of the disease. Fourth, selecting proper critical value will help to prevent missing screening.",M1

PKU was screened by bacterial inhibition assay and fluorometric method, and CH was screened by TSH measurement by time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA), fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RESULTS: From 1985 to 2001 in China, totally of 5 817 280 newborns were screened for PKU, 522 cases of PKU detected with an incidence of 1:11 144, and 5 524 019 newborns were screened for CH, 1 836 cases of CH detected with an incidence of 1:3 009. Annual average number of newborns screened for congenital genetic diseases was increased by 45.5% in recent six years. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening was developed quickly in China in recent years, especially in some developed cities, such as Shanghai with a coverage of 98.3% in 2001. But, its coverage was about only 10% in China as a whole. In development of neonatal screening, it is necessary to attach more importance to quality of screening and increasing coverage of screening, as well as gradual development of new screening techniques for other neonatal preventable diseases, in addition to PKU and CH, and their application, and improvement of level of child health care in China.",M1
12931029,"TT virus infection does not affect the clinical profiles of patients with hepatitis B and C in Yanbian City, China.China is an area of high endemicity for viral hepatitis, and the molecular epidemiological investigation of TT virus (TTV) infection is of interest. In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology, clinical significance and molecular characteristics of TTV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in Yanbian City, China. Serum samples obtained from 74 patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C who visited Yanbian Hospital, located in northeast China, were analyzed in this study. The study group included 22 cases of chronic hepatitis B (B-<e>CH</e>), 17 cases of liver cirrhosis B (B-LC), 7 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (B-HCC), 16 cases of chronic hepatitis C (C-CH), 11 cases of liver cirrhosis C (C-LC) and 1 case of hepatocellular carcinoma (C-HCC). Detection of TTV DNA was performed as described by Nishizawa et al. The second-round PCR products from 7 subjects were sequenced, followed by investigation of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis. TTV DNA was present in 18.2, 5.9, 28.6, 6.3, 9.1 and 0% of the patients with B-CH, B-LC, B-HCC, C-CH, C-LC and C-HCC, respectively. The highest prevalence of TTV infection was seen in the groups aged 40-50 and over 60 years. There was no significant correlation between the presence of TTV DNA and the clinical parameters in patients with hepatitis B and C. The various isolates showed 97.9-100% with isolates reported previously from Japan and 98.4-100% with isolates reported previously from China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the Yanbian isolates could be classified in the same group as the Japan and China isolates. We concluded that chronic coinfection with TTV did not affect the serological features of chronic hepatitis B and C in China, as found in Tokyo, Japan.",M1
12776921,"Bullera anomala sp. nov. and Bullera pseudovariabilis sp. nov., two new ballistoconidium-forming yeast species from Yunnan, China.Two ballistoconidium-forming yeast strains, <e>CH</e> 2.504 and CH 2.509, were isolated from the wilting leaves of Parthenocissus sp. collected in Yunnan, China in 1996. These two strains were assigned to the genus Bullera Derx by the characteristics of forming rotationally symmetric ballistoconidia, containing xylose in the cell hydrolysates and having Q-10 as the major ubiquinone. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S rDNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences revealed that CH 2.504 is closely related to B. variabilis Nakase &amp; Suzuki, while CH 2.509 is located in a clearly separate clade among the described Bullera species and related taxa. The results indicated that CH 2.509 represents a new species, for which Bullera anomala sp. nov. is the proposed name (type strain AS 2.2094T). Further DNA-DNA reassociation data showed that CH 2.504 also represents a distinct species, for which the name Bullera pseudovariabilis sp. nov. is given (type strain AS 2.2092T).",M1

Skinner and the ballistoconidium-forming species Bullera sinensis Li by molecular phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA sequencing. This strain was demonstrated to represent a distinct undescribed yeast species by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequence and G+C content comparison and DNA-DNA relatedness, for which the name Bullera kunmingensis sp. nov. is proposed. Meanwhile, the taxonomic relationships among Bullera sinensis and its synonyms B. derxii Nakase &amp; Suzuki and B. alba (Hanna) Derx var. lactis Li, were clarified on the basis of molecular phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA reassociation. B. derxii was confirmed to be conspecific with B. sinensis, while B. alba var. lactis was shown to represent a variety of B. sinensis. A new combination, Bullera sinensis Li var. lactis (Li) Bai, Takashima et Nakase, is therefore proposed. Comparative analysis of different types of molecular criteria employed in the present study suggested that when inferring phylogenetic relationships among sibling taxa, sequence data from ITS regions should be interpreted with caution.",M1
12591249,"Key factors affecting spatial variation of methane emissions from freshwater marshes.To understand the mechanism for spatial variation of <e>CH</e>(4) emissions from marshes grown with different type of plants in a region and plots within a certain marsh grown with one type of plants, we measured CH(4) emissions from a region in which eutrophic freshwater marshes were divided into three types: Carex lasiocarpa, Carex meyeruana and Deyeuxia angustifolia according to plant type as well as CH(4) concentration in porewater, aboveground plant biomass and stem density in situ in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China in August 2001. Spatial variation of CH(4) emissions from both different marshes in a region and different plots within a certain marsh was high. The flux rates of CH(4) emissions from three marshes ranged from 17.2 to 66.5 mg CH(4) m(-2)h(-1) with 34.76% of variation coefficient, whereas the values in Carex lasiocarpa, Carex meyeriana and Deyeuxia angustifolia marshes varied from 21.6 to 66.5 (39.61%), from 17.2 to 45.0 (29.26%) and from 19.1 to 33.0 mg CH(4) m(-2)h(-1) (17.51%), respectively. Both the flux rates and spatial variation of CH(4) emissions strongly increased as standing water depth increased significantly. Standing water depth greatly governed the spatial variation of CH(4) emissions from different marshes in a region by changing the amount of plant litters inundated in standing water, which provided labile organic C for methanogens and controlled CH(4) concentrations in porewater. Moreover, the aboveground plant biomass determined spatial variation of CH(4) emissions from plots within a certain marsh by controlling the pathways (stem density) of CH(4) emissions from the marsh into the atmosphere.",M1

12526349,"[Detection of GBV-C/HGV infection in patients with liver diseases]The aim of this article is to study the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV in patients with liver diseases and the clinical features in patients with (GBV-C/HGV infection. The serum samples were obtained from 169 patients with liver diseases in You An Hospital). Serum GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) using two primer pairs of 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of HGV. Serum anti-HGV was detected by ELISA simultaneously. The partial GBV-C/HGV genome isolated from one patient was cloned into T vectors and sequenced by dideoxy-mediated chain termination methods. Among 169 patients with various liver diseases, the GBV-C/HGV RNA positive rate was 9.5% (16/169), including 11.1% (1/9) of AHA, 4.1% (3/73) of CHB, 16.2% (6/37) of CHC, 13.3% (2/15) of AH(nonA-E) 12.5% (1/8) of <e>CH</e>(nonA-E) 15.4% (2/13) of LC and 33.3% (1/3) of SH cases. Of 29 patients having a history of surgical operation and transfusion, 9(31.0%) was positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA, which was remarkably higher than those cases without surgical operation and transfusion. The sequence analysis showed that there was 89.14%-98.91% nucleotide identity between our isolate and published GBV-C/HGV isolates. The results also suggested that infection rate of GBV-C/HGV was around 9.5% in patients from Beijing region, patients with GBV-C/HGV infection might show various clinical features and GBV-C/HGV might not be the major cause of hepatitis nonA-E.",M1
12508902,"Reclassification of the Sporobolomyces roseus and Sporidiobolus pararoseus complexes, with the description of Sporobolomyces phaffii sp. nov.More than 50 ballistoconidium-forming yeast strains, isolated from plant leaves collected in Yunnan, China, were identified as Sporobolomyces roseus Kluyver &amp; van Niel by conventional methods. However, comparison of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 265 rDNA D1/D2 domain sequences indicated that these strains represented more than one species. Type or authentic strains of the synonyms of Sporobolomyces roseus and the closely related species Sporidiobolus pararoseus Fell &amp; Tallman were employed in the rDNA sequence comparison. Sporobolomyces boleticola Ramírez, Sporobolomyces pollaccii Verona &amp; Ciferri, Sporobolomyces roseus var. madurae Janke and Torulopsis somala Verona were confirmed to be conspecific with Sporobolomyces roseus. Another synonym of this species, Sporobolomyces salmoneus Derx, was located together with Sporobolomyces marcillae Santa Maria in a separate clade. Two synonyms of Sporidiobolus pararoseus, Sporobolomyces carnicolor Yamasaki &amp; Fujii (nom. inval.) and Sporobolomyces japonicus Iizuka &amp; Goto, were revealed to represent two distinct species. The name Sporobolomyces carnicolor is validated, with strain CBS 4215(T) as the type strain. A novel species represented by five of the selected Yunnan strains was confirmed, for which the name Sporobolomyces phaffii sp. nov. is proposed (type strain <e>CH</e> 2.052(T) = AS 2.2137(T) = JCM 11491(T) = CBS 9129(T)).

The experimental conditions were optimized. A microwave power of 60% and an extraction time of 25 min were adopted. Comparison of microwave extraction and conventional extraction methods revealed that results obtained by microwave techniques were generally in a good agreement with those obtained by use of extraction methods; use of the former resulted in substantial time saving and a better precision, however. Microwave extraction was used to evaluate the bioavailability of heavy metals in soils. Single correlation analysis was performed to establish the relationship between the concentrations of the extractable heavy metals in wet rhizosphere soils and their concentrations in wheat ( Troticum aestivum L.) grown on the soils under greenhouse conditions. The correlation coefficients between the extractable metals in soils and their concentrations in wheat roots were found to be 0.5398-0.7819, 0.6425-0.8073, 0.5568-0.8276, 0.5851-0.6087 for the extractants CaCl(2), EDTA, CH(3)COOH, and HCl, respectively.",M1

CD4+, CD8+ T cells, plasma viral loads, depletion of intestinal lymphocytes with memory phenotype, humoral immune responses and clinical courses were monitored for 600 days. The pathogenesis of SIVmac was also compared with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of humans. Plasma viral loads in Ch Rh were lower in the acute and chronic phases compared with Ind Rh. SIVmac pathogenesis in Ch Rh was closer to virus loads in untreated HIV infected humans. Ch Rh had higher CD4/CD8 ratios, stronger antibody responses and interestingly, less depletion of intestinal memory CCR5+ CD4+ T lymphocytes compared with Ind Rh. One Ch Rh developed B cell origin lymphoma at 570 days post-infection, the first such report in this subspecies. Three of four Ind Rh developed AIDS within 6 months. The findings indicate that Ch Rh are more resistant to SIVmac pathogenesis compared with Ind Rh and that Ch Rh paralleled HIV-1 infections in untreated adult humans. The SIVmac infected Ch Rh subspecies are an acceptable model for HIV/AIDS.",M1
12131186,"SIV(mac) pathogenesis in rhesus macaques of Chinese and Indian origin compared with primary HIV infections in humans.OBJECTIVE: To develop a SIV-rhesus macaque (Rh) model of AIDS that more closely approximates HIV pathogenesis in humans. DESIGN: The pathogenesis of SIV was compared in two different types of Rh, the Chinese (<e>Ch</e>) and Indian (Ind) subspecies. METHODS: Ch Rh and Ind Rh origin were identified genetically and infected with the SIV(mac)239 molecular clone. Plasma viral loads, depletion of intestinal lymphocytes with memory phenotype, humoral immune responses and CD4/CD8 cell ratios were compared during acute and steady-state periods of infection. RESULTS: Plasma viral loads from 7 days after infection through 240 days were significantly lower in Rh of Ch origin compared with Ind Rh. Viral loads in Ch Rh were closer to viral loads observed in untreated humans infected with HIV-1. Depletion of intestinal effector cells was less evident in SIV-infected Ch Rh compared with Ind Rh. An index of intestinal pathogenesis was devised that closely paralleled viral load and severity of infection. There were no rapid progressors to AIDS among 10 Ch Rh. In contrast, three of four Ind Rh progressed rapidly to AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Ind Rh, SIV(mac) pathogenesis in Ch Rh was closer to HIV-1 infections in untreated adult humans. The differences were statistically significant. The Ch Rh subspecies is a suitable AIDS model and may have advantages over the rapid and highly pathogenic Ind Rh model. Moreover, Ind Rh supplies are limited and use of Ch Rh provides a new resource.",M1

METHODS: A representative sample of 8,182 adults aged over 20 to 75 years old were randomly selected in the residents of Shenzhen, China in 1997. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to the WHO criteria. Questionnaire survey, anthropometric measurement and blood analysis were carried out, and logistic regression analysis was used to study the risk factors. RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in subjects with high total cholesterol were 4.9 times of those with lower TC value. Subjects with high triglyceride had a prevalence 5.7 times of those who had lower TG. Those HDL-<e>ch</e> had a prevalence 68.7% higher than those with normal HDL-ch value; on the other hand, those HDL-ch &gt; 1.91 mmol/L were 44.6% lower in the prevalence than those with normal HDL-ch. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in subjects with BMI &gt;or= 25 were 2.6 times of those with BMI &lt; 25. Subject with hypertension (&gt;or= 140/90 mm Hg) had a prevalence 3.8 times of those with normal blood pressure. Subjects with family history of type II diabetes had a prevalence 2.0 times of no family history, and women who had delivered babies over 4 kg had a prevalence 1.9 times of those who had babies less than 4 kg. Subjects with waist/hip ratio (WHR) &gt;or= 1.0 had a prevalence 5.1 times of those with WHR &lt; 1.0. The prevalence of type 2 Diabetes was higher with increasing amount of cigarette smoking and the duration (in years) of smoking or increasing drinking (alcohol) and the duration (in years) of drinking. CONCLUSIONS: The blood glucose level was found to be positively correlated with TC or TG, and negatively correlated with HDL-ch. This study demonstrated again that TC, TG, HDL-ch, obesity, hypertension, family history of type 2 diabetes and in women, delivery of babies over 4 kg and age were risk factors of type 2 diabetes.",M1

METHODS: Chose rural Miyun County in Beijing as a sample, according to the need-based and demand-weighted forecasting method, a protocol WHO-<e>CH</e> model and corresponding JWG-6-M package developed by authors were used to calculate the present and future need and demand of dental-manpower in Miyun County. Further predications were also calculated on the effects of four modeling parameters to the demand of dental manpower. RESULTS: The present need and demand of oral care personnel for Miyun were 114.5 and 29.1 respectively. At present, Miyun has 43 oral care providers who can satisfy the demand but not the need. The change of oral health demand had a major effect on the forecast of the manpower. CONCLUSION: Dental-manpower planning should consider the need as a prime factor but must be modified by the demand. It was suggested that corresponding factors of oral care personnel need to be discussed further.",M1
11574565,"Characterization of newly emerging Newcastle disease virus isolates from the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.Seven Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) isolates which were recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken and pigeon flocks in China and Taiwan between 1996 and 2000 were genotypically and pathotypically characterized. By phylogenetic analysis of the fusion protein genes, isolates <e>Ch</e>-A7/96, Ch/98-3, Ch/99, Ch/2000, and TW/2000 were placed into two novel subgenotypes, VIIc and VIId. Isolate Ch/98-1 was grouped into subgenotype VIb, while Ch-W6/96 was proven to be a mixture of isolates Ch-A7/96 and Ch/98-1. These isolates were pathotyped as viscerotropic velogenic for Ch/98-3, Ch/99, Ch/2000, and TW/2000; neurotropic velogenic for Ch-A7/96; and mesogenic for Ch/98-1. Three separate, comparative, genetic analyses of the F genes, including genetic distance measurement, phylogenetic tree analysis, and residue substitution analysis, were performed with our isolates and selected NDV strains from GenBank. Results showed that the close genetic similarity provided evidence for the epidemiological linkage between the outbreaks in China and Taiwan and that the 1990s outbreaks in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe constituted the fourth panzootic of ND. In combination with epidemiological analysis, an evolutionary model of the NDV strains, representative of the direction of transmission within the NDV strains, was proposed, and epidemiology of NDV transmission was evaluated with emphasis on molecular aspects. Finally, a cross-protective experiment indicated that at least one strain (Ch-A7/96) among our NDV isolates was an antigenic variant, responsible for recent outbreaks of ND in vaccinated chicken flocks.",M1
11223719,"Hepatitis B virus genotype distribution among chronic hepatitis B virus carriers in Shanghai, China.OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype distribution is still unclear in China, where a high prevalence of HBV infection exists, although it is well known that HBV can be classified into six genotypes based on intergroup divergence. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological distribution of HBV genotypes and to clarify further the genotype-related differences in the pathogenicity of HBV. METHODS: Seminested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were conducted in 97 asymptomatic HBV carriers (ASC) and 46 chronic hepatitis (<e>CH</e>), 37 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 44 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in Shanghai, China. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty samples (98.2%) were positive for HBV DNA, and of these, 3 (1.4%), 38 (17.2%) and 179 (81.4%) were classified as genotype A, B and C, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of genotypes B and C among various categories of liver diseases (p &lt; 0.01). The distribution of genotype C showed an increasing trend from ASC, CH and LC to the HCC group; in contrast, the distribution of genotype B showed a decreasing trend in the same order. HBeAg positivity was higher in genotype C than in genotype B in all the subjects or in the ASC group alone (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). More severe liver damage and a higher mean age were observed in genotype C than in genotype B (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the following: (1) genotypes A, B and C of HBV exist in Shanghai, China; (2) genotype C is the major genotype in this area; (3) genotype C is associated with the development of severe liver diseases, and (4) genotype B has a relatively good prognosis.",M1
10929044,"Prevalence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and its association with arterial and venous thrombosis in the Chinese population.Moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia (MHH) is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. A main genetic defect related to MHH is a C to T substitution at nucleotide 677 of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. A prothrombin 20210A mutation was recently identified as a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. However, studies on the prevalence of mutant MTHFR C677T and prothrombin G20210A and their association with thrombosis were controversial and seldom reported in the Chinese population. We investigated the prevalence of MTHFR C677T and prothrombin G20210A genotypes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion in 420 Chinese subjects: 53 with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); 145 with cerebrovascular disease [115 cerebral infarction, 30 cerebral haemorrhage (<e>CH</e>)]; 100 with coronary artery disease (CAD); and 122 control subjects. The prevalence of the mutated MTHFR 677TT genotype and the 677T allele in normal controls was 12.3% and 30.7% respectively, similar to that in Caucasians and Japanese. The mutant 677T homozygotes and alleles were more frequent in patients with DVT than in controls (18.9% vs. 12.3%, 0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0. 025; 48.1% vs. 30.7%, P &lt; 0.005). The relative risk of DVT among the carriers of 677TT and 677T were significantly increased [odds ratios: 3.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.5, and 3.6, 95% CI 1. 7-7.7, respectively). The mutant MTHFR heterozygous 677C/T carriers were increased in patients with cerebral infarction compared with controls (53.9% vs. 36.9%, 0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.025). Relative risk of cerebral infarction was 0.96 (95% CI 0.4-2.3) for 677TT homozygotes and 1.99 (95% CI 1.2-3.4) for 677C/T heterozygotes. However, the distribution of the MTHFR TT genotype was less frequent in patients with CAD with coronary artery stenosis of &gt; 50% than in controls (2. 8% vs. 12.3%, 0.025 &lt; P &lt; 0.05). Relative risk of CAD was not increased among the carriers of 677TT and 677T (odds ratios: 0.2, 95% CI 0-1.1, and 0.97, 95% CI 0.5-1.8, respectively). There were no differences in the distribution of the MTHFR genotypes among CH, CAD with coronary artery stenosis of &lt; 50% and controls. The prothrombin 20210A mutation was not found in any patients or controls. These results demonstrated that MTHFR 677T was associated with DVT and cerebral infarction but was less associated with CAD in the Chinese population.",M1
10898672,"beta-lactamases in Shigella flexneri isolates from Hong Kong and Shanghai and a novel OXA-1-like beta-lactamase, OXA-30.Ninety-one ampicillin-resistant Shigella flexneri strains from Hong Kong and Shanghai were studied for production of beta-lactamases. TEM-1-like and OXA-1-like enzymes were identified in 21 and 79% of the strains, respectively, by isoelectric focusing (IEF). No difference in the pattern of beta-lactamase production was found between strains from Hong Kong and Shanghai. Four ribotypes were detected. Over 88% of OXA-producing strains had the same ribotype. All TEM-1-like strains harbored a plasmid which hybridized positively with the bla(TEM) probe. Total DNA from OXA-1-like strains failed to hybridize or only hybridized weakly with an OXA probe. The OXA resistance was not transferable. OXA-1-like enzymes exhibited substrate and inhibition profiles similar to that of OXA-1 and were shown to have a pI of 7.3 by further IEF using a narrow-range ampholine gel. The gene encoding the OXA-1-like enzyme from one isolate (<e>CH</e>-07) was cloned, sequenced, and found to differ from bla(OXA-1) at codon 131 (AGA--&gt;GGA; Arg to Gly), resulting in the novel designation OXA-30. The predominance of OXA-type enzymes in ampicillin-resistant S. flexneri suggests host preference for specific beta-lactamases.",M1

10738232,"Measuring quality of life of Chinese cancer patients: A validation of the Chinese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale.BACKGROUND: Few cancer specific quality-of-life (QoL) measures from the West have been translated for use with Chinese-speaking patients, and no substantial validation of these translations with adequately large cohorts has been published previously, to the authors' knowledge. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a well-validated QoL instrument that is specific to cancer patients. The scale was translated into Chinese and the psychometric properties of this translated scale (FACT-G [<e>Ch</e>]) were tested with a Chinese sample in Hong Kong, China. METHODS: A total of 1262 Chinese cancer patients were selected in 3 samples from 5 Hong Kong regional hospitals. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to assess the cultural equivalence, factor structure, reliability, and validity of the FACT-G (Ch). RESULTS: Focus group discussions indicated that the FACT-G was seen as covering QoL domains identified as important and relevant to Chinese cancer patients, though in some respects it was seen as having limited scope in this sample. Psychometrically, the factor structure of the FACT-G deviated from that of the original work. The FACT-G (Ch) had acceptable reliability (Cronbach alpha 0.85). The convergent validity of the FACT-G (Ch) with a generic QoL measure (WHOQOL-BREF[HK]) was 0.72 (P &lt; 0.001), and divergent validity showed low correlations of less than 0.15 (P &lt; 0.05) with non-QoL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Focus group data indicated that the FACT-G translation into Chinese was seen as a conceptually relevant and moderately sufficient QoL measure. Psychometrically, the instrument had acceptable properties, but conceptual differences from the original version were suggested. Although more work is needed to increase its adequacy, the translated scale has reasonable utility for use with Chinese populations in clinical settings.",M1
11114674,"Measuring diet quality in china: the INFH-UNC-<e>CH</e> diet quality index.OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development and efficacy of a diet quality index (DQI) for China. DESIGN: The Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents motivated the selection of 10 DQI components. These components were weighted and assigned cut-offs and point schemes based on the Chinese Food Guide Pagoda, Chinese and/or international dietary reference values. The efficacy of resulting DQI scores was assessed relative to a priori expectations. SUBJECTS: The Chinese DQI was evaluated using cross-sectional 3 day diet record and anthropometric data on 7450 adults from the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey. METHODS: For each individual, a DQI total score was calculated as the sum of components, and DQI pattern scores calculated to reflect the underlying composition of diet quality problems. The DQI scores were compared with component scores, food and nutrient intake, weight status and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: The total DQI score simultaneously represented all component aspects of diet quality as well as micronutrients not explicitly built into the index. The total DQI score was significantly correlated with food and nutrient intakes, BMI, urban residence and income. The DQI pattern scores correlated with DQI components and weight status as expected. CONCLUSIONS: The China DQI captures variation along several components of diet quality, appears sensitive to under- and overnutrition, as well as sociodemographic variables.

9526691,"Classifying ethnicity utilizing the Canadian Mortality Data Base.The study of ethnic differences in disease is a methodological challenge as ethnicity is often not identified in existing datasets and surrogate measures need to be used. We have developed a novel methodology combining last name and country of birth to study mortality patterns of Canadians of South Asian (SA) and Chinese (<e>CH</e>) ethnic origin and have compared death rates among SA, CH, and White (WH) Canadians. METHODS: SA and CH were identified in the Canadian Mortality Data Base (CMDB) using the last name and country of birth of the deceased. Records of people who had been born in countries with large South Asian and Chinese populations (e.g. India, Pakistan, China, Hong Kong) were selected and manually screened by last name. A name directory was then created of distinct South Asian and Chinese names and this directory was used to search all other records in the CMDB for SA and CH deaths. Where necessary, other identifying characteristics such as first name and parents' last name were also used. Population counts were obtained from the Census self-reported question on ethnicity for SA and CH. WH were identified as non-immigrant Canadians who were neither SA nor CH. The method of assigning ethnicity in the CMDB and Census were assessed for comparability and issues of validity and reliability were addressed. RESULTS: Using this method, 10,989 SA and 21,548 CH deaths were identified. There was marked heterogeneity in birthplace, with only 56% of SA born in South Asia and only 74% of CH born in Greater China. Last names had high validity for self-reported ethnicity in a population sample of SA and were highly reproducible. Mortality rates varied dramatically between groups studied. SA and WH had high rates of ischemic heart disease while stroke mortality was similar among all three groups. Cancer death rates were high in CH and WH and much lower in SA. CONCLUSION: Last names and country of birth can be used to determined ethnicity of SA and CH with validity and reliability, and leads to a more accurate classification than country of birth alone. The contrasting patterns observed in mortality from major causes of death suggest many interesting hypotheses for further study.",M1

The nucleotide homology of these three HEV isolates was 80.2%, 79.9% and 79.4%, respectively, as compared with the Maxico strain of HEV (M); 93.4%, 92.3% and 93.8% with the Burma epidemic strain of HEV(B) (Ep); 95.5%, 93.9% and 95.1% with the Burma sporadic strain of HEV(B) (Sp); 97.0%, 96.5% and 95.9% with the Xinjiang epidemic strain of HEV <e>CH</e> 1.1. It is demonstrated that these three isolates of HEV obtained from sera of acute sporadiic hepatitis E cases have a higher degree of homology with the Xinjiang strain of HEV CH 1.1 and the Burma strain of HEV(B). The data indicate that these three HEV isolates may belong to HEV(B) subtype, as the HEV CH 1.1 does.",M1
9178500,"Evidence for the assignment of two strains of SPLV to the genus Potyvirus based on coat protein and 3' non-coding region sequence data.The use of potyvirus-specific primers and subsequent application of the RACE procedure allowed the cloning of the 3' terminal 1088 nucleotides of the genomic RNA of the Taiwan isolate of sweetpotato latent virus (SPLV-T) and the 3' genomic 1085 nucleotides of a SPLV-like virus from China (SPLV-<e>CH</e>). The sequence of an internal part of the presumptive nuclear inclusion b gene was also determined for both isolates. Detailed sequence analyses revealed the presence of consensus motifs which indicated that SPLV-CH and SPLV-T should be regarded as members of the genus Potyvirus. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were also performed and unambiguously assessed these isolates as strains of a distinct Potyvirus. SPLV was not related to other potyviruses infecting sweetpotato nor to any other sequenced virus. From the presence of the DAG box, SPLV-CH is expected to be a typical aphid transmitted Potyvirus whereas a conceivable explanation is proposed for the non-aphid transmission of SPLV-T.",M1

The results showed that HAV infection could not develop chronic hepatitis. Among 238 patients of CH, LC, and HCC, anti-HAV IgM was not detected. HBV infection was the main pathogenic factor of CH, LC, and HCC with an infection rates of 77.78%, 84.21%, and 94.29%, respectively, the average rate of infection was 3.8 times higher than that in AH. HCV infection rate was increased gradually with development of chronic liver syndrome. Anti-HCV positive rate was 5.56% in CH, but 14.74% and 20.00% in LC and HCC respectively. HEV infection was found in patients with all types of liver disease with an average positive rate of 13.19%. It was not found that single HEV infection developed in CH, LC, and HCC. The average rate of super infection was 17.18% among all the patients, but the super infection rate in LC and HCC was 1.93 times higher than that in AH and CH.

Five species have been identified as sources of arrow poison: A. carmichaelii, A. nagarum, A. ouvrardianum, A. stylosum, and A. episcopale. The most important one, A. carmichaelii, has long served, together with A. kusnezoffii, as the main source of the Chinese medicinal aconite drugs--ts'ao wu (wu t'ou), the parent tuber, and fu tzu (<e>ch</e> 'uan wu), the daughter tuber.

6953615,"HLA-linked genetic markers in Chinese and other Oriental populations.The polymorphic variants of the HLA-linked genetic markers Bf, C2, C4 and GLO-I were studied in three mongoloid populations. Analysis of linkage dis-equilibrium between these markers and HLA-A, B, C and DR antigens was carried out on test results from 140 unrelated Chinese individuals. The phenotypes BfS and GLO-2 were found at significantly higher frequencies than in Caucasians. BfS was associated with B12 in Japanese but not in Chinese. A single individual with the rare Bf variant S1 was found. No C2 deficient individuals were observed. The C2C (common) allele occurred at a gene frequency of 0.949 and the more basic allele C2B at 0.039. The acidic variant, C2A, was observed at a frequency of 0.011 and appeared to be associated with BfF. Eighty-nine per cent of the Chinese were phenotypically C4FS. In contrast to Bf and C2, each of which is coded for by codominant alleles at a single genetic locus, C4 is coded for by two genes, C4F (Rodgers) and C4S (Chido). The C4F locus allele, C4F1 (extra fast), was strongly associated with HLA-B17, as has been found in other populations, but a new association of the C4S locus deficiency allele, C4so (<e>Ch</e>-), with B17 was also observed. All HLA-B17;C4so haplotypes were BfS position. As has been previously found in Caucasian populations, individuals of the C4F phenotype (i.e. genotypically FsoFso) were all found to be Chido negative. The frequencies of the various HLA-linked genetic markers, however, as much as the frequencies and associations of the HLA antigens themselves, distinguish these populations from other ethnic groups.",M1

Our objective was to establish a complementary health promotion campaign tool for skin cancer prevention. Internet-based education, instruction for self assessment and teledermatological evaluation of skin lesions by an expert commission of dermatologists was used. Compliance and clinical diagnosis was assessed in a subgroup. 12,000 users visited the educational website. There was strong interest among the middle aged male population (53% (N = 262): male; mean age: 42). 28.5% of examined lesions (N = 494) were considered suspicious. Email requests, sent to the group whose lesions where considered suspicious, were answered by 46.0% of females (N = 29) and 59.7% of males (N = 46) with a female distribution predominantly in younger ages (52.6% of females with known age: &lt; 30 years). Males were predominantly represented over 30 years (86.2% of all males). According to user's declarations, at least 8 (8.5%) malignant lesions (1 melanoma in situ, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 4 basal cell carcinomas, 2 malignant lesions without declared diagnosis) were finally diagnosed by physicians. We conclude that internet-based, interactive, educational programs, in addition to existing health promotion campaigns, can enhance public participation in the middle aged male population in skin cancer prevention.",M2

A qualitative study.In the German-speaking countries: Austria, Germany and Switzerland, which have a joint annual conference in psychiatric nursing, the process of academization of nursing has led to a discussion about which adaptations to make in psychiatric nursing in order to develop a profile, which is practicable in the future. Therefore, it was necessary to describe the current duties and activities of psychiatric nurses. With this, the knowledge and abilities of the nurses were to be made more explicit and their identity was to be strengthened. Data were generated by using participant observation and group discussions with the involved nurses to validate the observations and the emerging categories of activities. Participant observation took place in a psychiatric clinic in Switzerland over a period of 11 months on 14 psychiatric wards with different specializations. Data analysis followed a qualitative content analysis. Findings show that by means of descriptions of nursing situations the duties and activities of the nurses can be summarized into 12 categories. Many of the described activities can be found in psychiatric nursing textbooks. This concurrence suggests that there is something like a basic framework of psychiatric nursing. In addition, the findings illustrate how wide the variety of tasks are and how challenging psychiatric nursing is.",M2
19410489,"Congenital hydrocephalus--prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and outcome of pregnancy in four European regions.OBJECTIVE: To describe prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and outcome for fetuses and infants with congenital hydrocephalus. METHODS: Data were taken from four European registries of congenital malformations (EUROCAT). The registries included are based on multiple sources of information and include information about livebirths, fetal deaths with GA &gt; or = 20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). All cases from the four registries diagnosed with congenital hydrocephalus and born in the period 1996-2003 were included in the study. Cases with hydrocephalus associated with neural tube defects were not included in the study. RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases with congenital hydrocephalus were identified during the study period giving an overall prevalence of 4.65 per 10,000 births. There were 41 livebirths (47%), four fetal deaths (5%) and 42 TOPFA (48%). Nine percent of all cases were from a multiple pregnancy. Additional non-cerebral major malformations were diagnosed in 38 cases (44%) and karyotype anomalies in eight cases (9%). Median GA at TOPFA was 21 weeks. Among livebirths 61% were diagnosed prenatally at a median GA of 31 weeks (range 17-40 weeks) and median GA at birth was 37 weeks. Fourteen liveborn infants (34%) died within the first year of life with the majority of deaths during the first week after birth. CONCLUSION: Congenital hydrocephalus is a severe congenital malformation often associated with other congenital anomalies. <e>CH</e> is often diagnosed prenatally, although sometimes late in pregnancy.

19099610,"Comparative assessment of passive surveillance in disease-free and endemic situation: example of Brucella melitensis surveillance in Switzerland and in Bosnia and Herzegovina.BACKGROUND: Globalization and subsequent growth in international trade in animals and animal products has increased the importance of international disease reporting. Efficient and reliable surveillance systems are needed in order to document the disease status of a population at a given time. In this context, passive surveillance plays an important role in early warning systems. However, it is not yet routinely integrated in the assessment of disease surveillance systems because different factors like the disease awareness (DA) of people reporting suspect cases influence the detection performance of passive surveillance. In this paper, we used scenario tree methodology in order to evaluate and compare the quality and benefit of abortion testing (ABT) for Brucella melitensis (Bm) between the disease free situation in Switzerland (<e>CH</e>) and a hypothetical disease free situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH), taking into account DA levels assumed for the current endemic situation in BH. RESULTS: The structure and input parameters of the scenario tree were identical for CH and BH with the exception of population data in small ruminants and the DA in farmers and veterinarians. The sensitivity analysis of the stochastic scenario tree model showed that the small ruminant population structure and the DA of farmers were important influential parameters with regard to the unit sensitivity of ABT in both CH and BH. The DA of both farmers and veterinarians was assumed to be higher in BH than in CH due to the current endemic situation in BH. Although the same DA cannot necessarily be assumed for the modelled hypothetical disease free situation as for the actual endemic situation, it shows the importance of the higher vigilance of people reporting suspect cases on the probability that an average unit processed in the ABT-component would test positive. CONCLUSION: The actual sensitivity of passive surveillance approaches heavily depends on the context in which they are applied. Scenario tree modelling allows for the evaluation of such passive surveillance system components under assumed disease free situation. Despite data gaps, this is a real opportunity to compare different situations and to explore consequences of changes that could be made.",M2

Following the recommendations of the Multinational Musculoskeletal Inception Cohort Study (MMICS) Statement, our study aims to define outcome assessment tools for patients with acute LBP and the time point at which chronic LBP becomes manifest and to identify patient characteristics which increase the risk of chronicity. METHODS: Patients with acute LBP will be recruited from clinics of general practitioners (GPs) in New Zealand (NZ) and Switzerland (<e>CH</e>). They will be assessed by postal survey at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome will be disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); key secondary endpoints will be general health as measured by the acute SF-12 and pain as measured on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A subgroup analysis of different assessment instruments and baseline characteristics will be performed using multiple linear regression models. This study aims to examine: 1. Which biomedical, psychological, social, and occupational outcome assessment tools are identifiers for the transition from acute to chronic LBP and at which time point this transition becomes manifest. 2. Which psychosocial and occupational baseline characteristics like work status and period of work absenteeism influence the course from acute to chronic LBP. 3. Differences in outcome assessment tools and baseline characteristics of patients in NZ compared with CH. DISCUSSION: This study will develop a screening tool for patients with acute LBP to be used in GP clinics to access the risk of developing chronic LBP. In addition, biomedical, psychological, social, and occupational patient characteristics which influence the course from acute to chronic LBP will be identified. Furthermore, an appropriate time point for follow-ups will be given to detect this transition. The generalizability of our findings will be enhanced by the international perspective of this study.

Sixty-three prospectively followed children with CH were assessed at age of 14 y with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and compared with 175 healthy controls. Median age at onset of treatment was 9 d (range 5-18 d) and median starting dose of levothyroxine (L-T4) was 14.7 microg/kg/d (range 9.9-23.6 microg/kg/d). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was significantly lower than in controls after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and gender (101.7 versus 111.4; p &lt; 0.0001). Children with athyreosis had a lower performance IQ than those with dysgenesis (adjusted difference 7.6 IQ scores, p &lt; 0.05). Lower initial thyroxine (T4) levels correlated with poorer IQ (r = 0.27, p = 0.04). Lower SES was associated with poorer IQ, in particular in children with CH (interaction, p = 0.03). Treatment during childhood was not related to IQ at age 14 y. Adolescents with CH manifest IQ deficits when compared with their peers despite early high-dose treatment and optimal substitution therapy throughout childhood. Those adolescents with athyreosis and lower SES are at particular risk for adverse outcome. Therefore, early detection of intellectual deficits is mandatory in children with CH.",M2

XWCH supports various high performance applications, including those having large storage and communication requirements. Two high performance applications were ported and deployed on an XWCH platform. The first one is the Phylip package of programs that is employed for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). It is the most widely distributed phylogeny package and has been used to build the largest number of published trees. Some modules of Phylip are CPU time consuming; their sequential version cannot be applied to a large number of sequences. The second application ported on XWCH is a medical application used to generate temporal dynamic neuronal maps. The application,named NeuroWeb,is used to better understand the connectivity and activity of neurons. NeuroWeb is a data and CPU intensive application.

Isotope analysis of a female skeleton on the 9th century A.D. from Elsau, Canton Zurich, Switzerland]At Elsau near Winterthur (<e>CH</e>), a 9th century AD grave with a female skeleton was found in 2003. This grave was reopened one to six years after burial. After manipulating the partially decayed skeleton, the grave was filled with a layer of rocks and a claw of a sea eagle as well as the paw of a fox was placed on top. At least from this time onwards, the grave was situated in the annex of a church. Because of this special burial site for the 42 year old woman, who suffered from different severe illnesses, it is thought that she belonged to the upper class. The postmortal changes at the grave are exceptional and even after thorough research, no equivalent burial procedures are known from this area. To investigate the possibility if the woman migrated to the region of Elsau, the oxygen and strontium isotope composition of several teeth and one long bone of her skeleton was analysed. The results indicate a certain but restricted mobility within the northern Alpine foreland and as a result changes of the isotope composition of the food and drinking water during her childhood. Immigration from regions in which similar burial customs to those used for the woman persisted into the 9th century AD can be largely excluded based on the isotope composition of her skeletal remains. The mobility in the pre-Alpine region supports the interpretation that the woman belonged to the upper class, whose properties where widely distributed.",M2

In all three countries, the R(0) values decreased below 1 after the introduction of a ban on feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) to ruminants around the 1990s. A variety of additional measures against BSE led to further decrease of R(0) to about 0.06 in the years around 1998. The calculated R(0) values were consistent with the observations made on the surveillance results for UK, but were partially conflicting with the surveillance results for NL and CH.

Imports of MBM and feed components can be an explanation for this discrepancy, and the importance of imports for these observations is discussed.",M2
17476048,"Porting PHYLIP phylogenetic package on the desktop GRID platform XtremWeb-<e>CH</e>.This paper describes the parallelization (gridification) of the phylogenetic package PHYLIP on a desktop GRID platform termed XtremWeb-CH. PHYLIP is a package of programs for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). It is the most widely-distributed phylogeny package. PHYLIP has been used to build the largest number of published trees. It's known that some modules of PHYLIP are CPU time consuming; their sequential version can not be applied to a large number of sequences. XtremWeb-CH (XWCH) is a software system that makes it easier for scientists and industrials to deploy and execute their parallel and distributed applications on a public-resource computing infrastructure. Universities, research centres and private companies can create their own XWCH platform while anonymous PC owners can participate to these platforms. They can specify how and when their resources could be used. The objective of XWCH is to develop a real High Performance Peer-To-Peer platform with a distributed scheduling and communication system. The main idea is to build a completely symmetric model where nodes can be providers and consumers at the same time. In this paper we describe the porting, deployment, and execution of some PHYLIP modules on the XWCH platform. The parallelized version of PHYLIP is used to generate evolutionary tree related to HIV viruses.",M2
17476043,"Grid-based analysis of tandem mass spectrometry data in clinical proteomics.Biomarker detection is one of the greatest challenges in Clinical Proteomics. Today, great hopes are placed into tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to discover potential biomarkers. MS/MS is a technique that allows large scale data analysis, including the identification, characterization, and quantification of molecules. Especially the identification process, that implies to compare experimental spectra with theoretical amino acid sequences stored in specialized databases, has been subject for extensive research in bioinformatics since many years. Dozens of identification programs have been developed addressing different aspects of the identification process but in general, clinicians are only using a single tools for their data analysis along with a single set of specific parameters. Hence, a significant proportion of the experimental spectra do not lead to a confident identification score due to inappropriate parameters or scoring schemes of the applied analysis software. The swissPIT (Swiss Protein Identification Toolbox) project was initiated to provide the scientific community with an expandable multi-tool platform for automated and in-depth analysis of mass spectrometry data. The swissPIT uses multiple identification tools to automatic analyze mass spectra. The tools are concatenated as analysis workflows. In order to realize these calculation-intensive workflows we are using the Swiss Bio Grid infrastructure. A first version of the web-based front-end is available (http://www.swisspit.cscs.<e>ch</e>) and can be freely accessed after requesting an account. The source code of the project will be also made available in near future.",M2
17172391,"Deaths caused by malaria in Switzerland 1988-2002.Despite sophisticated intensive medicine, between one and three malaria-associated deaths occur annually in Switzerland. In this retrospective study, 33 deaths (25 men and 8 women) caused by falciparum malaria reported in Switzerland from 1988 to 2002 were analyzed. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the falciparum infections for the 15-year period was 1.2%, with a peak of 2.2% in 1991. Sub-Saharan Africa was the source of all the imported fatal infections. Non-immune Europeans had a significantly higher case fatality ratio than the non-Europeans (1.7% versus 0.2%; P &lt; 0.001). Careless use or non-use of prophylaxis, sometimes because of physicians giving unsatisfactory pre-travel advice, and initially missed diagnosis post-travel were factors that contributed to the development of severe infections leading to death. Travelers should be sensitized to the risk of malaria by well-informed general practitioners. Updated information is readily available (www.safetravel.<e>ch</e>). Regarding diagnosis and treatment, greater physician awareness of the disease is needed, and expert advice should be sought without hesitation. Rapid malaria tests may be a useful diagnostic adjunct in centers where microscopic expertise is lacking. Falciparum malaria in a non-immune patient is an emergency requiring immediate treatment.",M2
16941406,"Aspirin in peripheral arterial disease: breakthrough or pitfall?BACKGROUND: This paper introduces a proof-of-concept trial in progress, supposedly providing new important information on anti-platelet drugs used in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The Arteriogenesis Competence Network (Art.Net.) of the Universities of Basel, Berlin, and Freiburg could show in animal models that Aspirin (ASA), in contrast to Clopidogrel, inhibits the formation of an appropriate collateral network (arteriogenesis). This trial is supposed to reproduce the animal data in man. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, bi-national (D, <e>CH</e>), multicentre trial, 250 patients will be randomised to either 100 mg ASA or 75 mg Clopidogrel once daily. Patients will then enter a three months structured rehabilitation programme with daily physical training supposed to induce arteriogenesis. The claudication distances will be tested as the primary endpoint at baseline, 6 weeks, and at 3 months. Also, the 24h physical activity profile of all patients will be electronically documented. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide information on potential disadvantages when using ASA in PAD patients. If data emerging from animal pharmacology can be reproduced in man, the present standard scheme of anti-aggregant treatment in PAD patients has to be reconsidered.",M2

16409716,"Ten years of Swiss National IVF Register FIVNAT-<e>CH</e>. Are we making progress?In 2001, analysis of Swiss data collected since 1993 included 1001 treatment cycles with IVF, 2217 treatment cycles with intracytoplasmic sperm injection and 2160 treatment cycles with frozen-thawed embryos or zygotes. IVF cycle number has remained constant over the past 10 years, now representing only 18% of the total. ICSI treatment cycles have plateaued since 2001. Altogether, patients receive 1.56 treatment cycles per year, nearly constant since 1995. Mean maternal age has increased from 33.9 to 35.7 years, while mean number of recovered oocytes has increased by 1.3. Considerable improvement was seen in clinical pregnancy rate after 'fresh' treatment cycles since 2000. Mean number of replaced embryos in 'fresh' treatment cycles has fallen to below 2.5 since 1996, long before the legal imposition of the three-embryo transfer limit in 2001, and is still decreasing without affecting the consistent twin pregnancy rate of 19%. The frequency of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome has increased three-fold. External audits have reduced the mean number of errors per data file by half, and increased the number of correct files by 20%. Data collected over this 10-year period show that despite the introduction of a restrictive law and increasing mean maternal age, the overall clinical pregnancy rate has continued to improve.",M2

16263976,"How do physicians immunize their own children? Differences among pediatricians and nonpediatricians.CONTEXT: Immunization has an essential impact on public health worldwide. Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of different vaccines to protect individuals from various diseases. However, some parents choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons such as, among others, doubts regarding their usefulness, concerns over safety or efficacy, etc. Physicians are known to exert a direct influence on immunization rates by answering questions and clarifying misconceptions. Yet, it is unknown how they immunize their own children. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess how physicians interested in vaccination issues immunized, or would immunize, their own children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An 11-question, Web-based survey with a total of 102 discrete answers was sent to 2070 Swiss physicians in October 2004. All physicians were subscribers to a nonprofit, Web-based expert network (InfoVac, www.infovac.<e>ch</e>) that distributes monthly newsletters and answers question within 2 days on immunization issues. The InfoVac network reaches &gt; 95% of pediatricians in Switzerland but &lt; 20% of general practitioners. All responses were anonymous, and no identifier could be used to trace the participants of the survey. Questions were divided into 2 parts: (1) physicians who were parents were asked which vaccines they gave to their own children and at what age, and (2) all physicians were asked which vaccines they would give to their own child and at what age if they had a newborn child in 2004. Vaccines available in Switzerland at the time of the survey were offered as possible replies, and recommended vaccines were considered as those noted in the Swiss federal immunization schedule issued yearly. One question compared their immunization practice between their own children and their patients. Sociodemographics, qualifying year, membership in different professional groups, and their type of practice were also requested. Statistics. Standard descriptive statistics were used for sociodemographic characteristics. Univariate statistical analyses were performed for each variable to determine its relationship to the dependent variable, being a pediatrician or nonpediatrician. Logistic-regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for any statistically significant demographic variables that might function as confounders (gender, parenthood, workplace, year of diploma, and type of practice). For all statistical tests, differences were considered significant at P &lt; .05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We performed a comparison of past and projected immunization rates in the children of pediatricians and nonpediatricians. RESULTS: One thousand seventeen valid questionnaires were received (response rate: 49.1%; pediatricians: 53.3%). Nine hundred fifteen physicians (90%) had &gt; or = 1 child. All physicians reported immunizing children in their practice. Pediatricians were more likely to be women and to work in private practice than nonpediatricians but less likely to belong to a self-reported alternative medicine association. Among the nonpediatricians, 317 were general practitioners, 144 were internists, and 95 were other specialists. Ninety-two percent of pediatricians followed the official immunization recommendations for their own children. In contrast, after controlling for gender, workplace, type of practice, and year of diploma, nonpediatricians were more likely not to have immunized their children against measles, mumps, hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenzae type b. They more frequently postponed diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) (OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 2.0-10.19) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. Although projected immunization rates were higher than effective rates, 10% of nonpediatricians would still not follow the official immunization recommendations in 2004. They would more frequently refrain from using combination vaccines and postpone DTP and MMR immunization to later in life. Several comparisons confirmed the weaker use of the more recently licensed vaccines by nonpediatricians. In addition to vaccines currently recommended in Switzerland, both groups of physicians added hepatitis A, influenza, and varicella vaccines to the vaccination schedule of their own children. Pediatricians were more likely to give pneumococcal (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.004-4.68) and meningococcal C (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.62-3.17) vaccines to their own children. In contrast, they were less likely to give tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccine (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-three percent of the surveyed physicians agree with the current official vaccination recommendations and would apply them to their own children. However, the observation that 5% of nonpediatricians would not use Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine if they had a child born in 2004 is unexpected and concerning. In contrast, both groups gave additional vaccines than those recommended to their own children. Among physicians in Switzerland interested in immunization, a significant proportion of nonpediatricians decline or delay the immunization of their own children with the recommended MMR- or DTP-based combination vaccines, which indicates that clarification of misconceptions such as fear of  immune overload  has not yet reached important targets among health care providers who thus are unlikely to answer parental concerns adequately.",M2
16143430,"An European survey of structure and organisation of nutrition support teams in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Nutritional support teams (NST) have been demonstrated to be an excellent mechanism for identifying patients in need of nutrition support, improving the efficacy of nutrition support in a variety of hospital environments. Focus of this study was the investigation of function, structure and organisation of NST in Germany (D), Austria (A) and Switzerland (<e>CH</e>). METHODS: Prospective investigation of the function, structure and organisation of NST in D, A and CH, using standardised questionnaires. RESULTS: From a total of 3071 hospitals in D, A and CH, NST have been established at 98 hospitals (3.2%). Their main activities were creating nutritional regimes (100%), education (87%) and monitoring nutrition therapy (92%). In general, the NST are not independently operating units but are affiliated to a special discipline. Seventy-one per cent of the physicians, 40% of the nurses and 69% of the dieticians in the NST held a nutrition-specific additional qualification. A total of 12% of the physicians, 37% of the nurses and 46% of the dieticians are exclusively responsible for the NST. A reduction of complications (88%) and cost saving (98%) were indicated since their establishment. The NST received in 32% funding support. CONCLUSION: In D, A, CH neither a uniform nor comprehensive patient care by NST existed in 2004. Standards of practice, development of guidelines in clinical nutrition and better documentation in NSTs are necessary. Special efforts should be aimed at education of NST members and financing of teams.",M2
15974138,"The Action Plan--a new instrument to collect data on interventions in secondary prevention in adolescents.It is difficult to draw causal conclusions about the effectiveness of secondary prevention programs for adolescents at risk, when the programs use a variety of different interventions. The Action Plan is an instrument that is designed to make collection of such data possible. This allows calculating different kinds of intervention patterns for each participant and program, which, in combination with outcome measures, gives an estimate of successful vs. less successful interventions. The study compared intervention patterns from 12 different sites in a national intervention program in Switzerland. The program, called supra-f (www.supra-f.<e>ch</e>), started in 1999 and will end in 2005. Results are presented from the ongoing study with approximately 600 adolescents.

The latest epidemiological data for Switzerland were prospectively collected in 1971. METHODS: A prospective nationwide survey over a period of five weeks was initiated by IBDNet.<e>ch</e> and a questionnaire sent to all gastroenterologists in hospital or private practice. RESULTS: The response rate was 42% (85/204). 930 patients were recorded, 505 (54.3%) had CD, 425 (44.9%) UC, male/female ratio was 47 vs. 53%, mean age 44 +/- 15.8 years (standard deviation, SD). Median duration of disease was 84 months (mean 101 +/- 3.15 SEM). In CD, intestinal involvement was colitis in 135 (26.7%), ileitis in 142 (28.1%) and ileocolitis in 228 (45.2%) patients. In UC, (n = 425) pancolitis was present in 182 (43.5%), left-sided colitis in 140 (33.6%) and proctitis in 95 (22.9%) cases. Diarrhea was the main symptom (52.8%; CD/UC: 47.5% vs. 59.2%; p &lt; 0.001), as well as abdominal pain 35.8% (CD/UC: 48.5% vs. 20.1%; p &lt; 0.001), rectal bleeding 27.8% (CD/UC: 8.4% vs. 51.8%; p &lt; 0.001). Weight loss was reported in 12.2% (CD/UC: 14% vs. 9.8%), anemia in 15.1% ( CD/UC: 14.8% vs. 15.3%). The mean number of medications per patient was 2.1 (+/- 1.2SD), CD/UC 2.4 vs. 1.9 (p &lt; 0.001). 5-ASA preparations per os were used in 74%, topical treatment in 18% in both groups. Corticosteroids CD/UC 56.5%/54%, oral or topical budesonide (CD/UC: 19% vs. 16%; CD/UC: 1.9% vs. 2.1%). Antibiotics (18%) or immunomodulatory therapy, as well as infliximab, was similar in both groups. Inflammatory bowel disease related surgery was performed in 233 (25.4%): resection of stenosis or in fistula 132 (14.2%), colectomy (total and subtotal) in 70 (7.5%), colostomy in situ in 21 patients (2.3%). Extraintestinal manifestations occurred in 36.6%, significantly more in patients with CD vs. UC: 25% vs. 16% (p &lt; 0.001). Arthritis 18.6% (CD/UC: 22.6 vs. 13.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and osteoporosis were recorded in 9.7% (CD/UC: 13.65 vs. 4.8%, p &lt; 0.001).

15592949,"Prostate cancer screening: results of a prospective trial in Canton Aargau, Switzerland.INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Swiss men and the second leading cause of cancer related death among them (e.g. <e>CH</e>: 1,267 in year 1998). With the population at risk constantly growing these absolute numbers are expected to further increase. While there is no question that aggressive treatment of localised tumour is required for definitive cure of prostate cancer, the application of screening for early stage disease remains controversial. Since 1998 the Clinic of Urology in Kantonsspital Aarau has participated in the ERSPC (European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer) study, which is designed to provide data on prostate cancer screening within a prospective randomised controlled setting. METHODS: Men aged between 55 and 70 years were enrolled in the study. From n = 18,361 men invited by a letter to participate, 7,124 (38.8%) agreed and gave their informed consent to be randomised in either a PSA measurement (n = 3,562, group 1) or a control group (n = 3,562, group 2). Men in group 1 with a PSA level ?3.0 ng/ml, n = 372 (10.5%) then underwent ultrasound guided transrectal sextant biopsy of the prostate. RESULTS: Prostate cancer was detected at presentation in every fourth man biopsied (n = 89). Neither the free-to-total PSA ratio nor the PSA density could significantly spare biopsies while sustaining a high sensitivity level. The overall cancer detection rate amounted to 2.5% in PSA tested men. In 7% (n = 5) distant disease was already present. 93% of men with clinically organ confined disease underwent prostatectomy (n = 59) or radiotherapy (n = 22), whilst only (n = 3) chose to follow a policy of watchful waiting. In 92% the histology of the prostatectomy specimens revealed aggressive cancer characteristics according to the criteria of Epstein et al. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinically relevant tumour characteristics and the relatively low cancer detection rate of 2.5% (less than the lifetime mortality risk of 3% and the morbidity risk of 8%) seem to justify screening in terms of adequate diagnosis and treatment, follow-up until 2008 is needed to prove the benefit in mortality for the prostate cancer screening group over the control group. Furthermore, information from the ongoing ERSPC study is needed in order to assess uncertainties i.e. the degree of overdiagnosis caused by repeated screening and the quality of life adjusted gain in life years. For daily practice a  PSA grey zone  of 4-10 ng/ml can no longer be postulated as only 70% of men in this range presented with organ confined disease. Once the PSA level exceeds 4.0 ng/ml. prostate biopsy should be performed immediately.",M2
15573277,"Coronary revascularization in DACH: 1991-2002.BACKGROUND: The changes in coronary revascularization in Europe in general and in the DACH countries (Deutschland, Austria, Switzerland) in particular between 1991 - 2002 were studied. METHODS: The databases of different national surgical societies, registries, and governments and international organizations and collegial responses were analyzed. RESULTS: The population of Europe (excluding Russia, CIS, and Turkey) increased by 2.29 % from 1991 to 521.84 million in 2002 and by 4.7 %, 3.4 %, and 7.4 % in Austria (AT), Germany (DE), and Switzerland (<e>CH</e>), respectively. The DACH countries contributed 18.76 % to the European population in 2002. During this period the cardiac surgery (CS) output increased in Europe, AT, DE, CH by 108 % to 428 477 (821/million population), by 72 % to 7035 (859/million), by 244 % to 125 341 (1521/million), and 61 % to about 8600 (1175/million), respectively. Coronary artery surgery (CAS) output increased by 108 % to 241 567 (463/million), by 83 % to 4559 (557/million), by 159 % to 73 929 (897/million), and by 37 % to about 5000 (684/million), respectively. DACH contributed 34.6 % of CAS volume in Europe in 2002. CAS average volume/center/year rose from 301 in 1991 to 392 in 2002 in Europe, 312 --&gt; 506 in AT, 538 --&gt; 936 in DE, and changed to 331 --&gt; 278 in CH. The percentage of CAS in CS hardly changed from 56.2 % in 1991 to 56.4 % in 2002 in Europe but changed from 61 % --&gt; 64.8 % in AT, 67.5 % --&gt; 58.98 % in DE, and 68.1 % --&gt; 58.2 % in CH. Acceptance of OPCAB remains low at 5 - 18 % of CAS. The increase in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) volume was more impressive: the 2002 average of PCI/million was 1244 in Europe, 1659 in AT, 2524 in DE, and 1708 in CH; 36 % of the total number of European PCI was done in DACH. In 2002, coronary stenting was done in 83 % of PCI in Europe: with 1039/million in Europe, 1399/mill (84 %) in AT, 1994/mill (79 %) in DE, and 1435/mill (84 %) in CH. The average European total coronary revascularization activity (PCI + CAS) increased from 1991 by 257 % to 1707/million in 2002; in DACH it increased by 261 % to 3243/million. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary revascularization productivity in Europe during the last decade has continued to grow (mostly in the PCI sector) but has lagged behind that in the USA. The pattern of coronary artery surgery remains fairly consistent in DACH while CAS productivity is far ahead of the rest of Europe despite recent plateauing. The trend towards PCI was equally pronounced in AT, DE, and CH.",M2
15369014,"Undergraduate teaching in gerodontology in Austria, Switzerland and Germany.OBJECTIVE: To survey the present state of undergraduate teaching in the domain of gerodontology in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: All universities of Austria (A), Germany (D) and Switzerland (<e>CH</e>). PROTOCOL: A questionnaire on undergraduate teaching in gerodontology was mailed to all Deans (A: n = 3; CH: n = 4; D: n = 31) and all independent departments except paediatric dentistry and orthodontics (A: n = 11; CH: n = 15; D: n = 111). RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed and returned by 29 Deans (A: n = 2; CH: n = 4; D: n = 23) and 102 departments (A: n = 7; CH: n = 8; D: n = 87). In Austria, gerodontology is a very small component of the dental curriculum and the Deans did not want this to be increased. Most German universities claimed to teach some aspects of gerodontology to undergraduate students and 87.4% of the Deans voted for separate lectures in gerodontology. In Switzerland, gerodontology seems well established. The results of questionnaires from the independent departments revealed that in all three countries lectures were more prevalent (A: n = 0; CH: n = 4; D: n = 6) than practical training in nursing homes (A: n = 0; CH: n = 3; D: n = 6). CONCLUSION: Considering the demographical shift which is leading to an increasing proportion of elderly in the population, the weighting of gerodontology in the undergraduate dental curriculum should be considered for revision in Austria and Germany.",M2

This study describes hospital pharmacists' practices in France (F), Switzerland (<e>CH</e>), and Belgium (B). METHODS: From the responses received using a standardized questionnaire, (n = 378) we determined the origin, types of container used, and choice of PN formula (standard versus tailor-made) and the type of quality control and the existence of nutrition support teams. RESULTS: The mean response rates were 55.6% (CH), 30.5% (F), and 24.5% (B). Standard formulas were used mainly for adult patients (CH, 86%; F, 79%; B, 86%), whereas approximately 50% of tailor-made PN bags were used for children. Single-compartment or multicompartment bags or glass bottles contained standard formulas. Most standard formulas were provided by industry, apart from (B), where 50% of PN solutions were compounded by hospital pharmacies. Single-compartment bags contained generally tailor-made formulas produced exclusively by hospital pharmacies in (CH) and (B), whereas 33% were provided by industry in (F). Quality controls were mostly visual and occurred in 75% to 95% of hospitals. Nutrition support teams were present in 32% to 45% of hospitals. CONCLUSION: The choice, origin, and type of container used for PN formulas were highly variable among countries. However, the use of standard formulas in bags was predominant in (CH) and (B). The function of nutrition support teams was similar in (F), (CH), and (B).",M2
15060977,"[Computer-based information system (CliniTox) for the management of poisoning in small animals]Because cases of poisoning are observed rarely, veterinary practitioners have only limited knowledge of clinical toxicology and may face considerable problems in handling toxicological emergencies. In this report, we describe a novel decision support system for the management of poisonings in companion animals that provides rapid access to the current knowledge of clinical toxicology. For that purpose, relevant reports from the peer-reviewed literature were evaluated and organised according to the requirements of a structured database. The information provided for each toxic substance includes a summary of its chemical and physical properties, sources, commercial uses or natural occurrences, toxicokinetic data, mechanisms of action, threshold doses, clinical symptoms with brief case reports, sampling and analytical results, post-mortem findings, differential diagnoses, therapeutic guidelines and references to the literature. This decision support system has been programmed with two user-friendly search functions: a search tool that allows to choose clinical symptoms, and another function that serves to find a substance using its chemical name, the class of compounds to wich it belongs, a possible source or one of its main applications. CliniTox can be accessed directly via our webserver (http://www.clinitox.<e>ch</e>).",M2
15021986,"Diagnostic telepathology: long-term experience of a single institution.OBJECTIVES: The paper reviews the development of the application of telepathology in a department of surgical pathology between 1991 and 2003. The goal of the efforts during this time was to give up the concept of programming a single application, available only between two fixed workstations with sophisticated devices and special software, and to find the virtual  largest common denominator  for implementing as many different applications as possible with the same basic system. METHODS: A new telepathology system was designed as a client-server system with a relational database at its centre. The clients interact together by transferring the questions (texts and images) to a record (case) in the database on the server and by transferring the answers to the same record on the database. RESULTS: The new  open  telepathology system iPath (http://telepath.patho.unibas.<e>ch</e>) has been very well accepted by many groups around the world. The main application fields are: consultations between pathologists and medical institutions without a pathologist (e.g. for frozen section diagnoses or for surgical diagnoses in hospitals in South Asia or Africa), tumour boards, field studies and distance education (http://teleteach.patho.unibas.ch). CONCLUSIONS: Having observed that with iPath we have succeeded in satisfying all our telepathology needs, we are inclined to put the emphasis on the nature of the tasks being performed, as opposed to the methods or technical means for performing a given task. The three organisation models proposed by Weinstein et al. (2001) can be reduced to only two models: the model of discussion groups and the model of expert groups (virtual institutes).",M2

The antibiotics were chosen on the basis of their licenses for intramammary application in Switzerland (www.vetpharm.unizh.<e>ch</e>). 91% of the S. aureus strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. Only 9% of the strains were resistant to Penicillin G and 7% to Ampicillin. 53% of the CNS strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 31% exhibited resistance to Penicillin G, 26% to Ampicillin, 16% to Cloxacillin and 14% to Lincomycin. 30% of the Streptococcus spp. strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 4% were resistant to Penicillin G, 4% to Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 1% to Cefoperazone, 2% to Cefquinome, 35% to Neomycin, 22% to Gentamicin, 61% to Kanamy-cin and 11% to Lincomycin. 43% of the strains showed multiple resistance. 79% of the E. coli strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 20% exhibited resistance to Ampicillin, 9% to Neomycin and 10% to Kanamycin. A comparison of the own results with data of other authors in Switzerland shows no important changes in the resistance situation during the last 20 years. With the exception of two strains (Streptococcus spp.), all tested isolates were sensible against Cefquinome.",M2

On September 1, 2001, castration of calves and lambs has been deleted from this list of exceptions. Since then, several pressure groups have requested these interventions to be delegated to the producers for economical reasons. The current article describes the results of a web-based survey on this subject, conducted among the members of the Swiss Association of ruminant practitioners (SARP). Two separate questionnaires--one focused on calves and one on lambs--were made available to the members of the SARP for a duration of 3 months as pdf-files on the homepage of the SARP (www.svwasmr.<e>ch</e>). On December 31, 2002, the deadline for submission of the completed questionnaires, the membership of the SARP was constituted of 360 practicing veterinarians. The response rate was 25%. Close to a hundred percents of the responding veterinarians expressed the expectation that the SARP publish guidelines on the castration of calves and lambs. An overwhelming majority refused the delegation of castrations to the producers, and further stated that they were not ready to accept any responsibility for interventions performed by the producers. However, a third of the responding veterinarians judged the expected workload for the castration of lambs to presumably exceed their current capacity. It is concluded from the results of this survey that the board of the SARP should urgently elaborate, discuss, and propose novel and innovative concepts to solve the issue of castration of calves and lambs.",M2

As early as in 1947, however, motivated young physicians left Switzerland for England, Scandinavia and the USA to familiarise themselves with the advances made in modern anaesthesia. In March, 1951, three of these pioneers, <e>Ch</e>. Bovay (Lausanne), W. Hügin (Basel), and K. Zeller (Winterthur), founded the Professional Association of Swiss Anaesthesiologists, thus preparing the ground for the Swiss Society of Anaesthesiology which was founded on July 5 th, 1952, on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Swiss Society of Surgery held in Zurich. Members of the first Executive Committee were Ch. Bovay, K. Zimmermann (Zurich), and W. Hügin. In 1963, the latter was appointed first Professor of Anaesthesiology in Switzerland by the University of Basel. Looking back, the 18 physicians involved in the foundation of the Society were indeed most courageous. This step towards independence is all the more admirable since the Swiss Society of Surgery, by founding a Section of Anaesthesiology, attempted to retain sovereignty over this small and new group of specialists. Only in 1954 anaesthesiology was recognised by the Swiss Medical Association as a medical specialty in its own right. In 1967 the name was changed to Swiss Society of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation (SSAR). Since coming into existence, the Society has grown more than 40-fold, with a total membership approaching 800 by 2002 end. In recent years, the SSAR took a particular interest in promoting both the training and CME of anaesthesiologists, in supporting research by its young members and in improving the quality and safety of anaesthesia.",M2

11344953,"[Fight against doping--national and international developments after Tour de France 1998]After the scandal at the Tour de France 1998, the fight against doping was intensified on national as well as international levels. In particular, the foundation of the new World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has been a landmark: for the first time in the history of the fight against doping, there exists now an international structure that includes partners from the Olympic movement as well as from the governments. The importance of the WADA has already been demonstrated during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney. First, it conducted several thousands of un-announced doping tests internationally and second, members of the WADA acted as independent observers to judge the carrying out of doping controls during the games. In Switzerland, important new measures were taken in the past years: The introduction of an independent attorney for the judgment of sanctions or the employment of four professional doping control officers had a clear effect on the quality of doping controls. In addition, research--e.g. a survey on the perception of doping among the population or the development of new technologies for doping analysis--was intensified. In the fields of information and prevention, the existing printed material was extended with a website on doping (www.dopinginfo.<e>ch</e>). Furthermore, international cooperation to develop new didactical material for schools is intended. On the legal level, Switzerland will introduce a new law in mid 2001. It will enable the government to fight against the entourage of athletes when it provides doping substances to athletes. The sanctioning of athletes using doping will still be in the jurisdiction of the sports federations.",M2

In March 1999 a survey was conducted to better appraise the benefits gained from the information provided from the website visitors' point of view. Around 400 persons who had entered their names in the homepage guest book were informed about the survey by e-mail. A total of 167 questionnaires were filled in online, which is equivalent to the reply rate of close to 42%. The majority of the replies (63.5%) were from private-practice physicians, 22.2% from hospital-based physicians. The average age ranged between 40 and 49 years. 67.7% of the 167 respondents had internet access at their workplace, 72.5% had private internet access.

10992750,"Appropriateness and necessity research on the Internet: using a  second opinion system .Appropriateness and necessity research of various procedures in medicine may be the most complex field of innovation in healthcare and technology assessment. Nevertheless, the appropriateness of the indication of any medical intervention is probably more important than the outcome since even ideal quality components of structures, processes and outcomes become irrelevant without a proper indication. The first part of our appropriateness initiative in interventional cardiology and gynecology was to formulate guidelines. To define the appropriateness for coronary angiography, coronary revascularization and hysterectomy, literature-based consensus methods were used. The second part was to disseminate the guidelines in a user-friendly manner via the Internet. Therefore, we relied on a system-driven query facility for propositional (experts) rules. The next part of the appropriateness initiative may be a user-friendly Internet-based data collection system to validate the national accepted guidelines. Most important may be that only data that is needed can be collected using a refined database technology. The described Second Opinion System can be found under: http:sos.inf.ethz.<e>ch</e>.

Data came from two surveys and included 16- and 18-year-old respondents (F: study year 1993, n = 280, CH: study year 1992/3, n = 272). Three intake behaviours--eating, drinking and smoking--were analysed by means of cluster and logistic regression analyses. Three cross-culturally valid behaviour clusters emerged: a healthy, an unhealthy and a mixed pattern where unhealthy eating behaviours were combined with non-smoking and low alcohol use. The determinants of the patterns were tested by comparing the two countries in relation to the socio-demographic characteristics of the young people that belonged in the same cluster. In both countries the structure of the determinants was almost identically indicating high cross-cultural stability. The study suggests that among young people of this age there is clear and cross-culturally consistent patterning of health-related behaviours.",M2

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study, which was conducted after a survey using a questionnaire. SETTING: Interdisciplinary ICU (n = 8 beds) at San Giovanni Hospital in Bellinzona (<e>CH</e>). SUBJECTS: Three-hundred ninety families of patients who died in the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A postal questionnaire (n = 43 questions) was sent to the families of 390 patients who died in the ICU during 8 yrs (1981 to 1989). The results referred to 123 replies: a) 82.6% of the respondents expressed no criticism of the patient's hospital stay; b) 90% considered the patient's treatment was adequate; c) 17% felt that the information received concerning diagnosis was insufficient or unclear; and d) 30% (particularly close relatives and those relatives who were informed of the death by telephone and not in person) expressed dissatisfaction regarding the information received on the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey found that the relatives of patients who died were most dissatisfied with the care received according to: a) the type of death (e.g., sudden death vs. death preceded by a gradual deterioration in the patient's condition); and b) the manner in which the relatives were notified of the death (in person vs. by telephone). The personal characteristics of the people interviewed, such as gender and the closeness of their relationship to the deceased, also seem to have some bearing on the opinions expressed.
