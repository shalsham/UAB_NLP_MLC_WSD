20185606,"Association of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> intake and phosphorus to protein ratio with mortality in hemodialysis patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epidemiologic studies show an association between higher predialysis serum phosphorus and increased death risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The hypothesis that higher dietary phosphorus intake and higher phosphorus content per gram of dietary protein intake are each associated with increased mortality in MHD patients was examined. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: Food frequency questionnaires were used to conduct a cohort study to examine the survival predictability of dietary phosphorus and the ratio of phosphorus to protein intake. At the start of the cohort, Cox proportional hazard regression was used in 224 MHD patients, who were followed for up to 5 years (2001 to 2006). RESULTS: Both higher dietary phosphorus intake and a higher dietary phosphorus to protein ratio were associated with significantly increased death hazard ratios (HR) in the unadjusted models and after incremental adjustments for case-mix, diet, serum phosphorus, malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome, and inflammatory markers. The HR of the highest (compared with lowest) dietary phosphorus intake tertile in the fully adjusted model was 2.37. Across categories of dietary phosphorus to protein ratios of &lt;12, 12 to &lt;14, 14 to &lt;16, and &gt; or =16 mg/g, death HRs were 1.13, 1.00 (reference value), 1.80, and 1.99, respectively. Cubic spline models of the survival analyses showed similar incremental associations. CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary phosphorus intake and higher dietary phosphorus to protein ratios are each associated with increased death risk in MHD patients, even after adjustments for serum phosphorus, phosphate binders and their types, and dietary protein, energy, and potassium intakes.",M1
20164365,"Sodium-dependent phosphate uptake in the jejunum is post-transcriptionally regulated in pigs fed a low-<e>phosphorus</e> diet and is independent of dietary calcium concentration.In rodents, severe dietary P restriction increases active phosphate absorption by the intestine. However, it remains unknown if moderate dietary P restriction has a similar effect. Weanling pigs (n = 32; body weight 7.4 +/- 0.55 kg) were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design and fed dietary available P (aP) concentrations of 0.23 or 0.40% and Ca concentrations of 0.58 or 1.00% for 14 d. Diets were formulated on an aP basis instead of a total P basis, because pigs are unable to absorb phytate-P present in corn and soybean meal. Jejunal segments were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for determination of Na(+)-dependent nutrient transport. Intestinal mucosal scrapings were taken for RNA isolation and brush border membrane (BBM) vesicle isolation. Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake and gene expression of Na-phosphate cotransporter IIb (NaPi-IIb), SGLT-1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter-1), and calbindin D(9k) and protein expression of NaPi-IIb were evaluated. Na(+)-dependent phosphate transport increased (P &lt; 0.05) 46% as dietary aP concentration was decreased. However, increased Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake was not accompanied by increased NaPi-IIb mRNA expression. Expression of NaPi-IIb protein in the BBM increased (P &lt; 0.01) 84% in pigs fed low-P diets compared with pigs fed adequate-P diets. No dietary Ca effects or aP x Ca interactions were detected for Na-dependent P uptake, mRNA or protein expression of NaPi-IIb, or mRNA expression of calbindin D(9k). These data suggest that restricting dietary aP concentration by only 43% stimulates Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake and expression of the NaPi-IIb protein in the BBM of the small intestine and through a post-transcriptional mechanism.",M1
20093346,"Understanding sources of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease.In individuals with chronic kidney disease, high dietary phosphorus (P) burden may worsen hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy, promote vascular calcification and cardiovascular events, and increase mortality. In addition to the absolute amount of dietary P, its type (organic versus inorganic), source (animal versus plant derived), and ratio to dietary protein may be important. Organic P in such plant foods as seeds and legumes is less bioavailable because of limited gastrointestinal absorption of phytate-based P. Inorganic P is more readily absorbed by intestine, and its presence in processed, preserved, or enhanced foods or soft drinks that contain additives may be underreported and not distinguished from the less readily absorbed organic P in nutrient databases. Hence, P burden from food additives is disproportionately high relative to its dietary content as compared with natural sources that are derived from organic (animal and vegetable) food proteins. Observational and metabolic studies indicate nutritional and longevity benefits of higher protein intake in dialysis patients. This presents challenges to providing appropriate nutrition because protein and P intakes are closely correlated. During dietary counseling of patients with chronic kidney disease, the absolute dietary P content as well as the P-to-protein ratio in foods should be addressed. Foods with the least amount of inorganic P, low P-to-protein ratios, and adequate protein content that are consistent with acceptable palatability and enjoyment to the individual patient should be recommended along with appropriate prescription of P binders. Provision of in-center and monitored meals during hemodialysis treatment sessions in the dialysis clinic may facilitate the achievement of these goals.",M1
20083730,"Dietary <e>phosphorus</e>, blood pressure, and incidence of hypertension in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study and the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.Greater phosphorus intake has been associated with lower levels of blood pressure in cross-sectional studies. This association, however, has not been assessed prospectively. We studied 13 444 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, with diet assessed at baseline using validated food frequency questionnaires. Blood pressure and use of antihypertensive medication were determined at baseline and during follow-up visits. Compared with individuals in the lowest quintile of phosphorus intake at baseline, those in the highest quintile had lower baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures after adjustment for dietary and nondietary confounders (-2.0 mm Hg [95% CI: -3.6 to -0.5], P for trend=0.01; and -0.6 [95% CI: -1.6 to +0.3], P for trend=0.20, respectively). During an average 6.2 years of follow-up, 3345 cases of hypertension were identified. Phosphorus intake was associated with the risk of hypertension (hazard ratio: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.80 to 1.00], comparing extreme quintiles; P for trend=0.02) after adjustment for nondietary factors but not after additional adjustment for dietary variables (hazard ratio: 1.01 [95% CI: 0.82 to 1.23], P for trend=0.88). Phosphorus from dairy products but not from other sources was associated with lower baseline blood pressure and reduced risk of incident hypertension. Hazard ratios (95% CIs) comparing extreme quintiles were 0.86 (0.76 to 0.97; P for trend=0.01) for phosphorus from dairy foods and 1.04 (0.93 to 1.17; P for trend=0.48) for phosphorus from other foods. These findings could indicate an effect of phosphorus in conjunction with other dairy constituents or of dairy itself without involvement of phosphorus.",M1
20038659,"Responses of alkaline phosphatase activity to <e>phosphorus</e> stress in Daphnia magna.We examined how alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity within the bodies and in the materials released by the crustacean Daphnia magna responds to variable algal food phosphorus (P)-content. We found that Daphnia eating P-poor food (C:P approximately 700) had significantly higher AP activity in their bodies on a mass-specific basis compared with individuals eating P-rich food (C:P approximately 100). This dietary P effect on AP activity was not altered by Daphnia starvation but was partially related to differences in the P concentration of animal body homogenates. By contrast, poor P-nutrition of Daphnia lowered AP activity in released materials compared with that measured from their P-sufficient conspecifics. Moreover, AP activity in Daphnia release was lowest in animals consuming P-poor food for longer time periods. Our results support the hypothesis that AP activity increases inside P-limited Daphnia as a mechanism to increase P-acquisition and retention from ingested algae in these nutritionally stressed animals. The lower level of AP activity present in the water of P-deprived animals could reflect a change from largely free to membrane-bound AP isotypes in the digestive tracts of P-starved animals or a decrease in the shedding of membrane-anchored AP from their intestinal lining. These results supplement accumulating evidence that P-poor algal food reduces the dietary mineral P available to Daphnia. In addition, animal body AP activity measurements, with some refinement, may prove useful as an in situ indicator of P-stress in aquatic consumers.",M1
19949275,"[<e>Phosphorus</e>-rich foods and bone]Phosphorus is present in almost all food. The major sources are grain, meat, sea food and dairy product. However average absorption rate from the intestine is 60 approximately 70%, it differs according to types of food. Recently, increased phosphorus intakes from food additives are seen as a problem. But, the accurate amount is unknown in Japan. It is expected to clarify the exact phosphorus intake and proper recommended intakes considering with other nutrients especially calcium for the best condition of bone, and also show adequate food choice methods.",M1
19942351,"The interactive effect of phytase and coccidia on the gross lesions as well as the absorption capacity of intestine in broilers fed with diets low in calcium and available phosphorous.In an experiment with 2x2 factorial design, the influence of dietary phytase on the intestinal lesions as well as the absorption capacity of intestine for D-xylose in broiler chickens provided with a diet low in calcium (Ca) and available <e>phosphorus</e> (aP) and challenged with Eimeria oocysts, was evaluated. Four groups of 20 1-day-old male broiler were provided with diets low in total Ca and aP (8 and 3g/kg instead of 10 and 5g/kg of Ca and aP in the diet, respectively). On day 10, 10 chicks from each group were randomly kept in individual raised floor wire cages to adopt environmental conditions. The experimental groups were as follows, Group 1: received no Eimeria oocysts (negative control), Group 2: received oocysts of mixed Eimeria species on day 15 to create an experimental coccidiosis (positive control), Group 3: negative control received phytase enzyme in their diet, from the first day of life, and Group 4: positive control received phytase enzyme in the diet. On day 20, after 12h fasting, the D-xylose absorption test was performed and immediately after that, the intestinal lesion scoring was carried out. The results showed that coccidiosis in Groups 2 and 4 produced progressive lesions in intestinal tract and reduced the concentration of plasma D-xylose in Group 2 when compared to Groups 1 and 3. Dietary phytase had no influence on the concentration of plasma D-xylose in un-infected birds. The enzyme had no influence on the intestinal lesions caused by coccidiosis as well. However, it increased the plasma D-xylose concentration of Group 4 to the level that it was comparable with Groups 1 and 3, at 45 and 90min post-ingestion of the solution. It was concluded that the addition of phytase enzyme to the low Ca and aP diet, increased indirectly the absorption capacity of intestine for D-xylose in infected chickens most probably through the improvement of mechanisms involved in the absorption and transport of D-xylose.",M1
19929969,"Cell-surface phytase on Pichia pastoris cell wall offers great potential as a feed supplement.Cell-surface expression of phytase allows the enzyme to be expressed and anchored on the cell surface of Pichia pastoris. This avoids tedious downstream processes such as purification and separation involved with extracellular expression. In addition, yeast cells with anchored proteins can be used as a whole-cell biocatalyst with high value added. In this work, the phytase was expressed on the cell surface of P. pastoris with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring system. The recombinant phytase was shown to be located at the cell surface. The cell-surface phytase exhibited high activity with an optimal temperature at 50-55 degrees C and two optimal pH peaks of 3 and 5.5. The surface-displayed phytase also exhibited similar pH stability and pepsin resistance to the native and secreted phytase. In vitro digestibility test showed that P. pastoris containing cell-surface phytase released <e>phosphorus</e> from feedstuff at a level similar to secreted phytase. Yeast cells expressing phytase also provide additional nutrients, especially biotin and niacin. Thus, P. pastoris with phytase displayed on its surface has a great potential as a whole-cell supplement to animal feed.",M1
19904637,"Studies on the effects of microbial phytase on amino acid digestibility and energy metabolisability in caecectomised laying hens and the interaction with the dietary <e>phosphorus</e> level.1. Caecectomised laying hens were used in two assays to study the effects of a microbial 6-phytase on amino acid (AA) digestibility and energy metabolisability using (1) diets with phytate-rich protein sources and (2) with two dietary phosphorus (P) levels. The two assays followed a 2 x 2-factorial arrangement of treatments using 8 hens per treatment. The hens were housed individually in metabolism cages, and excreta were quantitatively collected for a period of 5 d. 2. In Assay 1, two dietary P levels (8.0 and 4.0 g/kg dry matter) and two levels of phytase supplementation (0 and 1000 U/kg diet) were used in diets that were mainly based on maize, sunflower meal and wheat gluten. The digestibility of AA was 001 to 002 lower in the diet with the low P than with the high P concentration. The effect of P content was significant for 12 out of the 14 AA studied. The supplementation of phytase significantly improved the degradation of myo-inositol(1,2,3,4,5,6)hexakisphosphate (IP6), but affected neither AA digestibility nor energy metabolisability. An interaction between the two factors was not detected. 3. In Assay 2, diets contained one main protein source (sunflower meal or rapeseed meal) at a concentration of 250 g/kg. The diets were either supplemented or not with phytase (1500 U/kg diet). On average, AA digestibility was 0.01 lower in the rapeseed meal-containing diet than in the sunflower meal-containing one. The maximum difference was 0.03. The effect of the protein source was significant for 9 of the 14 AA studied. The supplementation of phytase had no significant effect on AA digestibility or energy metabolisability. 4. Our studies do not substantiate the hypothesis that improved IP6 degradation due to phytase supplementation is associated with improved AA digestibility and energy metabolisability in laying hens. An interaction between phytase efficacy to improve AA digestibility or energy metabolisability and the P level in the diet does not seem to exist.",M1
19857269,"Influence of the calcium concentration in the presence of organic <e>phosphorus</e> on the physicochemical compatibility and stability of all-in-one admixtures for neonatal use.BACKGROUND: Preterm infants need high amounts of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization, which is difficult to obtain with parenteral feeding due to the low solubility of these salts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical compatibility of high concentrations of calcium associated with organic phosphate and its influence on the stability of AIO admixtures for neonatal use. METHODS: Three TPN admixture formulas were prepared in multilayered bags. The calcium content of the admixtures was adjusted to 0, 46.5 or 93 mg/100 ml in the presence of a fixed organic phosphate concentration as well as lipids, amino acids, inorganic salts, glucose, vitamins and oligoelements at pH 5.5. Each admixture was stored at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C and evaluated over a period of 7 days. The physicochemical stability parameters evaluated were visual aspect, pH, sterility, osmolality, peroxide formation, precipitation, and the size of lipid globules. RESULTS: Color alterations occurred from the first day on, and reversible lipid film formation from the third day of study for the admixtures stored at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. According to the parameters evaluated, the admixtures were stable at 4 degrees C; and none of them presented precipitated particles due to calcium/phosphate incompatibility or lipid globules larger than 5 mum, which is the main parameter currently used to evaluate lipid emulsion stability. The admixtures maintained low peroxide levels and osmolarity was appropriate for parenteral administration. CONCLUSION: The total calcium and calcium/phosphorus ratios studied appeared not to influence the physicochemical compatibility and stability of AIO admixtures.",M1
19845495,"Assessment of survival in a 2-year comparative study of lanthanum carbonate versus standard therapy.OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological data link elevated levels of serum <e>phosphorus</e> with increased mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent data also suggest improved survival with the use of dietary phosphate binders in patients on dialysis. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the survival benefit associated with different phosphate binders. A post-hoc survival analysis was undertaken of lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol *) versus standard therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients on dialysis enrolled in a phase 3, 2-year, comparative safety study were randomized 1:1 to lanthanum carbonate or standard therapy to treat serum phosphorus to a target of &lt; or =5.9 mg/dL (1.90 mmol/L). Patients (N = 1354) were followed up for survival status during, or after completion of or discontinuation from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival was measured by time from first dose of study medication to all-cause mortality or last contact. RESULTS: The distribution of follow-up time was similar in the lanthanum carbonate and standard therapy groups (mean 23.7 versus 23.9 months [median 27.0 versus 26.0 months], respectively). Serum phosphorus levels were similar across treatment groups, as patients were treated to target. At follow-up, 19.9% (135/680) of patients treated with lanthanum carbonate had died versus 23.3% (157/674) on standard therapy (log-rank p = 0.18). In the subgroup of patients aged &gt;65 years (n = 336), 27.0% (44/163) of lanthanum-carbonate-treated patients had died compared with 39.3% (68/173) on standard therapy (log-rank p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In these survival analyses, overall mortality was similar in the lanthanum carbonate and standard therapy groups, but results suggest that there was a survival benefit associated with lanthanum carbonate treatment for patients aged &gt;65 years, who are likely to carry the greatest burden of vascular calcification. These results were similar to those observed in the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study, a prospective trial of sevelamer hydrochloride designed to assess survival.",M1
19818298,"Evaluation of <e>phosphorus</e>, protein, and n-3 fatty-acid content in 15 marine fish species identifies the species most beneficial to renal patients.OBJECTIVE: Among 15 marine fish species, we sought to identify those most beneficial to renal patients by evaluating their phosphorus (P), protein (PC), and n-3 fatty-acid (n-3 PUFA) content. DESIGN: These 15 species are all edible. They were obtained and sampled randomly, and were filleted to obtain 100g, enabling us to perform the analysis in triplicate. Crude protein was analyzed with a Kjeltec, and minerals were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RESULTS: The PC values (g/100g) ranged from 14.3 (blue runner; BR) to 22.8 (California butterfly ray). The fish with the highest P (mg/100g) content were spotted sea trout (ST), gafftopsail fish (CF) (289), and BR (274), followed by smalltail shark (272). The species with the lowest ratio of P:n-3 PUFA was dollar fish (DF) (0.28), followed by BR, ST, and vermilion snapper (range, 0.28 to 0.67). The highest ratio of P:n-3 PUFA was found in the small-tail shark (11.6). Fish with a high n-3 PUFA/g PC content were DF (41.7), BR (38.05), ST (34.8), and CF (22.5). There was a tendency of P to increase as muscle fat increased (mg P/100g), i.e., lean fish (194), semifatty fish (239), and fatty fish (262). CONCLUSIONS: The regular inclusion in the diet, at least three times a week, of the species DF, BR, CF, ST, caitipa mojarra, vermillion snapper, and pot snapper can be considered beneficial to the general health status of renal patients.",M1
19786381,"Average daily intake of <e>phosphorus</e> in 3- to 5-year-old Japanese children as assessed by the duplicate-diet technique.The present study aimed to determine whether there is excessive mean daily intake of phosphorus in 3- to 5-year-old Japanese children and to ascertain relationships between phosphorus intake and various food and beverage groups. Subjects comprised of 90 children, with 15 boys and 15 girls in each age group from 3 to 5 years. The duplicate-diet technique was used to ascertain total dietary intake, including snacks and beverages over a 24-h period on 3 separate days from summer 1999 to winter 2000. After wet ashing food samples, phosphorus was quantified by colourimetry using a spectrophotometer. Median and 25th-75th percentile daily phosphorus intake for 3- to 5-year-old Japanese children was 674 mg (534-890 mg), and phosphorus intake correlated with the intake of many food groups and was closely correlated with total daily intake of food and beverage (rs=0.64). In addition, phosphorus intake correlated with the intake of magnesium and calcium (rs&gt;=0.6, p&lt;0.001). When assessed based on dietary reference intakes for the US, maximum intake did not exceed the tolerable upper intake level in any of the young children, but phosphorus intake was not more than the estimated average requirement (EAR) in 4.4% of subjects, which exceeded the target of 2.5% for the US EAR. We concluded that there is a risk of insufficient phosphorous intake, rather than excessive intake, for 4.4% of 3- to 5-year-old Japanese children.",M1
19781123,"Low calcium:<e>phosphorus</e> ratio in habitual diets affects serum parathyroid hormone concentration and calcium metabolism in healthy women with adequate calcium intake.Excessive dietary P intake alone can be deleterious to bone through increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, but adverse effects on bone increase when dietary Ca intake is low. In many countries, P intake is abundant, whereas Ca intake fails to meet recommendations; an optimal dietary Ca:P ratio is therefore difficult to achieve. Our objective was to investigate how habitual dietary Ca:P ratio affects serum PTH (S-PTH) concentration and other Ca metabolism markers in a population with generally adequate Ca intake. In this cross-sectional analysis of 147 healthy women aged 31-43 years, fasting blood samples and three separate 24-h urinary samples were collected. Participants kept a 4-d food record and were divided into quartiles according to their dietary Ca:P ratios. The 1st quartile with Ca:P molar ratio &lt; or = 0.50 differed significantly from the 2nd (Ca:P molar ratio 0.51-0.57), 3rd (Ca:P molar ratio 0.58-0.64) and 4th (Ca:P molar ratio &gt; or = 0.65) quartiles by interfering with Ca metabolism. In the 1st quartile, mean S-PTH concentration (P = 0.021) and mean urinary Ca (U-Ca) excretion were higher (P = 0.051) than in all other quartiles. These findings suggest that in habitual diets low Ca:P ratios may interfere with homoeostasis of Ca metabolism and increase bone resorption, as indicated by higher S-PTH and U-Ca levels. Because low habitual dietary Ca:P ratios are common in Western diets, more attention should be focused on decreasing excessively high dietary P intake and increasing Ca intake to the recommended level.",M1
19768470,"Sensitivity of Daphnia species to <e>phosphorus</e>-deficient diets.The life history of freshwater cladocerans such as Daphnia spp. is strongly affected by their environment. Factors such as temperature, food quantity and even the presence or absence of predators influence growth, reproduction and morphology of individuals. Recently, it has also become clear that the quality of the food can affect various life history traits of Daphnia. More specifically, the effect of the elemental composition of algae, expressed as the C:P ratio, has been studied intensively. Daphnia species differ in their response to differences in the C:P ratio of their food. Until now, it has been unclear whether these species differences are driven by phylogenetic constraints or by adaptation to particular environmental conditions. Here we present laboratory experiments with 12 Daphnia species from three different subgenera originating from a broad range of habitats. We compared somatic growth rates and sensitivity to variation in the nutrient stoichiometry of the food with habitat parameters, taking into account the phylogenetic history of the species. No associations between fitness and habitat parameters were detected. However, we found a trade-off between sensitivity to P-deficient diets and the maximum growth rate on a P-sufficient diet. In several cases, this trade-off helps to explain the association between species distribution and habitat parameters. We observed no correlation of the sensitivity to P limitation with the phylogenetic history of the genus Daphnia. Thus, we conclude that the differential responses among Daphnia species to variation in P content in food were driven mainly by adaptations to their local habitats, and are not constrained by deep evolutionary patterns.",M1
19735023,"Performance and bone mineralisation in broiler chicks fed on diets with different concentrations of cholecalciferol at a constant ratio of calcium to non-phytate <e>phosphorus</e>.1. An experiment was conducted with broiler female chicks (720) to study the effects of graded concentrations (75, 15, 225 or 30 microg/kg) of cholecalciferol (CC) in diets containing varying levels of calcium (Ca) and non-phytate phosphorus (NPP) at a 2:1 ratio (4:2, 5:25, 6:3 or 7:35 g/kg, respectively), on the performance (2-35 d of age), bone mineralisation and mineral (Ca, P, Mn, Fe, Cu) concentration in excreta. 2. Body weight gain, food intake, tibia density and tibia ash increased, and leg abnormality score decreased with dietary increase of CC from 75 to 30 microg at 4 g Ca and 2 g NPP. However, this improvement was not comparable with the birds receiving the highest concentrations of CC, Ca and NPP (30 microg, 7 g and 3.5 g, respectively/kg diet). 3. Significant improvements in the majority of parameters noted with increasing CC up to 225 microg at 5 g Ca and 25 g NPP/kg, which was comparable to those fed the highest levels of CC, Ca and NPP. 4. Concentrations of Ca, P, Mn, Fe and Cu in excreta decreased significantly with increasing CC at all Ca:NPP ratios tested. 5. The predicted requirement of CC for most of the parameters ranged between 1625 and 25 microg/kg diet at 5 g Ca and 25 g NPP. 6. Considering the performance, bone mineralisation, and mineral concentration in excreta, it can be concluded that Ca and NPP levels in broiler diet could be reduced to 5 and 25 g, respectively, while maintaining CC at 25 microg/kg.",M1
19628683,"<e>Phosphorus</e> and potassium content of enhanced meat and poultry products: implications for patients who receive dialysis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uncooked meat and poultry products are commonly enhanced by food processors using phosphate salts. The addition of potassium and phosphorus to these foods has been recognized but not quantified. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We measured the phosphorus, potassium, and protein content of 36 uncooked meat and poultry products: Phosphorus using the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) official method 984.27, potassium using AOAC official method 985.01, and protein using AOAC official method 990.03. RESULTS: Products that reported the use of additives had an average phosphate-protein ratio 28% higher than additive free products; the content ranged up to almost 100% higher. Potassium content in foods with additives varied widely; additive free products all contained &lt;387 mg/100 g, whereas five of the 25 products with additives contained at least 692 mg/100 g (maximum 930 mg/100 g). Most but not all foods with phosphate and potassium additives reported the additives (unquantified) on the labeling; eight of 25 enhanced products did not list the additives. The results cannot be applied to other products. The composition of the food additives used by food processors may change over time. CONCLUSIONS: Uncooked meat and poultry products that are enhanced may contain additives that increase phosphorus and potassium content by as much as almost two- and three-fold, respectively; this modification may not be discernible from inspection of the food label.",M1

Average levels of the major composition of kurut and FMCM, respectively, were as follows: total solid, 16.91+/-1.30 g/100 g and 12.65+/-1.14 g/100 g; fat, 6.83+/-1.18 g/100 g and 3.92+/-0.92 g/100 g; total protein, 4.93+/-0.36 g/100 g and 3.33+/-0.71 g/100 g; free amino acid, 8.57+/-3.22 mmol/l and 2.23+/-0.62 mmol/l; calcamin, 117.26+/-9.66 mg/100 g and 86.51+/-7.55 mg/100 g; and <e>phosphorus</e>, 109.28+/-7.97 mg/100 g and 78.86+/-6.99 mg/100 g. The average bacteria count of lactic acid bacteria in kurut and FMCM were 7.66+/-0.71 and 8.03+/-0.68 log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, respectively. Moreover, the average yeast counts of these two samples were 6.48+/-0.81 and 5.92+/-0.52 log cfu/ml, respectively. The result showed that the major nutritional composition content of kurut was significantly higher than that of FMCM, which indicated that kurut can be considered an invaluable fermentation product for human being.",M1
19468946,"Effect of buckwheat flour on cooking quality and some chemical, antinutritional and sensory properties of erişte, Turkish noodle.In this study, wheat flour used in erişte production was replaced with whole buckwheat flour (BWF) up to a 40% level to improve the nutritional properties of erişte. The chemical composition, phytic acid content, color values, cooking quality and sensory properties of erişte samples were determined. High levels of BWF in erişte formulation increased the ash, cellulose and fat content when compared with a control made by wheat flour. The 40% BWF supplementation instead of wheat flour decreased the starch content from 65.4% to 58.4%. Increasing the BWF level in the erişte sample resulted in an expected increase (P&lt;0.05) in the phytic acid content and potassium, magnesium and <e>phosphorus</e> amounts. Significant decreases were observed in water uptake and volume increase values with BWF addition levels over 20%. BWF gave darker erişte samples in color. erişte containing BWF up to a 25% level were appreciated by the panelists, especially in terms of overall acceptability.",M1

Eight barrows (mean BW 35.9 +/- 0.9 kg), fitted with simple T-cannulas at the terminal ileum, were either fed a low-P corn-soybean meal-based control diet or 75% of the control diet supplemented with 25% cellulose, starch or pectin according to a 4 x 3 Latin Square design. Both pectin and cellulose caused higher faecal than ileal P recoveries. Ileal volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels were more pronounced for the starch (p &lt; 0.05) rather than the cellulose and pectin treatments, whereas pectin resulted in a higher faecal VFA concentration in comparison to starch and cellulose (p &lt; 0.05). The differences in faecal VFA concentrations corresponded to the pH values obtained in faeces. The N content of MBM was higher (p &lt; 0.05) when cellulose was supplemented. Pectin caused a decrease in the P content of the MBM compared to the control (p &lt; 0.05). As a result, the N:P ratio was significantly higher for the pectin (N:P = 4.33) than for the control treatment (N:P = 2.63), while the Ca:P ratio remained constant for all treatments, suggesting changes in the accumulation of N, P and Ca in MBM, probably due to changes in the species composition and activity of the microflora.",M1
19376617,"Dietary <e>phosphorus</e> restriction in dialysis patients: potential impact of processed meat, poultry, and fish products as protein sources.BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of phosphorus is derived largely from protein sources and is a critical determinant of phosphorus balance in patients with chronic kidney disease. Information about the phosphorus content of prepared foods generally is unavailable, but it is believed to contribute significantly to the phosphorus burden of patients with chronic kidney disease. DESIGN: Analysis of dietary components. SETTING: We measured the phosphorus content of 44 food products, including 30 refrigerated or frozen precooked meat, poultry, and fish items, generally national brands. OUTCOMES: Measured and reported phosphorus content of foods. MEASUREMENTS: Phosphorus by using Association of Analytical Communities official method 984.27; protein by using Association of Analytical Communities official method 990.03. RESULTS: We found that the ratio of phosphorus to protein content in these items ranged from 6.1 to 21.5 mg of phosphorus per 1 g of protein. The mean ratio in the 19 food products with a label listing phosphorus as an additive was 14.6 mg/g compared with 9.0 mg/g in the 11 items without listed phosphorus. The phosphorus content of only 1 precooked food product was available in a widely used dietary database. LIMITATIONS: Results cannot be extrapolated to other products. Manufacturers also may alter the phosphorus content of foods at any time. Protein content was not directly measured for all foods. CONCLUSION: Better reporting of phosphorus content of foods by manufacturers could result in improved dietary phosphorus control without risk of protein malnutrition.",M1
19353365,"Minerals, phytic acid and tannin contents of 18 fruits from the Brazilian savanna.The present study evaluated the nutritious potential of 18 fruits, all native of the Brazilian Cerrado biome. Mineral contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission; phytic acid and tannin contents by a colorimetric and titrimetric method, respectively; and the potential mineral bioavailability by the molar ratio of phytic acid/mineral. Baru nut showed the highest zinc, copper, iron, <e>phosphorus</e> and magnesium content, and, together with macaúba, showed also the highest calcium content and caloric value. Macaúba, pitomba, ingá and murici fruits were classified as a source of iron. The jatoba and baru nut had the highest concentration of phytic acid and tannins. The [phytic acid]/[iron] and [phytic acid]/[zinc] molar ratios were higher than the critical values (14 and 10, respectively) only in the baru nuts, which suggests that iron and zinc bioavailability is low in this nut. The [phytic acid]/[calcium] molar ratios were lower than the critical value (1.56) in all analyzed fruits, which suggests that calcium is bioavailable in the fruits.",M1
19307656,"The effect of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> on bone development in dairy heifers.Phosphorus requirements, as percent of dietary dry matter for heifers (0.20-0.35%) and endogenous levels of P in feeds (0.20-0.35% of dry matter) are similar, suggesting that supplementation of P in heifer diets may be infrequently required. Because long-term studies are unavailable, 183 Holstein heifers and 182 Holstein x Jersey crossbred heifers were fed diets with (0.39%) and without (0.29%) supplemental P from 4 to 21 mo of age in a replicated pen design. Two subpopulations of heifers were selected mid-trial for intensive measurement of bone development and metabolism. Thirty-two heifers at 628 d (+/-10.0 d) of age, balanced by breed and diet, were evaluated for bone development. External frame measurements included hip height, length, heart girth, hip width, cannon bone circumference, pelvic length, pelvic height, and pelvic width. Tails of heifers were surgically amputated with the 13 and 14th coccygeal vertebrae retained. After tissue removal, the 13th coccygeal vertebrae were scanned using peripheral quantitative computed tomography with cortical, trabecular, and total bone densities determined. A second subpopulation (n = 64) of heifers (375 d +/- 33 d), balanced for breed and diet, were evaluated for serum pyridinoline and osteocalcin to assess systemic bone metabolism. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with breed, treatment, and their interaction in the model. External skeletal measurements revealed significant differences in hip height, hip width, heart girth, cannon bone circumference, and pelvic length between Holstein and crossbred heifers. Supplementing P had no effect on external frame measurements, bone density, or bone metabolism markers. Bone P content was lower (18.1 vs. 18.6%) in heifers fed no supplemental P. Data suggest P supplementation to heifers modestly increased bone P content but increased bone P was not reflected in frame growth, bone density, or bone metabolism.",M1
19169944,"An investigation on sources of potential minerals found in traditional vegetables of north-east India.The north-eastern region of India is endowed with a great wealth of plant genetic resources. Out of the vast floral diversity of the region, a large number of indigenous plant species and their wild forms constitute the routine vegetables of the inhabitants, which provide sufficient nutrients and medicinal values for the people. They seem to be quite healthy on average, even though the ethnic tribes are ignorant about the concept of balanced diet and healthcare. This paper describes the mineral (calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium and <e>phosphorus</e>) contents and chemical composition in percentages such as carbohydrate, protein, fat, and so forth, found in 15 traditional vegetable species collected from different parts of North-east India. The results of this study contribute to the knowledge on vitamin contents in these vegetables.

19129257,"Regulation of PTH mRNA stability by the calcimimetic R568 and the <e>phosphorus</e> binder lanthanum carbonate in CKD.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) mRNA stability that leads to increased PTH mRNA and serum PTH levels. PTH gene expression is reduced by the calcimimetic R568 and the oral phosphorus binder lanthanum carbonate (La). Changes in PTH mRNA stability are regulated by the binding of trans-acting stabilizing and destabilizing factors to a defined cis element in the PTH mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Adenosine-uridine (AU)-binding factor 1 (AUF1) is a PTH mRNA-stabilizing protein, and K-homology splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is a destabilizing protein that targets mRNAs, including PTH mRNA, to degradation by the ribonuclease complex exosome. We now show that KSRP-PTH mRNA binding is decreased in parathyroids from rats with adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) where PTH mRNA is more stable. KSRP-PTH mRNA binding is increased by treatment with both R568 and La, correlating with decreased PTH gene expression. In vitro degradation assays using transcripts for PTH mRNA and rat parathyroid extracts reproduce the differences in mRNA stability in vivo. Accordingly, PTH mRNA is destabilized in vitro by parathyroid extracts from CKD rats treated with R568 or La compared with parathyroid extracts from untreated CKD rats. This destabilizing effect of R568 and La is dependent on KSRP and the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR. Therefore, the calcimimetic R568 and correction of serum phosphorus by La determine PTH mRNA stability through KSRP-mediated recruitment of a degradation complex to the PTH mRNA, thereby decreasing PTH expression.",M1
19098254,"Effect of feeding reduced crude protein and <e>phosphorus</e> diets on weaning-finishing pig growth performance, carcass characteristics, and bone characteristics.Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of feeding a corn- and soybean meal-based diet (control) or a low nutrient excretion (LNE) diet, formulated with reduced dietary CP and additional synthetic AA, low phytic acid corn, and phytase, on pig growth performance during the grower (BW=32 to 77 kg) and finisher (BW=78 to 126 kg) periods and on carcass and bone characteristics at slaughter. Pigs (32+/-1.3 kg of BW, Exp. 1; 6.7+/-0.27 kg of BW, Exp. 2) were blocked by sex and BW and randomly allotted to a control or LNE diet. Pigs were housed in 4 rooms during the nursery period and in 2 rooms during the grower and finisher periods, with individual and identical ventilation systems. Pigs were phase fed 3 nursery diets for 5 wk (Exp. 2) and phase fed 2 grower and 2 finisher diets for 16 wk (Exp. 1 and 2). Pigs were housed 4 or 5 pigs/pen with 9 pens x sex(-1) x treatment(-1) during the nursery period and 4 or 5 pigs/pen with 5 pens x sex(-1) x treatment(-1) in the grower phase and 2 or 3 pigs/pen in the finisher phase. Individual BW and pen feed disappearance were recorded weekly in the nursery period and every 2 wk in the grower-finisher period. Pigs were scanned ultrasonically at d 34 of the nursery period and wk 8 and 16 of the grower-finisher period to determine backfat depths and LM area. Ten pigs x sex(-1) x treatment(-1) were slaughtered at wk 16 of each experiment to determine carcass characteristics. Overall growth performance was not different during each experiment. However, nursery G:F (control=0.65; LNE=0.60), grower ADG (Exp. 1 and 2), and grower G:F (Exp. 2) were reduced (P&lt;0.05) when the LNE diets were fed. Diet had no effect on 10th-rib carcass data in either experiment. Metatarsal bone ash percentage was reduced (P&lt;0.05) when the LNE diets were consumed in both experiments. Feeding LNE diets resulted in the maintenance of overall growth performance, bone variables, and carcass characteristics. However, further refinements are still required in the nursery and grower phases of pig production to optimize LNE diet use by the swine industry.",M1
19093243,"Effects of reduced dietary calcium and phytase supplementation on calcium and <e>phosphorus</e> utilisation in broilers with modified mineral status.1. The impact of modified mineral status and dietary Ca:P ratio on Ca and P utilisation was measured in chicks with or without phytase supplementation. 2. In a preliminary study, 4 diets were given to chicks from 3 to 15 d of age: D1 (6.5 g P/kg and Ca:P = 1.5) and D2, D3 and D4 (6.0, 5.4 and 5.0 g P/kg, respectively, and Ca:P = 1.2). Growth performance was similar across diets. Tibia ash was similar in chicks given D1 and D2, but was gradually depressed from D2 to D4 (-22%). 3. In the depletion period, two groups of chicks, with similar performance, but with different mineral status were achieved by feeding them, from 5 to 15 d of age, diets with a similar Ca:P ratio of 1.2, but containing 6.3 or 5.2 g P/kg. 4. During the subsequent 11 d of the repletion period, chicks from each of the two previous groups were given one of the 4 diets containing 5.7 g P/kg, but differing in their Ca (8.3 and 5.3 g Ca/kg) and microbial phytase (0 or 1000 FTU, Natuphos levels in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. 5. At the end of the repletion period, the initially depleted chicks could not be differentiated from the non-depleted chicks, indicating the capacity of chicks to compensate for their initial depleted mineral status. 6. Interaction between dietary Ca and phytase levels was not significant. Phytase improved growth performance and bone characteristics. Reduced dietary Ca enhanced feed intake and growth rate, but depressed bone dry matter and ash weight. 7. At the end, diets supplemented with phytase maximised bone ash weight when chicks were fed with a Ca:P ratio of 1.5 but elicited the highest growth rate when chicks were fed with a Ca:P ratio of 0.9.",M1

Eight isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets were formulated to contain graded levels of dietary phosphorus (dP), i.e., T(1), 0.1%; T(2), 0.3%; T(3), 0.5%; T(4), 0.7%; T(5), 0.9%; T(6), 1.1%; T(7), 1.3%; or T(8), 1.5%. Four hundred and eighty fish (average weight 4.23 +/- 0.016 g) were equally distributed into 24 tanks forming eight treatments with three replicates each. The fish were fed daily at the rate of 3.5% body weight in two instalments. At the end of feeding trial fish were sampled to study total RBC and WBC count, haemoglobin, serum lysozyme activity, serum total protein, albumin (A), globulin (G) concentration and HSP70 expression. Total RBC count, haemoglobin concentration and serum lysozyme activity did not vary significantly in response to different dietary phosphorus concentrations. Total WBC count was found to be significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in T(1 )relative to all other treatments. Serum albumin and A/G ratio was found to be significantly lower in fish of T(1) and T(2) in relation to T(7) group (P &lt; 0.05). Serum globulin and total protein levels remained unaffected by variations in dietary phosphorus. HSP70 expression was observed in T(1) group (0.1% dP) in gills and brain tissue, but not in liver and muscle tissues. No HSP70 expression was observed in fish of T(4) (0.7% dP) and T(8) (1.5% dP) treatments. These prima facie results suggest that dietary phosphorus had only minor influence on the haemato-biochemical parameters studied; however dietary phosphorus deficiency caused organ specific induction of HSP70 in catla fingerlings.",M1
18828130,"[Altered calcium-<e>phosphorus</e> metabolism and low-protein diet]Many metabolic disorders associated with uremia can affect the long-term survival of patients with chronic kidney disease. Such disorders can be defined as: hypocalcemia, increased levels of phosphorus, reduced synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and serum calcitriol, and reduced expression of vitamin D receptors on parathyroid cells with increased parathyroid hormone levels and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Phosphorus, which plays a crucial role in the progression of progressive renal disease, has been shown to be an independent risk factor for death in hemodialysis patients. Thus, reducing the phosphorus intake by decreasing dietary proteins may slow the progression of renal disease. Hypocalcemia is typically associated with chronic kidney disease. It is due to the reduced intestinal absorption of calcium and the spontaneously reduced protein intake that occur in patients with progressive renal disorders. Activated vitamin D and calcium supplements should be administered to patients who are following low-protein diets to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism; the doses should be correlated with actual renal function and protein intake.",M1
18721742,"Fast food, <e>phosphorus</e>-containing additives, and the renal diet.OBJECTIVE: Fast food is commonly consumed by hemodialysis patients, but many menu items are not compatible with renal diets because of their sodium, potassium, or phosphorus content. Moreover, the phosphorus content of fast foods is difficult for patients to estimate, because phosphorus-containing additives are commonly added to many fast foods. We sought to determine how many fast-food entrees and side dishes are compatible with renal diets. METHODS: We examined nutrition-facts labels and ingredient lists provided by 15 fast-food chains. Each entree and side dish was first assessed according to traditional criteria (limited sodium, potassium, and naturally occurring phosphorus content), and then according to the presence of a phosphorus -containing additive. RESULTS: Of 804 total entrees across all restaurants, 415 (52%) were acceptable according to traditional criteria, but only 128 (16%) were also free of phosphorus-containing additives. Of 163 total side dishes, 37 (23%) were acceptable according to traditional criteria, and 27 (17%) were also free of phosphorus-containing additives. There were no acceptable entrees at 3 chains, and no acceptable side dishes at 5 chains. CONCLUSION: Only a small proportion of fast-food entrees and side dishes are compatible with renal diets. The widespread use of phosphorus-containing additives is a major impediment to the availability of acceptable fast-food choices for hemodialysis patients. We recommend limiting the use of phosphorus-containing additives, and including phosphorus content in nutrition-facts labels.",M1

In Experiment 1, broilers fed corn-soy basal diet [0.7% Ca, 0.4% total P (TP), and 0.12% nonphytate P (NPP)] with 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 5,000 FTU of phytase/kg diet produced PP hydrolysis (%) of 43.12, 68.12, 74.7, 85.02, 85.25 92.77, 96.91, and 99.45, respectively. In Experiment 2, broilers fed corn-soy basal (0.5% Ca and 0.17% PP) without added phytase and 0.08, 0.13, 0.18, 0.23, 0.28, 0.33, 0.38, and 0.45% NPP had PP hydrolysis (%) of 8.5, 27.6, 26.4, 28.9, 26.3, 17.1, 21.0, and 27.7, respectively. Broilers fed the same 0.5% Ca basal and NPP concentrations with 1,000 FTU of phytase/kg of diet increased (P &lt; 0.05) PP hydrolysis (%) to 80.9, 75.9, 73.5, 72.2, 68.4, 71.6, 58.3, and 62.5, respectively. Experiment 3 was conducted in the same way as Experiment 2 but Ca was maintained at 0.9% for all diets. Phytate P hydrolysis (%) without addition of phytase in 0.08, 0.13, 0.18, 0.23, 0.28, 0.33, 0.38, and 0.45% NPP-fed groups was 49.2, 19.6, 16.0, 8.0, 9.4, 2.1, 4.0, and 4.2, respectively. The addition of phytase increased (P &lt; 0.05) PP hydrolysis (%) to 85.3, 76.1, 70.0, 76.1, 62.6, 68.6, 67.4, and 63.7, respectively. In conclusion, these studies indicated near-complete hydrolysis (99.45%) of PP at greater dietary phytase (5,000 FTU/kg) supplementation, but maximum TP retention was obtained with only 1,000 FTU of added phytase. Maximum PP hydrolysis occurred for broilers fed diets with 1,000 FTU added phytase when the diets contained the lowest concentration (0.08%) of dietary NPP with either 0.5 or 0.9% dietary Ca concentrations. These data also suggest that broilers fed 0.9% dietary Ca have a greater P physiological threshold before a loss in retention compared with broilers fed lower (0.5%) dietary Ca concentrations with no dietary phytase supplementation.",M1
18635911,"Role of low protein and low <e>phosphorus</e> diet in the progression of chronic kidney disease in uremic rats.Restriction of dietary protein is useful for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients to protect residual renal function. However, the mechanism by which a low protein diet confers a beneficial effect in CKD patients remains unknown. One possibility is that the benefit from a low protein diet is associated with phosphorus restriction. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of protein and phosphorus on the progression of renal insufficiency using irreversible Thy1 rats, which histopathologically resemble IgA nephropathy. Irreversible Thy1 rats were fed six types of isocaloric diets consisting of three levels of protein (16.9, 12.6, and 8.4%) and two levels of phosphorus (0.5 and 0.3%) for 13 wk. Renal function was assessed biochemically and histopathologically. The low phosphorus (0.3%) diets showed protection of residual renal function regardless of dietary protein content in uremic rats. With the normal phosphorus (0.5%) diets, however, only the very low protein (8.4%) diet showed a beneficial effect, indicating that dietary phosphorus is a more important factor that affects the progression of renal insufficiency than dietary protein in this model. Furthermore, the low phosphorus diet also prevented an increase in serum parathyroid hormone, indicating that a low phosphorus diet might have beneficial effects not only for residual renal function but also for renal osteodystrophy, a typical complication of patients with CKD.",M1

The source of sufficient calcium is browse. The source of necessary phosphorus is obscure, but it could be osteophagia, a frequently observed behaviour in giraffes. We have assessed whether bone ingested as a result of osteophagia can be digested in the rumen. Bone samples from cancellous (cervical vertebrae) and dense bones (metacarpal shaft) were immersed in the rumens of five sheep, for a period of up to 30 days, and the effect compared to immersion in distilled water and in artificial saliva for 30 days. Distilled water had no effect on the bones. Dense bone samples were softened by exposure to the saliva and rumen fluid, but did not lose either calcium or phosphorus. In saliva and rumen fluid the cancellous bone samples also softened, and their mass and volume decreased as a result of exposure to saliva, but in neither fluid did they lose significant amounts of calcium and phosphorus. We conclude that although saliva and rumen fluid can soften ingested bones, there is an insignificant digestion of bones in the rumen.",M1

We examined the significance of dietary P to performance in fifth-instar nymphs of the grasshopper Melanoplus bivittatus fed artificial diets. Consumption, digestion, developmental rate, and growth in response to different levels of P nested within standard-Protein and carbohydrate diets were determined. Developmental rate was slowest on high-P diets; protein:carbohydrate concentration and P in diets affected frass production and consumption. Approximate digestibility and conversion of digested food were primarily influenced by the protein:carbohydrate quality of the diet but not P. Mass gain was marginally lower in the low-Protein:high carbohydrate diet used in this study. At the individual level, other than small effects to developmental rate at high concentrations for M. bivittatus, dietary P otherwise seems to have little effect on nymphal performance. To the degree that it is important, effects of dietary P depend on the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate in the diet.",M1

The purposes of this study were to compare nutrient intakes and body measures among children and adolescents drinking flavored milk (with or without plain milk), exclusively plain milk, and no milk. DESIGN: Data used in the study included intakes reported in 24-hour dietary recalls and height and weight measurements collected during a physical examination in the 1999--2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The milk drinking status of each person was identified, and nutrient intakes and body mass index (BMI) measures were determined by milk drinking status. SUBJECTS: The study population included 7,557 children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparisons among mean milk intakes, energy and nutrient intakes, and BMI measures by milk drinking status were completed using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Children and adolescents who included flavored milk in their diets reported higher total milk intakes than consumers of exclusively plain milk (P&lt;0.05). Intakes of vitamin A, calcium, <e>phosphorus</e>, magnesium, potassium, and saturated fat (adjusted for energy intake and age) were generally comparable among milk drinking groups, whereas intakes by milk nondrinkers were significantly lower (P&lt;0.05). Among females aged 12 to 18 years, calcium intakes by flavored and exclusively plain milk drinkers were 992+/-41.5 and 1,038+/-22.5 mg/day, respectively, whereas intake by nondrinkers was 576+/-11.7 mg/day. Intake of added sugars did not differ between flavored milk drinkers and milk nondrinkers. BMI measures of milk drinkers were comparable to or lower than measures of nondrinkers (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that consumption of either flavored or plain milk is associated with a positive influence on nutrient intakes by children and adolescents and is not associated with adverse effects on BMI measures.",M1
18344312,"The effect of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> and calcium level, phytase supplementation, and ileal infusion of pectin on the chemical composition and carbohydrase activity of fecal bacteria and the level of microbial metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.Two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary P and Ca level, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on ileal and fecal P and Ca balance, chemical composition of fecal mixed bacterial mass (MBM), and bacterial metabolic activity. Pigs (initial BW = 30 kg) were fitted with simple T-cannulas at the distal ileum. They were fed a low-P corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of P/kg) or the control diet supplemented with monocalcium phosphate (MCP; 7 g of P/kg; Exp. 1) or 1,000 FTU phytase/kg (Exp. 2). The daily infusion treatments consisted of 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 L of demineralized water or 1.8 L of demineralized water as the control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. In each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double, incomplete 4 x 2 Latin square. The dietary treatments in Exp. 1 were the control (Con-) diet with water infusion; the control (Con+) diet with pectin infusion; the MCP diet with water infusion; and the MCP diet with pectin infusion. In Exp. 2, the pigs received the same Con- and Con+ treatments as in Exp. 1 and, in addition, the phytase-supplemented diet in combination with water or pectin infusion. After a 15-d adaptation period, feces were collected for 5 d followed by ileal digesta collection for 24 h. In Exp. 1, supplemental MCP increased (P &lt;/= 0.003) ileal and fecal P and Ca recovery as well as P and Ca content of the MBM. Pectin infusion increased the N content of the MBM (P = 0.054) and polygalacturonase activity (P = 0.032) in feces. In addition, pectin decreased (P = 0.049) ileal and tended (P &lt; 0. 079) to increase fecal VFA concentrations. In Exp. 2, phytase decreased ileal and fecal P recovery (P &lt; 0.001) and the P content of the MBM (P = 0.045), whereas the N content of the MBM (P = 0.094) and fecal cellulase activity (P = 0.089) tended to decrease. Similarly, pectin infusion decreased (P = 0.036) fecal cellulase activity but increased (P &lt; 0.001) polygalacturonase activity. In conclusion, these data indicate that bacterial P and Ca assimilation and metabolic activity depend on P and Ca availability in the large intestine and on the availability of fermentable substrate, such as pectin. Thus, increasing dietary P and Ca levels increases bacterial P and Ca assimilation due to greater intestinal P and Ca availability, whereas decreasing intestinal P availability for bacteria through phytase addition to low-P diets reduces bacterial P incorporation and seems to decrease bacterial activity.",M1
18329301,"Milk fever in dairy cows: a review of pathophysiology and control principles.The periparturient or transition period of 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after calving is characterised by a greatly increased risk of disease. Hypocalcaemia around calving is a risk factor for many of these diseases and is an indirect risk factor for increased culling. The incidence of clinical hypocalcaemia (milk fever) in the field generally ranges from 0-10%, but may exceed 25% of cows calving. In research trials conducted on milk fever the incidence has approached 80% of cows calving. Homeostasis of calcium (Ca) is regulated by calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D(3). Age increases the risk of milk fever by approximately 9% per lactation. Control of milk fever has revolved around stimulation of homeostatic mechanisms through feeding a pre-calving diet low in Ca. More recently, the role of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) in the prevention of Ca disorders has been examined, both by field research and meta-analysis. The most appropriate form of the DCAD equation has been contentious, but recent meta-analyses have shown that the equation (Na(+)+K(+))-(Cl(-)+S(2-)) is most effective for predicting milk fever risk. Decreased risk of milk fever is linear with DCAD, whereas the effect of DCAD on urinary pH is curvilinear. A pivotal role of providing dietary magnesium (Mg) before calving has been confirmed by meta-analysis, and a quadratic effect of Ca on milk fever risk was found with a peak occurring with dietary levels of 1.1-1.3% of dry matter. Risks of milk fever increase with increased dietary <e>phosphorus</e> (P) fed pre-calving and with increasing days of exposure to a pre-calving diet. Meta-analysis has revealed that the important roles of dietary Ca, Mg and P, as well as the duration of exposure to the pre-calving diet in milk fever control strategies are independent of DCAD. Studies on the effect of exposure to well designed pre-calving diets have shown that substantial improvements in production, reproduction and animal health can be made but further examination of the influence of the period of exposure to different diets is warranted.",M1
18281570,"Interaction of calcium and phytate in broiler diets. 1. Effects on apparent prececal digestibility and retention of <e>phosphorus</e>.Phytate P utilization from soybean meal (SBM) included in broiler diets has been shown to be poor and highly dependent on dietary Ca intake. However, the effect of Ca on P utilization and on the optimal ratio of Ca to nonphytate P (Ca:NPP) when diets contained varying levels of phytate has not been clearly shown and was the objective of this research. A factorial treatment structure was used with 4 dietary Ca levels from 0.47 to 1.16% and 3 levels of phytate P (0.28, 0.24, and 0.10%). Varying dietary phytate P levels were obtained by utilizing SBM produced from 3 varieties of soybeans with different phytate P concentrations. Ross 508 broiler chicks were fed 1 of 12 diets from 16 to 21 d of age. Excreta were collected from 16 to 17 d and from 19 to 20 d of age and ileal digesta was collected at 21 d of age. Apparent prececal P digestibility decreased when dietary Ca concentration increased and was higher when diets contained low-phytate SBM. The apparent digestibility of Ca and percentage of phytate P hydrolysis at the distal ileum were not reduced when dietary phytate P concentration increased. Including low-phytate SBM in diets reduced total P output in the excreta by 49% compared with conventional SBM. The optimum ratio of Ca:NPP that resulted in the highest P retention and lowest P excretion was 2.53:1, 2.40:1, and 2.34:1 for diets with 0.28, 0.24, and 0.10% phytate P. These data suggested that increased dietary Ca reduced the extent of phytate P hydrolysis and P digestibility and that the optimum Ca:NPP ratio at which P retention was maximized was reduced when diets contained less phytate P.",M1
18250363,"Dietary <e>phosphorus</e> and blood pressure: international study of macro- and micro-nutrients and blood pressure.Raised blood pressure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; improved nutritional approaches to population-wide prevention are required. Few data are available on dietary phosphorus and blood pressure and none are available on possible combined effects of phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium on blood pressure. The International Study of Macro- and Micro-Nutrients and Blood Pressure is a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of 4680 men and women ages 40 to 59 from 17 population samples in Japan, China, United Kingdom, and United States. Blood pressure was measured 8 times at 4 visits. Dietary intakes were obtained from four 24-hour recalls plus data on supplement use. Dietary phosphorus was inversely associated with blood pressure in a series of predefined multiple regression models, with the successive addition of potential confounders, both nondietary and dietary. Estimated blood pressure differences per 232 mg/1000 kcal (2 SD) of higher dietary phosphorus were -1.1 to -2.3 mm Hg systolic/-0.6 to -1.5 mm Hg diastolic (n=4680) and -1.6 to -3.5 mm Hg systolic/-0.8 to -1.8 mm Hg diastolic for 2238  nonintervened  individuals, ie, those without special diet/nutritional supplements or diagnosis/treatment for cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Dietary calcium and magnesium, correlated with phosphorus (partial r=0.71 and r=0.68), were inversely associated with blood pressure. Blood pressures were lower by 1.9 to 4.2 mm Hg systolic/1.2 to 2.4 mm Hg diastolic for people with intakes above versus below country-specific medians for all 3 of the minerals. These results indicate the potential for increased phosphorus/mineral intake to lower blood pressure as part of the recommendations for healthier eating patterns for the prevention and control of prehypertension and hypertension.",M1
18156343,"Effect of low doses of Aspergillus niger phytase on growth performance, bone strength, and nutrient absorption and excretion by growing and finishing swine fed corn-soybean meal diets deficient in available <e>phosphorus</e> and calcium.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of low doses of Aspergillus niger (AN) phytase for growing and finishing pigs fed corn-soybean meal (SBM) diets with narrow Ca:P ratios that were about 0.9 g/kg deficient in available P and Ca. Experiment 1 utilized 120 pigs with an early finisher period from 51.5 +/- 0.2 to 89.7 +/- 0.9 kg of BW and a late finisher period that ended at 122.5 +/- 2.0 kg of BW. During each period, treatments were the low-P diets with 0, 150, 300, or 450 units (U) of AN phytase added/kg of diet, and a positive control (PC) diet. There were linear increases (P &lt; or = 0.001) in bone strength and ash weight, the absorption of P (g/d and %) and Ca (%), and overall ADG (P = 0.01) with increasing concentration of AN phytase. Pigs fed the diets with 150, 300, or 450 U of AN phytase/kg did not differ from pigs fed the PC diet in growth performance overall, and pigs fed the diets with 300 or 450 U of AN phytase did not differ in P and Ca absorption (g/d) or bone ash weight from pigs fed the PC diet. However, only pigs fed the diet with 450 U of AN phytase/kg had bone strength similar to that of pigs fed the PC diet. Experiment 2 utilized 120 pigs in a grower phase from 25.3 +/- 0.1 to 57.8 +/- 0.8 kg of BW and a finisher phase that ended at 107.6 +/- 1.0 kg of BW. Treatments were the low-P diet with AN phytase added at 300, 500, or 700 U/kg of grower diet, and 150, 250, or 350 U/kg of finisher diet, respectively, resulting in treatments AN300/150, AN500/250, and AN700/350. Growth performance and the absorption (g/d) of P and Ca for the grower and finisher phases were not different for pigs fed the diets containing AN phytase and pigs fed the PC diets. However, pigs fed the PC diets excreted more fecal P (g/d, P &lt; or = 0.01) during the grower and more P and Ca (g/d, P &lt; 0.001) during the finisher phases than the pigs fed the diets with phytase. There were linear increases (P &lt; or = 0.05) in bone strength and bone ash weight with increasing concentration of AN phytase. However, pigs fed the PC diets had a greater bone strength and bone ash weight than pigs fed diets AN300/150, AN500/250 (P &lt; or = 0.02), or AN700/350 (P &lt; or = 0.08). There were no treatment responses for N or DM digestibility in either experiment. Phytase supplementation reduced fecal P excretion from 16 to 38% and fecal Ca excretion from 21 to 42% in these experiments. In conclusion, 450 U of AN phytase/kg was effective in replacing 0.9 g of the inorganic P/kg of corn-SBM diet for finishing swine based on bone strength, whereas 300 or 150 U of AN phytase/kg of diet maintained growth performance of grower or finisher pigs, respectively.",M1
18096946,"<e>Phosphorus</e> utilization and environmental and economic implications of reducing phosphorus pollution from Ontario dairy cows.A major source of environmental pollution has been overfeeding P to dairy cows, caused by the  safety margins  added to diets in order not to compromise the health and production of animals. An extant whole-animal model was evaluated using an experiment conducted in Ontario to assess its applicability for predicting P excretion. The objective of the study was to use the model to estimate P excretion levels and the economic and environmental implications of implementing mitigating options by following recommendations from studies that have reported sufficient levels of P inclusion in the diet. Mean square prediction error and concordance coefficient analysis showed that the overall predictions were close to the mean and that there was only a slight underprediction of fecal P output by the model. The majority of the error was random, with only 8.9% coming from error caused by deviation from the regression line, and the model did not show a systematic trend of over- or underprediction. The model was then used to predict P excretion in Ontario by using diets commonly fed to dairy cows on Ontario farms. It is estimated that Ontario dairy farms produce 7 kt of P annually at current levels of P inclusion in the diet. Reducing P levels from the current 0.41% P of dry matter to 0.35% is estimated to save producers CAN $20/cow per year and the environment 1.3 kt/yr without impairing cow health or productivity. Additionally, the reductions might be from inorganic P sources added to the feed, which are more polluting than organic sources because of their water-soluble nature and liability to leaching and runoff.",M1
18034683,"The aetiology of spinal deformity in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L.: influence of different commercial diets on the incidence and severity of the preclinical condition in salmon parr under two contrasting husbandry regimes.A large-scale trial of the effect of different commercial diets on the incidence of preclinical spinal deformation, as assessed by radiography, and the influence of two contrasting rearing systems was carried out. Two sets of three populations of Atlantic salmon, each of 20 000 first feeding fry of identical hatchery origin, created from equal numbers of eggs from 15 different families, were reared under commercial conditions on two different farms. Three commercial (closed formula) extruded fish meal-based diets were used in this study (diets A, B &amp; C). Each diet was fed to one population of 20 000 fish at each site. Fish were fed a percentage of their body weight per day, with feeding rates set at commercial levels, based on water temperature, day length and fish biomass. Additional hand feeding was used to ensure satiation in all tanks. Fish in each tank were bulk-weighed and counted at the beginning and at 2-week intervals throughout the study. The fish were grown for 30 weeks. In addition, <e>phosphorus</e> (P) digestibility was evaluated by in-feed absorption testing in rainbow trout. The morphology of the radiographic lesions conformed to those described previously. Statistical analysis using multivariate regression analysis showed that date of sampling, site and diet were all statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) on univariable analysis. Farm A had significantly more affected fish than farm B (P &lt; 0.001), which may have been attributable to variation in dissolved oxygen levels. The available dietary P levels were low in each diet. The number of fish affected in the group of fish being fed diet B was significantly lower than in the groups being fed diets A or C (P &lt; 0.001). It appears most likely that the occurrence of preclinical radiographically apparent defects in parr which are believed to lead to the condition known as 'spinal deformity' is predominantly caused by a deficiency of available dietary P in first-feeding fry. The availability of dietary P may also vary considerably between diets formulated using different ingredients. Phytate-P associated with plant ingredients may affect the availability of P as well as other essential dietary nutrients. Additionally, diets for the production of salmonids in fresh water are currently formulated to keep P effluent to a minimum compatible with healthy spinal development. These various factors combine to make it crucial that small Atlantic salmon, especially first-feeding fry, are provided with carefully formulated diets fortified to an adequate level with a high quality source of available P.",M1

Four cheese samples were manufactured using starter culture at different whey pH values [(A) 6.2, (B) 5.9, (C) 5.6, and (D) 5.3] and analyzed on the 1st, 28th, and 56th day. Ash, calcium, and <e>phosphorus</e> concentrations decreased as the whey pH at drainage was lowered. Cheese yield and calcium recovery were the highest in D cheeses. During storage, expressible serum levels decreased and nonexpressible serum levels increased, indicating an increase in the water holding capacity of the cheeses. Reducing the calcium content of cheeses increased meltability values, but an overly low calcium level (D cheeses) had an adverse effect on the meltability. The melting properties of cheese samples, except D cheeses, were improved with aging. A cheeses were the hardest and D cheeses the softest throughout storage. The 1st day sensory evaluations revealed that C and D cheeses were preferred and that A cheeses were not. All sensory properties of A cheeses were improved with storage. D cheeses were rated inferior to the others at the end of the storage time.",M1

Layers were grouped randomly into 5 treatments, with 8 replicates per treatment and 8 layers per replicate. The 5 diets consisted of a positive control diet with adequate Ca (3.30%), total P (0.50%), and nonphytate P (NPP; 0.28%), and a negative control diet with Ca reduced by 0.12%, total P reduced by 0.14%, NPP reduced by 0.13%, and 3 phytases (phytase A derived from Aspergillus niger, and phytases B and C derived from Escherichia coli) supplemented at 300 phytase units/kg of feed, respectively. Egg production and feed intake were recorded daily, and eggshell quality and ileal nutrient digestibility were measured at the end of a 6-wk feeding period. The results revealed that the reduction of Ca and P from the positive control diet significantly depressed feed intake, egg mass, eggshell hardness, and the digestibility of N, Ca, P, and amino acids (P &lt; 0.05). Phytase supplementation in the negative control diet improved the digestibility of P and Ca by 11.08 and 9.81% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, whereas it improved the digestibility of amino acids by 2 to 8% (P &lt; 0.05). However, the digestibility of most amino acids was not restored to the levels of the positive control diet by the application of phytases. Supplementing phytases in the negative control diet improved the rate of lay, egg mass, and egshell quality to the levels of birds fed the positive control diet. These results suggest that supplementing phytases can improve the digestibility not only of Ca and P, but also of amino acids in layers fed a corn-, soybean-, and by-product-based diet.",M1

17638981,"Economic and <e>phosphorus</e>-related effects of precision feeding and forage management at a farm scale.Structural best management practices were implemented throughout the Cannonsville Reservoir Watershed (CRW) in an effort to reduce P losses to the reservoir. Yet long-term water quality control efforts within CRW are hindered by continuous P build-up in the soils resulting from dairy farm P imports exceeding exports. Addressing the P imbalance problems and maintaining economic viability of the farms requires a system-level redesign of farm management. One possible innovative strategy, precision feed management (PFM), reduces soil-P build-up by limiting feed and fertilizer purchases, and increasing high-quality homegrown forage production. This study applied the integrated farm system model (IFSM) to 2 CRW dairy farms to quantify the benefits of a PFM farm planning strategy in controlling P imbalance problems, and maintaining farm profit-ability and reducing off-farm P losses. The IFSM accurately simulated the 2 farms based on farm data supplied by farm planners; these scenarios were used as the baseline conditions. The IFSM simulations of more accurate feeding of P (based on P required in animal diets) integrated with increased productivity of grass-forage and increased proportion of forage in the diet reduced the P imbalance of 1 farm from 5.3 to 0.5 kg/ ha and from 9.6 to 0.0 kg/ha for the second farm. For both farms, soluble P lost to the environment was reduced by 18%. Feed supplement purchases declined by 7.5 kg/cow per year for dietary mineral P, and by 1.04 and 1.29 t/cow per year for protein concentrates through adoption of the PFM system. Moreover, when a land management practice of converting corn to grass was coupled with the precision feeding of P and improved forage management, IFSM predicted reductions of 5.8 and 9.3 kg/ha of converted land sediment-bound P in erosion loss each year. The model predicted slight purchase increases in corn grain to offset reductions in corn silage production and feeding rates, but no appreciable change in the farm P balance due to land conversion. The model-based studies conducted on a farm-by-farm basis complement farm planning efforts in exploring innovative farming systems. Moreover, the results set a benchmark for potential benefits of PFM strategies, economically and environmentally.",M1
17635818,"<e>Phosphorus</e> homeostasis in normal health and in chronic kidney disease patients with special emphasis on dietary phosphorus intake.Elevated serum phosphorus has been identified as a cardiovascular risk factor in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and a clear understanding of phosphorus homeostasis is very important for practicing nephrologists. At any particular point, serum phosphorus levels reflect the balance between movements of this mineral from and into the intestine, bone, intracellular space, and kidneys. We briefly review here all these exchanges with a particular emphasis on dietary phosphorus intake. Despite all the oral phosphorus binders currently available in the market, dietary restriction of this mineral remains a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia. An effective restriction of dietary intake of phosphorus requires prescription of a moderate protein intake (0.9-1.0 g/kg/day) and restricted consumption of highly processed fast and convenience foods. Phosphorus added during food processing is an important source of this mineral because of its magnitude and high bioavailabilty. Moreover, as food manufacturers are not required to label the amount of phosphorus added during food processing, a significant amount of the current daily phosphorus intake remains unaccounted when estimating phosphorus intake in CKD patients. The recent development of low phosphorus-containing food products represents a very useful addition for CKD patients.",M1
17635817,"Phosphate metabolism in the setting of chronic kidney disease: significance and recommendations for treatment.<e>Phosphorus</e> is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in cell structure and metabolism. In living organisms, phosphorus exists surrounded by four oxygen atoms to form phosphate (PO(4)). Within cells, PO(4) regulates enzymatic activity and serves as an essential component of nucleic acids, adenosine triphosphate, and phospholipid membranes. Outside cells, PO(4) primarily resides in bone and teeth as hydroxyapatite. A small amount of inorganic PO(4) circulates in serum, with levels balanced by gastrointestinal intake, renal excretion, and a set of specific hormones. Under normal conditions, PO(4) is excreted through the kidneys. Among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving chronic dialysis, circulating PO(4) levels typically rise to levels well above the normal laboratory range. Higher serum PO(4) levels are strongly associated with arterial calcification and mortality in this setting. Among predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), phosphaturic hormones enhance renal PO(4) excretion to maintain serum PO(4) levels within the high-normal laboratory range. Recently, high-normal serum PO(4) levels have been associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality among individuals who have CKD and among those who have normal kidney function. This review discusses PO(4) metabolism in the context of CKD, examines associations of PO(4) levels with adverse outcomes in the CKD setting, and suggests treatment strategies for moderating serum PO(4) levels.",M1
17615001,"Influence of different <e>phosphorus</e> levels and phytase supplementation in gestation diets on sow performance.A total of 104 sows of different parities were studied. They were fed four diets with different phosphorus (P) levels during gestation for two reproductive cycles, while the same diet was fed during lactation. The aim was to decrease the total P level in the diet during gestation and to evaluate the effect on sow performance. The gestation treatments were low P (LP-; 3.7 g P/kg feed), low P with phytase (LP+, Ronozyme P; 765 FTU/kg feed), medium P (MP; 4.5 g P/kg feed) and high P (HP; 6.0 g P/kg feed). Daily feed allowances were 2.6 kg during gestation and 9.2 kg during lactation. Number of born piglets and piglet mortality were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the LP treatments than in the MP and HP treatments. No difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the numbers of live-born piglets, piglet birthweights, sow weights or piglet weight gains was found between the treatments. Phosphorus level in sow milk was the highest (p &lt; 0.05) in the MP treatment, while no effects (p &gt; 0.05) of treatment were found on milk Ca levels, P and Ca levels in serum of sows and piglets, nor on the analysed mineral, fat and protein contents of piglets. The estimated average requirement of P for the entire gestation period was 4.4-4.5 g/day. In conclusion, a reduction of dietary total P content during gestation did not result in negative effects on sow or piglet performance. This suggests that it should be possible to lower the dietary P content for gestating sows, compared with earlier recommendations, and thereby reduce the environmental P pollution.",M1
17600739,"Effect of pre-calving zeolite, magnesium and <e>phosphorus</e> supplementation on periparturient serum mineral concentrations.The objective of this study was to test whether supplementing dry cow rations with phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) would interfere with the beneficial effect of zeolite supplementation on the periparturient blood calcium (Ca) concentration in dairy cattle. Three groups (A-C) of 10 Danish Jersey cows were each given the following daily supplements from 2 weeks before the expected date of calving until actual calving: group A: zeolite, monoammonium phosphate, standard dry cow mineral and vitamin mix, containing 61g magnesium phosphate; group B: zeolite, standard mineral and vitamin mix without the magnesium phosphate and group C: standard mineral and vitamin mix, monoammonium phosphate. All cows in group B had an apparently less variable serum calcium concentration around calving with no cases of milk fever and no subclinical hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia recorded. In contrast, a parturient drop in blood Ca was seen in group A as well as group C. In group A, one cow was hypocalcaemic at calving, and developed milk fever. In group C, 12 blood samples, representing six cows, were hypocalcaemic, and three of these cows were treated for milk fever. All groups remained normomagnesaemic and there were no significant differences in blood Mg across groups. In conclusion, the combined P and Mg supplementation in addition to zeolite supplementation did not increase the serum Mg level (forage Mg 16.9g/day; 0.21% of DM). Combined P and Mg supplementation reduced the zeolite-induced hypophosphataemia but also reduced the stabilising effect of zeolite on parturient serum Ca.",M1

To determine serum biochemical findings of rickets in healthy 11-15 yr old girls, the effect of sunlight exposure and oral vitamin D supplementation on serum 25- hydroxy vitamin D and calcium administration in girls with abnormal findings during December 2002 through March 2003 in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Healthy middle school girls were selected for estimation of vitamin D, calcium and <e>phosphorus</e> intake by a three-day food recall. And measurement of serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline-phosphatase and 25- hydroxyvitamin D concentration. The girls with abnormal findings divided in two groups. Hypovitaminosis D girls subdivided into two groups, supplementary sunlight exposure and vitamin- D administrated for them and calcium administration for the second group for 20 days. RESULTS: Of 414 girls, the mean daily vitamin D acquirement and calcium intake were 119 +/- 52 IU and 360 +/- 350 mg among all girls respectively. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with two or more abnormal biochemical findings in 15 (3.6%) girls (group I) were 7.8 ng/ml and alkaline phosphatse with normal or low calcium in 29 (7%) girls (group II) was 1187 IU/L. Mean serum calcium was 8.2 mg % in 8 of 29 girls. Serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D before and after sunlight exposure was 7.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml and 13.9 +/- 2.4 ng/ml and vitamin D administration was 7.4 +/- 1.8 ng/ml (group Ia) and 27.9 +/- 4.2 ng/ml (group Ib) respectively. Serum alkaline phosphatase before and after calcium administration were 1187 IU/L and 666 IU/L respectively.

17586425,"The prevalence and nutritional implications of fast food consumption among patients receiving hemodialysis.BACKGROUND: Fast food consumption has increased dramatically in the general population over the last 25 years. However, little is known about the prevalence and nutritional implications of fast food consumption among patients receiving hemodialysis. METHODS: By using a cross-sectional study design, we obtained data on fast food consumption and nutrient intake (from four separate 24-hour dietary recalls) and nutritional parameters (from chart abstraction) for 194 randomly selected patients from 44 hemodialysis facilities in northeast Ohio. RESULTS: Eighty-one subjects (42%) reported consuming at least one fast food meal or snack in 4 days. Subjects who consumed more fast food had higher kilocalorie, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium intakes. For example, kilocalorie per kilogram intake per day increased from 18.9 to 26.1 with higher frequencies of fast food consumption (P = .003). Subjects who consumed more fast food also had higher serum <e>phosphorus</e> levels and interdialytic weight gains. CONCLUSION: Fast food is commonly consumed by patients receiving hemodialysis and is associated with a higher intake of kilocalories, carbohydrates, fats, and sodium and adverse changes in phosphorus and fluid balance. Further work is needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks of fast food consumption among patients receiving hemodialysis.",M1
17585033,"Supplemental Escherichia coli phytase and strontium enhance bone strength of young pigs fed a <e>phosphorus</e>-adequate diet.Young pigs represent an excellent model of youth to assess potentials of dietary factors for improving bone structure and function. We conducted 2 experiments to determine whether adding microbial phytase (2,000 U/kg, OptiPhos, JBS United) and Sr (50 mg/kg, SrCO3 Alfa Aesar) into a P-adequate diet further improved bone strength of young pigs. In Expt. 1, 24 gilts (8.6 +/- 0.1 kg body wt) were divided into 2 groups (n = 12), and fed a corn-soybean-meal basal diet (BD, 0.33% available P) or BD + phytase for 6 wk. In Expt. 2, 32 pigs (11.4 +/- 0.2 kg) were divided into 4 groups (n = 8), and fed BD, BD + phytase, BD + Sr, or BD + phytase and Sr for 5 wk. Both supplemental phytase and Sr enhanced (P &lt; 0.05) breaking strengths (11-20%), mineral content (6-15%), and mineral density (6-11%) of metatarsals and femurs. Supplemental phytase also resulted in larger total bone areas (P &lt; 0.05) and a larger cross-sectional area of femur (P = 0.06). Concentrations of Sr were elevated 4-fold (P &lt; 0.001) in both bones by Sr, and moderately increased (P = 0.05-0.07) in metatarsal by phytase. In conclusion, supplemental phytase at 2000 U/kg of P-adequate diets enhanced bone mechanical function of weanling pigs by modulating both geometrical and chemical properties of bone. The similar benefit of supplemental Sr was mainly due to an effect on bone chemical properties.",M1
17577338,"Enteral calcium, phosphate and vitamin D requirements and bone mineralization in preterm infants.With major advances in life-support measures, nutrition has become one of the most debated issues in the care of very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Current nutritional recommendations are based on healthy premature infants and designed to provide postnatal nutrient retention during the 'stable-growing' period equivalent to the intrauterine gain of a normal foetus. However, this reference is still a matter of discussion, especially in the field of the mineral requirements. After birth, there are dramatic physiological changes in bone metabolism resulting from various factors: disruption in maternal mineral supply, stimulation of calciotropic hormone secretion, change in hormonal environment and relative reduction in mechanical stress. These events stimulate the remodelling process leading to an increase in endosteal bone resorption and a decrease in bone density. In preterm infants, these adaptation processes modify the mineral requirement, since, by itself, the increased remodelling provides a part of the mineral requirement necessary for postnatal bone growth and turnover. The care of newly born premature infants should not necessarily aim to achieve intrauterine calcium accretion rates. CONCLUSION: Considering that a calcium retention level ranging from 60 to 90 mg/kg/day assures appropriate mineralization, and decreases the risk of fracture and diminishes the clinical symptoms of osteopenia, an intake of 100 to 160 mg/kg/day of highly bioavailable calcium salts, 60 to 90 mg/kg/day of <e>phosphorus</e> and 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D per day is recommended.",M1
17565069,"Comparative evaluation of mathematical functions to describe growth and efficiency of <e>phosphorus</e> utilization in growing pigs.Success of pig production depends on maximizing return over feed costs and addressing potential nutrient pollution to the environment. Mathematical modeling has been used to describe many important aspects of inputs and outputs of pork production. This study was undertaken to compare 4 mathematical functions for the best fit in terms of describing specific data sets on pig growth and, in a separate experiment, to compare these 4 functions for describing of P utilization for growth. Two data sets with growth data were used to conduct growth analysis and another data set was used for P efficiency analysis. All data sets were constructed from independent trials that measured BW, age, and intake. Four growth functions representing diminishing returns (monomolecular), sigmoidal with a fixed point of inflection (Gompertz), and sigmoidal with a variable point of inflection (Richards and von Bertalanffy) were used. Meta-analysis of the data was conducted to identify the most appropriate functions for growth and P utilization. Based on Bayesian information criteria, the Richards equation described the BW vs. age data best. The additional parameter of the Richards equation was necessary because the data required a lower point of inflection (138 d) than the Gompertz, with a fixed point of inflexion at 1/e times the final BW (189 d), could accommodate. Lack of flexibility in the Gompertz equation was a limitation to accurate prediction. The monomolecular equation was best at determining efficiencies of P utilization for BW gain compared with the sigmoidal functions. The parameter estimate for the rate constant in all functions decreased as available P intake increased. Average efficiencies during different stages of growth were calculated and offer insight into targeting stages where high feed (nutrient) input is required and when adjustments are needed to accommodate the loss of efficiency and the reduction of potential pollution problems.

DESIGN: A study of bone-related variables in women aged 45-55 years in Jakarta compared with corresponding historical data from Caucasian Australian women. MEASUREMENTS: Dietary intakes, bone mineral density (BMD) and calcium-related variables in blood and urine. RESULTS: Dietary calcium, <e>phosphorus</e> and protein intakes were significantly lower in the women from Jakarta than in those from Adelaide (all P &lt; 0.001), probably because of lower milk consumption, but energy intake was similar in the two cities. Indonesian women were shorter and lighter than Australian women (P &lt; 0.001) but had a comparable body mass index (BMI). The Indonesians also had a lower spinal BMD than the Australians but this was accounted for by the differences in height and weight between the two populations. The differences in serum and urinary calcium and phosphate and serum alkaline phosphatase across the menopause were comparable in Indonesian and Australian women but creatinine excretion was 25% lower in Jakarta than in Adelaide (P &lt; 0.001) and this was probably sufficient to account for higher ratios of some urinary solutes to urinary creatinine in the Indonesians. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.001) and serum PTH levels significantly higher (P = 0.0045) in Jakarta than in Adelaide. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in bone-related biochemical variables across the menopause were similar in the two populations, but calcium and protein intake and urine creatinine were lower in Indonesian than in Australian women. Serum 25OHD was lower and PTH higher in the Indonesian women, probably because of their darker skin, their practice of avoiding direct sunlight and the heavy atmospheric pollution in Jakarta.",M1
17468418,"Meta-analysis of <e>phosphorus</e> balance data from growing pigs.Many studies have highlighted concerns over current methods of determining endogenous P losses and P requirements in growing pigs. Therefore, a database containing observations on 350 pigs was assembled from various studies. Four functions for analyzing P balance data were considered: 1) a straight line, 2) a diminishing returns function (monomolecular), 3) a sigmoidal function with a fixed point of inflection (Gompertz), and 4) a sigmoidal function with a flexible point of inflection (Richards). The nonlinear functions were specifically reparameterized to assign biological meaning to the parameters. Meta-analysis of the data was conducted to estimate endogenous P excretion, maintenance requirement, and efficiency of utilization. Phosphorus retention was regressed against either available P intake or total P intake [all variables scaled by metabolic BW (BW(0.75))]. There was evidence of non-linearity in the data, and the monomolecular function provided the best fit to the data. The Richards equation did not fit the data well and appeared overparameterized. Estimates of endogenous P excretion of 14 and 17 mg/kg of BW(0.75) x d based on available and total P analysis, respectively, were predicted by the monomolecular equation, which were within the range reported in the literature. Maintenance requirement values of 15 mg of available P/kg of BW(0.75) x d and 37 mg of total P/kg of BW(0.75) x d were obtained, based on the monomolecular equation. Average efficiencies of conversion of dietary P to retained P were 65 and 36% for available and total P, respectively, with greater efficiency values calculated for low P intakes. Although the monomolecular equation fitted the data best, more observations at high P intakes/kg of BW(0.75) are required to determine conclusively whether P retention scaled by metabolic BW is linearly related to available or total P intake.",M1
17401693,"Acute effects of different <e>phosphorus</e> sources on calcium and bone metabolism in young women: a whole-foods approach.The recommended dietary phosphorus intake is exceeded in the typical Western diet. However, few studies have been conducted on the bioavailability and metabolic consequences of dietary phosphorus from different food sources. In this study, acute effects of dietary phosphorus from three different food sources and a phosphate supplement on calcium and bone metabolism were investigated. Sixteen healthy women aged 20-30 years were randomized to five controlled 24-hour study sessions, each subject serving as her own control. At the control session, calcium intake was ca. 250 mg and phosphorus intake ca. 500 mg. During the other four sessions, phosphorus intake was about 1,500 mg, 1,000 mg of which was obtained from meat, cheese, whole grains, or a phosphate supplement, respectively. The foods served were exactly the same during the phosphorus sessions and the control session; only phosphorus sources varied. Markers of calcium and bone metabolism were followed. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to compare the study sessions. Only the phosphate supplement increased serum parathyroid hormone (S-PTH) concentration compared with the control session (P = 0.031). Relative to the control session, meat increased markers of both bone formation (P = 0.045) and bone resorption (P = 0.049). Cheese decreased S-PTH (P = 0.0001) and bone resorption (P = 0.008). These data suggest that the metabolic response was different for different foods.",M1
17369719,"Phosphate restriction in diet therapy.Hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism, frequently observed in patients with endstage renal disease, are associated with renal osteodystrophy, organ calcification, cardiovascular disease and sudden death. Restriction of dietary protein and <e>phosphorus</e> is beneficial in slowing the progression of renal failure. Dietary phosphorus restriction must be prescribed at all stages of renal failure in adults. It may be achieved by decreasing protein intake and avoiding foods rich in phosphorus. An average of 60-80% of the phosphorus intake is absorbed in the gut in dialysis patients. If phosphate binders are employed, the phosphorus absorbed from the diet may be reduced to 40%. Conventional hemodialysis with a high-flux, high-efficiency dialyzer removes approximately 30 mmol (900 mg) phosphorus during each dialysis performed three times weekly. Therefore, 750 mg of phosphorus intake should be the critical value above which a positive balance of phosphorus may occur. This value corresponds to a protein diet of 45-50 g/day or 0.8 g/kg body weight/day for a 60 kg patient. Target levels should become 9.2-9.6 mg/dl for calcium, 2.5-5.5 mg/dl for phosphorus, &lt;55 mg2/dl2 for the calcium-phosphorus product, and 100-200 pg/ml for intact parathyroid hormone.",M1
17365904,"Role of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> and degree of uremia in the development of renal bone disease in rats.The remnant kidney rat model has been extensively used for the evaluation of bone changes due to uremia. The present study aimed to assess the effect of the dietary phosphorus availability and of the severity of renal failure on bone histomorphometric changes and various biochemical markers over time in this model. Chronic renal failure (CRF) was induced in male Wistar rats by 5/6th nephrectomy. Half of the number of animals received a standard rat diet (STD) (0.67% P, containing low bioavailable phosphorus of plant origin); the other animals were fed a high phosphorus diet (HPD) (0.93% P, containing inorganic phosphorus with high bioavailability). Every two weeks, blood and urine samples were collected. At sacrifice after 6 or 12 weeks, bone samples were taken for the measurement of histological and histodynamic parameters. Serum creatinine measurements indicated the development of mild to moderate renal failure in both diet groups. Phosphaturia was unexpectedly low in all animals that received the STD, indicating relative phosphorus depletion despite the normal dietary phosphorus content. In the HPD CRF group, a decrease in calcemia and a rise in phosphatemia were seen after 12 weeks of CRF, which were more pronounced in animals with higher serum creatinine. Serum iPTH levels were distinctly increased in CRF rats fed a HPD, especially those with more pronounced renal failure. Serum osteocalcin and to a lesser extend tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline crosslinks were higher in the CRF animals compared to the shams, particularly in the animals of the HPD group with more pronounced CRF. In both diet groups, the CRF animals had significantly higher amounts of osteoid compared to shams. Only the animals that received a HPD developed distinct histological signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPTH), that is, an increased bone formation rate, mineral apposition rate, osteoblast perimeter, and eroded perimeter. Again, this effect was most prominent in rats with more severe CRF. In conclusion, data of the present study indicate that in experimental studies using the remnant kidney rat model, both the dietary phosphorus bioavailability and the degree of renal failure in the development of hyperparathyroidism should be considered.",M1
17279387,"Molecular and conventional responses of large rainbow trout to dietary <e>phosphorus</e> restriction.The dietary phosphorus (P) requirement for large fish is difficult to estimate because of insensitivities of known P status indicators. We examined dietary P requirement of large rainbow trout (mean body weight 278 g) using recently identified P-responsive genes (mRNA abundances) as well as conventional serum P and bone P. Fish were fed six diets (varied P contents), and the tissues of intestine, pyloric caeca (PC), kidney, serum and bone were collected at varying time intervals. Serum P responded clearly to dietary P by day 2, but the estimated P requirement based on this variable changed as feeding duration continued. Bone P did not respond clearly until week 7. Among P-responsive genes studied, Na/Pi cotransporter in PC (PC-NaPi) was the most sensitive, and responded in 2 days. Fish-to-fish (within treatment) variance was larger in mRNA than in serum P and bone P levels. Estimated dietary P requirements (%P in dry diet) were 0.45 (based on serum P), 0.45 (based on bone P), 0.36 (based on PC-NaPi), 0.33 (based on intestinal NaPi), 0.71 (based on renal NaPi), and 0.33 (based on mitochondrial Pi carrier).

To document dairy consumption in African Americans by age and sex during 1994-1998 and 1999-2000 and compare it with concomitant dairy, calcium, and related nutrient intakes in non-African-American adults and children. DESIGN: Duplicate and single 24-hour recalls were analyzed to determine dietary intake during the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 1994-1996, 1998 (CSFII), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 (NHANES), respectively. SUBJECTS: African Americans and non-African Americans of all ages who participated in CSFII 1994-1996, 1998, and in NHANES 1999-2000; both surveys are a stratified random sample of the total civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Dairy food and nutrient intake per day were quantified according to age, sex, and ethnicity/race from CSFII 1994-1996, 1998, and NHANES 1999-2000. For NHANES, mean intakes from 1-day food records were sample-weighted, and standard errors estimated by the Taylor linearization method of SUDAAN (version 9.0, 2004, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC). Usual daily intakes of calcium, magnesium, and <e>phosphorus</e> were based on 2-day intake data from CSFII 1994-1996, 1998, and calculated using Software for Intake Distribution from Iowa State University. The percentage of individuals categorized as not meeting the Estimated Average Requirement for magnesium and phosphorus were calculated in the same way. RESULTS: CSFII 1994-1996, 1998, and NHANES 1999-2000 data both show that African Americans in all age groups consume fewer mean servings per day of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt than non-African Americans, and have lower mean intakes of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Significant differences were seen for men and women. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, young African-American women did not meet Dietary Reference Intakes for phosphorus, and all African Americans did not meet Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and magnesium. African Americans in all age groups did not meet dairy recommendations from the 2005 US Dietary Guidelines and the 2004 National Medical Association Consensus Report on the role of dairy and dairy nutrients in the diet of African Americans.",M1
17190108,"The effects of calcium, <e>phosphorus</e>, magnesium, sodium, and zinc in improving the depression of gonadal development in growing male rats kept under a disturbed daily rhythm-investigations based on the L(16)(2(15))-type orthogonal array.The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of nutrients on the gonadal development of male rats kept under constant darkness as a model of disturbed daily rhythm. This experimental protocol was designed based on the L16(2(15))-type orthogonal array, which can examine six factors. Five minerals (calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and zinc (Zn)) were selected as experimental factors, and the dietary content of these minerals was normal (AIN-76 diet) or 1/3.5 of the normal content. Lighting conditions (constant darkness or normal lighting) were also added as a factor. Four-week-old rats (Fischer 344 strain) were kept under constant darkness or normal lighting (12-h light/dark cycle) for 4 wk. After 4 wk, the gonadal weights and serum testosterone content were evaluated. The lighting condition, Ca, Mg, and Na, and the interactions between the lighting condition and Ca, and Mg and Na were observed to affect the testes weight. Among the constant darkness groups (D-groups), the highest value for testes weight was observed under the normal-Ca, normal-Mg, and normal-Na diet, and the lowest value was observed under the low-Ca, normal-Mg, and low-Na diet. Among the normal lighting groups (N-groups), the highest value for testes weight was observed under the low-Ca, normal-Mg, and normal-Na diet, and the lowest value was observed under the normal-Ca, normal-Mg, and low-Na diet. Among the D-groups, the highest value for serum testosterone was observed under the normal-Ca, normal-Mg, and low-Na diet. Among the N-groups, the highest value was observed under the low-Ca, normal-Mg, and low-Na diet. It became clear that the amount of dietary Ca necessary for the gonadal development of rats increases when rats are kept under constant darkness as a model of disturbed daily rhythm compared with the normal lighting condition.",M1
17179418,"Characterization of the chicken small intestine type IIb sodium phosphate cotransporter.Intestinal absorption and renal resorption play a critical role in overall <e>phosphorus</e> homeostasis in chickens. Using RNase-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, we obtained a cDNA from the broiler small intestine that encodes a type IIb Na-dependent phosphate transporter. The cDNA has an open reading frame of 2,022 bp and predicts a 674-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 74 kDa. Prediction of membrane spanning domains based on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the amino acids suggests 8 transmembrane domains, with both the NH(2) and COOH termini being intracellular. The Na-inorganic phosphate (Pi) IIb cotransporter has relative high homology with other type II Na-Pi cotransporters but low homology with the type I or type III Na-Pi cotransporters. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single mRNA transcript present predominantly in the small intestine, with the highest expression in the duodenum, followed by the jejunum and ileum. In situ hybridization indicated that the Na-Pi cotransporter mRNA is expressed throughout the vertical cryptvillus axis of the small intestine. Reduction of P in the diet of chicks from hatch to 4 d of age resulted in a significant induction of Na-Pi cotransporter mRNA expression in the small intestine. Further study is needed to elucidate its physiological role in intestinal phosphate absorption in chickens.",M1
17158417,"Posthospital discharge feeding for preterm infants: effects of standard compared with enriched milk formula on growth, bone mass, and body composition.BACKGROUND: Despite the theoretical benefits of nutrient-enriched formula given to preterm infants after hospital discharge, its role in reversing growth deficits after hospital discharge remains poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effect of different formulas on the growth, bone mass, and body composition of preterm infants after hospital discharge. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double blind comparison of a nutrient-enriched formula (EF) and a formula for term infants (TF) given for 1 y after hospital discharge. Compared with the TF, the EF had a higher energy density and higher contents of protein, calcium, and <e>phosphorus</e> (by 10%, 21%, 44%, and 11%, respectively) and higher contents of almost all other nutrients (by &gt;or=10%). RESULTS: Birth weights of the infants were 630-1620 g (median: 1250 g) and gestational ages were 24-34 wk (median: 29 wk). TF resulted in significantly greater weight, length, head circumference measurements, and their respective z scores on the basis of age- and sex-specific norms. At the end of the study, the mean z scores for the corrected age of infants in the TF group were -0.37 for weight, 0.001 for length, and 0.50 for head circumference. The TF group also had significantly greater dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measured bone and lean and fat mass than did the EF group (P &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The use of EF for preterm infants after hospital discharge shows no advantage over TF in growth, bone mineralization, and body composition. More studies are needed to determine the optimal postdischarge nutrition support for preterm infants.",M1
17053890,"Influence of dietary calcium and <e>phosphorus</e> supply on epithelial phosphate transport in preruminant goats.P homeostasis affected by high or low Ca and/or P supply in preruminant goats was characterized by balance studies in vivo. The main excretion pathway was the renal P(i) excretion whose extent was modulated by variations in dietary P and/or Ca supply. Faecal P excretion remained low irrespective of dietary regimen. The balance data were combined with respective in vitro data on P(i) transport properties and their adaptation in response to changes in dietary Ca and/or P intake. Therefore, P(i) transport capacities were determined by P(i) uptake into brush border membrane vesicles of jejunum and kidney. Epithelial P(i) transporters were determined semiquantitatively by northern and western blot analyses in jejunum, kidney and salivary gland. Renal P(i) transport was downregulated by doubling dietary P supply while doubling both, Ca and P as well as restrictive Ca at unchanged P led to slight, but not significant reductions in renal P(i) transport. Jejunal P(i) transport was reduced by P excess (doubling P and doubling both, Ca and P), but only NaPi IIb protein expression was significantly diminished. In conclusion, the significance of epithelial adaptation to dietary Ca and P supply for P homeostasis is discussed in preruminant goats.",M1
17050109,"Dietary cholecalciferol and <e>phosphorus</e> influence intestinal mucosa phytase activity in broiler chicks.1. The role of cholecalciferol and phosphorus in the regulation of intestinal mucosa phytase was investigated in broiler chicks. 2. A total of 144 7-d-old male broiler chicks were grouped by weight into 6 blocks of 4 cages with 6 broiler chicks per cage. Four maize-soybean meal-based mash diets were randomly assigned to cages within each block. The 4 diets consisted of cholecalciferol at 0 or 75 microg/kg and total phosphorus at 3.6 or 7.0 g/kg in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The birds were given the experimental diets for 12 d under conditions which excluded ultraviolet light. 3. Broiler chicks fed on diets with the higher concentration of cholecalciferol had higher Vmax and Km of the mucosa phytase, weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency and percentage tibia ash, higher ileal digestibility of dry matter, energy, phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and increased retention of dry matter, nitrogen, P, Ca and energy. 4. Broiler chicks receiving diets with the higher P concentration showed lower Vmax and Km of the intestinal mucosa phytase but greater weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency and percentage tibia ash, higher ileal digestibility of dry matter, energy, P and nitrogen, and increased retention of dry matter, energy, nitrogen and Ca. 5.

The present study examined the bone strength and apparent mineral metabolisability of a selected broiler chicken compared with those of a relatively unselected genotype. 2. Selected (SB) and unselected genotypes (UB) were reared under standard conditions and were fed on either a high quality (HQ) or a low quality (LQ) diet. Tibiotarsi samples were collected at 42 d from SB and compared to tibiotarsi from UB of the same age and the same body mass (BM). 3. Bones were assessed for: bone breaking strength (BBS), morphology (weight and length), and both organic (OM) and inorganic content (ASH). Apparent dry matter digestibility and the coefficient of apparent metabolisability of calcium and phosphorus were determined at the same BM. 4. The BBS of SB (214 +/- 9 N) was greater than that of same-age UB (119 +/- 8 N) but the same as that of same-BM UB (218 +/- 10 N). At the same age, the SB had stronger, heavier bones with more ash and organic matter per unit length of tibiotarsus than UB. At the same BM, the tibiotarsi of the SB were shorter and lighter, with a higher ash and a similar organic content than the bones of the UB. At the same BM, BBS was about 15% lower in both genotypes fed on the LQ compared to the HQ diet. 5. The coefficients of apparent metabolisability of calcium and phosphorus were the same in both genotypes when fed on the HQ diet, but were lower in the SB than in the UB genotype when the birds were given the LQ diet. 6. The tibiotarsi of the selected broilers were stronger, or at least as strong, as those of the unselected broiler genotype, which may be due to similar levels of apparent calcium metabolisability of the selected chickens.",M1
17046617,"Conflicting dietary advice for adhering to low-sodium and low-<e>phosphorus</e> diets.OBJECTIVE: To elucidate conflicts that patients face when advised to limit multiple nutrients in their diet. DESIGN: We analyzed the phosphorus content of low-sodium foods compared with their regular-sodium content counterparts, and the sodium content of low-phosphorus foods compared with foods containing higher levels of phosphorus. Low-sodium and low-phosphorus foods were identified with the use of recommendations from National Kidney Foundation patient information Web sites. Content of sodium and phosphorus was quantified with use of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nutrient Database. SETTING: Review and analysis of publicly available patient information Web sites and nutrient databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Phosphorus content of low- versus regular-sodium-containing foods, and sodium content of low- versus high-phosphorus-containing foods. RESULTS: Of 47 low-sodium foods, 32 had identical phosphorus content--8 higher and 7 lower--compared with regular-sodium alternatives. Of 9 foods recommended as low-phosphorus alternatives to high-phosphorus choices, 4 had higher sodium content and 5 had lower, with considerable variability. However, choosing servings of 4 low-sodium alternatives could increase ingestion of phosphorus by up to 16% of recommended intake, and choosing servings of 4 low-phosphorus alternatives could increase ingestion of sodium by more than 20% of recommended intake. CONCLUSION: Adhering to a complex renal diet is extremely difficult for patients with chronic kidney disease. Balancing sodium and phosphorus restrictions is particularly challenging, especially as food choices low in one nutrient may not be low in the other. To help patients follow these diets, alternative methods of achieving dietary restrictions of multiple, often conflicting, components may be needed.",M1
17032833,"Adaptation of epithelial sodium-dependent phosphate transport in jejunum and kidney of hens to variations in dietary <e>phosphorus</e> intake.The objective of this study was to explore the homeostatic response of jejunal and renal epithelia regarding the inorganic phosphate (P(i)) transport capacities to variations in dietary total phosphorus (tP) supply in hens. Adaptive processes were determined by quantitative measures of intake and excretion, P(i) transport studies across brush border membranes, and semiquantitative detection of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters (NaPi II) based on mRNA expression in the jejunum and kidney. Twelve hens (4/group) were adapted to 3 tP feeding levels in a pair-fed manner (60 g/d): low P diet with 0.073% tP, medium P diet with 0.204% tP, and high P diet with 0.343% tP. Excretion was measured during the last 5 d of a 16-d feeding period. After slaughtering, jejunal mucosa and renal cortex were removed. Tissues were used for (32)P uptake studies in brush-border membrane vesicles by rapid filtration technique and NaPi II mRNA expression studies by northern analyses. Plasma P(i) concentrations were additionally measured. The NaPi II transporter mRNA could specifically be detected in chicken jejunum and kidney. Functional parameters of Na(+)-dependent P(i) transport indicated that these transporters were involved in chicken P(i) transport across the apical membranes of jejunal and renal epithelia. Increased tP intake resulted in an increased overall tP excretion. Correlating individual data from all animals by linear regression highlighted that the adaptive decrease of renal P(i) transport capacity and NaPi IIa mRNA expression was associated with an increase in plasma P(i) levels and resulted in a higher tP excretion. Jejunal P(i) transport capacity and NaPi IIb mRNA expression did not react to variations in dietary tP supply. In conclusion, the homeostatic response was mainly based on the adaptive capacity of the kidney in hens.",M1
17032825,"Response of broilers to feeding low-calcium and <e>phosphorus</e> diets plus phytase under different environmental conditions: body weight and tibiotarsus mineralization.Three experiments on Ross broiler chickens were conducted in 3 locations: cages (Experiment 1), floor pens (Experiment 2), and commercial farms (Experiment 3). The effect of low-total P (TP) wheat-soybean based diets plus microbial phytase (Natuphos) was evaluated. Four experimental starter and finisher diets were used in a 2-phase feeding program, as follows: control diet (SC until 21 d, FC from 22 to 42 d); 2 diets (SL400 and SL600 until 21 d, FL400 and FL600 from 22 to 42 d) with low TP (0.61% for starter and 0.54% for finisher), including 400 and 600 U/kg of phytase, respectively; and a very low-TP (0.52% for starter and 0.44% for finisher) diet (SVL600 until 21 d, FVL600 from 22 to 42 d) with 600 U/kg of phytase. In Experiment 1 (broilers in cages had movement limitation and no access to litter), no differences in BW, tibiotarsus mineralization, or mineral metabolism were observed among diets. In Experiment 2 (broilers in floor pens had movement limitation and access to litter), at 21 d of age, the lowest tibiotarsus ash percentage and BW were shown by birds fed the SVL600 diet. At 42 d of age, broilers fed the FC diet were the lightest. For the rest of the parameters of tibiotarsus mineralization and mineral metabolism measured in Experiment 2, no differences were shown. In Experiment 3 (broilers in commercial farms had access to litter without movement limitation), the BW of broilers fed the SC diet was the highest at 21 d of age. At 42 d of age, the broilers fed FL400 and FL600 diets were the heaviest. At the end of Experiment 3, broilers fed the FC diet had the highest dry litter Ca and P, whereas broilers fed the FVL600 diet had the lowest values. In conclusion, the very low-TP wheat-soybean based diet supplemented with 600 U/kg of phytase was sufficient to optimize all the parameters measured in Experiment 1 but not in Experiments 2 and 3. Therefore, when evaluating Ca and P in phytase-supplemented diets for broilers, it is necessary to bear in mind the environmental conditions of experimentation.",M1
17014508,"Management of hyperphosphatemia.Hyperphosphatemia is a well recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Despite advanced technology and regular and efficient dialysis treatment the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia is still high. The goal of normalization of serum <e>phosphorus</e> (iP) levels can only be reached by optimization of dialysis prescription in combination with individualized dietary and medical strategies. Due to the unique characteristics of intradialytic iP kinetics, dialysis treatment time and frequency are the most effective factors governing intradialytic iP removal. Although the combination of diffusive and convective removal by hemodiafiltration allows a further increase in iP mass removal, a neutral phosphorus balance without dietary restrictions and the use of phosphate binders has only be achieved by daily nocturnal hemodialysis. Strict dietary phosphate restriction bears the risk of inadequate protein intake and the development of protein/calorie malnutrition. Although phosphate binders (PB) can effectively lower serum iP levels into the normal range, this is rarely achieved in clinical practice probably due to inadequate relation of PB dose to dietary phosphorus intake. Developing methods to enable patients to self-adjust phosphate binder dose to individual meal phosphate content, similar to adjusting insulin dose to carbohydrate intake, may lead to further improvements in phosphate management.",M1
16955720,"Influence of graded magnesium deficiencies on white blood cell counts and lymphocyte subpopulations in rats.Increased white blood cell counts or leukocytosis have been observed primarily in young rats fed diets extremely low in Mg (&lt; 60 ppm) and high in <e>phosphorus</e> (0.5 % P). We investigated the influence that acute and moderate Mg deficiencies have on blood leukocytes at high and low dietary phosphorus levels. For four weeks, male Sprague-Dawley rats (initially 7 weeks old) were fed diets containing 30, 60, 120, 208, or 850 ppm Mg and either 0.3 % or 0.5 % dietary phosphorus. Total leukocytes were increased in rats fed 30 ppm Mg (p &lt; 0.0001), and the leukocyte subpopulation counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils increased significantly only in the rats fed 30 ppm Mg (p &lt; 0.0001). B-cells decreased significantly as a percentage of lymphocytes (p &lt; 0.0093) as dietary Mg decreased. As total counts in blood, B-cells, CD4 and CD8 cells were significantly increased in the rats consuming the 30 ppm Mg diet. Dietary phosphorus only had an effect in combination with the lowest dietary Mg. These results demonstrate a threshold effect for increased leukocytes during a Mg deficiency of four weeks. A Mg deficiency of a longer duration may show different results.",M1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on school girls aged 11-15 years selected randomly from various areas of Tehran, Iran. Dietary information and amount of sunlight exposure were estimated by a 7 day recalling method using self-reported questionnaire. Hypovitaminosis D defined as low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with two or more others abnormal biochemical findings. Girls with hypovitaminoses D were randomly divided into two groups. The faces and hands of girls in group 1 were exposed to sunlight for one hour per day for twenty days, while those in group 2 were administered vitamin D capsules, 50,000 IU per day for the same period. RESULTS: four-hundred fourteen girls evaluated, mean daily calcium intake, sunlight exposure and vitamin D acquirement were 360 mg, 10 minutes and 119 IU, respectively. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 30 ng/ml among all girls whereas in 15 (3.63%) of 414 girls was 7.8 ng/ml. Abnormal biochemical findings in these girls included hypocalcemia (n=4), hypophosphatemia (n=5), raised serum alkaline phosphatase (n=13), and parathyroid hormone (n=15). After intervention, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in sunlight exposure (n=8) and vitamin D (n=7) supplementation increased to 14.4+/-4 ng/ml and 23+/-4 ng/ml respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency developed in rapid growth period of girls without clear clinical rickets in sunny temperate climate city in Iran which vitamin D supplementation improved biochemical findings better than sunlight exposure.",M1

The purpose of this study was to describe intake patterns of fluid, sodium, potassium, <e>phosphorus</e>, protein, and calories over a 3-month period as recorded using a PDA. Mean weekly intake values were plotted on line graphs to examine trends of intake. The patients' mean weekly intakes of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and fluid were dynamic and fluctuating. Protein and caloric intakes were significantly below the recommendations of the K/DOQI guidelines. Standard methods to assess intake may not adequately capture intake patterns on a daily basis.",M1
16837509,"High-calcium vs high-phosphate intake and small artery tone in advanced experimental renal insufficiency.BACKGROUND: Disturbed calcium-<e>phosphorus</e> balance significantly contributes to uraemic changes in large arteries. We examined the influences of high-calcium and high-phosphate intake on small artery tone in experimental renal insufficiency. METHODS: Sixty-five rats were assigned to 5/6 nephrectomy (NTX) or sham operation. After 15 week disease progression, NTX rats were given high-calcium (3%), high-phosphate (1.5%) or control diet (0.3% calcium, 0.5% phosphate) for 12 weeks. Then isolated segments of small mesenteric arteries were studied using wire and pressure myographs. RESULTS: Subtotal nephrectomy reduced creatinine clearance by 60% and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate 12-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively. High-phosphate intake further elevated PTH and phosphate (33-fold and 5.5-fold, respectively), while the calcium diet suppressed them (to 3.5 and 62% vs sham, respectively). Ventricular B-type natriuretic peptide synthesis was increased, and blood pressure was 27 and 18 mmHg higher in NTX rats on control and phosphate diet, respectively, than in calcium-fed rats. Vasorelaxation to acetylcholine was impaired by approximately 50% in uraemic rats, and was further deteriorated by high-phosphate intake, whereas the calcium diet improved endothelium-mediated relaxation via nitric oxide and potassium channels. Small arteries of all NTX groups featured eutrophic inward remodelling: wall-to-lumen ratio was increased 1.3-fold without change in cross-sectional area. CONCLUSION: High-phosphate intake had a detrimental influence on secondary hyperparathyroidism and vasodilatation, whereas high-calcium intake reduced blood pressure and PTH, alleviated volume overload and improved vasorelaxation in experimental renal insufficiency. Therefore, alterations in the calcium-phosphorus balance can significantly modulate small artery tone during impaired kidney function.",M1

Performance, gait score (GS), tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), and tibia bone mineralisation and breaking strength were determined in 2880 male and female Ross 208 broilers fed on diets with two different concentrations of dietary metabolisable energy (ME) (11.00 or 12.00 MJ/kg) and 4 different concentrations of available phosphorus (aP) adjusted for dietary ME content (4.0, 4.5, 5.0 or 5.5 g/kg aP in starter and 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 or 5.0 g/kg aP in finisher diets containing 12.00 MJ/kg). 2. Tibia ash, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) contents in broilers given diets with low ME (11.00 MJ/kg) were greater than those of broilers given diets with higher ME (12.00 MJ/kg). Tibia ash, Ca and P contents increased curvilinearly with increasing dietary aP content. The dietary aP level had no effect on GS. 3. Dietary concentration of ME or aP had no effect on tibia breaking strength. 4. Walking ability, as measured by GS, was negatively correlated with the body weight (BW) of tested birds at 23 and 35 d of age, but the dietary ME content or aP level had no significant effect on GS at 35 d of age. 5. The results indicated that bone mineral content had no clear correlation with the walking ability of broilers.",M1
16649576,"Effect of microbial phytase on apparent ileal amino acid digestibility of <e>phosphorus</e>-adequate diets in growing pigs.Six ileally cannulated pigs (mean initial body weight 34.8 kg) were used to study the effect of microbial phytase on apparent ileal digestibility of P, total N and amino acids. Three P-adequate diets (digestible P concentration 2.3 g kg(- )l) containing barley (B), soyabean meal (S) or a mixture of the two (BS) with or without phytase supplement (1000 FTU x kg(-1)) were fed to pigs using a 6 x 6 Latin square design. The addition of phytase increased (p &lt; 0.05) apparent ileal P digestibility of diets B, S and BS by 16.5, 19.2 and 19.2%, respectively. There was no effect of phytase on the ileal digestibility of total N. Apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids tended to increase in the BS diet supplemented with phytase (mean improvement of 2.2%); but no significant difference was found for any amino acid as compared with the unsupplemented diet. To asses the additivity of apparent amino acid digestibility, the determined values for the BS diet were compared to those calculated from digestibilities found in diets B and S. There were no significant differences between the determined and calculated values. It is concluded that the addition of microbial phytase to P-adequate diets does not affect ileal amino acid digestibility in growing pigs and that the apparent amino acid digestibility values determined in single ingredients may be additive when included into a complex diet.",M1
16612019,"Effect of graded doses and a high dose of microbial phytase on the digestibility of various minerals in weaner pigs.An experiment with 224 weaner pigs (initial BW of 7.8 kg) was conducted to determine the effect of dose of dietary phytase supplementation on apparent fecal digestibility of minerals (P, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Cu) and on performance. Four blocks, each with 8 pens of 7 pigs, were formed. Eight dietary treatments were applied to each block in the 43-d experiment: supplementation of 0 (basal diet), 100, 250, 500, 750, 1,500, or 15,000 phytase units (FTU) or of 1.5 g of digestible P (dP; monocalcium phosphate; positive control) per kilogram of feed. The basal diet, with corn, barley, soybean meal, and sunflower seed meal as the main components, contained 1.2 g of dP per kilogram of feed. Fresh fecal grab samples were collected in wk 4 and 5 of the experiment. Average daily feed intake, ADG, G:F, and digestibility of all of the minerals increased (P &lt; 0.001) with increasing phytase dose. Digestibility of P increased from 34% in the basal diet to a maximum of 84% in the diet supplemented with 15,000 FTU, generating 1.76 g of dP per kilogram of feed. At this level, 85% of the phytate <e>phosphorus</e> was digested, compared with 15% in the basal diet. Compared with the basal diet, digestibility of the monovalent minerals increased maximally at 15,000 FTU, from 81 to 92% (Na) and from 76 to 86% (K). In conclusion, phytase supplementation up to a level of 15,000 FTU/kg of a dP-deficient diet improved performance of weaner pigs and digestibility of minerals, including monovalent minerals. Up to 85% of the phytate-P was digested. Thus, dietary phytase supplementation beyond present day standards (500 FTU/kg) could further improve mineral use and consequently reduce mineral output to the environment.",M1
16612017,"A genetically engineered Escherichia coli phytase improves nutrient utilization, growth performance, and bone strength of young swine fed diets deficient in available <e>phosphorus</e>.A 28-d experiment was conducted using 126 crossbred barrows to evaluate the addition of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli phytase to diets that were 0.15% deficient in available P. Growth performance, bone strength, ash weight, and the apparent absorption of P, Ca, Mg, N, energy, DM, Zn, Fe, and Cu were the response criteria. The pigs (2 pigs/pen) averaged 7.61 kg of BW and 30 d of age initially. The low-P basal diet was supplemented with 0, 100, 500, 2,500, or 12,500 units (U) of E. coli phytase/kg of diet, or 500 U of Peniophora lycii phytase/kg of diet. The positive control (PC) diet was adequate in available P. Pigs were fed the diets in meal form. Fecal samples were collected from each pig from d 22 to 27 of the experiment. There were linear and quadratic increases (P &lt; 0.001) in 28-d growth performance (ADFI, ADG, and G:F), bone breaking strength and ash weight, and the apparent absorption (g/d and %) of P, Ca, and Mg (P &lt; or = 0.01 for quadratic) with increasing concentrations of E. coli phytase. Pigs fed the low-P diets containing 2,500 or 12,500 U/kg of E. coli phytase had greater (P &lt; or = 0.01 or P &lt; 0.001, respectively) values for growth performance, bone breaking strength and ash weight, and the apparent absorption (g/d and %) of P, Ca, and Mg than pigs fed the PC diet. The addition of E. coli phytase did not increase the apparent percentage absorption of N, GE, DM, Zn, Fe, or Cu. There were no differences in the efficacy of the E. coli or P. lycii phytase enzymes at 500 U/kg of low-P diet for any criterion measured. In conclusion, there were linear increases in growth performance, bone breaking strength and ash weight, and the apparent absorption of P, Ca, and Mg with increasing addition of E. coli phytase up to 12,500 U/kg of diet. Also, all of these criteria were greater for pigs fed the low-P diets containing 2,500 or 12,500 U of E. coli phytase/kg than for pigs fed the PC diet. The addition of 500, 2,500, or 12,500 U of E. coli phytase/kg of low-P diet reduced P excretion (g/d) in manure by 35, 42, and 61%, respectively, compared with pigs fed the PC diet.",M1
16431896,"Effect of endothelin receptor antagonist on parathyroid gland growth, PTH values and cell proliferation in azotemic rats.BACKGROUND: A variety of stimuli are involved in the pathogenesis of parathyroid gland hyperplasia in renal failure. Recently, it was shown that blocking the signal from the endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor (ET(A)R/ET(B)R) by a non-selective receptor antagonist, bosentan, reduced parathyroid cell proliferation, parathyroid gland hyperplasia and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in normal rats on a calcium deficient diet. Our goal was to determine whether in 5/6 nephrectomized (NPX) rats with developing or established hyperparathyroidism, the endothelin receptor blocker, bosentan, reduced the increase in parathyroid cell proliferation, parathyroid gland hyperplasia and PTH values. METHODS: High (HPD, 1.2%) or normal <e>phosphorus</e> diets (PD) (NPD, 0.6%) were given to 5/6 NPX rats for 15 days (NPX(15)). In each dietary group, one-half the rats were given bosentan (B) i.p. 100 mg/kg/day. The four groups of rats were: (1) NPX(15)-1.2% P; (2) NPX(15)-1.2% P+B; (3) NPX(15)-0.6% P; and (4) NPX(15)-0.6% P+B. In a second study in which hyperparathyroidism was already established in 5/6 NPX rats fed a HPD for 15 days, rats were divided into two groups in which one group was maintained on a HPD and the other group was changed to very low PD (VLPD, &lt;0.05%) for an additional 15 days. In each dietary group, one-half the rats were given bosentan i.p. 100 mg/kg-day. The four groups of rats were: (1) NPX(30)-1.2% P; (2) NPX(30)-1.2% P+B; (3) NPX(30)-0.05% P and (4) NPX(30)-0.05% P+B. Parathyroid cell proliferation was measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining and ET-1 expression by immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: In the study of developing hyperparathyroidism, bosentan reduced ET-1 expression in the parathyroid glands of rats on the NPD and HPD (P&lt;0.05). But only in rats on the NPD did bosentan result in a reduced increase in parathyroid gland weight (P&lt;0.05). In the study of established hyperparathyroidism, in which 5/6 NPX rats were given a HPD for 15 days, bosentan started on day 15 reduced (P&lt;0.05) ET-1 expression in rats maintained for 15 additional days on the HPD or the VLPD. On the VLPD, parathyroid gland weight was less (P&lt;0.05) than that in rats on the HPD sacrificed at 15 or 30 days. Bosentan did not reduce parathyroid cell proliferation or parathyroid gland weight in rats maintained on the HPD or further reduce these parameters beyond that obtained with dietary phosphorus restriction. PTH values were lowest in the VLPD group, intermediate in the NPD group, and highest in the HPD group, but in none of the three groups did bosentan decrease PTH values. CONCLUSIONS: In azotemic rats with developing hyperparathyroidism, bosentan resulted in a reduced increase in parathyroid gland weight when dietary phosphorus content was normal. Despite a reduction in ET-1 expression in rats on a HPD with developing or established hyperparathyroidism, bosentan did not reduce the increase in parathyroid cell proliferation, parathyroid gland growth or PTH values. Thus, ET-1 blockade with bosentan did not prevent parathyroid gland growth in the azotemic rat.",M1
16428636,"Hypocalcemia in dairy cows: meta-analysis and dietary cation anion difference theory revisited.Data from 137 published trials involving 2,545 calvings were analyzed using random effects normal logistic regression models to identify risk factors for clinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows. The aim of the study was to examine which form, if any, of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) equation provided the best estimate of milk fever risk and to clarify roles of calcium, magnesium, and <e>phosphorus</e> concentrations of prepartum diets in the pathogenesis of milk fever. Two statistically equivalent and biologically plausible models were developed that predict incidence of milk fever. These models were validated using data from 37 trials excluded from the original data used to generate the models; missing variables were replaced with mean values from the analyzed data. The preferred models differed slightly; Model 1 included prepartum DCAD, and Model 2 included prepartum dietary concentrations of potassium and sulfur alone, but not sodium and chloride. Other factors, included in both models were prepartum dietary concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus; days exposed to the prepartum diet; and breed. Jersey cows were at 2.25 times higher risk of milk fever than Holstein cows in Model 1. The results support the DCAD theory of greater risk of milk fever with higher prepartum dietary DCAD (odds ratio = 1.015). The only DCAD equation supported in statistical analyses was (Na(+) + K(+)) - (Cl(-) + S(2-)). This finding highlights the difference between developing equations to predict DCAD and those to predict milk fever. The results support a hypothesis of a quadratic role for Ca in the pathogenesis of milk fever (model 1, odds ratio = 0.131; Model 2, odds ratio = 0.115). Milk fever risk was highest with a prepartum dietary concentration of 1.35% calcium. Increasing prepartum dietary magnesium concentrations had the largest effect on decreasing incidence of milk fever in both Model 1 (odds ratio = 0.006) and Model 2 (odds ratio = 0.001). Increasing dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum increased the risk of milk fever (Model 1, odds ratio = 6.376; Model 2, odds ratio = 9.872). The models presented provide the basis for the formulation of diets to reduce the risk of milk fever and strongly support the need to evaluate macro mineral nutrition apart from DCAD of the diet.",M1
16414439,"Effect of boiling on dietary phosphate and nitrogen intake.OBJECTIVE: Dietary phosphate restriction is one of the means of phosphatemia control in dialysis patients. To limit dietary phosphate intake, appropriate food choices are recommended, but this often creates a conflict with the high-normal protein requirement of dialysis patients. Although food processing by boiling may be a safe tool for eliminating many minerals, this method poses a risk for loss of important nutrients, including proteins. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of boiling on phosphate and protein nitrogen changes in commonly used foods that contain proteins of high biological value. METHODS: We evaluated the true retention values of dry matter, crude protein, and total <e>phosphorus</e> in fresh beef and chicken breast before and after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of boiling; the reported values represent the average of five determinations. RESULTS: Compared with crude raw samples, dry matter retention in cooked beef was reduced up to 92% +/- 6%, crude protein retention was reduced up to 87% +/- 10%, and phosphorous retention was reduced up to 42% +/- 13%; similar data were obtained when boiling the chicken breast, 93% +/- 3%, 81% +/- 4%, and 63% +/- 6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that consuming boiled foods can significantly reduce dietary phosphate while preserving protein intake, namely reducing the effective phosphate intake per gram of dietary protein. This can represent additional advice to the patient for limiting the dietary phosphorus load at the same protein intake, leading to a better control of phosphate balance together with a lower risk of protein malnutrition.",M1
16411340,"[Enhanced expression of EGFR, TGF-alpha, EGF in hyperplastic parathyroid glands in established stage of renal failure in rats]It was reported that the parathyroid gland hyperplasia correlated with enhanced co-expression of TGF-alpha and its receptor EGFR at early stages of renal failure.

The levels of EGFR, EGF, TGF-alpha mRNA in rat PTGs were increased for the time periods. The serum intact PTH levels, and EGFR, EGFmRNA in rat PTGs were suppressed in normal-P diet group. Nuclei positive cells for PCNA in TKI group were suppressed. The levels of p21mRNA were increased in TKI group. These results suggested that the enhanced expression of EGFR, TGF-alpha and EGF participate in the cell proliferation of hyperplastic PTGs in established stage of renal failure.",M1

16277767,"High-<e>phosphorus</e> diet stimulates receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand mRNA expression by increasing parathyroid hormone secretion in rats.The purpose of the present study was to clarify the manner by which the supplementation of high-P diet induces bone loss. Eighteen 4-week-old male Wistar-strain rats were assigned randomly to three groups and fed diets containing three P levels (0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 %) for 21 d. A lower serum Ca concentration was observed in the rats fed on the 1.5 % P diet than in the other two groups. Serum P and parathyroid hormone concentrations and urinary excretion of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were elevated with increasing dietary P levels. Serum osteocalcin concentration was increased in the rats fed on the 1.5 % P diet than in the other two groups. Bone formation rate of the lumbar vertebra was significantly increased in the two high-P groups than in the 0.3 % P group. Osteoclast number was significantly increased with increasing dietary P levels. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density of the femur and lumbar vertebra and ultimate compression load of the lumbar vertebra were decreased with increasing dietary P levels. Additionally, ultimate bending load of the femur was decreased in the rats fed on the 1.5 % P diet than in the other two groups. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the femur was significantly higher with increasing dietary P levels. These results suggest that secondary hyperparathyroidism due to a high-P diet leads to bone loss via an increase in bone turnover. Furthermore, an increase in osteoclast number was caused by increased RANKL mRNA expression.",M1
16268105,"Evaluation of phytase concentration needed for growing-finishing commercial turkey toms.1. Growth performance, serum bone markers, and bone strength and mineralisation were determined in tom turkeys grown from 9 to 17 weeks of age. 2. Dietary non-phytate <e>phosphorus</e> was formulated to be reduced by 1.0 g/kg in the low phosphorus diet compared to a control diet and phytase was added to provide 0, 150, 300, 450 or 600 units/kg activity to the low phosphorus diet. 3. From 9 to 12 weeks of age, body weight and gain:food were reduced by the low phosphorus diet without added phytase, compared to the adequate phosphorus diet. Increasing the concentration of phytase linearly increased these growth parameters. There were no significant growth responses at 17 weeks of age. 4. Serum osteocalcin was reduced by increasing dietary phosphorus at 12 weeks of age when growth was affected, but not at later ages. Serum pyridinoline was reduced by higher dietary phosphorus and decreased linearly with increasing phytase activity at 17 weeks of age. 5. Fracture force of the ulna and femur increased linearly with increasing phytase activity but bone strength was not affected when corrected for bone cross-sectional area. Bone strength of the ulna and ash concentration of the ulna and tibia were increased by higher dietary phosphorus. Humerus and ulna ash increased linearly with increasing phytase activity. 6. Water-soluble phosphorus content of the litter was increased by higher dietary phosphorus and addition of phytase to the low phosphorus diet. The increase in water-soluble phosphorus content of the litter when phytase was fed may indicate that phosphorus could be fed at a lower concentration than used in this trial, at least in the finisher diet when phytase is added to the food. 7. Bone fracture force, strength and ash were generally optimised when 450 units/kg phytase activity was added to the low phosphorus diet. However, growth performance was best in the grower I (9 to 12 weeks) phase when 600 units/kg phytase was added to the diet.",M1

Cobb x Cobb broiler chicks were raised from 0 to 16 d in 2 experiments using corn-soybean meal based diets. Experiment 1 used a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement with diets formulated to contain combinations of 4 levels of Ca: 0.38, 0.58, 0.78, and 0.98% and 4 levels of NPP: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5%. Experiment 2 used a composite rotatable design in which rations were formulated to contain dietary Ca levels of 0.38, 0.47, 0.68, 0.89, and 0.98% and NPP levels of 0.20, 0.24, 0.35, 0.46, and 0.50%. An extra point was included in the design to contain the lowest Ca and lowest NPP levels (0.38% Ca and 0.20% NPP). All combinations of Ca and NPP were fed with 657 phytase units/kg Natuphos 5000 phytase, plus 4 combinations (0.38% Ca and 0.20% NPP, 0.47% Ca and 0.24% NPP, 0.68% Ca and 0.35% NPP, and 0.89% Ca and 0.46% NPP) were fed without phytase to determine the suitability of comparing multiple regression response surfaces for particular variables among experiments. Comparison of surfaces, with and without phytase, showed that growth and bone quality responses to phytase were greatest at low NPP levels and high Ca levels, and these decreased when the Ca level was reduced or when the NPP level was increased. A third experiment confirmed that phytase elicits a greater response at higher Ca levels and lower NPP levels (0.86% Ca and 0.20% NPP) versus low Ca levels and low NPP levels (0.47% Ca and 0.24% NPP). The data demonstrated why it is impossible to determine a single NPP equivalency value for phytase supplements.",M1

Inorganic phosphorus, P(i), is determined using a 1 x 10(-2) mol.L(-1) potassium phthalate buffer solution adjusted at pH 4. A sensitivity of 47 mV/decade and an operating range from 10 to 1000 mg.L(-1) (1 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-2) M) of dihydrogen phosphate are obtained. The inositol phosphates amount, which is referred to the organic phosphorus, P(org), is directly determined from extracts using a 1 x 10(-2) mol.L(-1) Tris-HCl buffer solution adjusted at pH 8. A sensitivity of 127 mV/decade and an operating range of 10-1000 mg.L(-1) (2.5 x 10(-4)-5 x 10(-3) M) of P(org) (expressed as inositol hexakisphosphoric acid monocalcium) are achieved. Some samples of seed and grain are analyzed by an ICP-OES and a spectrophotometric method to compare results to the developed flow system; no significant differences at the 95% confidence level are observed using a paired t test.

The AID and the standardized ileal digestibility coefficients (SID) of CP and AA also were determined. The animals (initial BW = 29.3 +/- 1 kg) were allotted to a 9 x 9 Latin square with nine diets and nine periods. Three diets contained low-phytate corn, normal corn, and soybean meal as their sole source of CP, AA, Ca, and P, respectively. Three additional diets were identical to these diets except that limestone and monosodium phosphate were added. Two diets contained low-phytate corn or normal corn and soybean meal, limestone, and monosodium phosphate, and the final diet was a N-free diet. The AID and ATTD of Ca were higher (P &lt; 0.05) for low-phytate corn than for normal corn (70.0 and 69.1% vs. 47.4 and 49.6%, respectively). The AID and ATTD for Ca in soybean meal (50.9 and 46.7%, respectively) did not differ from values for normal corn but were lower (P &lt; 0.05) than for low-phytate corn. The AID and ATTD for P from low-phytate corn (56.5 and 54.5%, respectively) were greater (P &lt; 0.05) than from normal corn (28.3 and 28.8%, respectively), whereas soybean meal had intermediate AID and ATTD for P (37.2 and 38.0%, respectively). The AID and ATTD of P increased (P &lt; 0.05) when monosodium phosphate was added to normal corn (44.9 and 49.8%, respectively) and soybean meal (49.6 and 46.2%, respectively), but adding monosodium phosphate to low-phytate corn, did not alter either AID (49.7%) or ATTD (50.7%) of P. No differences between AID and ATTD for Ca or P within the same diet were observed. The AID of Arg, Asp, Gly, Ile, Lys, Phe, Thr, and Val were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in low-phytate corn than in normal corn. The AID of all AA in soybean meal were greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in both types of corn, with the exception of Ala, Cys, Leu, and Met. The SID of Lys, Phe, and Thr were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in low-phytate corn than in normal corn. Because low-phytate corn has a higher digestibility of Ca and P, less inorganic Ca and P need to be supplemented to diets containing low-phytate corn than to those containing normal corn, and P excretion may be decreased when low-phytate corn is used in the diet.",M1

Treatments 1 to 6 were NRC (1994) NPP (C); University of Maryland (UMD) NPP; UMD NPP - 0.064% (UMD+PHY); UMD NPP - 0.09% (UMD+PHY+25D); NRC - 0.10% (C+PHY), and 90% UMD NPP (NC), respectively. Treatments 3, 4, and 5 had 600 U of PHY/kg of diet. Treatment 4 also had 70 microg of 25D/kg of diet; NPP concentrations were reduced to account for the sparing effect of these additives. No differences in hatch to 49 d BW were observed between treatments in Exp 1 and 2, and only in Exp 3 were the BW of the NC broilers (2.86 kg) different (P &lt; 0.05) from those fed the C, UMD, and UMD+PHY treatments (2.96, 2.94, and 2.98 kg, respectively). Cumulative NPP consumption per bird was lowest (P &lt; 0.05) for broilers fed the UMD+PHY+25D treatment (8.65 g in Exp 3) compared with those fed the C, NC, UMD, and UMD+PHY treatments (18.19, 10.60, 13.63, and 11.01 g, respectively for Exp 3). Application of any of these treatments reduced total P and NPP consumption compared with C. The results of this series of floor pen Exp validate the UMD NPP recommendations for a 4-phase feed program and the PHY and 25D NPP-sparing effects observed in battery trials without negatively affecting broiler performance.",M1
16041577,"Biotechnological production and applications of phytases.Phytases decompose phytate, which is the primary storage form of phosphate in plants. More than 10 years ago, the first commercial phytase product became available on the market. It offered to help farmers reduce <e>phosphorus</e> excretion of monogastric animals by replacing inorganic phosphates by microbial phytase in the animal diet. Phytase application can reduce phosphorus excretion by up to 50%, a feat that would contribute significantly toward environmental protection. Furthermore, phytase supplementation leads to improved availability of minerals and trace elements. In addition to its major application in animal nutrition, phytase is also used for processing of human food. Research in this field focuses on better mineral absorption and technical improvement of food processing. All commercial phytase preparations contain microbial enzymes produced by fermentation. A wide variety of phytases were discovered and characterized in the last 10 years. Initial steps to produce phytase in transgenic plants were also undertaken. A crucial role for its commercial success relates to the formulation of the enzyme solution delivered from fermentation. For liquid enzyme products, a long shelf life is achieved by the addition of stabilizing agents. More comfortable for many customers is the use of dry enzyme preparations. Different formulation technologies are used to produce enzyme powders that retain enzyme activity, are stable in application, resistant against high temperatures, dust-free, and easy to handle.",M1
15998841,"A critical role for enhanced TGF-alpha and EGFR expression in the initiation of parathyroid hyperplasia in experimental kidney disease.The parathyroid hyperplasia secondary to kidney disease is associated with enhanced expression of the growth promoter transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). TGF-alpha stimulates growth through activation of its receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), normally expressed in the parathyroid glands. Because enhanced coexpression of TGF-alpha and EGFR causes aggressive cellular growth, these studies utilized highly specific inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase, a step mandatory for TGF-alpha-induced EGFR activation, to assess the contribution of growth signals from enhanced expression of TGF-alpha exclusively or both TGF-alpha and EGFR to the rapid parathyroid growth induced by kidney disease and exacerbated by high-<e>phosphorus</e> (P) and low-calcium (Ca) diets in rats. The enhancement in parathyroid gland weight and proliferating activity (proliferating cell nuclear antigen/Ki67) induced by kidney disease and aggravated by either high P or low Ca intake, within the first week after 5/6 nephrectomy, in rats, coincided with simultaneous increases (2- to 3-fold) in TGF-alpha and EGFR content. Conversely, prevention of the increases in both TGF-alpha and EGFR paralleled the efficacy of either P restriction or high-Ca intake in ameliorating uremia-induced parathyroid hyperplasia. More importantly, suppression of TGF-alpha/EGFR signaling, through prophylactic administration of potent and highly selective inhibitors of ligand-induced EGFR activation, completely prevented both high-P- and low-Ca-induced parathyroid hyperplasia as well as TGF-alpha self-upregulation. Thus enhanced parathyroid TGF-alpha/EGFR expression, self-upregulation, and growth signals occur early in kidney disease, are aggravated by low-Ca and high-P intake, and constitute the main pathogenic mechanism of the severity of parathyroid hyperplasia.",M1
15967248,"Dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D, <e>phosphorus</e> and the risk of prostate cancer.OBJECTIVES: A relation of prostate cancer risk with calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus has been suggested, but remains controversial. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Italy in 1991-2002. Cases were 1294 men with incident prostate cancer, and controls were 1451 men admitted to hospital for acute non-neoplastic diseases. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared to the lowest one quintile of dietary calcium intake the OR was 1.18 for the highest, 1.01 for an increment of 622 mg/day of calcium, and 1.29 (95% CI 0.78-2.13) for 2000 mg/day or more of calcium. The OR of prostate cancer for the highest quintile of dietary intake of vitamin D and phosphorus were 1.33 and 1.20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no material association of dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus with prostate cancer risk.",M1
15914926,"Effects of dietary <e>phosphorus</e> intake on bone mineralization and calcium absorption in adult female rats.We investigated the effects of dietary phosphorus (P) intake on the bone mineralization and calcium (Ca) absorption in adult female rats. Fifteen 16-wk-old female Wistar rats were divided into three groups, and respectively fed a low-P diet containing 0.15% P (LP), a control diet containing 0.5% P (C), and a high-P diet containing 1.5% P (HP) for 42 d. The apparent Ca absorption was significantly increased with decreasing dietary P level. The serum parathyroid hormone concentration was significantly lower in the LP group than in the C and HP groups. The serum osteocalcin concentration and urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline were significantly higher in the HP groups than in the LP and C groups. The bone mineral density of the fifth lumbar vertebra was significantly increased with decreasing dietary P level. These results indicate that the low-P diet increased Ca absorption, this being effective for bone mineralization in adult female rats.",M1
20572461,"Interaction between denitrification and <e>phosphorus</e> removal in a sequencing batch reactor phosphorus removal system.Batch experiments were performed to investigate simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal by denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms (DNPAO). The results showed that while using the same amount of carbon source, DNPAOs are able to uptake phosphorus by using nitrate as an electron acceptor. It was observed that higher nitrate concentration required a longer anoxic period for denitrifying phosphate uptake. In addition, the effect of the presence of nitrate in substrate was studied. Phosphorus release occurred as long as substrate was present in the anaerobic phase regardless of nitrate concentrations. It also was noticed that nitrate hindered the release of phosphorus in the anaerobic stage because of denitrifiers competing with phosphorus accumulating organisms for their carbon source. The DNPAOs, however, remained competitive in a system with nitrate in the anaerobic phase.",M2
20558539,"Common genetic variants associate with serum <e>phosphorus</e> concentration.Phosphorus is an essential mineral that maintains cellular energy and mineralizes the skeleton. Because complex actions of ion transporters and regulatory hormones regulate serum phosphorus concentrations, genetic variation may determine interindividual variation in phosphorus metabolism. Here, we report a comprehensive genome-wide association study of serum phosphorus concentration. We evaluated 16,264 participants of European ancestry from the Cardiovascular Heath Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Framingham Offspring Study, and the Rotterdam Study. We excluded participants with an estimated GFR &lt;45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to focus on phosphorus metabolism under normal conditions. We imputed genotypes to approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HapMap and combined study-specific findings using meta-analysis. We tested top polymorphisms from discovery cohorts in a 5444-person replication sample. Polymorphisms in seven loci with minor allele frequencies 0.08 to 0.49 associate with serum phosphorus concentration (P = 3.5 x 10(-16) to 3.6 x 10(-7)). Three loci were near genes encoding the kidney-specific type IIa sodium phosphate co-transporter (SLC34A1), the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), proteins that contribute to phosphorus metabolism. We also identified genes encoding phosphatases, kinases, and phosphodiesterases that have yet-undetermined roles in phosphorus homeostasis. In the replication sample, five of seven top polymorphisms associate with serum phosphorous concentrations (P &lt; 0.05 for each). In conclusion, common genetic variants associate with serum phosphorus in the general population. Further study of the loci identified in this study may help elucidate mechanisms of phosphorus regulation.",M2
20536816,"Nitrogen enrichment and plant communities.Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment of many ecosystems throughout the globe has important ramifications for plant communities. Observational and experimental studies frequently find species richness declines with N enrichment, in concert with increasing primary production. Nitrogen enrichment also reorders species composition, including species turnover through gains and losses of species, changes in dominance and rarity, and shifts in the relative abundance of particular functional groups. Nitrogen has traditionally been considered the primary limiting nutrient for plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems, but recent synthetic work suggests that colimitation by <e>phosphorus</e> (P), water, and other resources is widespread, consistent with theoretical predictions. At the same time, disproportionate increases in ecosystem N input are expected to exacerbate limitation by P and other resources. Similarly, synthetic research has pointed out the important role of consumers and pathogens in determining plant community structure, especially with respect to shifting resource availability. We argue here that environmental and biotic contexts, including limitation by multiple resources, herbivores and pathogens, play important roles in our understanding of plant community responses to N enrichment.",M2
20529605,"[The effect of one year therapy with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on growth velocity, calcium-<e>phosphorus</e> metabolism, bone mineral density and changes in body composition in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD)]INTRODUCTION: The most significant effect of growth hormone treatment is growth promotion. For adults the metabolic effect is the most important. This treatment has an influence on the forming of correct composition of body mass, on metabolism of osseous tissue and bone mineral density. AIM OF THE STUDY: Comparison between the rate of growth and estimation of calcium-phosphorus metabolism, bone mineral density and change of body composition in children with growth hormone deficiency during the first year of growth hormone treatment. Material and methods: The treatment included 120 children and adolescents (85 boys and 35 girls) in age from 6 to 21.5 years old (the average age: 14.2+/-3.0) who were treated in Dept. of Endocrinology and Diabetology for Children and Adolescents during the years 2002-2006 as a result of growth hormone deficiency. Children suffering from panhypopituitarism and other diseases were excluded from the research. The following parameters were included in the analysis: age and sex, age at the start of treatment, the degree of growth hormone deficiency, concentration of calcium, magnesium and phosphates in blood serum, mineral density of bones (BMD), the concentration of osseous minerals, concentration of adipose tissue and lean body mass. All the children were treated with recombined human growth hormone (rhGH) in dose of 0.7 j/kg per week. No interruption of the treatment was noticed. RESULTS: Partial growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was diagnosed in the group of 71 children (52 boys and 19 girls), total GHD diagnosed in 49 cases (34 boys and 15 girls). Average age at the start of treatment was 11.7+/-2.9 years. During the first year of treatment the rate of growing increases from 3.9+/-1,1 cm per year before treatment to 8.72+/-2.27 cm per year (p&lt;0.01) for the whole examined group, for girls from 3.8+/-1.2 cm per year to 8.77 cm per year (p&lt;0.01), for boys from 3.2+/-1.3 per year to 8.58+/-2.20 cm per year (p&lt;0.01). Average concentrations of calcium, magnesium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in blood serum remain in accordance with laboratory standards and were statistically not significant. In the majority of patients LBM increased significantly from 28 689+/-4423 g to 35 549.09+/-2968 g (p&lt;0,05) and FM decreased from 21 070+/-4019,8 g (33,15+/-7,6%) to 19 075.37+/-4307,3 g (26.15+/-8.6%) (p&lt;0.05).

20486436,"Effects of iron on growth and intracellular chemical contents of Microcystis aeruginosa.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of iron on the growth, physiology and photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. METHODS: A gradient of iron concentrations was employed to investigate the growth, photo-pigments (chlorophyll A and phycocyanin), and cell chemical contents (C, N, P) of Microcystis aeruginosa in response to different iron additions. RESULTS: The specific growth rate during the exponential growth phase, as well as the cell chlorophyll A and the phycocyanin content, was limited by iron below 12.3 tmol Fe x L(-1). The growth was inhibited when the iron concentration was at 24.6 micromol Fe x L(-1). The cell chlorophyll A and the phycocyanin content were saturated when the iron concentration was above 12.3 micromol Fe x L(-1) and declined slightly at 24.6 micromol Fe x L(-1). At a low iron concentration (about 6.15 micromol Fe x L(-1) and less), the cell nitrogen and carbohydrate content were iron limited, and the variation of the cell <e>phosphorus</e> content was similar to that of the nitrogen and carbohydrate, with a transition point of 12.3 micromol Fe x L(-1). CONCLUSION: The variation of cynobacteria growth is synchronous with that of the photo-pigments or the cell chemical content, and there exist relationships among photosynthesis, growth and internal chemical content, which could be useful for the growth estimation from the cell characteristics.",M2

Developing dietetic measures for these cattle was the primary aim of this study. The feeding experiments were focused on the general effects of varying the crude fibre supply and adding CaCl2 as a urine acidifier, especially concerning individual reactions to the different diets. Five standard balance trials were performed with three fattening bulls. The crude fibre content in the ration varied between 14.8% and 24.0% DM. In two trials, coated CaCl2 was fed (per day 20 g/100 kg BW). Influences on the macro mineral metabolism and the acid-base-balance were investigated. Unexpectedly, the crude fibre content had no significant effect on the renal P excretion, but individual differences occurred concerning digestibility, renal excretion and serum concentration of P: one bull constantly showed significantly higher values. Adding CaCl2 resulted in reduced renal P excretion and pH values of the urine (&lt; 6.5). Thus, using CaCl2 might be a beneficial dietetic measure for preventing struvite. The huge individual differences in the P metabolism could be linked to genetically-based variations, as known for sheep.",M2
20480829,"Model-based evaluation of microbial mass fractions: effect of absolute anaerobic reaction time on microbial mass fractions.Although enhanced biological <e>phosphorus</e> removal processes (EBPR) are popular methods for nutrient control, unstable treatment performances of full-scale systems are still not well understood. In this study, the interaction between electron acceptors present at the start of the anaerobic phase of an EBPR system and the amount of organic acids generated from simple substrate (rbsCOD) was investigated in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Quantification of microbial groups including phosphorus-accumulating microorganisms (PAOs), denitrifying PAOs (DPAOs), glycogen-accumulating microorganisms (GAOs) and ordinary heterotrophic microorganisms (OHOs) was based on a modified dynamic model. The intracellular phosphorus content of PAOs was also determined by the execution of mass balances for the biological stages of the plant. The EBPR activities observed in the plant and in batch tests (under idealized conditions) were compared with each other statistically as well. Modelling efforts indicated that the use of absolute anaerobic reaction (eta1) instead of nominal anaerobic reaction time (eta), to estimate the amount of available substrate for PAOs, significantly improved model accuracy. Another interesting result of the study was the differences in EBPR characteristics observed in idealized and real conditions.",M2
20480759,"Water treatment plant sludge discharge to wastewater treatment works: effects on the operation of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and activated sludge systems.This experiment examined the effects of the discharge of water treatment plant (WTP) sludge into the following three types of wastewater treatment systems: a pilot-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, a pilot-scale activated sludge system, and a full-scale activated sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The UASB reactor received 50 mg of suspended solids (SS) of WTP sludge per liter of wastewater in the first phase, and, in the second phase, it received 75 mg SS/L. The pilot-scale activated sludge system received 25 and 50 mg SS/L in the first and second phases, respectively. The full-scale WWTP (SBR) received approximately 74 mg SS/L. The results of the experiments showed that, despite some negative effects on nitrification, there were positive effects on <e>phosphorus</e> removal, and, furthermore, there was the addition of solids in all systems.",M2

Two hundred fifty-six ducks were grouped by weight into 8 blocks of 8 cages with 4 ducks per cage. The 8 diets consisted of a P-adequate positive control corn-soybean meal formulated to contain CP, Ca, total P, and nonphytate P at 220, 8, 6.6, and 4 g/kg, respectively; a low-P negative control (NC) corn-soybean meal basal diet formulated to contain CP, Ca, total P, and nonphytate P at 220, 6.5, 3.9, and 1.3 g/kg, respectively; NC diet plus 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 g of inorganic P from monosodium phosphate/kg; and NC diet plus E. coli phytase at 500, 1,000, or 1,500 units/kg. Ducks were provided ad libitum access to water and experimental diets. Feeding the low-P NC diet to ducks reduced (P&lt;0.01) BW gain, feed intake, G:F, tibia ash, ileal digestibility, and utilization of P. Supplementation of the NC diet with inorganic P or phytase linearly improved (P&lt;0.01) final weight, BW gain, feed intake, G:F, tibia ash, and ileal P digestibility. There were linear increases (P&lt;0.01) in the utilization of P from 33.8 to 42% or from 33.8 to 46.6% as dietary added inorganic P or phytase increased from 0 to 1.5 g/kg or 0 to 1,500 units/kg, respectively. Linear regression equations for the tibia ash as the dependent variable and supplemental intake of inorganic P and phytase or supplemental level of inorganic P and phytase as independent variables were used to generate P equivalency values of phytase. The mean P equivalency values of phytase from linear regression equations derived from ducks fed a low-P NC diet supplemented with graded levels of inorganic P or phytase from d 7 to 17 posthatch for 500, 1,000, and 1,500 phytase units/kg of diet were 0.453, 0.847, and 1.242 g/kg of diet, respectively. The results of this study showed that this phytase was efficacious in hydrolyzing phytate P for bone mineralization and growth of ducks.",M2
20434190,"Iron salts dosage for sulfide control in sewers induces chemical <e>phosphorus</e> removal during wastewater treatment.Chemical phosphorus (P) removal during aerobic wastewater treatment induced by iron salt addition in sewer systems for sulfide control is investigated. Aerobic batch tests with activated sludge fed with wastewater containing iron sulfide precipitates showed that iron sulfide was rapidly reoxidised in aerobic conditions, resulting in phosphate precipitation. The amount of P removed was proportional to the amount of iron salts added, and for the sludge used, ratios of 0.44 and 0.37 mgP/mgFe were obtained for ferric and ferrous dosages, respectively. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of iron sulfide in sewers was found to have a crucial impact on the settling of iron sulfide precipitates during primary settling, with a shorter HRT resulting in a higher concentration of iron sulfide in the primary effluent and thus enabling higher P removal. A mathematical model was developed to describe iron sulfide oxidation in aerated activated sludge and the subsequent iron phosphate precipitation. The model was used to optimise FeCl(3) dosing in a real wastewater collection and treatment system. Simulation studies revealed that, by moving FeCl(3) dosing from the WWTP, which is the current practice, to a sewer location upstream of the plant, both sulfide control and phosphate removal could be achieved with the current ferric salt consumption. This work highlights the importance of integrated management of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants.",M2

SUBJECTS &amp; INTERVENTIONS: Chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 16) and age and sex matched normal controls (n = 8) underwent <e>phosphorus</e> magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to evaluate pH handling during exercise. Subjects performed plantar flexion at fixed 35% load maximum voluntary contraction. Heart rate variability was performed during 10 min supine rest using digital photophlethysmography as a measure of autonomic function. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, the CFS/ME group had significant suppression of proton efflux both immediately postexercise (CFS: 1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol L(-1) min(-1) vs. normal: 3.6 +/- 1.5 mmol L(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.001) and maximally (CFS: 2.7 +/- 3.4 mmol L(-1) min(-1) vs. control: 3.8 +/- 1.6 mmol L(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the time taken to reach maximum proton efflux was significantly prolonged in patients (CFS: 25.6 +/- 36.1 s vs. normal: 3.8 +/- 5.2 s, P &lt; 0.05). In controls the rate of maximum proton efflux showed a strong inverse correlation with nadir muscle pH following exercise (r(2) = 0.6; P &lt; 0.01). In CFS patients, in contrast, this significant normal relationship was lost (r(2) = 0.003; P = ns). In normal individuals, the maximum proton efflux following exercise were closely correlated with total heart rate variability (r(2) = 0.7; P = 0.007) this relationship was lost in CFS/ME patients (r(2) &lt; 0.001; P = ns). CONCLUSION: Patients with CFS/ME have abnormalities in recovery of intramuscular pH following standardised exercise degree of which is related to autonomic dysfunction. This study identifies a novel biological abnormality in patients with CFS/ME which is potentially open to modification.",M2
20429469,"Photosynthesis and yield reductions from wheat stem sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae): interactions with wheat solidness, water stress, and <e>phosphorus</e> deficiency.The impact of herbivory on plants is variable and influenced by several factors. The current study examined causes of variation in the impact of larval stem mining by the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), on spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L. We performed greenhouse experiments over 2 yr to (1) study whether biotic (hollow versus solid stemmed host wheat) and abiotic (water, phosphorus stress) factors interact with C. cinctus stem mining to influence degree of mined stem physiological (photosynthesis) and yield (grain weight) reductions; and (2) determine whether whole plant yield compensatory responses occur to offset stem-mining reductions. Flag leaf photosynthetic reduction was not detected 16-20 d after infestation, but were detected at 40-42 d and doubled from water or phosphorus stresses. Main stem grain weight decreased from 10 to 25% from stem mining, largely due to reductions in grain size, with greater reductions under low phosphorus and/or water levels. Phosphorus-deficient plants without water stress were most susceptible to C. cinctus, more than doubling the grain weight reduction due to larval feeding relative to other water and phosphorus treatments. Two solid stemmed varieties with stem mining had less grain weight loss than a hollow stemmed variety, so greater internal mechanical resistance may reduce larval stem mining and plant yield reductions. Our results emphasize the importance of sufficient water and macronutrients for plants grown in regions impacted by C. cinctus. Also, solid stemmed varieties not only reduce wheat lodging from C. cinctus, they may reduce harvested grain losses from infested stems.",M2
20426329,"Scaling plant nitrogen use and uptake efficiencies in response to nutrient addition in peatlands.Nitrogen (N) is the primary growth-limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems, and therefore plant production per unit N taken up (i.e., N use efficiency, NUE) is a fundamentally important component of ecosystem function. Nitrogen use efficiency comprises two components: N productivity (A(N), plant production per peak biomass N content) and the mean residence time of N in plant biomass (MRT(N)). We utilized a five-year fertilization experiment to examine the manner in which increases in N and <e>phosphorus</e> (P) availability affected plant NUE at multiple biological scales (i.e., from leaf to community level). We fertilized a natural gradient of nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, with 6 g N x m(-2) x yr(-1), 2 g P x m(-2) x yr(-1), or a combination of N and P. Our objectives were to determine how changes in carbon and N allocation within a plant to leaf and woody tissue and changes in species composition within a community, both above- and belowground, would affect (1) NUE; (2) the adaptive trade-off between the components of NUE; (3) the efficiency with which plants acquired N from the soil (N uptake efficiency); and (4) plant community production per unit soil N availability (N response efficiency, NRE). As expected, N and P addition generally increased aboveground production and N uptake. In particular, P availability strongly affected the way in which plants took up and used N. Nitrogen use efficiency response to nutrient addition was not straightforward. Nitrogen use efficiency differed between leaf and woody tissue, among species, and across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient because plants and communities were adapted to maximize either A(N) or MRT(N), but not both concurrently. Increased N availability strongly decreased plant and community N uptake efficiency, while increased P availability increased N uptake efficiency, particularly in a nitrogen-fixing shrub. Nitrogen uptake efficiency was more important in controlling overall plant community response to soil N availability than was NUE, and above- and belowground community N uptake efficiencies responded to nutrient addition in a similar manner. Our results demonstrate that plants respond to nutrient availability at multiple biological scales, and we suggest that N uptake efficiency may be a more representative measurement of plant responses to nutrient availability gradients than plant NUE.",M2
20426270,"Effect of cycle changes on simultaneous biological nutrient removal in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR).The destabilization of a microbial population is sometimes hard to solve when different biological reactions are coupled in the same reactor as in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). This paper will try to guide through practical experiences the recovery of simultaneous nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e> removal in an SBR after increasing the demand of wastewater treatment by taking advantage of its flexibility. The results demonstrate that the length of phases and the optimization of influent distribution are key factors in stabilizing the system for long-term periods with high nutrient removal (88%, 93% and 99% of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively). In order to recover a biological nutrient removal (BNR) system, different interactions such as simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and also phosphorus removal must be taken into account. As a general conclusion, it can be stated there is no such thing as a perfect SBR operation, and that much will depend on the state of the BNR system. Hence, the SBR operating strategy must be based on a dynamic cycle definition in line with process efficiency.",M2
20421234,"Multiple adaptive responses of Australian native perennial legumes with pasture potential to grow in <e>phosphorus</e>- and moisture-limited environments.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many Australian legumes have evolved in low-phosphorus (P) soils and low-rainfall areas. Therefore a study was made of the interaction of soil [P] and water availability on growth, photosynthesis, water-use efficiency (WUE) and P nutrition of two Australian native legumes with pasture potential, Cullen australasicum and C. pallidum, and the widely grown exotic pasture legume, lucerne (Medicago sativa). METHODS: Plants were grown in a glasshouse at 3, 10 and 30 mg P kg(-1) dry soil for 5 months. At week 10, two drought treatments were imposed, total pot dried (all-dry) and only top soil dried (top-dry), while control pots were maintained at field capacity. KEY RESULTS: Shoot dry weight produced by lucerne was never higher than that of C. australasicum. For C. pallidum only, shoot dry weight was reduced at 30 mg P kg(-1) dry soil. The small root system of the Cullen species was quite plastic, allowing plants to access P and moisture efficiently. Lucerne always had a higher proportion of its large root system in the top soil layer compared with Cullen species. All species showed decreased photosynthesis, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance when exposed to drought, but the reductions were less for Cullen species, due to tighter stomatal control, and consequently they achieved a higher WUE. All species showed highest rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations in the all-dry treatment. For lucerne only, carboxylates decreased as P supply increased. Citrate was the main carboxylate in the control and top-dry treatments, and malate in the all-dry treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple adaptive responses of Cullen species and lucerne favoured exploitation of low-P soils under drought. The performance of undomesticated Cullen species, relative to that of lucerne, shows their promise as pasture species for environments such as in south-western Australia where water and P are limiting, especially in view of a predicted drying and warming climate.",M2

The analysis involved 40 female standard chinchillas managed in a commercial farm system, aged 2 to 4 years, divided into two groups of 20 individuals each: D--chinchillas with incisor overgrowth and C--controls with normal dentition. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, and P were measured in blood plasma. The analysis was carried out using ICP OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) by means of the Optima 2000 DV instrument (Perkin Elmer). The resulting data were analysed statistically using one-way ANOVA with Duncan's range test. The results show that abnormal metabolism of dental tissue minerals, especially Ca and P, cannot be excluded as the cause of tooth overgrowth in chinchilla.",M2
20418630,"Biological nitrogen removal in a step-feed CAST with real-time control treating municipal wastewater.The performance of a 18 L step-feed cyclic activated sludge technology (CAST) combined with real-time control treating real municipal wastewater was evaluated. The operation strategies employed pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) as on-line control parameters, which can control the durations of oxic and anoxic phases flexibly. The obtained results showed that the studied process had achieved advanced and enhanced nitrogen removal by several phases of consecutive oxic/anoxic periods. Total nitrogen in effluent was lower than 2 mg/L and the average TN removal efficiency was higher than 98%, while only requiring small amount of external carbon source. Unexpected characteristic points in pH and ORP profiles denoting the depletion of nitrate were also observed during the last anoxic phase. Denitrification rate was found to be more dependent on the system temperature compared to nitrification rate. Moreover, a stable and efficient <e>phosphorus</e> removal rate above 90% was achieved by using step-feed strategy which enabled the influent carbon source to be fully used and the favourable condition for phosphorus releasing to be created during the anoxic phases.",M2
20415059,"[Fish in renal patient's diet: <e>phosphorus</e>: n-3 fatty acids ratio]OBJECTIVE: To identify between 24 marine fish species the most beneficial to renal patient evaluating its phosphorus:n-3 fatty acids ratio. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15 fishes of each specie were randomly selected; they were filleted and homogenized to take 100 g to carry out the chemical analysis by triplicate. Crude protein (Pr) was analyzed in kjeltec equipment. Potassium and calcium was detected by atomic absorption and phosphorus (P) in an UV/ Visible spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Crude protein (g/100 g) values varied from 15 (pompano) up to 28.2 (big head tile-fish). The fishes with highest (P) (mg/100 g) content were pompano (287), Spanish mackerel (274), king mackerel (257), big head tile-fish (255) and pacific barracuda (252). The specie with the lowest ratio (P): n-3 PUFA was slender frostfish (0.09), followed by albacore (0.17), king mackerel (0.40) and Spanish mackerel; the highest was blue bobo (45.20). Fishes with a high n-3 PUFA/g Pr content were albacore (71.20), king mackerel (35.96), Spanish mackerel (32.50) and rooster hind (2.76). Differences were significant (p &lt; 0.05), in (P) content, in fishes classified by the fat content in muscle (mg P/100 g): lean fishes (193), semi fatty fishes (235) and fatty fishes (244). CONCLUSIONS: None of the following fishes are recommended in renal patient's diet by it lowest contribution of n-3PUFA/g of Pr: blue bobo, yellowedge grouper, parrot sandbass. It is suggested to include chilhuil sea catfish, broomtail grouper, yellow tail snapper, southern flounder, parrot sand bass and big head tilefish by their low content of P/g Pr. The following species included regularly in the diet at least thrice a week could be considered beneficial to the general health status of patients.",M2

20408005,"Biological and chemical <e>phosphorus</e> fractionalization in swine manure under aeration.In this work, the dynamic responses of different phosphorous factions in swine manure to aeration treatment were investigated and profiled to provide insight on potential ways to improve the biological phosphorus removal process. Batch reactors fabricated from clear acrylic columns were filled with fresh swine manure containing a 4.6 % solids content, which was aerated continuously for 15 days at an airflow rate of 2 L/min. The results indicate that the treatment can reduce soluble phosphorus (P) by about 78 % after only one-day aeration due largely to chemical precipitations. At the end of the experiment, the average soluble inorganic P level was reduced by 12 % (from 91 down to 79 %), while the average soluble organic P was increased by 13 % (from 9 to 22 %). The biomass P (DNA/RNA/poly-P) was increased by 24 % in the first three days, but only by 14 % in the rest 12 days of aeration. Also increased by aeration was the lipid P (47 %) but not the protein P. The data reveal that the current aeration rate cannot maintain a stable oxygen level [represented by the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)] in the treated manure, evidenced by the decrease in ORP from 250 mV at the beginning to almost zero at the conclusion of the experiment, which is considered the major factor hindering the growth of aerobes, including the phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Therefore, it may be concluded that continuous aeration of swine manure at a constant rate will not guarantee the supply of sufficient oxygen to the growth of PAOs. On another front, it was observed that too much aeration might negatively impact the overall P removal by increasing the release of soluble organic P from dead cells.",M2
20402701,"Effects of increasing days of exposure to prepartum diets on the concentration of certain blood metabolites in dairy cows.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the number of days exposure to a prepartum transition diet on mineral, energy and protein metabolism in dairy cows. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PROCEDURES: The prepartum transition diet consisted of ryegrass pasture, cereal hay, grain, grain by-product, protein meals, BioChlor, rumen modifiers, minerals and vitamins and contained 13.9% crude protein, 10.0 MJ metabolisable energy/kg and a dietary cation anion difference of -35 meq/kg dry matter. Forty cows were bled bi-weekly from their introduction to the prepartum transition diet until day 35 of lactation. Blood samples were submitted for estimation of a range of metabolites. Cubic smoothed splines were fitted to scatterplots of metabolite concentration as a function of day relative to calving and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Linear regression modelling determined the effect of days exposed, age, body condition score (BSC) and calving day on AUC. Results The prepartum AUC of blood <e>phosphorus</e> and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased and the AUC of blood calcium and cholesterol decreased with increasing days exposed to the diet. The postpartum AUC of beta-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids decreased with increasing days exposed but increased with days exposed x age and days exposed x BCS, respectively. The AUC of other metabolites did not vary significantly with number of days exposed. Conclusions Increasing exposure to the prepartum diet significantly altered the AUC of blood metabolites associated with mineral, energy and protein metabolism in ways consistent with improvements in production and reproduction previously reported and the result suggests links between energy, protein and skeletal metabolism.",M2
20400598,"Using rare earth elements to control <e>phosphorus</e> and track manure in runoff.Concern over the enrichment of agricultural runoff with phosphorus (P) from land applied livestock manures has prompted the development of manure amendments that minimize P solubility. In this study, we amended poultry, dairy, and swine manures with two rare earth chlorides, lanthanum chloride (LaCl(3).7H(2)O) and ytterbium chloride (YbCl(3).6H(2)O), to evaluate their effects on P solubility in the manure following incubation in the laboratory as well as on the fate of P and rare earth elements (REEs) when manures were surface-applied to packed soil boxes and subjected to simulated rainfall. In terms of manure P solubility, La:water-extractable P (WEP) ratios close to 1:1 resulted in maximum WEP reduction of 95% in dairy manure and 98% in dry poultry litter. Results from the runoff study showed that REE applications to dry manures such as poultry litter were less effective in reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in runoff than in liquid manures and slurries, which was likely due to mixing limitations. The most effective reductions of DRP in runoff by REEs were observed in the alkaline pH soil, although reductions of DRP in runoff from the acidic soil were still &gt;50%. Particulate REEs were strongly associated with particulate P in runoff, suggesting a potentially useful role in tracking the fate of P and other manure constituents from manure-amended soils. Finally, REEs that remained in soil following runoff had a tendency to precipitate WEP, especially in soils receiving manure amendments. The findings have valuable applications in water quality protection and the evaluation of P site assessment indices.",M2
20400593,"Runoff losses of suspended sediment, nitrogen, and <e>phosphorus</e> from a small watershed in Korea.Nutrients and sediments in runoff lead to the degradation of water quality of lakes and streams. The development of schemes to mitigate such degradation requires a characterization of the underlying transport processes. The objectives of this study were to develop annual and seasonal load-discharge relationships for suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) losses from a small mixed land use watershed and to use these relationships to explicate the annual and monthly patterns of losses of these species. Data from 1996 to 2004 were used to develop load-discharge relationships for SS, TN, and TP at the HP#6 watershed, a subwatershed of the Balhan reservoir watershed located in Bongdam-myun and Paltan-myun, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Standard least squares curve fitting and S-estimation procedures were used to fit power functions to the data collected over this time period. The fitted load-discharge relationships are indicative of seasonal variations in SS and TN and of TP losses from HP#6. The exponents of the fitted power functions for TN and TP in the fall, for TP in summer season, and for SS in all seasons are &gt;1, indicating that the concentrations of these species increase as flow rate increases. Most of the SS, TN, and TP transported in runoff left the watershed between April and September; thus, cost-efficient strategies can be established by focusing on this period. Further study of the seasonal variations is required for a better characterization of seasonal losses of SS, TN, and TP in runoff from the HP#6 watershed.",M2
20400592,"Conventional and conservation tillage: influence on seasonal runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses in the Canadian Prairies.Conservation tillage has been widely promoted to reduce sediment and nutrient transport from agricultural fields. However, the effect of conservation tillage on sediment and nutrient export in snowmelt-dominated climates is not well known. Therefore, a long-term paired watershed study was used to compare sediment and nutrient losses from a conventional and a conservation tillage watershed in the Northern Great Plains region of western Canada. During the treatment period, dissolved nutrient concentrations were typically greater during spring snowmelt than during summer rainfall events, whereas concentrations of sediment and particulate nutrients were greatest during rainfall events. However, because total runoff was dominated by snowmelt, most sediment and nutrient export occurred during snowmelt. Overall, conservation tillage reduced the export of sediment in runoff water by 65%. Similarly, concentrations and export of nitrogen were reduced by 41 and 68%, respectively, relative to conventional tillage. After conversion to conservation tillage, concentrations and exports of <e>phosphorus</e> (P) increased by 42 and 12%, respectively, with soluble P accounting for the majority of the exported P, especially during snowmelt. Our results suggest that management practices designed to improve water quality by reducing sediment and sediment-bound nutrient export from agricultural fields and watersheds can be less effective in cold, dry regions where nutrient export is primarily snowmelt driven and in the dissolved form. In these situations, it may be more appropriate to implement management practices that reduce the accumulation of nutrients in crop residues and the surface soil.",M2
20397384,"Effect of nutrient level on phytoplankton community structure in different water bodies.Increasing levels of pollution within water bodies can cause eutrophication and an associated rapid growth in and reproduction of phytoplankton. Although most frequently occurring in bodies of water such as lakes and dams, in recent years an increasing number of river systems in China have suffered serious algal blooms. The community structure of phytoplankton may differ, however, dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient levels within the water body. The field investigation results obtained from a stagnant river in Suzhou City and Taihu Lake, China, showed that in water with higher concentrations of nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e>, Chlorophyta became the predominant species and in water with lower concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, Cyanobacteria became the predominant species. Growth experiments with competitive species, Microcystis aeruginosa Kütz and Scenedesmus quadricauda (Turp.), were conducted at three different nutrient levels. The biomass of algae in pure and mixed cultures was measured under conditions of different N/P ratios at oligotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic nutrient levels. The results indicated that the most suitable state for the growth and reproduction of M. aeruginosa and S. quadricauda were eutrophic conditions in both pure and mixed cultures. Under competition, however, the lower medium nutrient levels favoured M. aeruginosa, while the higher medium nutrient levels better suited S. quadricauda. Under similar hydrodynamic conditions, the community structure of phytoplankton in the water body was determined by the dominant species in competition for nutrients.",M2
20397382,"Evaluation of <e>phosphorus</e> removal from wastewater by soils in rural areas in China.Low-cost, easy-maintenance and high-efficiency decentralized wastewater treatment technologies are urgently needed in rural areas of China. Processes with high potential for phosphorus removal are of great interest. However, commonly used treatment methods often do not meet the strict criteria for removing phosphorus from rural wastewater. In order to search an economic and simple technology for phosphorus removal from the common bio-technologies effluent, seven soil types collected from different rural areas in China were investigated for their ability to remove phosphorus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyse the mineral structure, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was used to analyse the geochemical composition of the soil samples. Three primary minerals--quartz, albite and montmorillonite - were clearly detected. The samples were divided into two soil types, acidic soils and alkaline soils, based on their pH values. The geochemical composition study indicated that a higher percentage of Ca and Mg occurred in alkaline soils (pH &gt; 8) than in acidic soils (pH &lt; 6.5). Adsorption isotherms from batch experiments fitted the Langmuir and Freundlich models well, the maximum P adsorption capacities ranged from 0.256 to 1.598 mg P/g, indicating a high phosphorus removal potential for all of these soils. The P fractions extracted revealed that the sum of NaOH-extracted inorganic P (NaOH-Pi) was the major P component in the acidic soils, and CaCO3-bound phosphorus (Ca-P) in the alkaline soils. Dynamic adsorption simulation showed that these soils have the ability to remove phosphorus from wastewater.",M2

20392012,"<e>Phosphorus</e> and soil development: does the Walker and Syers model apply to semiarid ecosystems?The Walker and Syers model of phosphorus (P) transformations during pedogenesis is widely accepted for the development of humid ecosystems, but long-term P dynamics of more arid ecosystems remain poorly understood. We tested the Walker and Syers model in semiarid piñon-juniper woodlands by measuring soil P fractions under tree canopies and in intercanopy spaces along a well-constrained, approximately 3000 ka (1 ka = 1000 years) volcanic substrate age gradient in northern Arizona, USA. The various pools of soil P behaved largely as predicted; total soil P and primary mineral P declined consistently with substrate age, labile inorganic P increased early in soil development and then declined at later stages, and organic phosphorus increased consistently across the chronosequence. Within each site, soils under tree canopies tended to have higher concentrations of labile and intermediately available P fractions compared to intercanopy soils. However, the degree of spatial heterogeneity conferred by tree islands was moderated by the stage of soil development. In contrast, tree islands had no influence on within-site distribution of more recalcitrant soil P pools, which appear to be controlled solely by the stage of pedogenesis. Coincident with declines in total P, primary mineral P, and labile inorganic P, we found that phosphatase enzyme activity increased with substrate age; a result consistent with greater ecosystem-level P demand on older, more highly weathered substrates. Our results suggest that, compared to humid climates, reduced inputs of water, energy, and acidity to semiarid ecosystems slow the rate of change in P fractions during pedogenesis, but the overall pattern remains consistent with the Walker and Syers model. Furthermore, our data imply that pedogenic change may be an important factor controlling the spatial distribution of labile P pools in semiarid ecosystems. Taken together, these data should both broaden and unify terrestrial ecosystem development theory.",M2
20391796,"<e>Phosphorus</e> removal from wastewater by microalgae in Sweden--a year-round perspective.The phosphorus and nitrogen removing capacity of a microalgal treatment step in Sweden was studied during an annual cycle. The treatment step had been constructed for extended phosphorus removal in a hydroponic wastewater treatment system, which had been built in a greenhouse. Two culture depths (17 and 33 cm) were compared as well as the effect of additional illumination during winter. The results showed large fluctuations in algal biomass production and phosphorus removal as a result of season. The phosphorus removal efficiency showed a clear correlation with pH, and the shallow cultures generally had higher phosphorus removal efficiencies than the deeper cultures. The efficiencies were between 60% and 100% during summer but mostly lower than 25% during winter, except in the shallow culture with extra illumination where efficiencies of 60-80% were recorded even during winter. A nitrogen removal efficiency of around 40% was reached for most parts of the year, and efficiencies of up to 60-80% were achieved during summer in the shallow cultures. In conclusion, the results showed that a large proportion of the phosphorus could be removed on a year-round basis, hence reducing the need for chemical precipitation, and also that significant nitrogen removal is possible.",M2
20389009,"Development and optimization of a sequencing batch reactor for nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e> removal from abattoir wastewater to meet irrigation standards.A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was used for the treatment of abattoir wastewater to produce effluent with desirable nitrogen and phosphorus levels for irrigation. The SBR cycle consisted of an anaerobic phase with wastewater feeding, a relatively short aerobic period (allowing full ammonium oxidation), a second anoxic period with feeding, followed by settling and decanting. This design of operation allowed biological nitrification and denitrification via nitrite, and therefore with reduced demand for aeration and COD for nitrogen removal. The design also allowed ammonium, rather than oxidized nitrogen, being the primary nitrogen species in the effluent. Biological phosphorus removal was also achieved, with an effluent level desirable for irrigation. A high-level of nitrite accumulation (40 mg N/L) in the reactor caused inhibition to the biological P uptake. This problem was solved through process optimization. The cycle time of the SBR was reduced, with the wastewater load per cycle also reduced, while the daily hydraulic loading maintained. This modification proved to be an effective method to ensure reliable N and P removal. N(2)O accumulation was measured in two experiments simulating the anoxic phase of the SBR and using nitrite and nitrate respectively as electron donors. The estimated N(2)O emissions for both experiments were very low.",M2

The results indicated that feed conversion in the 3% HW treatment was lower in most of the period (p &gt; 0.05). Results of carcass analysis showed no significant differences between treatments. Also, there were no significant differences between blood calcium and phosphorous among treatments. The 4.5 and 3.0% hatchery wastes treatments had the highest tibia ash (p &lt; 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The study assessed the skeletal and biochemical response to 46 h of PTH(1-34) infusion in dialysis patients. DESIGN: The study was a prospective, controlled assessment of response to PTH(1-34). SETTING: The study was performed at the University of California, Los Angeles, General Clinical Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen dialysis patients and 17 healthy volunteers were studied. INTERVENTION: PTH(1-34) was infused at a rate of 8 pmol/kg x h for 46 h. Bone biopsy was performed in all dialysis patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum calcium, <e>phosphorus</e>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTH (four separate assays), and FGF-23 were determined at baseline and h 7, 23, 35, and 46 of the infusion.

CONCLUSIONS: The skeleton of dialysis patients with high bone turnover is resistant to the calcemic actions of PTH. PTH(7-84) may contribute to this phenomenon.",M2
20382406,"<e>Phosphorus</e> load estimation in the Saginaw River, MI using a Bayesian hierarchical/multilevel model.We propose the use of Bayesian hierarchical/multilevel ratio approach to estimate the annual riverine phosphorus loads in the Saginaw River, Michigan, from 1968 to 2008. The ratio estimator is known to be an unbiased, precise approach for differing flow-concentration relationships and sampling schemes. A Bayesian model can explicitly address the uncertainty in prediction by using a posterior predictive distribution, while in comparison, a Bayesian hierarchical technique can overcome the limitation of interpreting the estimated annual loads inferred from small sample sizes by borrowing strength from the underlying population shared by the years of interest. Thus, by combining the ratio estimator with the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, long-term loads estimation can be addressed with explicit quantification of uncertainty. Our study results indicate a slight decrease in total phosphorus load early in the series. The estimated ratio parameter, which can be interpreted as flow-weighted concentration, shows a clearer decrease, damping the noise that yearly flow variation adds to the load. Despite the reductions, it is not likely that Saginaw Bay meets with its target phosphorus load, 440 tonnes/yr. Throughout the decades, the probabilities of the Saginaw Bay not complying with the target load are estimated as 1.00, 0.50, 0.57 and 0.36 in 1977, 1987, 1997, and 2007, respectively. We show that the Bayesian hierarchical model results in reasonable goodness-of-fits to the observations whether or not individual loads are aggregated. Also, this modeling approach can substantially reduce uncertainties associated with small sample sizes both in the estimated parameters and loads.",M2
20371943,"Enhancing biological <e>phosphorus</e> removal with glycerol.An enhanced biological phosphorus removal process (EBPR) was successfully operated in presence of acetate. When glycerol was substituted for acetate in the feed the EBPR process failed. Subsequently waste activated sludge (WAS) from the reactor was removed to an off-line fermenter. The same amount of glycerol was added to the WAS fermenter which led to significant volatile fatty acids (VFA) production. By supplying the system with the VFA-enriched supernatant of the fermentate, biological phosphorus removal was enhanced. It was concluded that, if glycerol was to be used as an external carbon source in EBPR, the effective approach was to ferment glycerol with waste activated sludge.",M2
20371938,"Uncertainty and variability in enhanced biological <e>phosphorus</e> removal (EBPR) stoichiometry: consequences for process modelling and optimization.The overall potential for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in the activated sludge process is constrained by the availability of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The efficiency with which polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) use these VFAs for P-removal, however, is determined by the stoichiometric ratios governing their anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. While changes in anaerobic stoichiometry due to environmental conditions do affect EBPR performance to a certain degree, model-based analyses indicate that variability in aerobic stoichiometry has the greatest impact. Long-term deterioration in EBPR performance in an experimental SBR system undergoing P-limitation can be predicted as the consequence of competition between PAOs and GAOs. However, the observed rapid decrease in P-release after the change in feed composition is not consistent with a gradual shift in population.",M2

Using laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors seeded with a mixed microbial consortium and fed real wastewater, we observed that longer SRTs can improve BPR performance; organic acid augmentation can stabilize BPR, but it is not necessary for process success; and higher volatile suspended solids concentrations correlate with improved phosphorus removal. The results also suggest that organic acids may not be critical in driving anaerobic phosphorus release, but in driving aerobic growth. Finally, given an observed population similarity across all tested bioreactors, BPR variability appears to be less influenced by the presence of specific microbes and more affected by the induction of critical metabolisms.",M2

20353734,"Outcomes associated with serum <e>phosphorus</e> level in males with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hyperphosphatemia is associated with higher mortality and increased incidence of end-stage renal disease in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), but there has not been a concomitant assessment of mortality and progressive kidney disease that would also account for cumulative effects of hyperphosphatemia. METHODS: In order to account for the cumulative effects of abnormal serum phosphorus we examined associations of not only baseline, but also time-averaged serum phosphorus levels with all-cause mortality, the composite of mortality or ESRD and the slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), by using Cox models and mixed effects models in a contemporary cohort of 713 males with moderate and advanced NDD-CKD. RESULTS: Higher baseline and time-averaged serum phosphorus were both associated with mortality and with the composite outcome. A 1 mg/dl higher time-averaged serum phosphorus was associated with a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of all-cause mortality (95% CI) of 1.56 (1.19 - 2.05), p = 0.001. Higher serum phosphorus was associated with a steeper slope of eGFR in unadjusted analyses, but this association became non-significant after multivariable adjustments. CONCLUSION: The cumulative burden of hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased mortality in patients with moderate and advanced NDD-CKD. Clinical trials are needed to determine if lowering serum phosphorus can result in improved mortality in this population.",M2

20351440,"The simulation research of dissolved nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e> non-point source pollution in Xiao-Jiang watershed of Three Gorges Reservoir area.Xiao-jiang, with a basin area of almost 5,276 km(2) and a length of 182.4 km, is located in the center of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and is the largest tributary of the central section in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, farmland accounts for a large proportion of Xiao-jiang watershed, and the hilly cropland of purple soil is much of the farmland of the watershed. After the second phase of water storage in the Three Gorges Reservoir, the majority of sub-rivers in the reservoir area experienced eutrophication phenomenon frequently, and non-point source (NPS) pollution has become an important source of pollution in Xiao-jiang Watershed. Because dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus non-point source pollution are related to surface runoff and interflow, using climatic, topographic and land cover data from the internet and research institutes, the Semi-Distributed Land-use Runoff Process (SLURP) hydrological model was introduced to simulate the complete hydrological cycle of the Xiao-jiang Watershed. Based on the SLURP distributed hydrological model, non-point source pollution annual output load models of land use and rural residents were respectively established. Therefore, using GIS technology, considering the losses of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the course of transport, a dissolved non-point source pollution load dynamic model was established by the organic coupling of the SLURP hydrological model and land-use output model. Through the above dynamic model, the annual dissolved non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus pollution output as well as the load in different types were simulated and quantitatively estimated from 2001 to 2008, furthermore, the loads of Xiao-jiang Watershed were calculated and expressed by temporal and spatial distribution in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The simulation results show that: the temporal changes of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus load in the watershed are close to the inter-annual changes of rainfall runoff, and the different land-use type distribution has great impacts on the spatial changes of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus load in the watershed; The nitrogen and phosphorus load of different land-use types in size with descending order is, glebe and mixed land, paddy, grassland, urban land, forestland; however, for the phosphorus load, the unit area output load of glebe and mixed land is almost the same as for paddy fields; The output contribution of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution load from land-use accounts for 78%-85%, while the output contribution from livestock and poultry occupies 13%-20%. The established load model was verified by observation data, simulation results show that the established model is reasonable, simulation accuracy is higher.",M2
20351433,"Characteristics of nutrient retention in a stormwater wetland during dry and wet days.A 0.23-ha pilot wetland was constructed to examine its effectiveness for the control of nonpoint source pollution (NPS) from a 7.42-ha agricultural watershed in Korea. The wetland was operated during base flow and storm flow conditions and monitored for four years (2006-2009). The wetland was operated under high hydraulic loading rates (HLRs, 0.78 m/day on average) during rainy days. The average influent nitrogen concentration was 9.8 mg/L during wet days, but around 11.6 mg/L during dry days. Due to the short hydraulic retention time (HRT) on wet days, nitrogen retention at the wetland was poor, only 6.1%; whereas, during dry days the efficiency was higher, around 17.9%. On rainy days, the wetland presented high retention for total <e>phosphorus</e> (TP), with an average efficiency of 68.3%, accompanied with a total suspended solids (TSS) removal of 84.7%. However, on dry days, the wetland showed positive soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) retention other than TP. The interior of the wetland was observed to have different nutrients levels. Furthermore, suggestions are addressed in terms of improved design for better performance.",M2
20349828,"Linking environmental nutrient enrichment and disease emergence in humans and wildlife.Worldwide increases in human and wildlife diseases have challenged ecologists to understand how large-scale environmental changes affect host-parasite interactions. One of the most profound changes to Earth's ecosystems is the alteration of global nutrient cycles, including those of <e>phosphorus</e> (P) and especially nitrogen (N). Along with the obvious direct benefits of nutrient application for food production, anthropogenic inputs of N and P can indirectly affect the abundance of infectious and noninfectious pathogens. The mechanisms underpinning observed correlations, however, and how such patterns vary with disease type, have long remained conjectural. Here, we highlight recent experimental advances to critically evaluate the relationship between environmental nutrient enrichment and disease. Given the interrelated nature of human and wildlife disease emergence, we include a broad range of human and wildlife examples from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. We examine the consequences of nutrient pollution on directly transmitted, vector-borne, complex life cycle, and noninfectious pathogens, including West Nile virus, malaria, harmful algal blooms, coral reef diseases, and amphibian malformations. Our synthetic examination suggests that the effects of environmental nutrient enrichment on disease are complex and multifaceted, varying with the type of pathogen, host species and condition, attributes of the ecosystem, and the degree of enrichment; some pathogens increase in abundance whereas others decline or disappear. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that ecological changes associated with nutrient enrichment often exacerbate infection and disease caused by generalist parasites with direct or simple life cycles. Observed mechanisms include changes in host/vector density, host distribution, infection resistance, pathogen virulence or toxicity, and the direct supplementation of pathogens. Collectively, these pathogens may be particularly dangerous because they can continue to cause mortality even as their hosts decline, potentially leading to sustained epidemics or chronic pathology. We suggest that interactions between nutrient enrichment and disease will become increasingly important in tropical and subtropical regions, where forecasted increases in nutrient application will occur in an environment rich with infectious pathogens. We emphasize the importance of careful disease management in conjunction with continued intensification of global nutrient cycles.",M2
20349827,"Terrestrial <e>phosphorus</e> limitation: mechanisms, implications, and nitrogen-phosphorus interactions.Nutrient limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common limiting elements, both individually and in combination. Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a  terminal steady state  of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.",M2
20349709,"[Nutrient uptake characteristics of nitrogen, <e>phosphorus</e> and potassium of Pinellia ternate from Sichuan during growth stage]OBJECTIVE: To study the absorption characteristics of nitrogen (N) , phosphorus (P) , and potassium (K) of Pinellia ternate from Sichuan under the cultivated condition. METHOD: The samples of P. ternate S-29 and S-33 from Sichuan were regularly collected randomly, the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of each part (aerial and underground parts) were determined, and their distribution and accumulation characters of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium were also studied. RESULT: The absorption rate of aerial and underground parts of P. ternate were different in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at different growing stages. Among them, the potassium uptake was the highest, while the phosphorus uptake was the lowest. Totally, the uptakes of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of P. ternate from Sichuan during  sprout tumble  stage were comparatively higher than that not at  sprout tumble  stage. A significant correlation was observed between the phosphorus and potassium uptake of the aerial and underground parts, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). And there was also significant positive correlation between the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake at underground parts (P &lt; 0.05). During the growth stage of P. ternate, for producing 100 kg air-dried P. ternate, 5.02-5.64 kg N, 2.44-2.56 kg P205, 11.62-13.49 kg K20 were needed to be absorbed. CONCLUSION: P. ternate from Sichuan should be given enough base fertilizer in field cultivation, and then be supplied with phosphorus and potassium by combining foliar spray with field application during the middle ten days of June and last ten days of August. The ratios of potassium should be properly improved. There was promoting effect in the phosphorus and nitrogen assimilations of the underground parts of P. ternate from Sichuan.",M2

Phosphorus recovered from EBPR waste sludge can be used as a raw material for the fertilizer industry, if a sound recycling strategy is developed and applied. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on phosphate metabolism in bacteria, focusing on molecular mechanisms of bacterial polyphosphate (polyP) accumulation. A simple method for releasing polyP from EBPR waste sludge and recovering phosphorus in a reusable form for the fertilizer industry is presented.

20347512,"Intact PTH combined with the PTH ratio for diagnosis of bone turnover in dialysis patients: a diagnostic test study.BACKGROUND: Determination of parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is the most commonly used surrogate marker for bone turnover in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease on dialysis therapy (CKD-5D). The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of various PTH measurements for identifying low or high bone turnover rate. STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic test study. SETTINGS &amp; PARTICIPANTS: 141 patients with CKD-5D from 15 US hemodialysis centers. INDEX TESTS: Intact PTH, PTH 1-84, and PTH ratio (ratio of level of PTH 1-84 to level of large carboxy-terminal PTH fragments). REFERENCE TEST OR OUTCOME: Bone turnover determined using bone histomorphometry. OTHER MEASUREMENTS: Demographic and treatment-related factors, serum calcium and <e>phosphorus</e>. RESULTS: Patients presented histologically with a broad range of bone turnover abnormalities. In white patients with CKD-5D (n = 70), PTH ratio &lt;1.0 added to intact PTH level &lt;420 pg/mL increased the positive predictive value for low bone turnover from 74% to 90%. In black patients (n = 71), adding PTH ratio &lt;1.2 to intact PTH level &lt;340 pg/mL increased the positive predictive value for low bone turnover from 48% to 90%. Adding PTH ratio &gt;1.6 to intact PTH level of 340-790 pg/mL increased the positive predictive value for high bone turnover from 56% to 71%. LIMITATIONS: Because the research protocol called for carefully controlled blood specimen handling, blood drawing and routine specimen handling might be less stringent in clinical practice. By limiting study participation to black and white patients with CKD-5D, we cannot comment on the roles of intact PTH, PTH 1-84, and PTH ratio in other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: In black patients with CKD-5D, the addition of PTH ratio to intact PTH measurements is helpful for diagnosing low and high bone turnover. In white patients with CKD-5D, it aids in the diagnosis of low bone turnover.",M2
20338613,"Impact of solids residence time on biological nutrient removal performance of membrane bioreactor.Impact of long solids residence times (SRTs) on nutrient removal was investigated using a submerged plate-frame membrane bioreactor with anaerobic and anoxic tanks. The system was operated at 10, 25, 50 and 75 days SRTs with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 2 h each for the anaerobic and anoxic tanks and 8 h for the oxic tank. Recirculation of oxic tank mixed liquor into the anaerobic tank and permeate into the anoxic tank were fixed at 100% each of the influent flow. For all SRTs, percent removals of soluble chemical oxygen demand were more than 93% and nitrification was more than 98.5% but total nitrogen percent removal seemed to peak at 81% at 50 days SRT while total <e>phosphorus</e> (TP) percent removal showed a deterioration from approximately 80% at 50 days SRT to 60% at 75 days SRT. Before calibrating the Biowin((R)) model to the experimental data, a sensitivity analysis of the model was conducted which indicated that heterotrophic anoxic yield, anaerobic hydrolysis factors of heterotrophs, heterotrophic hydrolysis, oxic endogenous decay rate for heterotrophs and oxic endogenous decay rate of PAOs had the most impact on predicted effluent TP concentration. The final values of kinetic parameters obtained in the calibration seemed to imply that nitrogen and phosphorus removal increased with SRT due to an increase in anoxic and anaerobic hydrolysis factors up to 50 days SRT but beyond that removal of phosphorus deteriorated due to high oxic endogenous decay rates. This indirectly imply that the decrease in phosphorus removal at 75 days SRT may be due to an increase in lysis of microbial cells at high SRTs along with the low food/microorganisms ratio as a result of high suspended solids in the oxic tank. Several polynomial correlations relating the various calibrated kinetic parameters with SRTs were derived. The Biowin((R)) model and the kinetic parameters predicted by the polynomial correlations were verified and found to predict well the effluent water quality of the MBR at 35 days SRT.",M2
20334971,"Algal-based immobilization process to treat the effluent from a secondary wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).Algal-based immobilization process was applied to treat the effluent from a secondary wastewater treatment plant. Batch test proved that algae could attach onto fiber-bundle carrier in 7 days, and then the algal-based immobilization reactor could reduce TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total <e>phosphorus</e>) significantly within 48 h. Based on the above investigations, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the algal-based immobilization reactor in continuous operation mode was determined to be 2 days. During the 91 days of experiment on the treating secondary effluent of Guang-Rao wastewater treatment plant, it was found that the fiber-bundle carrier could collect the heterobacteria and nitrifying bacteria gradually, and thus improved the COD removal efficiency and nitrification performance step by step. Results of the continuous operation indicated that the final effluent could meet the Chinese National First A-level Sewage Discharge Standard when the algal-based immobilization reactor reached steady state.",M2

The use of pilot scale A2/O systems with immersed membranes in removing nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen were investigated over a period of 150 days. The A2/O membrane bio reactor (MBR) was operated at a flux of 17 LMH. The designed flux was increased stepwise over a period of one week. The reactor was operated with the mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations in the range of 7000-8000 mg l(-1). The phosphorus removal was found to be in the range of 74-84%. The ammonification was completed in the aerobic zone and the ammonia concentration was almost nil. Nitrate concentration in the anoxic zone was found to be in the range of 0.3-1.6 mg l(-1) indicating efficient denitrification. The nitrogen removal efficiency of the A2/O-MBR system was in the range of 68 to 75%. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent was in the range of 8-5 mgl(-1) indicating the efficiency of membrane.

20305510,"Orbital involvement in craniofacial brown tumors.PURPOSE: To describe the clinical and radiologic features of orbital involvement in craniofacial brown tumors and to compare the rate of brown tumors in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: A retrospective hospital-based study of 115 patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism and 34 with primary hyperparathyroidism was conducted. Laboratory results such as serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, <e>phosphorus</e>, and parathyroid hormone were recorded. Demographic data (age, sex, duration of disease) and image findings (bone scan scintigraphy, skull and long bone x-rays, CT) were also obtained. The main outcome measures were analysis of clinical, biochemical, and radiologic findings of all patients. RESULTS: Of the 115 patients with chronic kidney disease, 10 (8.7%) had brown tumors in different bones of the skeleton. Five patients had lesions in the craniofacial bones. The maxilla, mandible, maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity were the most affected sites. The orbit was involved in 2 patients with lesions arising in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. One patient had facial leontiasis. All patients with brown tumors had extremely high levels of parathyroid hormone (&gt;1,000 pg/ml, normal values 10-69 pg/ml) and alkaline phosphatase (&gt;400 U/l, normal values 65-300 U/l). The mean serum levels of phosphorus and calcium were not abnormal among the patients with brown tumors. Age and time of renal failure were similar for patients with and without brown tumors. Among the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, only 2 (5.8%) had brown tumors, and in just 1, the lesion was localized in the craniofacial skeleton. A 2-tailed Z test applied to compare the proportion of occurrence of brown tumors in the 2 groups revealed that the difference at the 90% of confidence level was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Brown tumors are equally found in secondary and primary hyperparathyroidism. Craniofacial brown tumors involve the orbit, usually because of the osteodystrophy process that involves the maxilla and paranasal sinuses. The lesions do not necessarily need to be excised and may regress spontaneously after the control of hyperparathyroidism.",M2
20299362,"Hypophosphatemic effect of niacin in patients without renal failure: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Niacin administration lowers the marked hyperphosphatemia that is characteristic of renal failure. We examined whether niacin administration also reduces serum <e>phosphorus</e> concentrations in patients who have dyslipidemia and are free of advanced renal disease. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We performed a post hoc data analysis of serum phosphorus concentrations that had been determined serially (at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24) among 1547 patients who had dyslipidemia and were randomly assigned in a 3:2:1 ratio to treatment with extended release niacin (ERN; 1 g/d for 4 weeks and dose advanced to 2 g/d for 20 weeks) combined with the selective prostaglandin D2 receptor subtype 1 inhibitor laropiprant (L; n = 761), ERN alone (n = 518), or placebo (n = 268). RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis revealed that ERN-L treatment resulted in a net mean (95% confidence interval) serum phosphorus change comparing ERN-L with placebo treatment of -0.13 mmol/L (-0.15 to -0.13 mmol/L; -0.41 mg/dl [-0.46 to -0.37 mg/dl]).

CONCLUSIONS: We have provided definitive evidence that once-daily ERN-L treatment causes a sustained 0.13-mmol/L (0.4-mg/dl) reduction in serum phosphorus concentrations, approximately 10% from baseline, which is unaffected by estimated GFR ranging from 30 to &gt; or =90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (i.e., stages 1 through 3 chronic kidney disease).",M2
20237576,"Monitoring the impact of hydrocarbon contamination and nutrient addition on microbial density, activity, and diversity in soil.The development of optimal in situ bioremediation strategies requires a better knowledge of their impact on the soil microbial communities. We have evaluated the impact of hexadecane contamination and different nutrient amendments on soil microbial density and activity. Microbial density was measured via total DNA quantification, and microbial activity via respiration and RNA variation. The RNA/DNA ratio was also determined, as it is a potential indicator of microbial activity. PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes were cloned and sequenced to analyze the diversity of bacterial communities. Nutrient addition significantly increased respiration and DNA and RNA concentrations in contaminated soil, indicating a limitation of degradation and growth by the availability of nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e> in unamended microcosms. Hexadecane treatment slightly affected the diversity of the bacterial community, while it was dramatically reduced by nutrient treatments, particularly the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus.

20237150,"Serum <e>phosphorus</e> levels and the spectrum of ankle-brachial index in older men: the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study.A higher serum phosphorus level is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among community-living populations. Mechanisms are unknown. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) provides information on both atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. In this cross-sectional study (2000-2002), the authors evaluated the association of serum phosphorus levels with low (&lt;0.90) and high (&gt; or =1.40 or incompressible) ABI as compared with intermediate ABI in 5,330 older US men, among whom the mean serum phosphorus level was 3.2 mg/dL (standard deviation, 0.4), 6% had a low ABI, and 5% had a high ABI. Each 1-mg/dL increase in serum phosphorus level was associated with a 1.6-fold greater prevalence of low ABI (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 2.1; P &lt; 0.001) and a 1.4-fold greater prevalence of high ABI (95% CI: 1.0, 1.9; P = 0.03) in models adjusted for demographic factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and kidney function. However, the association of phosphorus with high ABI differed by chronic kidney disease (CKD) status (in persons with CKD, prevalence ratio = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.61, 5.45; in persons without CKD, prevalence ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.61; interaction P = 0.04). In conclusion, among community-living older men, higher phosphorus levels are associated with low ABI and are also associated with high ABI in persons with CKD. These associations may explain the link between serum phosphorus levels and CVD events.",M2

Prolonged maternal administration of MgSO(4) may induce bone demineralization in the neonate. However, the effects of MgSO(4) on serum biochemistry related to bone metabolism in neonates remain unclear. AIM: To assess the effects of prolonged maternal administration of MgSO(4) on fetuses and neonates. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective case-control study examined 167 neonates. Cases comprised 58 neonates whose mothers had received intravenous MgSO(4) administration for &gt;5 days. Neonatal serum levels of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), <e>phosphorus</e> (P) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were reviewed. We also investigated whether subject neonates showed appearance of osteopenia at the metaphyseal lines on radiography at birth. RESULTS: Mean serum Mg and P levels were significantly higher, and Ca levels were significantly lower, in cases than in controls at birth. Mean serum ALP level was 1188.5IU/l in cases, significantly higher than that in controls at birth. Bone abnormalities were noted on radiography in 2 subjects. By 3 weeks old, serum ALP levels did not differ significantly between cases and controls. Logistic regression analysis revealed maternal administration of MgSO(4) and multiple pregnancies were significantly related to serum ALP level in neonates at birth. CONCLUSION: Prolonged maternal administration of MgSO(4) significantly affects neonatal serum biochemistry related to bone metabolism. Potential long-term adverse effects on neonates and how Mg affects fetal bone metabolism in utero need to be investigated in future studies.",M2

METHOD: Through the field experiment and the sampling analysis, the absorbing capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as well as the growth of plant at different growth stages in Ch. morifolium were analyzed. RESULT: The dry matter accumulation reached 70.4% of the total accumulation within 60-150 days after transplantation. Dry matter mainly distributed in leaf within 60 days after transplantation, the distribution ratio in the stem was higher than that in leaf within 60-150 days after transplantation, the highest distribution ratio was the flower, and the second was the root within 150-210 days after transplantation. The accumulative capacity of N, P and K by Ch. morifolium was lower within 45 days after transplantation, which only accounted for 16.14%, 13.39% and 10.19% of total absorptive capacity, respectively. But it increased rapidly within 45-150 days after transplantation, which accounted for 71.86%, 63.81% and 62.94% respectively. The nitrogen accumulation was slower, while the accumulation of phosphorus and potassium was increased rapidly, within 150-210 days after transplantation. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was different within different organs in different growth stages. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was mainly distributed in stem and leaf, within 150 days after transplantation, then transferring to the flower and root, the transferring efficiency was N &gt; P &gt; K. CONCLUSION: the absorption capacity of K was the highest, followed by N and P. The N : P205 : K2O ratio was 1 : 0.88 : 1.58. Correlation analysis showed that dry matter accumulation and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium accumulation correlated positively.

20195599,"A water quality model for regional stream assessment and conservation strategy development.Non-point-source (NPS) pollution remains the primary source of stream impairment in the United States. Many problems such as eutrophication, sedimentation, and hypoxia are linked with NPS pollution which reduces the water quality for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Increasingly, NPS pollution models have been used for landscape-scale pollution assessment and conservation strategy development. Our modeling approach functions at a scale between simple landscape-level assessments and complex, data-intensive modeling by providing a rapid, landscape-scale geographic information system (GIS) model with minimal data requirements and widespread applicability. Our model relies on curve numbers, literature-derived pollution concentrations, and land status to evaluate total <e>phosphorus</e> (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and suspended solids (SS) at the reach scale. Model testing in the Chesapeake Bay watershed indicated that predicted distributions of water quality classes were realistic at the reach scale, but precise estimates of pollution concentrations at the local scale can have errors. Application of our model in the tributary watersheds along Lake Ontario suggested that it is useful to managers in watershed planning by rapidly providing important information about NPS pollution conditions in areas where large data gaps exist, comparisons among stream reaches across numerous watersheds are required, or regional assessments are sought.",M2

METHODS: We retrospectively examined serum calcium, <e>phosphorus</e> and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) levels and thyroid-associated variables in 140 patients with apathetic hyperthyroidism, 456 patients with typical hyperthyroidism and 120 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Significant differences were identified with respect to age, serum calcium and corrected calcium, serum phosphorus, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), the FT(3)/FT(4) ratio, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, BAP and albumin among the typical and apathetic hyperthyroid and normal groups (all p &lt; 0.001). Univariate logistic regression showed that age, serum calcium and corrected calcium, serum phosphorus, TSH, FT(4), FT(3)/FT(4) ratio, ALT, AST and BAP were significantly associated with apathetic hyperthyroidism, and multivariate logistic regression showed that age, corrected calcium, TSH, FT(4), FT(3)/FT(4) ratio, BAP and ALT were significantly associated with apathetic hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSION: Greater age, increased corrected calcium levels, decreased TSH levels, increased FT(4), a decreased FT(3)/FT(4) ratio, increased BAP levels and increased ALT levels may be significant factors for differentiating apathetic from typical hyperthyroidism. Coordinated assessment of these variables may aid in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.",M2
20185158,"Alum application to improve water quality in a municipal wastewater treatment wetland: effects on macrophyte growth and nutrient uptake.Application of low doses of alum to treatment wetlands to reduce elevated outflow winter <e>phosphorus</e> concentrations were tested in mesocosms vegetated with either Typhadomingensis, Schoenoplectus californicus, or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (Najas guadalupensis-dominated). Alum was pumped to experimental units at a rate of 0.91 g Al m(-2) d(-1) and water quality monitored for 3 months. The alum application significantly improved the outflow water quality and overall the growth of the plants was unaffected by the alum application. Biomass and growth varied between species and through time, but no significant effects of alum application were detected. The concentrations of nutrients and mineral elements in the aboveground tissues differed between species and over time, but only the concentration of Al in plant tissue was increased by alum additions. The concentration of Al was 50-fold higher in alum-treated SAV as compared to the control, and in Typha and Schoenoplectus the concentrations were 4- and 2-fold, higher, respectively. The N/P ratios in the plant tissues were low (&lt;10) suggesting that their growth and biomass was limited by nitrogen. The research suggests that a continuous or seasonal low-dosage alum application to treatment wetlands provides an effective tool to maintain discharge concentrations within permitted values during the inefficient winter treatment times. We suggest that the use of alum should be restricted to treatment wetland areas dominated by emergent vegetation as the effects of the elevated Al concentrations in SAV needs further study.",M2

20183979,"<e>Phosphorus</e> removal by expanded clay--six years of pilot-scale constructed wetlands experience.Constructed wetlands, which facilitate phosphorus removal via precipitation, adsorption, and biological assimilation, offer a promising appropriate technology for advanced treatment in wastewater treatment plants. Because adsorption and precipitation are pointed out as the major phosphorus-removal mechanisms, the selection of a medium with high phosphorus-sorption capacity is important to obtain a sustained phosphorus removal. The objective of this study was to evaluate two kinds of lightweight expanded clay aggregates (LWAs)--Filtralite NR and Filtralite MR (Maxit Group, Avelar, Portugal)--as substrates in constructed wetlands to improve phosphorus-removal performance. Laboratory experiments were performed to test the potential of the LWAs to remove phosphorus from a phosphate solution. The experimental data were well-fitted by both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Pilot-scale investigations were carried out to evaluate the phosphorus removal under field conditions. Four subsurface constructed wetlands were operated since June 2002; two of them were planted with Phragmites australis, and the other two were unplanted. The beds were filled with the two kinds of LWAs. Total phosphorous and pH were monitored since 2003, at a mean hydraulic load of 50 +/- 4 L/(m2 x d), during 6 years. The inflow phosphorus concentration was in the range 4 to 13 mg/L. Under the conditions used, beds with Filtralite MR had better efficiency, and the bed with Filtralite MR planted with Phragmites australis provided a phosphorus effluent mean concentration of 0.7 +/- 0.2 mg/L, during the trial period. This study presents the first long-term pilot-scale data for constructed wetlands using LWAs.",M2
20183977,"Performance assessment of a street-drainage bioretention system.Event-based, flow-paced composite sampling was carried out at the inlet and outlet of a street-side bioretention facility in Seattle, Washington, to assess its ability to reduce street runoff quantity and pollutants. Over 2.5 years, 48 to 74% of the incoming runoff was lost to infiltration and evaporation. Outlet pollutant concentrations were significantly lower than those at the inlet for nearly all monitored constituents. In terms of mass, the system retained most of the incoming pollutants. Besides soluble reactive <e>phosphorus</e> (the mass of which possibly increased), dissolved copper was the least effectively retained; at least 58% of dissolved copper (and potentially as much as 79%) was captured by the system. Motor oil was removed most effectively, with 92 to 96% of the incoming motor oil not leaving the system. The results indicate that bioretention systems can achieve a high level of runoff retention and treatment in real-weather conditions.",M2
20183521,"Antioxidant status and selected biochemical parameters of porcine ovarian granulosa cells exposed to lead in vitro.The objective of this study was to determine the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant status (TAS) and release of calcium, <e>phosphorus</e>, magnesium, sodium, potassium, total lipids, totals proteins, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides by porcine ovarian granulosa cells cultured in vitro after lead acetate administration. The parameters were analyzed using semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer Microlab 300, microprocessor-controlled analyzer EasyLite and spectrophotometer Genesys 10. Cells were cultured with lead acetate trihydrate [Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O] as follows: group Max (5 mg Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O/10 mL), group A (2.5 mg/10 mL), group B (0.83 mg/10 mL), group C (0.625 mg/10 mL), group D (0.455 mg/10 mL) and the control group without lead exposure for 18 hrs. The highest TAS was estimated in the control group without lead treatment in comparison with other groups (MAX, A, B, C, D). Statistical analyses showed significantly lower value (P &lt; 0.05) in group B. The activity of SOD was the lowest in the control group in comparison to those exposed to in vitro lead culture. A significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) of calcium content in group MAX in comparison with control group was determined. Release of phosphorus by ovarian granulosa cells was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05; 0.01; 0.001) in all the treated groups in comparison with control group. Lead was found to stimulate the release of magnesium and potassium by granulosa cells, but the increase remained statistically insignificant. The highest concentration of glucose was noted in control group, but the differences were not significant either. No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were detected in concentration of other studied parameters among observed groups, too.",M2
20183514,"Decolouration of H2SO4 leachate from <e>phosphorus</e>-saturated alum sludge using H2O2 and advanced oxidation processes in phosphorus recovery strategy.As a part of attempt for phosphorus (P) recovery from P-saturated alum sludge, which was used as a low-cost P-adsorbent in treatment reed bed for wastewater treatment, decolouration of H(2)SO(4) leachate obtained from previous experiment, possessing a great deal of P, aluminum and red-brown coloured materials (RBCMs), by using H(2)O(2) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) was investigated. The use of H(2)O(2) and AOPs in the forms of Fenton (H(2)O(2)/Fe(2 +)) and photo-Fenton (UV/H(2)O(2)/Fe(2 +)) were tested. The changes in colour and total organic carbon (TOC) were taken place as a result of mineralization of RBCMs. The results revealed that all of these three processes examined were efficient. It was found that about 98% colour and 47% TOC can be removed under photo-Fenton treatment after 8 hours of UV irradiation.Correspondingly, the reaction rates of H(2)O(2) and Fenton systems were slow, but 100% colour and 59% TOC removal of H(2)O(2) process and 100% colour and 67% TOC reductions of Fenton process can be achieved after 72 hours of reaction. The changes of structure and molecular weight/size of RBCMs were also evaluated by HPLC and UV-vis spectroscopic analysis. From the results, some chromophores of RBCMs such as aromatic groups were appeared to be easily degraded to the smaller refractory components. Hence, based on the experimental results and considering the investment and expediency of operation, H(2)O(2) and Fenton oxidation could be suitable technologies for the treatment of the RBCMs derived from P-extraction stage by using H(2)SO(4) leaching.",M2
20183504,"Investigations on <e>phosphorus</e> recovery and reuse as soil amendment from electric arc furnace slag filters.Electric arc furnace (EAF) steel slag has been identified as an effective filter material for the removal of phosphorus (P) from both point and non-point sources. To determine the feasibility of land-applying P saturated EAF steel slag this study was undertaken to investigate (i) saturated EAF steel slag material's potential as a P fertilizer or soil amendment and (ii) P desorption and metals leachate from saturated EAF steel slag material to surface runoff. Medicago sativa (alfalfa) was planted in a nutrient depleted washed sand media. Phosphorus was added either as saturated EAF steel slag or as a standard commercial phosphate fertilizer in order to assess the plant availability of the P from saturated EAF steel slag. Four different P application levels were tested: a low (20 lbs acre furrow slice(-1) (5.5 g P m(-3))) two medium (40 and 60 lbs. acre f.s.(-1) (11 and 16.5 g P m(-3))) and a high (120 lbs. acre f.s.(-1) (33 g P m(-3))). The above-ground biomass of half of the plants was harvested after 5 weeks and the second half at 10 weeks. All treatments regardless of the P source used showed high rates of germination. At the first harvest period (5 weeks) significantly higher above-ground biomass (p &lt; 0.01) was seen at the 3 highest P amendment rates in treatments with triple super phosphate fertilizer (TSP) than with EAF steel slag. However, by the second harvest (10 weeks) only the highest amendment rate of TSP showed a significantly higher amount of biomass (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that EAF steel slag might be an effective slow release P source. In a second experiment, a rain simulator was used to assess desorption of DRP, TP and metals from a saturated and semi-saturated EAF steel slag. The results revealed that the total amounts of DRP and TP released to surface runoff from EAF steel slag were negligible when compared to the total quantities of P retained by this material. Overall the results from this study demonstrated that once the EAF steel slag filter reaches its saturation point, the material could be re-used as soil amendment for the slow release of bioavailable P with minimal risk for loss of P to surface runoff, bringing further benefits to the environment.",M2
20183497,"Hydrodynamic and nutrient modeling in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon.The USEPA WASP5 modeling system was applied to simulate and evaluate the relationships between external and internal nutrient loadings and water quality of Vistonis lagoon, North Greece for a 2-year time period. The hydrodynamic model DYNHYD5 was calibrated to estimate daily lagoon water level. The water quality models TOXI5 and EUTRO5 were calibrated and verified using meteorological data from a station near the lagoon, and field data (salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations) from seven stations located in the lagoon, for the time period April 1998 to May 1999. Predicted by the model salinity, dissolved oxygen, total <e>phosphorus</e>, total inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were plotted against observed values and showed good agreement. Model performance was evaluated using scattergrams of predicted versus observed values and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample goodness-of-fit test at p &lt; 0.05. Sediment sources of nitrogen and phosphorus were important to achieve a successful model calibration. The validated model was also used to test the effectiveness of alternative management scenarios in relation to improvement of the trophic state of the lagoon.",M2
20183051,"The effects of residual tetracycline on soil enzymatic activities and plant growth.A pot trial was carried out to investigate the adverse effects of tetracycline (TC) on soil microbial communities, microbial activities, and the growth of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L). The results showed that the presence of TC significantly disturbed the structure of microbial communities and inhibited soil microbial activities in terms of urease, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase (p &lt; 0.05). Plant biomass was adversely influenced by TC, especially the roots with a reduction of 40% when compared with the control. Furthermore, TC decreased the assimilation of <e>phosphorus</e> by the plant although the concentration of phosphorus was increased by 20% due to decreased plant biomass. TC seemed to increase the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (by 20%) in soil. The findings implied that the agricultural use of animal manure or fishpond sediment containing considerable amounts of antibiotics may give rise to ecological risks.",M2
20182088,"Impacts of housing development on nutrients flow along canals in a peri-urban area of Bangkok, Thailand.Change of nutrients load and flow according to land-use change induced by housing development was investigated in Bang Yai, Nonthaburi, Thailand, which located in the peri-urban area of Bangkok. Each house in the newly developed residential community was regulated to be equipped with a septic tank to collect night soil. However, greywater and leachate from the septic tank was collected by a community sewage system and discharged into the canals with insufficient treatment, while the canals still function as infrastructure for irrigation and transportation. In the study area, built-up area became 1.4 times and agricultural fields decreased by 13% from 2003 until 2007. Total nutrients load to the canals was increased by 25% as nitrogen and 14% as <e>phosphorus</e> according to the increase of built-up area. Net nutrients load from agricultural fields was largely set off when we evaluated nutrients inflow from the canals to the agricultural field through irrigation. Consequently, nutrients load from domestic wastewater accounted most of net nutrients load into the canal.",M2

20176845,"Can submerged macrophytes influence turbidity and trophic state in deep lakes? Suggestions from a case study.Feedback between submerged macrophytes and water transparency stabilizing the clear, macrophyte-dominated regime has been described so far for shallow lakes. Based on data of total <e>phosphorus</e> (TP) concentrations, underwater light supply, phytoplankton and submerged macrophyte abundance from narrow, stratified Lake Scharmützelsee (mean depth: 9 m, retention time: 16 yr) of the period 1994-2006 we hypothesize that submerged macrophytes may influence transparency and trophic state in deep lakes. The lake was characterized by summer epilimnion TP concentrations of 38 to 57 mug L(-1), turbid water due to mass development of cyanobacteria, and low abundance of few submerged macrophyte species until 2003. Thereafter, a sudden increase in water transparency was followed by a rapid submerged macrophyte colonization of the littoral down to about 5 m depth corresponding to the depth of a light supply of 3 E m(-2) d(-1). Initially, this recolonization was probably a consequence of decreased turbidity. We argue that the increase of submerged macrophyte coverage from &lt; 10% in 1994 to 2003 to about 24% in 2005-2006 has contributed to the stabilization of the clear-water regime during the subsequent years. This is supported by the fact that earlier shifts to clear-water regimes in 1994 and 2000 without a significant spread of submerged macrophytes were not stable. We discuss potential mechanisms that may have resulted in a positive effect of plants on transparency such as P uptake and immobilization by the dominant rootless macrophyte species Nitellopsis obtusa and Ceratophyllum demersum and other macrophyte-related mechanisms such as increased zooplankton grazing and allelopathy.",M2
20176828,"Effects of surface and groundwater interactions on <e>phosphorus</e> transport within streambank sediments.Understanding internal stream P transfers is important in controlling eutrophication. To determine the direction of groundwater and surface water interactions and evaluate P retention within streambank sediments, groundwater well pairs, about 5-m deep, were installed at three locations along a second-order, eutrophic stream in north-central Texas. Well cores were analyzed for P, and groundwater levels were monitored for about 2 yr. Water levels in wells furthest upstream always indicated a losing stream, while wells further downstream showed a gaining stream except during flow reversals with storm events and periods with reservoir backwater. Total-P from well cores ranged from 54 to 254 mg kg(-1) and was typically high near surface, decreased downward until redoximorphic features were encountered and then increased notably with depth to near or above surface concentrations. Very little extractable P occurred in sediments from the two upstream well sets; however, the set furthest downstream showed extractable P throughout with a high of 21 mg kg(-1) near the bottom. Repeated wetting-drying at sites A and B as noted by redoximorphic features may have shifted P into more stable sediment-bound forms. The decrease in extractable P at sites A and B compared to site C may be explained by conditions at C that were wetter and potentially anaerobic. Because the overall stream reach was more often losing than gaining, there appears to be a mass flow of P into streambank sediments. Streambank erosion may then transport this P downstream if not controlled.",M2
20175051,"Vitamin D treatment in hemodialysis patients with low serum levels of parathyroid hormone: which is the best choice?BACKGROUND: This short-term prospective study aimed to assess the effects of treatment with calcidiol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) or calcitriol in the subset of hemodialysis patients characterized by stable low serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or affected by hypoparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy (PTx). METHODS: Two groups were created according to baseline serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D): group A (12 patients): &lt;15 ng/mL; group B (12 patients): &gt;15 ng/mL. They underwent a 6-month treatment with oral calcidiol (group A) or oral calcitriol (group B). RESULTS: Group A showed a statistically significant increase in the serum levels of calcium corrected for serum albumin (cCa), <e>phosphorus</e> (P), total alkaline phosphatases (ALP), PTH and 25(OH)D. Group B showed a statistically significant increase in serum levels of cCa and P. A statistically significant decrease in serum levels of ALP and 25(OH)D was observed. Baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were 12.6 + 3.8 ng/mL in group A and 23.0 + 5.0 ng/mL in group B (p&lt;0.0001). After 6 months, they increased to 38.3 + 21.0 ng/mL in group A (p&lt;0.01) and decreased to 16.9 + 5.8 ng/mL in group B (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with oral calcitriol was associated with a decrease in the serum levels of ALP and 25(OH)D; treatment with oral calcidiol was associated with more physiological serum levels of 25(OH)D and with an increase in the serum levels of ALP and PTH: whether the statistically significant differences in the biochemical parameters achieved with the 2 treatments have a clinical relevance, remains a matter of debate.",M2
20172218,"The effect of injectable butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin on postpartum serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, calcium, and <e>phosphorus</e> concentrations in dairy cattle.The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an injection of 10% butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin (Catosal, Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS) on the day of calving and 1 d later on the prevalence of subclinical ketosis in dairy cattle in the early postpartum period. Cows from 4 herds (n=1,122) were randomized to receive either 25mL of 10% butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin or 25mL of sterile water subcutaneously on both days. Each milliliter of Catosal contained 0.05mg of cyanocobalamin and 100mg of butaphosphan, which provided 17.3mg of P in the form of [1-(butylamino)-1-methylethyl]-phosphonic acid. Serum was sampled for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration at calving (pretreatment) and again between 3 and 10 d in milk. A subset of samples from mature cows was also evaluated for serum Ca and P concentrations. When cows from all age groups were included in the analysis, there was no difference between the median serum BHBA concentrations of cows in the 2 treatment groups, and no difference in the proportion of hyperketonemic cows (serum BHBA &gt;or=1,200micromol/L) during the first week postpartum. When the analysis was restricted to mature cows (lactation &gt;or=3), both the median BHBA concentration and the proportion of hyperketonemic cows were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group. Serum Ca and P concentrations did not differ between treatment groups. Our results suggest that injection of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin on the day of calving and 1 d later may decrease the prevalence of subclinical ketosis during the week after calving in mature dairy cows, but not in first- and second-lactation animals.",M2
20170019,"Characterization of phosphobacteria isolated from eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.Phosphobacteria are able to enhance <e>phosphorus</e> availability in soil and improve crop yields. To develop such biofertilizers, 14 predominant phosphobacteria were isolated from eutrophic aquatic ecosystems. Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis revealed three groups among the nine isolates of inorganic phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (IPSB): IPSB1 and IPSB2 belonged to the actinobacteria and flavobacteria, respectively, and the other seven belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria. Among five isolates of organic phosphorus-mineralizing bacteria (OPMB), two groups were present: OPMB1 and OPMB3 belonged to the beta-proteobacteria, while the other three belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria. The IPSB isolates released 62.8-66.7 mg P 1(-1) from tricalcium phosphate under shaking conditions, and 26.8 to 43.7 mg P 1(-1) under static conditions; the OPMB strains released 23.5-30.2 mg P 1(-1) from lecithin under shaking conditions, and 16.7-27.6 mg P 1(-1) under static conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that IPSBI (designated Aureobacterium resistents) as a tricalcium phosphate-solubilizing bacterium and OPMB1 and OPMB3 (designated Acidovorax temperans and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, respectively) are lecithin-mineralizing bacteria.

There were 6 barrows per diet, in a randomized complete block design, with an average initial body weight of 10.4, 20.0, or 51.1 kg for each of starter, grower, and finisher pigs in the three phosphorus balance experiments, respectively. In the experiments, the addition of dicalcium phosphate or phytase to the basal diet increased (P &lt; 0.05) the digestibility and retention of P, and there were linear reductions (P &lt; 0.05) in water-soluble P excretion as a result of supplementing the basal diet with phytase. In the starter pig experiment, phytase addition at 500 or 1000 units/kg reduced (P &lt; 0.05) water-soluble P excretion by 28 or 42%, respectively when compared with the B + P diet. In the grower pig experiment, adding phytase at 500 or 1000 units/kg reduced (P &lt; 0.05) water-soluble P excretion by 24 or 34%, respectively when compared with the B + P diet. The use of phytase at 500 or 1000 units/kg reduced (P &lt; 0.05) water-soluble P excretion by 11 or 30%, respectively in the finisher pig experiment. The proportion of water-soluble phosphorus in total phosphorus was not affected by dietary treatment in any of the three experiments. In conclusion, adding phytase at 1000 units/kg to a corn-soybean meal-based P-deficient diet basal diet containing no added inorganic P compared with B + P diet reduced the daily excretion of water-soluble P in starter, grower, and finisher pigs by 42, 34, and 30%, respectively.",M2

A survey was conducted at the Kyoto University experimental farm in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, and included 9.5 ha of meadow and about 160 head of beef cattle. Forages cultivated on the meadow were ensiled and offered to breeding cows. The whole farm was regarded as a beef-forage production system. The system consisted of three components: animals, manure and soil/crop. Nutrient inputs, flows through the soil-plant-animal pathway and outputs were quantified for 2 periods for the whole farm. Nutrient utilization was evaluated by nutrient balances, utilization efficiencies (ratio of nutrient export to nutrient input) and cycling index. The average nutrient balances of N, P and K for the whole farm (kg/year/ha) were 435.7, 136.3, and 262.8, and the average nutrient utilization efficiencies were 0.08, 0.06, and 0.01, respectively. The characteristics of nutrient balances and utilization efficiencies for each component differed among the nutrients. The average cycling indices for N, P and K were 0.19, 0.17 and 0.49, respectively.

The X-ray crystal structure of two derivatives containing dangling <e>phosphorus</e>.The reaction of NP(3) (tris[2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl]amine and PP(3) (tris[2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl]phosphine) with the five-coordinate complexes [PdCl(NP(3))]Cl (1) and [MX(PP(3))]X [M = Pd: X = Cl(2), Br(3), I(4); M = Pt: X = Cl(5), Br(6), I(7)], respectively, followed by (31)P{(1)H}NMR when X = Cl, led to the formation of unprecedented four-coordinate halides in a 1 : 2 metal to ligand ratio, [M(AP(3))(2)]X(2) [A = N, M = Pd: X = Cl(8); A = P, M = Pd: X = Cl(9), Br(10), I(11); A = P, M = Pt: X = Cl(12), Br(13), I (14)], containing reactive dangling phosphorus. Given the non characterised precursors [M(ONO(2))(PP(3))](NO(3))], the interaction between the heteronuclear species [MAg(NO(3))(3)(PP(3))] [M = Pd(15), Pt(16)] and PP(3) was explored. It was found that the addition of 1 equivalent of phosphine afforded [MAg(NO(3))(PP(3))(2)](NO(3))(2) [M = Pd(15*), Pt(16*)] containing Ag(I) bound to two dangling phosphorus while the reaction with 2 equivalents led to the complexes [M(PP(3))(2)](NO(3))(2) [M = Pd (17), Pt (18)] in coexistence with [Ag(2)(mu-PP(3))(2)](NO(3))(2). The fate of Ag(I) on the reaction of the mixed metal compounds with excess PP(3) consisted of preventing dissociation, observed in solution for halides, and acting as an assistant for crystallization. Colourless single crystals of 18 and 10, studied by X-ray diffraction, were afforded by reaction of 16 with 4 equivalents of PP(3) and from solutions of 10 in chloroform coexisting with red crystals of 3, respectively. The structures revealed the presence of dications [M(PP(3))(2)](2+) that show two five-membered chelate rings to M(II) in a square-planar arrangement and four uncoordinated phosphine arms with the counter anions being symmetrically placed at 4.431 (Br(-)) and 13.823 (NO(3)(-)) A from M(II) above and below its coordination, MP(4), plane. Complexes 9 and 12 were shown to undergo an interesting reactivity in solution versus group 11 monocations. The reactions consisted of conversions of the two five-membered chelate rings to M into three (structure I) or two (structure II) fused five-membered chelate rings, formation of species where Pt(II) retained its square-planar environment with the two dangling phosphine arms of each PP(3) bound to Cu(I) or Ag(I) (structure III) and complexes bearing distorted square-planar (P(2)MCl(2)) and presumably tetrahedral (AuP(4)+ P(2)AuCl(2)) arrangements (structure IV).

The sulfur K-edge XANES spectra, however, show significantly higher accumulations of sulfur in the sulfate (SO(4)(2-)) form in hairs of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia patients. This study presents the possible roles of calcium, chlorine, phosphorus and sulfur in the etiology of dementia in elderly patients.",M2
20153174,"Evaluation of a membrane biological reactor for reclaiming water, alkalinity, salts, <e>phosphorus</e>, and protein contained in a high-strength aquacultural wastewater.The capacity of a membrane biological reactor to provide nitrification, denitrification, and enhanced biological phosphorus removal of a high-strength aquaculture backwash flow (control condition), or the same flow amended with 100mg/L of NO(3)-N and 3mg/L of dissolved P (test condition), was assessed using only endogenous carbon. Permeate TSS and cBOD(5) concentrations were &lt;1mg/L under control and test conditions, achieving 99.97-100% removal efficiencies, respectively. Permeate TN concentrations were 1.8+/-0.5mg/L and 2.1+/-1.4 mg/L, while permeate TP concentrations were 0.05+/-0.01 mg/L and 0.10+/-0.03 mg/L, respectively, under control and test conditions. Our findings suggest that permeate flow could be reclaimed to recycle alkalinity, salts, and heat for fish culture and that the waste activated sludge does not produce metals concentrations that would prevent its land application (reclaiming phosphorus) or prevent its use as a protein source in animal feeds.",M2
20151695,"The mechanism of nucleophilic displacements at <e>phosphorus</e> in chloro-substituted methylphosphonate esters: P-O vs P-C bond cleavage: a DFT study.Potential energy surfaces for the nucleophilic displacements at phosphorus in dimethyl methyl-, chloromethyl-, dichloromethyl-, and trichloromethylphosphonates have been computed at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory, using IEF-PCM to account for the solvent effect. The results reveal that sequential addition of chlorine substituents on the methyl phosphonates increases the stability of transition states and intermediates which facilitate P-C bond cleavage. Thus, while nonsubstituted dimethyl methylphosphonate and dimethyl chloromethylphosphonate may undergo exclusive P-O bond cleavage, the trichlorinated analogue exclusively undergoes P-C bond dissociation. Dichloromethylphosphonic acid derivatives were found to be borderline cases: while P-O fission is the preferred process, P-C scission might also be feasible. The increase in stability of the corresponding transition states and intermediates can account for the enhancement in the apicophilicity of the methyl ligand upon substitution with chlorine atoms.",M2
20150695,"Sorption and desorption of <e>phosphorus</e> by shale: batch and column studies.Constructed wetland systems have gained attention as attractive solutions for wastewater treatment. Wetlands are not efficient to treat wastewater with high concentrations of phosphorus (P). In order to remove high soluble P loads by wetland, sorbent beds can be added prior to the discharge of wastewater into wetlands. Sorption by sorbent materials is identified as a method for trapping excess P in wastewaters. In the present investigation, shale has been identified as a sorbent material for removal of phosphate (PO(4)-P) due to the cost effectiveness, stability and possibility of regeneration. The study focuses on the removal of PO(4)-P from wastewater using shale and the feasibility of using the P-sorbed material as slow-release fertilizer. Phosphorus sorption experiments were conducted by using shale (2 mm and 2-4.7 mm). Results indicate that Shale I (particle size = 2 mm) showed the highest sorption of PO(4)-P (500 +/- 44 mg kg(-1)). Breakthrough point was reached within 10 h in columns with flow rates of 2 and 3 ml min(-1). Lower flow rate of 1 ml min(-1) showed an average residence time of about 2 h while columns with a higher flow rate of 3 ml min(-1) showed a residence time of about 40 minutes. Variation in flow rate did not influence the desorption process. Since very low concentrations of PO(4)-P are released, Shale saturated with PO(4)-P may be used as a slow nutrient release source of P or as a soil amendment. The sorbent can also be regenerated by removing the sorbed PO(4)-P by using 0.1 N HCl.",M2
20150282,"Alterations in <e>phosphorus</e>, calcium and PTHrP contribute to defects in dental and dental alveolar bone formation in calcium-sensing receptor-deficient mice.To determine whether the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) participates in tooth formation and dental alveolar bone development in mandibles in vivo, we examined these processes, as well as mineralization, in 2-week-old CaR-knockout (CaR(-/-)) mice. We also attempted to rescue the phenotype of CaR(-/-) mice by genetic means, in mice doubly homozygous for CaR and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1alpha-hydroxylase [1alpha(OH)ase] or parathyroid hormone (Pth). In CaR(-/-) mice, which exhibited hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia and increased serum PTH, the volumes of teeth and of dental alveolar bone were decreased dramatically, whereas the ratio of the area of predentin to total dentin and the number and surface of osteoblasts in dental alveolar bone were increased significantly, as compared with wild-type littermates. The normocalcemia present in CaR(-/-);1alpha(OH)ase(-/-) mice only slightly improved the defects in dental and alveolar bone formation observed in the hypercalcemic CaR(-/-) mice. However, these defects were completely rescued by the additional elimination of hypophosphatemia and by an increase in parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression in the apical pulp, Hertwig's epithelial root sheath and mandibular tissue in CaR(-/-); Pth(-/-) mice. Therefore, alterations in calcium, phosphorus and PTHrP contribute to defects in the formation of teeth and alveolar bone in CaR-deficient mice. This study indicates that CaR participates in the formation of teeth and in the development of dental alveolar bone in mandibles in vivo, although it appears to do so largely indirectly.",M2
20150198,"Localized application of soil organic matter shifts distribution of cluster roots of white lupin in the soil profile due to localized release of <e>phosphorus</e>.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Phosphorus (P) is a major factor controlling cluster-root formation. Cluster-root proliferation tends to concentrate in organic matter (OM)-rich surface-soil layers, but the nature of this response of cluster-root formation to OM is not clear. Cluster-root proliferation in response to localized application of OM was characterized in Lupinus albus (white lupin) grown in stratified soil columns to test if the stimulating effect of OM on cluster-root formation was due to (a) P release from breakdown of OM; (b) a decrease in soil density; or (c) effects of micro-organisms other than releasing P from OM. METHODS: Lupin plants were grown in three-layer stratified soil columns where P was applied at 0 or 330 mg P kg(-1) to create a P-deficient or P-sufficient background, and OM, phytate mixed with OM, or perlite was applied to the top or middle layers with or without sterilization. KEY RESULTS: Non-sterile OM stimulated cluster-root proliferation and root length, and this effect became greater when phytate was supplied in the presence of OM. Both sterile OM and perlite significantly decreased cluster-root formation in the localized layers. The OM position did not change the proportion of total cluster roots to total roots in dry biomass among no-P treatments, but more cluster roots were concentrated in the OM layers with a decreased proportion in other places. CONCLUSIONS: Localized application of non-sterile OM or phytate plus OM stimulated cluster-root proliferation of L. albus in the localized layers. This effect is predominantly accounted for by P release from breakdown of OM or phytate, but not due to a change in soil density associated with OM. No evidence was found for effects of micro-organisms in OM other than those responsible for P release.",M2
20143773,"Influence of variety, location, growing year, and storage on the total <e>phosphorus</e>, phytate-phosphorus, and phytate-phosphorus to total phosphorus ratio in rice.The influence of variety, location, growing year, and storage on the total phosphorus (total P), phytate-P, and phytate-P to total P ratio in Korean rice varieties was investigated. Experiment 1 investigated the influence of 9 rice varieties, 4 locations, and 2 growing years. In experiment 2, the effect of storage for 1, 6, and 12 months was examined. Results showed that locations, varieties, and their interactions had a significant effect on the total P and phytate-P contents in rice, whereas growing year did not. Location had a higher effect than variety. Rice grown at locations with higher precipitation levels and higher temperatures obtained lower total P, phytate-P, and phytate-P to total P ratio. Effect of variety and location showed the possibility of reducing phytate-P in rice. Storage of rice for up to 12 months did not affect the total P and phytate-P concentrations of rice.",M2
20143720,"Use of benthic biodiversity for assessing the impact of shrimp farming on environment.An attempt was made to find out the impact of shrimp farm discharges on benthic diversity in the discharge point of a shrimp farm. The duration of the study was one culture period right from stocking to harvest. The results revealed that the values of environmental entities were in the safe levels. As regards nutrients, maximum value of TOC and <e>phosphorus</e> were recorded in the sample collected after harvest and minimum in the sample collected during culture. BIO-ENV method revealed that nitrogen, sediment salinity and TOC were manifested as best variable combination explaining faunal distribution. Polychaetes are the dominant group (50%) with 13 species followed by crustaceans (32%) with 10 species, gastropods (10%) with 2 species and bivalves (8%) with 3 species. The faunal density was found to vary in relation to months as observed in the samples which were collected during various seasons in the other areas of estuary. In line with this, diversity values were also paralleled to the faunal density. In a nut shell, the study revealed no negative impact of shrimp farming to the estuarine benthic biota.",M2
20143709,"Seasonal and vertical distributions of porewater <e>phosphorus</e> and iron concentrations in a macrophyte-dominated eutrophic lake.In this study variations in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total iron (TFe) concentrations and pH values in the littoral sediment porewater of macrophyte-dominated eutrophic Mogan Lake (Turkey), were determined depth wise (0-20 cm, on a basis of 5 cm depths) over a period of eleven months. Additionally water temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, TDP, SRP and TFe levels in the overlying water were measured. Especially in the spring and summer months constituting a large portion of the research period, seasonal variation of SRP at depths between 0-5 cm and 15-20 cm were not found to be statistically significant (p &gt; 0.01). However in the fall and winter months, surface sediment (0-5 cm) SRP values were elevated in comparison with deeper sediment depths. As for TFe values, no clearseasonal variation was evident at different depths. Due to the fact that TFe concentrations in the overlying water (101.25-511.67 mg x m(-3)) were lower than iron concentrations in the porewater (104.00-783.00 mg x m(-3)), positive phosphorus release remained at low levels. In this eutrophic lake, in which action is continuing to reduce the external phosphorus load, monitoring SRP variations in the overlying water and porewater would be beneficial.",M2

20139340,"In vivo dentin remineralization by calcium-phosphate cement.Minimally invasive caries-removal procedures remove only caries-infected dentin and preserve caries-affected dentin that becomes remineralized. Dental cements containing calcium phosphate promote remineralization. This study evaluated the in vivo remineralization capacity of resin-based calcium-phosphate cement (Ca-P) used for indirect pulp-capping. Carious and sound teeth indicated for extraction were randomly restored with the Ca-P base or without base (control), followed by adhesive restoration. Study teeth were extracted after three months, followed by elemental analysis of the cavity floor. Mineral content of affected or sound dentin at the cavity floor was quantified by electron probe micro-analysis to 100-mum depth. After three months, caries-affected dentin underneath the Ca-P base showed significantly increased calcium and <e>phosphorus</e> content to a depth of 30 mum. Mineral content of treated caries-affected dentin was in the range of healthy dentin, revealing the capacity of Ca-P base to promote remineralization of caries-affected dentin.",M2
20138755,"The removal of nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e> from reject water of municipal wastewater treatment plant using ferric and nitrate bioreductions.Reject water, which is the liquid fraction produced after dewatering of anaerobically digested activated sludge on the municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs), contributes up to 80% of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the MWWTP. It was proposed to combine the removal of nitrogen from reject water using the sequential biooxidation of NH(4)(+) and bioreduction of NO(3)(-) with precipitation of phosphate by Fe(2+) ions produced due to bioreduction of Fe(3+) in iron ore. Bioreduction of NO(3)(-) decreased Fe(3+) bioreduction rate in reject water from 37 to 21mg Fe(2+)/Ld due to competition between NO(3)(-) and Fe(3+) for electron donors. Addition of acetate as electron donor increased both bioreduction rates of Fe(3+) and NO(3)(-) but acetate interfered with the competition between nitrate and phosphate anions reacting with ferrous cations decreasing efficiency of the phosphate removal from reject water. The stages of denitrification and ferric bioreduction/phosphate precipitation must be performed sequentially.",M2

The set point values for the internal recycles were determined in advance with the use of an optimisation spreadsheet based on the ASM2d model to optimise the simultaneous removal of C, N and P. The biological nutrient removal (BNR) efficiencies were high from the start of operation with COD and N removal efficiencies of 92+/-6% and 89+/-7, respectively. During the course of the experiment P removal efficiencies increased and finally a P-removal efficiency of 92% was achieved. The activity of poly-phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and denitrifying poly-phosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs) increased and the specific phosphate accumulation rates after 150days of operation amounted to 13.6mgPg(-1)VSSh(-1) and 5.6mgPg(-1)VSSh(-1), for PAOs and DPAOs, respectively.",M2
20137917,"Population dynamics in a sequencing batch reactor fed with glucose and operated for enhanced biological <e>phosphorus</e> removal.The study investigated the effect of glucose feeding as the sole carbon source on population dynamics in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The lab-scale SBR operation was started with a biomass taken from a WWTP plant performing EBPR and continued around two months. It exhibited a sequence of periods with different performance and biomass characteristics. The first period indicated predominant EBPR activity, involving phosphorus release in the anaerobic phase with PHA production as expected. Lactate generated from glucose fermentation was presumably converted to PHA by PAOs as an essential part of the EBPR activity. In the second period a major shift occurred in the population dynamics favoring the preferential growth and the predominance of GAOs which have the advantage of utilizing glucose directly and eventually the EBPR activity was deteriorated. The significant feature of the third period was the proliferation of filamentous microorganisms.",M2
20143065,"The influence of nutrients and physical habitat in regulating algal biomass in agricultural streams.This study examined the relative influence of nutrients (nitrogen and <e>phosphorus</e>) and habitat on algal biomass in five agricultural regions of the United States. Sites were selected to capture a range of nutrient conditions, with 136 sites distributed over five study areas. Samples were collected in either 2003 or 2004, and analyzed for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) and algal biomass (chlorophyll a). Chlorophyll a was measured in three types of samples, fine-grained benthic material (CHL(FG)), coarse-grained stable substrate as in rock or wood (CHL(CG)), and water column (CHL(S)). Stream and riparian habitat were characterized at each site. TP ranged from 0.004-2.69 mg/l and TN from 0.15-21.5 mg/l, with TN concentrations highest in Nebraska and Indiana streams and TP highest in Nebraska. Benthic algal biomass ranged from 0.47-615 mg/m(2), with higher values generally associated with coarse-grained substrate. Seston chlorophyll ranged from 0.2-73.1 microg/l, with highest concentrations in Nebraska. Regression models were developed to predict algal biomass as a function of TP and/or TN. Seven models were statistically significant, six for TP and one for TN; r(2) values ranged from 0.03 to 0.44. No significant regression models could be developed for the two study areas in the Midwest. Model performance increased when stream habitat variables were incorporated, with 12 significant models and an increase in the r(2) values (0.16-0.54). Water temperature and percent riparian canopy cover were the most important physical variables in the models. While models that predict algal chlorophyll a as a function of nutrients can be useful, model strength is commonly low due to the overriding influence of stream habitat. Results from our study are presented in context of a nutrient-algal biomass conceptual model.",M2
20141632,"Can differences in <e>phosphorus</e> uptake kinetics explain the distribution of cattail and sawgrass in the Florida Everglades?BACKGROUND: Cattail (Typha domingensis) has been spreading in phosphorus (P) enriched areas of the oligotrophic Florida Everglades at the expense of sawgrass (Cladium mariscus spp. jamaicense). Abundant evidence in the literature explains how the opportunistic features of Typha might lead to a complete dominance in P-enriched areas. Less clear is how Typha can grow and acquire P at extremely low P levels, which prevail in the unimpacted areas of the Everglades. RESULTS: Apparent P uptake kinetics were measured for intact plants of Cladium and Typha acclimated to low and high P at two levels of oxygen in hydroponic culture. The saturated rate of P uptake was higher in Typha than in Cladium and higher in low-P acclimated plants than in high-P acclimated plants. The affinity for P uptake was two-fold higher in Typha than in Cladium, and two- to three-fold higher for low-P acclimated plants compared to high-P acclimated plants. As Cladium had a greater proportion of its biomass allocated to roots, the overall uptake capacity of the two species at high P did not differ. At low P availability, Typha increased biomass allocation to roots more than Cladium. Both species also adjusted their P uptake kinetics, but Typha more so than Cladium. The adjustment of the P uptake system and increased biomass allocation to roots resulted in a five-fold higher uptake per plant for Cladium and a ten-fold higher uptake for Typha. CONCLUSIONS: Both Cladium and Typha adjust P uptake kinetics in relation to plant demand when P availability is high. When P concentrations are low, however, Typha adjusts P uptake kinetics and also increases allocation to roots more so than Cladium, thereby improving both efficiency and capacity of P uptake. Cladium has less need to adjust P uptake kinetics because it is already efficient at acquiring P from peat soils (e.g., through secretion of phosphatases, symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, nutrient conservation growth traits). Thus, although Cladium and Typha have qualitatively similar strategies to improve P-uptake efficiency and capacity under low P-conditions, Typha shows a quantitatively greater response, possibly due to a lesser expression of these mechanisms than Cladium. This difference between the two species helps to explain why an opportunistic species such as Typha is able to grow side by side with Cladium in the P-deficient Everglades.",M2
