20191348,"Improvement of the extraction efficiency of D-amygdalin from Armeniacae <e>Semen</e> powder through inactivating emulsin and suppressing the epimerization of D-amygdalin.Armeniacae Semen contains not only amygdalin but also emulsin, which is an enzyme that hydrolyzes amygdalin. This hydrolysis reaction has been a major problem associated with the water extraction of Armeniacae Semen powder. In this study, the emulsin was inactivated by extracting Armeniacae Semen powder at a constant temperature of 90 degrees C. In addition, in order to suppress the epimerization of D-amygdalin, the extraction time was kept to less than 8 min. The use of a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.3) containing 13.5% acetonitrile as a mobile phase in reversed-phase HPLC was effective in separating and analyzing the D-amygdalin and neoamygdalin. The linearity between the concentrations and detector responses was obtained in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 mM. The detection limits for D-amygdalin and neoamygdalin were approximately 5 microM per amount injected.",M1

Voigt seeds (Semen pharbitidis) were tested against Dactylogyrus intermedius (Monogenea) in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Among the extracts tested, the methanolic and aqueous extracts of S. aesculi were observed to be more efficient than the other plant extracts with EC(50) and EC(90) values of 5.23 and 7.33 mg/L and 6.48 and 12.29 mg/L after 48 h, respectively, followed by methanolic extracts of Fructus bruceae, Radix angelicae pubescentis, Caulis spatholobi, and Semen pharbitidis with EC(50) 49.96, 57.45, 64.92, and 309.47 mg/L. The methanolic and aqueous extracts of S. aesculi exhibited potential results and can be exploited as a preferred natural antiparasitic for the control of D. intermedius.",M1
19912670,"Mutagenicity of Chinese traditional medicine <e>Semen</e> Armeniacae amarum by two modified Ames tests.BACKGROUND: Semen armeniacae amarum (SAA) is a Chinese traditional medicine and has long been used to control acute lower respiratory tract infection and asthma, as a result of its expectorant and antiasthmatic activities. However, its mutagenicity in vitro and in vivo has not yet been reported. The Ames test for mutagenicity is used worldwide. The histidine contained in biological samples can induce histidine-deficient cells to replicate, which results in more his+ colonies than in negative control cells, therefore false-positive results may be obtained. So, it becomes a prerequisite to exclude the effects of any residual histidine from samples when they are assayed for their mutagenicity. Chinese traditional herbs, such as SAA, are histidine-containing biological sample, need modified Ames tests to assay their in vitro mutagenicity. METHODS: The mutagenicity of SAA was evaluated by the standard and two modified Ames tests. The first modification used the plate incorporation test same as standard Ames teat, but with new negative control systems, in which different amounts of histidine corresponding to different concentrations of SAA was incorporated. When the number of his+ revertants in SAA experiments was compared with that in new negative control, the effect of histidine contained in SAA could be eliminated. The second modification used a liquid suspension test similar to the standard Ames test, except with histidine-rich instead of histidine-limited medium. The aim of this change was to conceal the effect of histidine contained in SAA on the final counting of his+ revertants, and therefore to exclude false-positive results of SAA in the Ames test. Furthermore, the effect of SAA on chromosomal aberration in mammalian bone marrow cells was tested. RESULTS: The standard Ames test showed a positive result for mutagenicity of SAA. In contrast, a negative response was obtained with the modified plate incorporation and modified suspension Ames tests. Moreover, no apparent chromosomal aberrations were observed in mammalian bone marrow cells treated with SAA. CONCLUSION: The standard Ames test was not suitable for evaluating the mutagenicity of SAA, because false-positive result could be resulted by the histidine content in SAA. However, the two modified Ames tests were suitable, because the experimental results proved that the effect of histidine in SAA and therefore the false-positive result were effectively excluded in these two modified Ames tests. This conclusion needs more experimental data to support in the future. Moreover, the experimental results illustrated that SAA had no mutagenicity in vitro and in vivo. This was in agreement with the clinical safety of SAA long-term used in China.",M1
19682877,"Pharmacological studies on the sedative-hypnotic effect of <e>Semen</e> Ziziphi spinosae (Suanzaoren) and Radix et Rhizoma Salviae miltiorrhizae (Danshen) extracts and the synergistic effect of their combinations.Semen Ziziphi spinosae (Suanzaoren in China) and Radix et Rhizoma Salviae miltiorrhizae (Danshen in China) are conventional herbal drugs in traditional Chinese medicine and have been used widely for the treatment of insomnia. In the present study, the sedative-hypnotic activity of the active fractions extracted from Suanzaoren and Danshen were studied using the method of pentobarbital-induced sleep in the mouse model. Qualitative analysis of the standardized extracts was carried out by HPLC-DAD. The results showed that the water extract of Suanzaoren (SWE) (400 and 800 mg/kg body wt.) and the ether extract of Danshen (DTT) (300 and 600 mg/kg body wt.) can shorten sleep latency significantly, increase sleeping time and prolong movement convalescence time induced by sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg body wt.) administration in mice. Furthermore, the combination of SWE and DTT showed significant synergistic effect (p&lt;0.05) in decreasing sleep latency and increasing sleeping time, but not in prolonging the movement convalescence time, which might be helpful for energy recovery in the treatment of insomnia. The results suggest that SWE, DTT, and the combination of SWE and DTT possess significant sedative-hypnotic activity, which supports the popular use of Suanzaoren and Danshen for treatment of insomnia and provide the basis for new drug discovery. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the combination of SWE and DTT may be preferable for the treatment of insomnia.",M1

METHODS: Ventricular remodeling was induced by abdominal aortic banding (AAB) in rats. After 30 days' treatment, the ratios of LVW/BW (left ventricle weight/body weight), HW/BW (heart weight/body weight) were calculated; Then the CYP11B, CYP11B2 and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression of left ventricle were detected by Real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The experimental data demonstrated that Semen descurainiae decreased the indexes of LVW/BW and HW/BW, down-regulated CYP11B, CYP11B2 and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in left ventricle (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Semen desceurainiae can significantly inhibit the experimental ventricular remodeling; the mechanism is related to its ability to attenuate the mRNA expression of CYP11B1, CYP11B2 and TGF-beta1 in left ventricle. The inhibition of aldosterone key gene expression by Semen descurainiae may contribute to its effect on restraint cardiac remodeling.",M1
19246083,"Improvement of liquid and frozen-thawed <e>semen</e> quality of Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls (Bubalus bubalis) through supplementation of fat.The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary fat on quality of liquid and frozen-thawed semen of Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls. Adult bulls (n=21) were fed a balanced ration (Con; n=7) or the same ration either containing sunflower oil (SF-O; n=7) or whole sunflower seeds (SF-S; n=7) for 63 days. Body weight and body condition score of each bull was recorded on days 0, 30 and 60 of the experiment. Semen was collected on days 39, 46, 53 and 60, frozen by a fast method and stored at -196 degrees C for 24h. Sperm motility was assessed using a bright field microscope. Plasma membrane integrity of fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa was assessed using a hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) assay. The concentration of spermatozoa and volume of semen was not different among groups on various days of collection. Sunflower-enriched diets did not affect the motility and number of HOS-positive spermatozoa in the fresh semen. Motility and HOS of post-thawed spermatozoa were higher (p&lt;0.05) in bulls fed the sunflower-enriched diets. Similarly, diets did not affect the body condition score and body weight of bulls. In conclusion, feeding of sunflower oil or sunflower seed as fat sources can improve the quality of buffalo bull spermatozoa.",M1

19151733,"Sperm quality improvement after date seed oil in vitro supplementation in spontaneous and induced oxidative stress.In vitro supplementation with date seed oil (DSO) can protect spermatozoa against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated damage and can improve sperm function, possibly owing to antioxidant properties. We tested the antioxidant effects of DSO on human sperm motility, sperm viability, reacted acrosome and lipid peroxidation assessed in vitro after H2O2-mediated oxidative damage in spermatozoa. Sixteen patients (mean age: 35 years; range: 25-45 years) referred to the Histology-Embryology Laboratory of the Medicine Faculty of Sfax for <e>semen</e> analysis after 12-24 months of sexual intercourse without conception were selected. After spermiogram, sperm selection by two-interface discontinuous Sill Select gradient was performed, and selected spermatozoa were used in four experimental assays: control; incubation with 100 microm H2O2; incubation with 0.1% DSO; and co-incubation with 0.1% DSO and 100 microm H2O2. Motility and viability were determined using World Health Organization criteria. Acrosome reaction and lipid peroxidation were assessed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-Pisum sativum and spectrophotometric measurement of malondialdehyde, respectively. Results showed that incubation with H2O2 alone led to a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (57.83%, P&lt;0.05) associated with a significant decrease in sperm motility, sperm viability (after 30 min and 24 h) and percentage of reacted acrosome (P&lt;0.05). Date seed oil improved sperm motility after 24 h of incubation (P&lt;0.05) and protected spermatozoa against the deleterious effects of H2O2 on motility, viability, acrosome reaction and lipid peroxidation. We conclude that supplementation with DSO may have a function in antioxidant protection against male infertility.",M1

18598173,"The pericarp extract of Prunus persica attenuates chemotherapy-induced acute nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in mice.The fruit of Prunus persica L. (peach) is one of the common fruits. Its seed is well known as a traditional medicine (Persicae <e>Semen</e>) in Japan, China, and other Asian countries. However, the biological activities of P. persica fruit except its seed are poorly understood. This study was aimed at evaluating the protective effect of the pericarp extract of P. persica (PPE) against cisplatin-induced acute toxicity in mice. PPE (500 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a significant protection against the acute nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity induced by a single administration of cisplatin (45 mg/kg, i.p.) over a 16-hour period in mice. Its protective effect was evaluated by serum and tissue biochemical parameters. The pretreatment with PPE for 7 days prevented the cisplatin-induced decrease in the kidney and liver weights as a percentage of the total body weight. PPE significantly inhibited both the cisplatin-induced elevation in serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels caused by kidney damage and the cisplatin-induced increase in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels by the liver damage. In addition, the administration of PPE caused recovery of the cisplatin-mediated changes in levels of serum nitric oxide and tissue lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione content returned to control levels. These results suggest that PPE protects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity by reducing cisplatin-induced oxidative stress in mice.",M1

18219667,"Authentication of the 31 species of Toxic and Potent Chinese Materia Medica (T/PCMM) by microscopic technique, part 2: Three species of seed T/PCMM.Toxic and Potent Chinese Materia Medica (T/PCMM) are being used more and more in the treatment of various diseases. In view of their toxic side effects and to ensure their safe use, accurate and reliable authentication is indispensable. However, identifying characteristics of T/PCMM are seldom reported, even though modern microscopy can provide ample, unique identifying characteristics from cells found in transverse sections and powders. In particular, no systematic authentication studies on seed T/PCMM have been conducted. In the course of our study on 31 T/PCMM originating from plants, animals, minerals, and secreta, an accurate and convenient method, based on microscopic techniques, has been developed and reported for the authentication of animal T/PCMM. The present study deals with detailed investigations on three species of seed T/PCMM, namely <e>Semen</e> Hyoscyami (Hyoscyamus niger L.), Semen Euphorbiae (Euphorbia lathyris L.), and Semen Strychni (Strychnos nux-vomica L.). The macroscopic characters are here described in detail, and the microscopic characters were conclusively determined by common and polarized light microscopy. Results showed that these three T/PCMM can be easily identified by the present method even when powdered and combined. Thus, the microscopic method is applicable for authentication of the earlier three T/PCMM, and the morphological and microscopic characteristics described here are proposed as parameters to establish the authenticity of these three T/PCMM.",M1
18175965,"An improved method for basic hydrolysis of isoflavone malonylglucosides and quality evaluation of Chinese soy materials.Basic hydrolysis procedure is often included in the sample preparation in order to quantify malonylglucosides or acetylglucosides of soy materials. However, it is preferable not to use NaOH as a hydrolytic reagent considering the effect of its alkalinity on the successive injection to HPLC and low acidity of soy isoflavones. This paper presents an improved method for basic hydrolysis using ammonia as a hydrolytic reagent without the additional neutralization step. Moreover, by means of HPLC and LC-MS methods, a systematic quality evaluation of natural soy materials from Chinese markets were established and discussed, inclusive of soybeans, black soybeans, defatted soy flours, as well as the distribution of isoflavones in the seed coat, hypocotyl and cotyledon. The results indicate that HPLC profiling patterns of originating various isoflavone constituents of Chinese soybeans was similar to those of Japanese ones, and those of Chinese black soybeans was similar to those of American ones. The average content level of total soy isoflavones of Chinese soybeans and black soybeans were a little lower than that of American and Japanese ones. Additionally, the thorough analysis for <e>Semen</e> Sojae Praeparatum, a Chinese herbal medicine made from fermented black soybeans or soybeans was done for the first time and the characteristic of its HPLC profiling patterns shows the higher content of isoflavone glucosides and aglycones than those of natural soy materials.",M1

17225457,"Prevention of epimerization and quantitative determination of amygdalin in Armeniacae <e>Semen</e> with Schizandrae Fructus solution.Armeniacae Semen not only contains amygdalin, but emulsin also, which is an enzyme that hydrolyzes amygdalin. The extraction yield of amygdalin from Armeniacae Semen was low, due to the presence of emulsin, when extracted with water. When Schizandrae Fructus solution was used as the extractant; however, amygdalin was almost completely extracted, regardless of the cutting size, due to the absence of the influence of emulsin. In addition, when the crude powder or small piece forms were used with Schizandrae Fructus solution, on epimerization of the D-amygdalin into neoamygdalin occurred. D-amygdalin and its conversion product, neoamygdalin, were quantitatively analyzed by reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with an optimized eluent of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.3), containing 11.5% acetonitrile.

The effects of EESP on mice splenocyte proliferation in vitro were measured. EESP significantly suppressed concanavalin A (ConA)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated splenocyte proliferation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effects of EESP at three dose levels on the humoral and cellular immune responses in the OVA-immunized mice were examined. ICR Mice were immunized subcutaneously with OVA on day 0 and 14. Starting on the day of immunization, the mice were administered intraperitoneally with EESP at a single dose of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg, and cyclosporin A (CsA, positive drug) at a single dose of 0.1 mg at intervals of 7 days. On day 28, mitogen- and OVA-induced splenocyte proliferation and OVA-specific antibody level in serum were measured. EESP significantly decreased ConA-, LPS-, and OVA-induced splenocyte proliferation in the OVA-immunized mice at the dose of 1.0 mg. Meanwhile, the OVA-specific serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b antibody levels in the OVA-immunized mice were markedly reduced by EESP in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that EESP could suppress the cellular and humoral immune response in mice, and deserve further research to be developed as immunosuppressant.",M1

17024852,"Effects of Nelumbinis <e>Semen</e> on contractile dysfunction in ischemic and reperfused rat heart.Nelumbinis Semen (NS), or lotus seed, is one of the most well-known traditional herbal medicines and is frequently used to treat cardiovascular symptoms in Korea. The anti-ischemic effects of NS on ischemia-induced isolated rat heart were investigated through analyses of changes in blood pressure, aortic flow, coronary flow, and cardiac output. The subjects in this study were divided into two groups: a control, untreated ischemia-induced group, and an ischemia-induced group treated with NS. There were no significant differences in perfusion pressure, aortic flow, coronary flow and cardiac output between the groups before ischemia was induced. The supply of oxygen and buffer was stopped for ten minutes to induce ischemia in isolated rat hearts, and NS was administered during ischemia induction. NS treatment significantly prevented decreases in perfusion pressure, aortic flow, coronary flow and cardiac output under ischemic conditions (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the mechanism of the anti-ischemic effects of NS was also examined through quantitation of intracellular calcium content in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. NS significantly prevented intracellular calcium increases induced by isoproterenol (p &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that NS has distinct anti-ischemic effects through calcium antagonism.",M1

Linearity between concentrations and detector responses was obtained in the range from 0.05 to 0.5 mM. The detection limits for D-amygdalin and neoamygdalin were approximately 5 microM per injected amount. Armeniacae semen contains not only amygdalin but also emlusin, which is an enzyme that hydrolyzes amygdalin. When extracting amygdalin from a whole piece of armeniacae semen in boiling water, there was almost no influence of emulsin; which increased the extraction efficiency. However, conversion of d-amygdalin into neoamygdalin at high temperature was found. In this report, we solved this problem by using 4% citric acid as an extractant. This solution also prevented the extraction process from being affected by emulsin. In addition, the extraction efficiency remained the same as that when methanol was used as an extractant, regardless of the cutting size.",M1

The effect of PJBH extracts on H2O2-induced toxicity in the rat pheochromocytoma line PC12 was examined by measurements of cell lesion, level of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities, since free radicals are involved in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). After a 30 min exposure of the cells to H2O2 (150 microM), a marked decrease in cell survival, activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase as well as an increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA) were found. Pretreatment of the cells with PJBH (0.5-10 microg/ml) prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated cell survival, antioxidant enzyme activities and resulted in a decrease in the level of MDA. The effects of the PJBH on hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in PC12 cells were also examined. PJBH had a remarkable elevating effect on catalase and GSH-Px activities as well as cell survival, suggesting that cytoprotective effects of the PJBH are involved in stimulation against intermediate concentrations of H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury.

This paper describes the effects of exposure to CS(2) on male sexual function and semen quality in a baseline observation. The effects of CS(2) on male sexual function were evaluated, including number of sexual encounters and length of sexual encounters related to solvents in 80 male workers exposed to CS(2) and 49 reference workers from the filature and cotton pulp departments of a fabric factory in China. And the semen samples were obtained from 43 of the exposed and 35 of the control. Adjustment was made for potential confounding factors such as age or alcohol drinking. Exposure to CS(2) was dichotomized by job type. The rate of sexual dysfunction was higher, number of sexual encounters was lower, and length of sexual encounters was shorter compared with the control (p &lt; 0.001). It was indicated that exposed workers had fewer semen quantity, longer liquefaction time, lower acrosomal membrane integrity rate, vitality and density, and more deformity of semen than the control (p &lt; 0.01).

However, cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) and semen have significant H2O2-blocking activity. METHODS: We measured the H2O2 concentration of CVF and the H2O2-blocking activity of CVF and semen using fluorescence and in vitro bacterial-exposure experiments. RESULTS: The mean H2O2 measured in fully aerobic CVF was 23 +/- 5 microM; however, 50 microM H2O2 in salt solution showed no in vitro inactivation of HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus ducreyii, or any of six BV-associated bacteria. CVF reduced 1 mM added H2O2 to an undetectable level, while semen reduced 10 mM added H2O2 to undetectable. Moreover, the addition of just 1% CVF supernatant abolished in vitro pathogen-inactivation by H2O2-producing lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Given the H2O2-blocking activity of CVF and semen, it is implausible that H2O2-production by vaginal lactobacilli is a significant mechanism of protection in vivo.",M2
20450841,"Selenium in blood, <e>semen</e>, seminal plasma and spermatozoa of stallions and its relationship to sperm quality.The essential trace element selenium is indispensable for male fertility in mammals. Until now, little data existed regarding the relationship between selenium and sperm quality in the stallion. Selenium, or selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity, was determined in red blood cells, semen, seminal plasma and spermatozoa, and the percentages of spermatozoa with progressive motility (PMS), intact membranes (PMI), altered (positive) acrosomal status (PAS) and detectable DNA damage, determined by the sperm chromatin structure assay, were evaluated in 41 healthy stallions (three samples each). The pregnancy rate per oestrus cycle (PRC) served as an estimation of fertility. An adverse effect on stallion fertility caused by low dietary selenium intake was excluded, as all stallions had sufficient selenium levels in their blood. Interestingly, no significant correlations (P &gt; 0.05) between the selenium level in blood and the selenium level in seminal plasma or spermatozoa were found, suggesting that the selenium level in blood is no indicator of an adequate selenium supply for spermatogenesis. The selenium level in spermatozoa (nmol billion(-1)) was correlated with PMI, PMS and PAS (r = 0.40, r = 0.31 and r = -0.42, respectively; P &lt;/= 0.05), and the selenium concentration in spermatozoa (nmol g(-1)) was correlated with PRC (r = 0.40, P &lt; 0.03).

Those on antiretrovirals (n = 2) had lower seminal plasma viral loads (SPVL) (2.11 and 1.98 log(10) copies/mL) than those not on antiretrovirals (n = 3) (2.27-3.78 log(10) copies/mL). One patient who was not taking antiretrovirals had a 94% decline in SPVL after treatment of asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis urethritis, suggesting that asymptomatic infection may be a co-factor for HIV transmission.",M2
20215029,"An integrated microfluidic device for DNA purification and PCR amplification of STR fragments.This work presents the integration of DNA extraction from complex samples and PCR amplification of STR fragments in a valveless, glass microdevice, using commercially available kits and instrumentation. DNA extraction was performed using a microchannel packed with a silica solid phase and a standard syringe pump as a single pressure source driving the extraction process, followed by integrated, online microchip amplification of STR fragments in a total volume of 1.2 microL. Reported characteristics important to this work include the capacity of the device for purification of DNA from a complex biological sample (whole blood) and the timing of DNA elution from the silica solid phase for successful downstream PCR amplification by placement the microdevice into a conventional thermocycler. Potential application of this microdevice to forensic genetic analysis was demonstrated through the preliminary extraction of DNA from <e>semen</e>, followed by an integrated, multiplexed, on-chip amplification that yielded detectable STR amplicons. By utilizing conventional laboratory equipment, the device presented exploits the benefits of microfluidic systems without complex control systems.",M2

20197223,"Effects of adding taurine and trehalose to a tris-based egg yolk extender on buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) sperm quality following cryopreservation.Cryopreservation induces sublethal damage to the spermatozoa, which leads to their reduced fertile life. Under the present study, the cryoprotective effect of taurine and trehalose on buffalo sperm quality parameters after freeze-thaw process was studied. Buffalo <e>semen</e> was cryopreserved in tris-based egg yolk extender along with cryoprotectants like taurine (50 mM) or trehalose (100 mM) and used for the assessment of sperm quality parameters like motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, total antioxidant status and the extent of cryocapacitation. The results were compared to semen cryopreserved in tris-based egg yolk extender only as control. Post-thaw semen evaluation clearly indicated that the addition of taurine or trehalose significantly improved (P&lt;0.05) the motility, viability and membrane integrity compared to control spermatozoa. The extent of sperm cells underwent cryocapacitation was significantly lowered (P&lt;0.05) in presence of taurine or trehalose. Moreover, the percentage of in vitro capacitated cells in the treated samples was comparable to the control spermatozoa along with maintaining other sperm quality parameters. Finally, compared to the control and trehalose treated sample, addition of taurine to the freezing extender showed more positive effect on the total antioxidant power of seminal plasma and spermatozoa. It is concluded that the addition of taurine or trehalose to the freezing extender led to the reduction of cryodamage to the buffalo spermatozoa.",M2
20193223,"[Association between age and quality of <e>semen</e> in Chinese males with normal fertility]OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between age and variables of semen in Chinese males with normal fertility. METHODS: The population size under study would consist of 946 fertile male volunteers from 6 provinces of China, aged between 20 and 59. Semen quality was analyzed by hand on site and background information was obtained through structured questionnaire. Trend chi-square test and multiple linear regression methods were used and 95%CI were calculated to serve as reference value of semen variables of different age group. RESULTS: The normal percent of motility and living sperm declined significantly while the ascending of age, they were 55.7% and 97.3% in age &lt; 30 group when compared to 21.9% and 90.3% in the age 50 - 59 group respectively. Under control of confounding factors as for center and abstinence time, all semen variables except semen volume were significantly different among the age groups. Sperm concentration, percentage of sperm motility and normal morphology sperm decreased significantly after age 40 while percentage of living sperm decreased after age 50 - 59 group. Sperm concentration among the 50 - 59 year-old group appeared to be lower than the 40 - year-old group. CONCLUSION: The influence of age must be taken into account when evaluating the quality of semen.",M2
20187830,"Effect of <e>semen</e> in urine specimens on urine protein concentration determined by means of dipstick analysis.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of semen in urine specimens on urine protein concentration measured by means of dipstick analysis. SAMPLE POPULATION: 14 urine samples from 3 adult castrated male dogs and 14 semen samples from 7 adult sexually intact male dogs. PROCEDURES: Serial dilutions of the whole ejaculate or spermatozoa-free seminal fluid in urine were created, and unaltered and diluted urine samples were analyzed by means of a commercially available dipstick; pH and specific gravity of the samples were also measured. Spermatozoa and WBC counts of the semen samples and protein concentration of the seminal fluid were determined. RESULTS: Protein concentrations determined by means of dipstick analysis of urine samples to which whole ejaculate (dilutions of 1:1, 1:2, 1:16, 1:64, and 1:256) or seminal fluid (dilutions of 1:1, 1:2, 1:16, and 1:64) had been added were significantly higher than concentrations in unaltered urine samples. All 13 samples to which whole ejaculate was added at a dilution of 1:2 and 10 of 12 samples to which seminal fluid was added at a dilution of 1:2 were positive for blood on dipstick analysis. There was no significant linear correlation between spermatozoa or WBC count of the semen sample and protein concentration of the spermatozoa-free seminal fluid. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that regardless of whether spermatozoa were present, semen contamination could result in false-positive results for protein and blood during dipstick analysis of urine samples from sexually intact male dogs.",M2
20178592,"In vitro antioxidant activity of the prostatic secretory granules in rabbit <e>semen</e> after exposure to organic peroxides.BACKGROUND: The prostate gland of rabbits produces numerous granules, which are specifically implicated in the inhibition of sperm capacitation during the first hours after mating. These granules are rich in vitamin E, but their role in the antioxidant protection of rabbit sperm has not been studied. AIM OF STUDY: The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the prostatic secretory granules (PSGs) could prevent sperm induced-lipid peroxidation and to verify a potential involvement of tocopherols from the PSGs to the sperm. METHODS: Washed sperm samples taken from eighteen White New Zealand rabbits were either incubated with tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (t-BHP, an oxidative stressor) or with buffered Tyrode's medium for 1 hour. The same number of sperm samples that contained PSGs were subjected to the previously mentioned treatments and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), vitamin E compounds and the acrosome status were assessed. RESULTS: The incubation of the sperm with t-BHP resulted in a noticeable production of TBARS (0.38 vs. 0.22 nmol/10(7) cells) and an associated decrease of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T, 72.3 vs. 103.2 nmol/10(8) cells) with respect to the sperm samples containing PSGs. The sperm incubated with the PSGs had a higher amount of alpha-T compared to the control (292.2 vs. 251.0 nmol/10(8) cells). The acrosome status was not affected by the occurrence of the organic peroxide in the medium and the amount of capacitated sperm was lower when the PSGs were also present. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the PSGs may represent a source of protection for rabbit sperm against in vitro oxidative stress by supplying the sperm with endogenous alpha-T. This mechanism could be in part involved in the inhibition of sperm capacitation by the granules.",M2
20171027,"Antioxidant systems of brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) <e>semen</e>.The present study characterizes the antioxidant systems of brown trout, Salmo trutta, semen as supplementation of semen dilution media with antioxidants can be beneficial to improve techniques for semen storage and cryopreservation. Antioxidants and oxidant defensive enzymes of spermatozoa and seminal plasma were analyzed. To determine whether antioxidants and oxidant defensive enzymes have an effect on sperm functionality, in vitro experiments were performed. Selected antioxidants and oxidant defensive enzymes were added to sperm motility-inhibiting saline solution and their effects on sperm viability (motility when activated, membrane integrity, and lipid peroxidation) were measured. In seminal plasma and spermatozoa the enzymes catalase, glutathione reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase and the metabolites ascorbic acid, glutathione, methionine, tocopherol, and uric acid were detected. Of the enzymes superoxide dismutase had the highest activity, of the metabolites uric acid occurred in highest concentrations. During in vitro incubation uric acid and catalase increased the sperm motility, sperm membrane integrity, and decreased the sperm lipid peroxidation in comparison to the control. However, catalase was effective only at an activity much higher than that occurring in seminal plasma. Reduced methionine increased the sperm motility and sperm membrane integrity and oxidized methionine the motility. However, neither reduced nor oxidized methionine decreased the sperm membrane lipid peroxidation. It is concluded, that uric acid is the main antioxidant of brown trout semen.",M2
20171026,"Cytokine expression in the gilt oviduct: effects of seminal plasma, spermatozoa and extender after insemination.Effects of <e>semen</e> components [fresh semen in extender, spermatozoa in extender (Spz), seminal plasma (SP)], or extender alone (Beltsville thawing solution, BTS) on the expression of selected cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1)] as well as the presence of cells positive for CD8 or CD25 were studied in the pig oviduct. In addition, cytokines in SP and oviductal flushings were analyzed. In experiment (Exp) I, groups of gilts were sampled at 5-6h after insemination with SP, Spz, fresh semen in BTS or only BTS (control). In Exp II, gilts were sampled 35-40 h after insemination with SP, Spz, BTS or only catheter insertion (control). Most oviductal flushing samples were positive (&gt; or =detectable limits) for IL-10 and TGF-beta1 but only few for IL-6. The IHC-labelling of IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta1 was evident, especially in the epithelial cells of the isthmus and infundibulum as well as in the cells of the regional (mesometrial) lymph node. Cilia of the epithelium were positive for IL-6 (strongest in the infundibulum) and TGF-beta1 (strongest in the isthmus) but negative for IL-10. There were no consistent differences in IHC-labelling of the cytokines in relation to different treatments, except at 35-40 h after insemination (Exp II), when IL-6 was slightly higher in epithelium of the SP group and IL-10 in the infundibular connective tissue was higher in the SP and Spz groups. In the isthmus and infundibulum, there were no differences between animals inseminated with BTS (control) and the semen components for any of the cytokine mRNAs at 5-6h after insemination (Exp I). However, later (35-40 h, Exp II), insemination with SP, Spz and BTS alone appeared to up-regulate TGF-beta1 mRNA expression compared with the control group (without any fluid infused). In all treatment groups, the mRNA level for TGF-beta1 was higher than for IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10. Higher mRNA levels of all cytokines were found in the isthmus compared with the infundibulum. Numbers of CD8-positive cells (both in epithelium and connective tissue) appeared higher in the infundibulum compared with the isthmus and were mostly higher shortly (Exp I) after treatment with SP, SPZ and BTS than later (Exp II) in both segments. CD25-positive cells were few and found solely in the sub-epithelial connective tissue. The results indicate that in the porcine oviduct, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta1 are endogenous produced and that TGF-beta1 may have a more important role for immunomodulation than the other cytokines, especially in isthmus. Differences between isthmus and infundibulum in cytokine mRNA expression and in presence of CD8-positive cells indicate different patterns of immune reactivity in the upper and lower parts of the oviduct.",M2
20170289,"The effects of severity of oligozoospermia on Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) cycle outcome.The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between the severity of oligozoospermia and the development of embryos and clinical outcome in patients undergoing ICSI. A total of 908 intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles involving women of &lt; or =37 years of age were included in this study. The patients were divided into four treatment groups according to the results of an analysis of their husbands' <e>semen</e>: (A) mild oligozoospermia that ranged from 10 x 10(6)/ml to &lt;20 x 10(6)/ml (n=283), (B) mild to severe oligozoospermia that ranged from 5 x 10(6)/ml to &lt;10 x 10(6)/ml (n=192), (C) severe oligospermia that ranged from 1 x10(6)/ml to &lt;5 x 10(6)/ml (n=259), and (D) very severe oligozoospermia that ranged from 0 to &lt;1 x10(6)/ml (n=174). Two pronuclei (PN) oocytes at MII were injected and the development of high quality embryos on day 2, as well blastocyst formation rate on day 5, the implantation rate, clinical pregnancies, and fetal loss, were examined. A lower percentage of two pronuclei (2PN) oocytes in the very severe oligozoospermia group was observed, however, there was no difference in clinical outcome when the oligozoospermic patients were divided by sperm concentration. In addition, no significant difference was detected in zygote production or clinical outcome between spermatozoa with a motility of &lt;40% and spermatozoa with a motility of &gt; or =40%. The results of this study emphasize the importance of selecting good quality sperm for oocyte injection, especially in cases involving very severe oligozoospermia.",M2
20170284,"DNA fragmentation dynamics in fresh versus frozen thawed plus gradient-isolated human spermatozoa.The aim of this study was to compare the rate of sperm DNA fragmentation (rSDF; increase of SDF over time) in fresh and gradient isolated frozen-thawed <e>semen</e> samples from male sperm donors of proven fertility. SDF was assessed in the two samples obtained from the same fifteen male donors after 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO(2) in air at 37 degrees C. Analysis was performed based on chromatin dispersion patterns evaluated using the Halosperm kit. No significant differences in SDF were obtained when fresh and gradient-isolated frozen-thawed spermatozoa were compared at baseline. However, the rSDF shown by the two samples differed and gradient-isolation selected for sperm subpopulations showing a lower variance for SDF. At the individual level, sperm selection by density gradient purification in frozen-thawed samples did not improve the levels of SDF when compared with the values obtained in fresh samples at baseline.",M2
20145944,"MicroRNA markers for forensic body fluid identification obtained from microarray screening and quantitative RT-PCR confirmation.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-protein coding molecules with important regulatory functions; many have tissue-specific expression patterns. Their very small size in principle makes them less prone to degradation processes, unlike messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which were previously proposed as molecular tools for forensic body fluid identification. To identify suitable miRNA markers for forensic body fluid identification, we first screened total RNA samples derived from saliva, <e>semen</e>, vaginal secretion, and venous and menstrual blood for the expression of 718 human miRNAs using a microarray platform. All body fluids could be easily distinguished from each other on the basis of complete array-based miRNA expression profiles. Results from quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; TaqMan) assays for microarray candidate markers confirmed strong over-expression in the targeting body fluid of several miRNAs for venous blood and several others for semen. However, no candidate markers from array experiments for other body fluids such as saliva, vaginal secretion, or menstrual blood could be confirmed by RT-PCR. Time-wise degradation of venous blood and semen stains for at least 1 year under lab conditions did not significantly affect the detection sensitivity of the identified miRNA markers. The detection limit of the TaqMan assays tested for selected venous blood and semen miRNA markers required only subpicogram amounts of total RNA per single RT-PCR test, which is considerably less than usually needed for reliable mRNA RT-PCR detection. We therefore propose the application of several stable miRNA markers for the forensic identification of blood stains and several others for semen stain identification, using commercially available TaqMan assays. Additional work remains necessary in search for suitable miRNA markers for other forensically relevant body fluids.",M2
20138202,"Vitamin E modulates reproductive toxicity of pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin in male rabbits.The objective of the current study was to analyze the reproductive toxicity caused by lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) in male rabbits, and to evaluate the possible protective effect of vitamin E (Vit. E) as antioxidant. Animals were orally administered their respective doses of LCT every other day and given drinking water supplemented with vitamin E for 16 weeks. Results showed that <e>semen</e> quality was deteriorated following treatment with LCT. Also, testosterone levels, body weight (BW), feed intake (FI), and relative testes (RTW) and epididymis (REW) weights were significantly decreased. Concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly increased in seminal plasma of rabbits treated with LCT compared with control. While, activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), transaminases and acid phosphatase (AcP) were significantly decreased. Vitamin E alone significantly increased testosterone levels, BW, FI, RTW, REW, semen characteristics and seminal plasma enzymes, and decreased the levels of TBARS. Also, the present study showed that vitamin E might be effective against LCT-induced reproductive toxicity. It was suggested that LCT exerted a significant adverse effect on reproductive performance of male rabbits. Furthermore, vitamin E antagonized the toxic effects of LCT and improved semen quality of male rabbit.",M2
20137070,"The association between leukocytes and sperm quality is concentration dependent.BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between leukocytes (polymorphonuclear granulocytes -PMNL) and <e>semen</e> parameters at different leukocyte concentrations. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical study at a university hospital andrology clinic. Semen samples from infertile men were analyzed for sperm morphology and motility according to seminal leukocytes (PMNL) concentration (category A: &gt;0 to &lt;0.25 x 10(6)/mL; category B: &gt;0.25 to &lt;0.5 x 10(6)/mL; category C: &gt;0.5 to &lt;0.75 x 10(6)/mL; category D: &gt;0.75 to &lt;1.0 x 10(6)/mL, category E: &gt;1 x 10(6)/mL). RESULTS: The percentage of sperm with normal morphology increased significantly from category A (14%) to category D (19%) but decreased in category E to levels (14%) similar to those in category A. Motility grades a and a+b (combined) also increased from category A (12%, 20%) to category D (18.0%, 28.5%) and decreased in category E (11%, 20.5%) to levels similar to those in category A. Sperm deformities and motility grades c and d increased progressively in all categories. SUMMARY: Leukocytes had a positive association with normal morphology and progressive motility in semen samples at a concentration of 0-1 x 10(6)/mL. The findings suggest that the association between leukocytes (PMNL) and semen quality might be concentration dependent.",M2
20133267,"Monotherapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir as maintenance after HIV-1 viral suppression: results of a 96-week randomized, controlled, open-label, pilot trial (KalMo study).BACKGROUND: Long-term adverse events and expenses associated with HAART have led to an interest in simplified therapy. Lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy is attractive due to its potency and high genetic barrier. METHODS: This is a 96-week, open-label, randomized study to assess the feasibility of using LPV/r monotherapy in patients with undetectable viral load after being on successful HAART for at least 6 months. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to either switch from HAART to LPV/r monotherapy or to maintain their previous regimen. RESULTS: 60 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. At Week 96, by intention-to-treat analysis, 24/30 (80.0%) subjects in monotherapy group and 26/30(86.6%) in the control group had a plasma viral load of &lt;80 copies/mL. There was one virologic failure (defined as VL not greater-than 500 copies/mL) in each arm. Genotyping testing identified no resistance-associated mutations. The patient on the monotherapy arm was successfully resuppressed to &lt;80 copies/mL after intensification with tenofovir and lamivudine. No statistically significant differences were found with regard to changes in CD4 counts. One subject in the monotherapy group discontinued due to diarrhea. Five subjects in the control group underwent regimen changes due to drug-related toxicities. Viral load from <e>semen</e> samples collected at the end of follow-up was undetectable on 14/15 patients randomized to monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from various HAART regimens to LPV/r monotherapy in patients who were virologically suppressed and without a history of previous virologic failure was effective, safe, and well tolerated through 96 weeks.",M2
20129470,"Post-coital vaginal sampling with nylon flocked swabs improves DNA typing.In the examination of sexual assault cases, DNA typing of vaginal samples mostly occurs after differential DNA extraction. Notwithstanding the differential extraction method, the DNA profiles from the seminal fraction often show the male alleles at low-level in combination with female alleles. This unfavorable ratio male to female DNA is due to a limited amount of sperm cells and an overwhelming quantity of female cells. In this study, we compared standard cotton and nylon flocked swabs for post-coital vaginal sampling. Twelve couples donated 88 vaginal swabs - 44 cotton, 44 nylon flocked - which were taken with a time since intercourse (TSI) up to 84 h. These vaginal swabs were sorted into categories on the basis of the TSI and submitted to (1) microscopic examination for the presence of male cells, (2) presumptive tests for the detection of seminal fluid and (3) DNA typing. Cellular elution was found to be 6-fold more efficient from the nylon flocked swabs. This makes microscopic analysis less time consuming as the higher cell yield and better cell morphology simplify detection of male cells. Both swab types reveal similar results regarding presumptive tests and male DNA typing. Positive presumptive tests (RSID-<e>semen</e> and PSA) were obtained up to 60 h TSI and male autosomal profiles up to 72 h TSI. Interestingly, over 50% of the samples negative for both presumptive tests resulted in informative male STR profiles. After differential extraction, less DNA was left on the nylon flocked swabs and more male DNA was isolated. Our results imply that the use of nylon flocked swabs for vaginal sampling will improve microscopic analysis and DNA typing in the medical forensic investigation of sexual assault cases.",M2
20111090,"Improving precision in the assessment of round cell numbers in human <e>semen</e>.The aim of this study was to increase the precision of assessment of the number of round cells observed in the peroxidase test for detection of seminal leukocytes (granulocytes). The dilution of semen was reduced and the volume of suspension examined was increased for semen samples containing between 0.6 and 6 million round cells per mL. A 1 + 5 (1:6) dilution was compatible with measurable peroxidase activity and a sufficiently clear background for cell assessment. At this dilution, and with assessment of all 18 grids on both sides of the Neubauer-improved counting chamber, only three of the 10 samples (nominal cell concentrations of 1.9 x 10(6) -3.3 x 10(6) mL(-1)) presented 400 round cells or more. As lower seminal dilutions were incompatible with easy detection of round cells or their peroxidase reaction product, it was not possible to provide precise measurements (sampling error 5%) of the suggested lower reference limit of 1 x 10(6) cells per mL. The results indicate that this poor precision of measuring 1 x 10(6) round cells per mL could explain the discrepant reports on the acceptability of the cut-off values for leukocytospermia. Such reference limits need to be established with statistically sound methods.",M2

20100323,"Compilation of a panel of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms for bovine identification in the Northern Irish cattle population.BACKGROUND: Animal identification is pivotal in governmental agricultural policy, enabling the management of subsidy payments, movement of livestock, test scheduling and control of disease. Advances in bovine genomics have made it possible to utilise inherent genetic variability to uniquely identify individual animals by DNA profiling, much as has been achieved with humans over the past 20 years. A DNA profiling test based on bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers would offer considerable advantages over current short tandem repeat (STR) based industry standard tests, in that it would be easier to analyse and interpret. In this study, a panel of 51 genome-wide SNPs were genotyped across panels of <e>semen</e> DNA from 6 common breeds for the purposes of ascertaining allelic frequency. For SNPs on the same chromosome, the extent of linkage disequilbrium was determined from genotype data by Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Minimum probabilities of unique identification were determined for each breed panel. The usefulness of this SNP panel was ascertained by comparison to the current bovine STR Stockmarks II assay. A statistically representative random sampling of bovine animals from across Northern Ireland was assembled for the purposes of determining the population allele frequency for these STR loci and subsequently, the minimal probability of unique identification they conferred in sampled bovine animals from Northern Ireland. RESULTS: 6 SNPs exhibiting a minor allele frequency of less than 0.2 in more than 3 of the breed panels were excluded. 2 Further SNPs were found to reside in coding areas of the cattle genome and were excluded from the final panel. The remaining 43 SNPs exhibited genotype frequencies which were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. SNPs on the same chromosome were observed to have no significant linkage disequilibrium/allelic association. Minimal probabilities of uniquely identifying individual animals from each of the breeds were obtained and were observed to be superior to those conferred by the industry standard STR assay. CONCLUSIONS: The 43 SNPs characterised herein may constitute a starting point for the development of a SNP based DNA identification test for European cattle.",M2
20097168,"Possible use of RNA isolate from inactivated vaccine for external positive control in reverse transcription-based detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus in bull <e>semen</e>.This study has demonstrated the novel use of inactivated and purified vaccine against FMD virus for detection and analysis. RNA isolate was efficiently generated from the vaccine for an external positive control for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays. The target DNA fragment sequences from the 2B region and 3D RNA polymerase gene of the virus for RT-PCR and RT-LAMP respectively were successfully amplified using the RNA template. Laboratories lacking complex equipment may not be feasible to handle high-risk viruses for conventional methods such as the isolation and culture of live viruses. Here, with the use of these molecular tools, novel use of RNA isolate from inactivated, purified vaccine proved to be an effective external positive control for the assays. Therefore, with these methods, the derived RNA control template aids in a safe method for screening FMD virus for diagnostic laboratories. And by using the same technique, it is then possible to generate a standard for diagnosing any other infectious viral diseases.",M2
20092881,"The influence of washing Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) sperm on the effects of cryopreservation in dependency of the photoperiod.Extenders containing low concentrations of egg yolk are recommended for cryopreserving ibex spermatozoa. However, the phylogenetic relationship of the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) with domestic goats suggests that phospholipases in the seminal plasma may have a negative effect on the response to freezing-thawing when egg yolk-based diluents are employed. The aim of the current work was to determine how seminal plasma removal from Spanish ibex <e>semen</e>, collected by electroejaculation over a period of 1 yr, affects its response to freezing-thawing. Semen was collected from six adult ibexes maintained in captivity. The negative effects of freezing-thawing on the quality of sperm motility and on the integrity of the acrosome and plasma membrane were more serious in the nonwashed semen samples than in those from which the seminal plasma had been removed (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05, and P&lt;0.05 respectively). The beneficial effect of removing the seminal plasma was particularly noticeable during the time of decreasing photoperiod. This suggests that ibex semen shows increased phospholipase activity during the rutting season.",M2
20090219,"Alcohol intake and cigarette smoking: impact of two major lifestyle factors on male fertility.CONTEXT: Lifestyle factors, like alcohol intake and cigarette smoking, have been reported to affect male fertility. AIMS: To find out the specific impact of alcohol and smoking on <e>semen</e> quality of male partners of couples seeking treatment for primary infertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the semen samples analyzed in our andrology laboratory, results of 100 alcoholics and 100 cigarette smoker males were studied following WHO guidelines and compared with 100 strict nonalcoholic and nonsmoker males for presence of asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data was analyzed by F- test using Microsoft Office Excel 2003. RESULTS: Only 12% alcoholics and six per cent smokers showed normozoospermia compared to 37 % nonalcoholic nonsmoker males. Teratozoospermia, followed by oligozoospermia dominated alcoholics. Overall impact of asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia, but not of oligozoospermia, was observed in smokers. Light smokers predominantly showed asthenozoospermia. Heavy alcoholics and smokers showed asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia as well as oligozoospermia. CONCLUSIONS: Asthenozoospermia, the most common semen variable in our study, can be an early indicator of reduction in quality of semen. Alcohol abuse apparently targets sperm morphology and sperm production. Smoke-induced toxins primarily hamper sperm motility and seminal fluid quality. Progressive deterioration in semen quality is related to increasing quantity of alcohol intake and cigarettes smoked.",M2
20089374,"Seasonal variation in the protective effect of seminal plasma on frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa.The response of ram spermatozoa to seminal plasma is highly variable, in part due to the presence of both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. The aim of this study was to assess variation in the protection of ram spermatozoa during freezing by seminal plasma. The seminal plasma variables studied were season of collection, fractionation and method of supplementation. Spermatozoa were supplemented before freezing with 4 mg of seminal plasma proteins (SPPs) per 10(8) cells, and their motility and viability were assessed during post-thaw incubation (37 degrees C). In Experiment 1, <e>semen</e> was (a) frozen with no supplementation (Control) (b) extended with a Tris-based diluent (C + TRIS), or (c) supplemented with seminal plasma collected throughout the year (in the Southern Hemisphere) and pooled for January-March, April-June, July-August and October-December, and either fractionated to produce a concentrated &gt;10 kDa seminal plasma protein retentate (&gt;10 kDa SPP), or kept as crude seminal plasma (CP). There was no effect of season or seminal plasma type (CP or &gt;10 kDa SPP) on motility of spermatozoa. CP and &gt;10 kDa SPP improved the viability of spermatozoa when collected from January-September compared to Control. Supplementation with &gt;10 kDa SPP increased viability of spermatozoa, compared to CP, when collected from January to July. In Experiment 2, &gt;10 kDa SPP were either added directly to the spermatozoa or included in the cryodiluent or &gt;10 kDa SPP were not supplemented (Control). Both supplementation methods improved the motility and the proportion of viable, acrosome-intact spermatozoa but direct supplementation resulted in more viable, acrosome-intact spermatozoa compared with supplementation of the cryodiluent. These results show that supplementation of ram spermatozoa with CP, or its protein component (&gt;10 kDa SPP), before freezing protects them from freeze-thaw damage. The protective effect is greatest when seminal plasma is collected during the breeding season, fractionated with &gt;10 kDa filters and added directly to the spermatozoa.",M2
20085639,"Decreasing sperm quality: a global problem?BACKGROUND: Carlsen and coworkers (1992) reviewed 61 heterogeneous observational studies on <e>semen</e> quality published between 1938 and 1990. This review indicates that mean sperm density decreased significantly between 1940 and 1990. An extended meta-analysis with 101 studies confirmed a decline in sperm density for the period from 1934 to 1996 (2000). The key message of the meta-analyses is that sperm counts have decreased globally by about 50% over the past decades. This assessment has been questioned. DISCUSSION: A major methodological problem of the meta-analysis is the use of data collected in different countries, at different times, on different populations and with different methods of semen analysis. Furthermore, the results of studies concerning semen analysis are frequently biased e.g. by selection criteria of volunteers. In most studies on human semen characteristics the populations under study are insufficiently defined and the study participants are not a representative population sample. The incidence of testicular cancer has increased in Caucasian men worldwide. The investigation of common risk factors for male reproductive disorders requires well designed epidemiological studies and the collection of individual data. SUMMARY: Former meta-analyses of sperm count data show a global downward trend. This conclusion should be interpreted with caution. The included studies are of great heterogeneity due to geographical and/or ethnical variation, different study designs and different methodological standards. Population-based prospective studies are needed to investigate secular trends in male reproductive disorders.",M2
20081087,"Effects of trehalose supplementation on <e>semen</e> quality and oxidative stress variables in frozen-thawed bovine semen.The antioxidant systems of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) are important in maintaining sperm motility and viability. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of varying doses of trehalose on in vitro semen quality variables and antioxidant activities of frozen-thawed bovine semen. The semen samples, diluted with an extender containing trehalose (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mM), were evaluated. The extender supplemented with 100 mM trehalose exhibited the greatest percentages of sperm motility, acrosomal membrane integrity, and plasma membrane integrity in comparison with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). No difference was observed for sperm motility between trehalose 50 and 100 mM groups (P &gt; 0.05). Extender supplemented with trehalose did not affect SOD levels. Compared with the other groups, CAT was greater with the supplementation of trehalose at 100 and 200 mM (P &lt; 0.05). The extender supplemented with trehalose had enhanced GSH-Px activity compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). However, increasing the doses of trehalose (100, 200 mM) decreased GSH-Px activity, compared with 50 mM trehalose (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the other groups, trehalose at the concentration of 25 and 50 mM increased GSH activity (P &lt; 0.05). The application of 200 mM trehalose produced the least amount of GSH activity among all of the groups (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, extender supplemented with trehalose reduced the oxidative stress induced by freeze-thaw and improved measures of bovine semen quality. The antioxidant characteristics of trehalose may be related to its effectiveness in membrane cryopreservation. Further studies are required to obtain more concrete results on the determination of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacities of trehalose in cryopreserved bovine semen.",M2
20077395,"[Bacteriospermia and the production of reactive oxygen species in the <e>semen</e> of males from infertile couples]OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of bacteriospermia, the representation of specific micro-organisms and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the semen of males from infertile couples in comparison with the semen of fertile volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Males from infertile couples were divided according to WHO criteria of their spermiogram results into those with normospermia (Group A, n = 65) and those with semen abnormalities (Group B, n = 116). The control group consisted of 44 fertile volunteers (Group C, n = 44). Aerobic culture was performed to ascertain the genus and species of the present microorganisms. ROS production was estimated by the chemiluminescence method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The incidence of positive cultures in the semen between Groups A, B and C (69 %, 74 % and 66 %, respectively) did not differ significantly, with Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species being most frequently identified. A significant difference was found only between the occurrence of microorganism Escherichia coli in the groups A, B and C (11.1 %, 9.3 % and 3.2 %). There were no statistically significant differences between ROS production in semen with positive or negative culture in any of the studied groups. CONCLUSIONS: In all the studied groups, the incidence of bacteriospermia as well as ROS production in the semen were similar. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species were found in all groups. A significantly higher frequency of Escherichia coli in the semen samples of males from infertile couples in comparison with those from fertile volunteers was observed. No differences in ROS production in semen samples with positive and negative culture results were found in any of the studied groups.",M2
20077219,"An exposure assessment of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) in human <e>semen</e>.Levels of the phthalates such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, a major metabolite of DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP, a major metabolite of DBP), and phthalic acid (P, (a common metabolite of phthalates, including DEHP and DBP) were determined in the semen samples of 99 healthy volunteers without known prior medicosurgical history. Samples were obtained from young men (age 20-25 yr) who visited a clinic, and the semen concentrations of phthalates were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). UPLC/MS/MS showed that mean concentrations in semen samples were 1.07 microg/ml for MEHP, 0.61 microg/ml for DEHP, 0.39 microg/ml for PA, 0.06 microg/ml for MBP, and 0.003 microg/ml for DBP. The concentration of MEHP (the metabolite of DEHP) was highest, and the concentrations of the metabolites including MEHP, MBP, and PA were higher than actual concentrations of parent DEHP and DBP. These findings suggest the detection of phthalates in healthy human semen might require further investigation for effects on human fertility.",M2
20070900,"Investigation of Chlamydiaceae in <e>semen</e> and cauda epididymidis and seroprevalence of Chlamydophila abortus in breeding bulls.BACKGROUND: Reproductive disorders associated with chlamydial infection have been reported worldwide in cattle and there are indications of potential venereal transmission. METHODS: Semen samples from 21 dairy bulls and cauda epididymidis tissue samples from 43 beef bulls were analysed for chlamydial agent by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) including an internal amplification control (mimic). Additionally, presence of antibodies against Chlamydophila (Cp.) abortus among the bulls was investigated with the commercial Pourquier ELISA Cp. abortus serum verification kit. RESULTS: No chlamydial agent was detected by PCR in either the semen samples or in the tissue samples. Additionally, no antibodies against Cp. abortus were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Cp. abortus is very rare, or absent in Swedish bulls and thus the risk for venereal transmission of chlamydial infection through their semen is low. However, because Chlamydophila spp. infection rates seem to differ throughout the world, it is essential to clarify the relative importance of transmission of the infection through semen on cattle fertility.",M2
20059941,"Effect of synchronization and <e>semen</e> sorting on artificial insemination bull fertility.Field data were collected over a period of 2 yr by artificial insemination technicians for the purpose of evaluating differences among bulls in their fertility when synchronization and semen sorting were involved. First, main effects of synchronization and semen sorting were found to reduce bull fertility by 1.5 and 12.7%, respectively. Second, the interaction of both factors with bull fertility significantly enhanced the evaluation models. Differences between 2 sets of adjusted conception rates for synchronized and nonsynchronized services ranged from 0.5 to 2.9%, whereas differences between 2 sets of adjusted conception rates for sorted and conventional semen ranged from -1.8 to 15.2%. This implies that using conventional fertility models that ignore these effects may not be sufficiently accurate in situations where synchronization or semen sorting are involved. Accounting for synchronization and especially for semen sorting to evaluate bulls on their fertility and the production of separate sets of conception rates under each situation are essential.",M2
20053623,"Environmental factors and <e>semen</e> quality.OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of reports suggest that chemical and physical agents in the environment, introduced and spread by human activity, may affect male fertility in humans. This article aims at evaluating the impact of environmental exposures (pesticides, phthalates, PCBs, air pollution, trihalomethanes (THMs), mobile phones) on semen quality, by reviewing most recent published literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological studies focusing on exposure to environmental factors and semen quality for the last ten years were identified by a search of the Pubmed, Medline, Ebsco, Agricola and Toxnet literature bases. RESULTS: The results from the presented studies suggest that there are strong and rather consistent indications that some pesticides besides DBCP (e.g. DDT/Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], ethylenedibromide, organophosphates) affects sperm count. PCBs are detrimental to sperm motility. In case of air pollution, studies suggest a link between ambient air pollutants and various semen characteristics. Additional research is needed to corroborate this association and to establish the causal agents. Results of few studies on subfertile men demonstrate associations between phthalate levels commonly experienced by the public and impaired sperm quality (impact on sperm concentration, morphology, motility), but the findings have not been corroborated in studies of men from the general population. Mobile phones might adversely affect the quality of semen by decreasing mostly motility but also the sperm counts, viability and morphology. In spite of their consistent results, most of the studies are rather small. Association between exposure to THMs and poor semen quality was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological studies suggest awareness of environmental factors which may affect semen quality. In case both of well proven and disputable reproductive and developmental hazards, it is necessary to prevent parental exposure to the agents associated with those hazards.",M2
20053429,"Embryo production in superovulated Angus cows inseminated four times with sexed-sorted or conventional, frozen-thawed <e>semen</e>.This study tested the hypothesis that four inseminations of commercially frozen sexed semen (&gt;or=2.1x10(6) sperm per 0.25-mL straw) in superstimulated embryo donors would yield a percentage and quantity of transferable embryos similar to that achieved with conventional frozen semen. Bos taurus, angus cows (n=32), stratified by age and body condition, were randomly allocated to receive four inseminations of frozen-thawed semen, either conventional semen (&gt;or=15x10(6) sperm/straw; Conventional) or sexed semen (&gt;or=2.1x10(6) sperm/straw; Sexed) from one of two AI sires. From 10 to 13 d after estrus, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was given twice-daily, with prostaglandin F(2alpha) given twice on the last day. Cows were inseminated once (1x) at first detected estrus and twice (2x) and once (1x) at 12 and 24h later, respectively, with nonsurgical embryo recovery 7 d after first detected estrus. The study was repeated 30 d later (switch-back experimental design). The total number of ova per flush was similar between Conventional and Sexed treatments (10.9+/-1.8 vs. 10.5+/-1.6), but the number of Grade 1 embryos was greater (P&lt;0.01) for Conventional (4.3+/-0.8 vs. 2.3+/-0.7). Conversely, the mean number of unfertilized ova was greater (P&lt;0.05) for Sexed (5.6+/-1.0 vs. 3.0+/-1.2). There was no significant difference between treatments for numbers of degenerate, Grades 2 or 3, and transferable embryos and no significant differences between bulls in percentage of transferable embryos (44.4% and 46.7%). However, fertilization rates and percentage of transferable embryos were affected (P&lt;0.05) by period and donor. In conclusion, superstimulated donor cows inseminated four times had fewer Grade 1 embryos and more unfertilized ova with sexed versus conventional semen.",M2
20047755,"Seasonal variations in seminal plasma and sperm characteristics of wild-caught and cultivated Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua.The objective was to investigate changes, throughout the spawning season, in body size attributes and quantitative <e>semen</e> characteristics of wild-caught and cultivated Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. Sperm velocity increased significantly throughout the spawning season of cod from both origins. Curvilinear velocity (VCL; 30 sec post-activation) increased from 78.9+/-6.5 to 128.2+/-6.5 microm/sec (mean+/-SEM) between the beginning and end of the spawning season, respectively, for wild-caught cod, whereas for cultivated fish, it increased from 26.6+/-2.4 to 48.9+/-3.1 microm/sec between January and March. Spermatocrit did not undergo a significant seasonal change in wild-caught cod but did thicken for cultivated cod (24.6+/-4.2% in January to 40.5+/-4.4% in April; P&lt;0.01). Sperm head area, perimeter, length, and width declined significantly at the end of the spawning season of cod from both origins (all P values&lt;0.01). Seminal plasma osmolality and Na(+) ion concentration followed a dome-shaped function through the spawning season for both wild-caught and cultivated cod (P&lt;0.05). For cultivated cod, seminal plasma pH was significantly lower at the start of the spawning season (P&lt;0.001), whereas Ca(2+) increased then decreased (P&lt;0.05). Body size attributes, spermatocrit, and seminal plasma constituents had significant relationships with sperm activity variables. These relationships varied as a function of time post-activation, month, and fish origin. Our findings may be used to (i) assess spermiation stage without killing males; (ii) optimize semen collection for hatchery production; (iii) characterize the potential impact of farming on sperm quality; and (iv) improve success of sperm cryopreservation and short-term storage.",M2
20036893,"New advances in clinical biomarkers in testis cancer.Diagnostic work-up when a testicular cancer is suspected includes a clinical examination, determination of risk factors, imaging and serum tumours markers. Tumour markers are useful in the diagnosis and staging of disease, for monitor the therapeutic response and to detect tumour recurrence. The alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) are well established as serum markers for GCTs of the testis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) may be alternative serological markers with less specifity. However, these markers are increased in only about 60 per cent of patients with testicular cancer. Therefore, additional tumour markers would facilitate clinical diagnosis and treatment in these patients. In this review we have evaluated the clinical application of several markers of testis cancers in serum, <e>semen</e> and tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry detection of some of these being solid new markers in addition to the routinely used but none have been shown to be superior to the classical markers in serum and semen samples.

20027206,"Transglutaminase-mediated <e>semen</e> coagulation controls sperm storage in the malaria mosquito.Insect seminal fluid proteins are powerful modulators of many aspects of female physiology and behaviour including longevity, egg production, sperm storage, and remating. The crucial role of these proteins in reproduction makes them promising targets for developing tools aimed at reducing the population sizes of vectors of disease. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, seminal secretions produced by the male accessory glands (MAGs) are transferred to females in the form of a coagulated mass called the mating plug. The potential of seminal fluid proteins as tools for mosquito control demands that we improve our limited understanding of the composition and function of the plug. Here, we show that the plug is a key determinant of An. gambiae reproductive success. We uncover the composition of the plug and demonstrate it is formed through the cross-linking of seminal proteins mediated by a MAG-specific transglutaminase (TGase), a mechanism remarkably similar to mammalian semen coagulation. Interfering with TGase expression in males inhibits plug formation and transfer, and prevents females from storing sperm with obvious consequences for fertility. Moreover, we show that the MAG-specific TGase is restricted to the anopheline lineage, where it functions to promote sperm storage rather than as a mechanical barrier to re-insemination. Taken together, these data represent a major advance in our understanding of the factors shaping Anopheles reproductive biology.",M2
20023142,"Assessment of buffalo <e>semen</e> with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay.The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which measures the reduction of MTT, is commonly used to validate the viability of metabolically active cells. This study was conducted to evaluate and validate the MTT assay to assess the spermatozoal viability of Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls and compare the efficiency of the test with the supravital staining technique (eosin and nigrosin) and the hypoosmotic swelling test. Fresh semen samples from breeding Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls (n = 25) were collected using an artificial vagina. After assessing the quality of the semen for routine variables, the MTT assay was carried out in PBS. Results revealed a correlation (r = 0.979; P &lt; 0.001) between the viability of spermatozoa and the rate of reduction of MTT. The other proportions of same semen samples showed a poor relationship between the eosin and nigrosin test (r = -0.25), the hypoosmotic swelling test (r = -0.12), and motility (r = -0.15). However, the MTT assay was found to be superior compared with other tests because it was able to determine those spermatozoa that were more than 90% viable. In conclusion, the MTT assay is a simple, robust test that can be used to select Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls on the basis of spermatozoa quality.",M2
20022362,"Oxytocin, vasopressin, prostaglandin F(2alpha), luteinizing hormone, testosterone, estrone sulfate, and cortisol plasma concentrations after sexual stimulation in stallions.This experiment was designed to determine the effects of sexual stimulation on plasma concentrations of oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (VP), 15-ketodihydro-PGF(2alpha) (PG-metabolite), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), estrone sulfate (ES), and cortisol (C) in stallions. <e>Semen</e> samples were collected from 14 light horse stallions (Equus caballus) of proven fertility using a Missouri model artificial vagina. Blood samples were collected at 15, 12, 9, 6, and 3 min before estrous mare exposure, at erection, at ejaculation, and at 3, 6, and 9 min after ejaculation. Afterwards, blood sampling was performed every 10 min for the following 60 min. Sexual activity determined an increase in plasma concentrations of OT, VP, C, PG-metabolite, and ES and caused no changes in LH and T concentrations. The finding of a negative correlation between C and VP at erection, and between C and T before erection and at the time of erection, could be explained by a possible inhibitory role exerted by C in the mechanism of sexual arousal described for men.",M2
20015377,"Assessment of sperm quality traits in relation to fertility in boar <e>semen</e>.BACKGROUND: Several studies have been published where sperm plasma membrane integrity correlated to fertility. In this study we describe a simple fluorometer-based assay where we monitored the fluorescence intensity of artificially membrane-ruptured spermatozoa with a fixed time staining with fluorescent DNA dyes. METHODS: Membrane-impermeant fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33258 (H258) and propidium iodide (PI) were used to measure the fluorescence of the nucleus in artificially membrane ruptured spermatozoa and membrane-permeant dye Hoechst 33342 (H342) was used to measure fluorescence of intact spermatozoa. The concentration of spermatozoa in insemination doses varied from 31.2x10(6)/ml to 50x10(6)/ml and the average value was 35x10(6)/ml. Each boar was represented by three consecutive ejaculates, collected at weekly intervals. Nonreturn rate within 60 days of first insemination (NR%) and litter size (total number of piglets born) of multiparous farrowings were used as fertility measures. RESULTS: Sperm fluorescence intensity of H258 and H342, but not the fluorescence intensity of PI-stained spermatozoa correlated significantly with the litter size of multiparous farrowings, values being r=-0.68 (P&lt;0.01) for H258, r=-0.69 (P&lt;0.01) for H342 and r=-0.38, (P=0.11) for PI. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in fluorescence values of membrane-ruptured H258 and unruptured H342-stained spermatozoa in boar AI doses can be associated with smaller litter size after AI. This finding indicates that the fluorescence properties of the sperm nucleus could be used to select for AI doses with greater fertilizing potential.",M2
20010846,"Comparative study of the effects of three <e>semen</e> preparation media on semen analysis, DNA damage and protamine deficiency, and the correlation between DNA integrity and sperm parameters.Semen samples collected from 28 male partners of infertile couples were divided into three equal aliquots and prepared with three selected media, such as PureSperm (Nidacon, Gothenburg, Sweden), Sil-Select Plus (Fertipro, Beernem, Belgium) and SpermGrad (Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden). The differences in mean percentages of semen parameters were assessed by repeated measures analysis. Correlations of sperm DNA damage, as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and of protamine deficiency, as measured by chromomycin A3 (CMA3) staining with sperm parameters, were determined by Pearson's correlation. After preparation with all three media, sperm concentrations decreased (P &lt; 0.05) while percentages of sperm with normal morphology increased (P &lt; 0.05). Percentages of sperm motility, rapid motility and progressive motile concentration (PMC) increased (P &lt; 0.05) for each of these parameters, PureSperm preparation gave the best results (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of DNA damage decreased in the PureSperm and Sil-Select Plus preparations (17.9% and 31.3%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) and increased in the SpermGrad preparation (56.3%, P &lt; 0.05). Protamine deficiency also decreased in all three kinds of media, 59.3%, 47.7% and 40.3% for PureSperm, Sil-Select Plus and SpermGrad preparations, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of DNA-damaged sperm was negatively correlated with the percentages of sperm motility, rapid motility and PMC, but was positively correlated with static motility (P &lt; 0.05). This comparative study and correlation analysis revealed that PureSperm preparation yielded sperm with the best motility and the lowest percentage of protamine deficiency. The Sil-Select Plus preparation yielded sperm with the lowest amount of DNA damage. The SpermGrad preparation had a high percentage of sperm with normal morphology, but also had the highest percentage of sperm with DNA damage. Sperm DNA damage was correlated with percentages of sperm motility, rapid motility, static motility and PMC.",M2
20005562,"<e>Semen</e> characteristics of genetically identical male cats cloned via somatic cell nucleus transfer.We investigated the sperm characteristics of four cloned male cats (Felis catus) to assess their reproductive potential. Fresh and frozen-thawed sperm were assessed for motility, viability, and morphology, and their functional competence was evaluated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) of domestic cat oocytes. All fresh semen characteristics varied among cats and collection times. Sperm concentration (x 10(6)/mL) of Cat A (512+/-140, range 368 to 685) was significantly higher, whereas that of Cat C (335+/-92, range 274 to 469) was significantly lower than that of Cloned B (459+/-159, range 336 to 510) and control cats (680+/-452, range 360 to 479). After thawing, motility and progressive motility of sperm from Cat B were significantly lower than that of the other cloned and control cats. The curvilinear, straight line, and average path velocities of sperm from Cat B were significantly higher, whereas the straightness was lower, than that of the other cloned and control cats. Frozen sperm from Cats A, B, and C successfully fertilized oocytes (cleavage=74.4%, 71.4%, and 86.2%, respectively) and produced embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage after IVF/In vitro culture (IVC) (34.4%, 26.7%, and 48.0%) at frequencies similar to the cleavage rate (82.0%) and blastocyst rate (43.9%) obtained with sperm from the control male.

19995078,"NMR structure in a membrane environment reveals putative amyloidogenic regions of the SEVI precursor peptide PAP(248-286).<e>Semen</e> is the main vector for HIV transmission worldwide. Recently, a peptide fragment (PAP(248-286)) has been isolated from seminal fluid that dramatically enhances HIV infectivity by up to 4-5 orders of magnitude. PAP(248-286) appears to enhance HIV infection by forming amyloid fibers known as SEVI, which are believed to enhance the attachment of the virus by bridging interactions between virion and host-cell membranes. We have solved the atomic-level resolution structure of the SEVI precursor PAP(248-286) using NMR spectroscopy in SDS micelles, which serve as a model membrane system. PAP(248-286), which does not disrupt membranes like most amyloid proteins, binds superficially to the surface of the micelle, in contrast to other membrane-disruptive amyloid peptides that generally penetrate into the core of the membrane. The structure of PAP(248-286) is unlike most amyloid peptides in that PAP(248-286) is mostly disordered when bound to the surface of the micelle, as opposed to the alpha-helical structures typically found of most amyloid proteins. The highly disordered nature of the SEVI peptide may explain the unique ability of SEVI amyloid fibers to enhance HIV infection as partially disordered amyloid fibers will have a greater capture radius for the virus than compact amyloid fibers. Two regions of nascent structure (an alpha-helix from V262-H270 and a dynamic alpha/3(10) helix from S279-L283) match the prediction of highly amyloidogenic sequences and may serve as nuclei for aggregation and amyloid fibril formation. The structure presented here can be used for the rational design of mutagenesis studies on SEVI amyloid formation and viral infection enhancement.",M2

A panel reviewing NTP reproductive toxicants identified boric acid as high priority for occupational studies to determine safe versus adverse reproductive effects. To address this, we collected boron exposure/dose measures in workplace inhalable dust, dietary food/fluids, blood, semen, and urine from boron workers and two comparison worker groups (n=192) over three months and determined correlations between boron and semen parameters (total sperm count, sperm concentration, motility, morphology, DNA breakage, apoptosis and aneuploidy). Blood boron averaged 499.2 ppb for boron workers, 96.1 and 47.9 ppb for workers from high and low environmental boron areas (p&lt;0.0001). Boron concentrated in seminal fluid. No significant correlations were found between blood or urine boron and adverse semen parameters.

This experiment was to investigate the effects of increasing dietary vitamin E on physical and biochemical characteristics of semen in Indian reared Kadaknath (KN) cockerels. DL-alpha-Tocopherol acetate was used as the source of vitamin E. 2. A total of 135 one-day-old male KN chicks were randomly selected and divided into 9 groups with 15 chicks in each group (3 dietary treatments x 3 replicates). 3. The basal diet contained 15 IU (10 mg) vitamin E/kg and the two experimental diets were supplemented with 150 IU (100 mg) and 300 IU (200 mg) vitamin E/kg (diets T(2) and T(3), respectively). 4. Physical characteristics in terms of semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and percentage live sperm did not differ significantly, whereas proportion of abnormal and dead spermatozoa were significantly lower and fertility higher in the T(2) group. 5. Biochemical characteristics in term of quantities of protein and nitric oxide (NO) did not differ significantly, whereas the quantity of glucose, acid phosphatase (ACP) and vitamin E were significantly higher in the T(2) group. 6. In contrast, the quantities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were significantly lower in T(2) group and higher in the T(1) (control) group. 7.

19945234,"Thawing boar <e>semen</e> in the presence of seminal plasma: Effects on sperm quality and fertility.Causes of poor fertility after insemination of frozen-thawed (FT) sperm include reduced sperm viability at thawing and a shorter longevity of surviving sperm in the female genital tract due to sub-lethal damage. The present studies examined the effect of incubating thawed boar sperm in seminal plasma (SP) on sperm membrane integrity (viability), and motility in vitro (experiment 1), and fertility in vivo (experiment 2). For experiment 1, FT sperm from five individual boars and a sperm pool from these boars were thawed and incubated for 4 h in media containing 0%, 10%, or 50% autologous seminal plasma (individual boars) or pooled seminal plasma (sperm pool). At approximately 10 min (0 h) and again at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, sperm populations were examined for percentage sperm viability and percent sperm motility. Each variable progressively decreased during the incubation period. Incubation in 50% SP increased percentages of live sperm (P &lt; 0.0001) and percent sperm motility (P &lt; 0.01) at all time points compared to incubation in either 0% or 10% SP. For experiment 2, multiparous Large white x Landrace sows (n = 82) each received 900 IU eCG at weaning and 750 IU hCG 80 h later to control time of ovulation. Sows were assigned on the basis of parity to be inseminated with pooled semen with or without SP from the boars used in experiment 1. Sows received 3 x 10(9) live fresh-extended sperm (n = 30) or FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS extender (n = 26) or 3 x 10(9) live FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS containing 50% SP (FT-SP; n = 26). Sows were inseminated at 36 h, and 42 h after hCG injection. Compared to sows receiving fresh semen, the pregnancy rate of FT inseminated sows tended (P = 0.06) to be lower with the FT-SP group being intermediate. Farrowing rates were not different (83.3%, 69.2%, and 65.4% for fresh, FT, and FT-SP, respectively). Inseminations with FT sperm were associated with a reduction in litter size (P &lt; 0.05), which was not evident in the FT-SP group. Taken together, these data confirm an adverse effect of inseminating FT sperm on sperm quality and sow fertility but suggest that thawing FT sperm in 50% SP may partially alleviate these adverse effects.",M2
19942654,"Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice.The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of T-2 toxin on <e>semen</e> quality, fertility and serum testosterone concentration in mice. Adult male mice were mated with sexually mature untreated female mice after being exposed to intraperitoneal injection of T-2 toxin at 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg body weight daily for 7 successive days. Semen quality, serum testosterone concentration and fertility of treated mice were assessed. The results showed that the number of abnormal spermatozoa increased significantly and a significant decrease in spermatozoa with integrated acrosome was observed in males treated with T-2 toxin at all doses, As well, the amount of live spermatozoa decreased significantly in mice treated with 10 and 15 mg/kg body weight T-2 toxin. Low pregnancy rate and high fetal resorption rate were observed when females were mated with T-2 toxin-exposed males. Testicular and cauda epididymal sperm counts, efficiency of sperm production and serum testosterone concentration were significantly reduced in mice treated with T-2 toxin at all doses in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings indicated that T-2 toxin presented toxic effects on reproductive system of adult male mice.",M2
19939764,"[IgG and IgA levels determination in <e>semen</e> liquid: interest for the biological investigation of infertility]We studied the relationship between spermogram parameters and biochemical elements in seminal plasma. In this way we searched an association between immunoglobulin levels in seminal plasma and spermogram parameters. The spermogram is usually performed in our laboratory for investigation of infertility. Using immunonephelometry, we measured immunoglobulin (Ig) G and A levels in the seminal plasma of 17 patients. Averages levels of IgG and IgA were 83.3 and 33.6 mg/L, respectively. IgG and IgA levels appeared to be significantly different (p = 0.001), and were significantly associated. A correlation between IgG values and coiled tails percentage was noted in patients having IgA below 20 mg/L (p &lt; 0,001). In conclusion, the measurement of IgG and IgA levels in seminal plasma might constitute a valuable diagnosis tool for the evaluation of infertility.",M2
19939204,"Modelling of energy expended by free swimming spermatozoa in temperature-dependent viscous <e>semen</e>.Derived models of fertilization kinetics have relied upon estimates of the swimming velocity of spermatozoa from the insemination site to a fallopian tube. However, limited derivations are available describing the probability and energy expended when spermatozoa collide with one another. An analytic approach of spermatozoon motion in a linear viscoelastic fluid is adopted to simplify the derivation. The complex kinematics of motion of an inextensible flagellum is modelled as planar flagellar wave of small amplitude. In humans, a temperature difference is expected between the cooler tubal isthmus and the warmer tubal ampulla. Thus, fluidic characteristics of semen such as viscosity can vary along the female reproductive tract. The results suggest that the probability of spermatozoa colliding in relatively lower viscous semen increases by 64.87% for a 0.5 degrees C surge in temperature. Moreover, this increases for a denser concentration of spermatozoa due to the limited semen volume available to manoeuvre. In addition, the propulsive forces and shear stress were 39.35% lower in less viscous semen due to an increase in temperature of only 0.5 degrees C. Hence, the described derivations herein can assist in the understanding of work done by a normal motile spermatozoon in a pool of semen.",M2
19938952,"The mobile phone decreases fructose but not citrate in rabbit <e>semen</e>: a longitudinal study.The negative impact of mobile phones on sperm motility has been previously described. Both fructose and citrate are important components in semen that facilitate sperm motility. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from the mobile phone on their levels.. Therefore, a longitudinal study using the adult rabbit as a model was undertaken. A total of 30 adult male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. The first (phone) group was placed in specially designed cages, and exposed to radio frequency emitted from a mobile phone (900 MHz) kept in standby mode and positioned adjacent to the genitalia for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. The other two groups served as controls; the stress group which was housed in the same kind of cages to evaluate any cage-induced anxiety, and the control group which was housed in the conventional roomy cages. Semen samples were retrieved weekly. Sperm motility and viability, semen fructose and citrate, and serum testosterone were measured. Histological sections from the prostatic complex, ampulla, and vesicular gland were evaluated. A significant drop in both fructose levels (257 +/-11.6 vs. 489 +/- 8.4 mg %, the baseline level) and number of motile sperms (50 vs. 72%) was observedin the phone group at the 10th week. However, no correlation was found between the two values. The stress control animals showed a similar but significantly less decline in motility No significant changes in citrate levels or other study parameters were seen in the three animal groups throughout the study. In conclusion, the pulsed radio frequency emitted by the mobile phone kept in the standby position longitudinally affected sperm motility and fructose but not citrate levels in rabbit semen.",M2
19934213,"World Health Organization reference values for human <e>semen</e> characteristics.BACKGROUND: Semen quality is taken as a surrogate measure of male fecundity in clinical andrology, male fertility, reproductive toxicology, epidemiology and pregnancy risk assessments. Reference intervals for values of semen parameters from a fertile population could provide data from which prognosis of fertility or diagnosis of infertility can be extrapolated. METHODS: Semen samples from over 4500 men in 14 countries on four continents were obtained from retrospective and prospective analyses on fertile men, men of unknown fertility status and men selected as normozoospermic. Men whose partners had a time-to-pregnancy (TTP) of &lt; or =12 months were chosen as individuals to provide reference distributions for semen parameters. Distributions were also generated for a population assumed to represent the general population. RESULTS: The following one-sided lower reference limits, the fifth centiles (with 95th percent confidence intervals), were generated from men whose partners had TTP &lt; or = 12 months: semen volume, 1.5 ml (1.4-1.7); total sperm number, 39 million per ejaculate (33-46); sperm concentration, 15 million per ml (12-16); vitality, 58% live (55-63); progressive motility, 32% (31-34); total (progressive + non-progressive) motility, 40% (38-42); morphologically normal forms, 4.0% (3.0-4.0). Semen quality of the reference population was superior to that of the men from the general population and normozoospermic men. CONCLUSIONS: The data represent sound reference distributions of semen characteristics of fertile men in a number of countries. They provide an appropriate tool in conjunction with clinical data to evaluate a patient's semen quality and prospects for fertility.",M2

19925327,"The role of enzymatic antioxidants detected in the follicular fluid and <e>semen</e> of infertile couples undergoing assisted reproduction.The follicular fluid environment surrounding the oocytes may play a critical role in fertilization and subsequent embryo development. The goal of our study was to evaluate the oxidative stress markers in the semen, blood serum, and follicular fluid of couples undergoing Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). Two hundred and eight infertile couples underwent ICSI and the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated. Semen Catalase was highly correlated with fertilization and cleavage rates, but not with pregnancy rates. Fertilization and cleavage rates were correlated with the levels of SOD and Catalase in the follicular fluid. After adjusting for age, a negative correlation was detected between LPO levels in follicular fluid and pregnancy rates. Follicular fluid LPO levels may be a marker as a metabolic activity within the follicle need for establishing a pregnancy.",M2
19919178,"Potential role of multiple members of the kallikrein-related peptidase family of serine proteases in activating latent TGF beta 1 in <e>semen</e>.Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta 1) has been implicated as a key contributor of immunosuppression in seminal plasma. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to production of active seminal TGF beta 1 are not fully understood. It is plausible that TGF beta 1 activation is partly induced simultaneously with the release of motile spermatozoa following liquefaction of the semen coagulum. Several members of the kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family are involved in the regulation of semen liquefaction. This study examines the involvement of these KLKs in TGF beta 1 activation in vitro and ex vivo, in seminal plasma. Latent TGF beta 1 was rapidly activated by KLK14. The latency-associated propeptide (LAP) was shown to be cleaved by KLK14 into small peptide fragments, providing a possible mechanism for TGF beta 1 activation. KLK14 also cleaved the latent TGFbeta binding protein 1 (LTBP1). KLK1, 2, and 5 might also contribute to TGF beta 1 activation by nicking the LAP motif and inducing conformational changes that aid in subsequent processing of LAP or through LTBP1 cleavage. Our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of multiple members of the seminal KLK cascade in activation of latent TGF beta 1 in seminal plasma. These findings might have clinical implications in infertility treatment of cases with concurrent delayed liquefaction and TGF beta 1-related semen antigenicity.",M2
19918934,"The use of selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry to detect and quantify polyamines in headspace gas and oral air.Polyamines are a class of aliphatic compounds which include putrescine, cadaverine, spermine and spermidine. They are involved in a variety of cellular processes and have been implicated in a number of different pathophysiological mechanisms. Polyamines are volatile compounds having a distinctive odour normally perceived as being unpleasant. The measurement of their abundance has, however, been restricted to compounds present in the aqueous phase. Using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) we have shown that the polyamines react with the ions H3O+, NO+ and O2+ to form distinctive product ions allowing their levels to be quantified in the vapour phase. The low volatility of spermine did not allow extensive analysis of this compound by SIFT-MS while the adherent properties of cadaverine and putrescine required the use of PTFE transfer lines and couplers. Our data suggested the presence of cadaverine and putrescine in both oral air and the headspace of putrefying bovine muscle, while product ions corresponding to putrescine and spermidine were found in the headspace of human <e>semen</e>. SIFT-MS therefore appears to be a practical means of measuring vapour-phase polyamine levels, having applications in biology, medicine and dentistry, and food science.",M2

Forty male rabbits were randomly assigned and fed four diets containing 0.13, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 mg FB(1)/kg, constituting diets 1 (control), 2, 3 and 4 respectively, for a period of 175 days in a completely randomized design. During the last week of the feeding trial, two untreated female rabbits were mated to each of the four treated bucks per treatment to assess the fertility rate of the treated bucks. Onset of puberty in animals fed diets 3 and 4 was significantly (P&lt;0.05) delayed by some 9-12 days. The weight at puberty, sperm concentration and total sperm/ejaculate were not significantly influenced by the dietary FB(1). Sperm mass activities, motility and live spermatozoa of the rabbits' semen significantly (P&lt;0.05) declined with an increase in the dietary FB(1). The highest sperm cell abnormalities were recorded in the animals fed 10.0 mg/kg FB(1), while the least was observed in the control animals. The conception rate, litter size and embryo survival rate were statistically the same among the dietary treatments. Embryo mortality was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in rabbits fed diets 3 and 4 than in others. Testicular elements were significantly (P&lt;0.05) impaired by the toxin in rabbits fed 7.5 and 10.0 mg FB(1)/kg. This suggests that LOAEL of 7.50 mg/kg FB(1) delayed puberty, impaired semen quality and spermatogenesis and induced embryo mortality without a statistically adverse effect on the fertility rates of male rabbits.",M2
19914014,"Effect of elemental nano-selenium on <e>semen</e> quality, glutathione peroxidase activity, and testis ultrastructure in male Boer goats.The objective of this experiment is to study the effects of novel elemental nano-selenium in the diet on testicular ultrastructure, semen quality and GSH-Px activity in male goats. Forty-two 2-month-old bucks were offered a total mixed ration which had been supplemented with nano-Se (0.3mg/kg Se) or unsupplemented (the control group only received 0.06mg/kg Se-background), for a period of 12 weeks (from weaning to sexual maturity). Results showed that the testicular Se level, semen glutathione peroxidase and ATPase activity increased significantly in the nano-Se supplementation group compared with control (P&lt;0.05). The semen quality (volume, density, motility and pH) was not affected by added Se in diets, however, the sperm abnormality rate of control bucks was significantly higher than Se supplemented bucks (P&lt;0.05). The testes of 5 goats in each group were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and showed that in Se-deficient bucks the membrane was damaged, and showed the occurrence of abnormalities in the mitochondria of the midpiece of spermatozoa. In conclusion, selenium deficiency resulted in abnormal spermatozoal mitochondria, and supplementation with nano-Se enhanced the testis Se content, testicular and semen GSH-Px activity, protected the membrane system integrity and the tight arrayment of the midpiece of the mitochondria. Further studies are required to research the novel elemental nano-Se with characterization of bioavailability and toxicity in small ruminants.",M2

The objective was to examine the effect of supplemental dietary organic selenium (Se) on improving semen quality and antioxidative status in male domestic fowls exposed to high ambient temperature. 2. Thirty-six Egyptian local cross males, 42 weeks old, were housed individually in cages in an open-sided building under 16 h L:8 h D and were provided with commercial feed and water ad libitum. In the house average daily temperature ranged from 33 to 36 degrees C and relative humidity from 60 to 70%. Birds were divided into 4 experimental treatments (n = 9) and were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 01, 02 or 03 mg organic Se/kg in the form of a yeast source (Sel-Plex) for 8 weeks. 3. Under heat stress conditions, inclusion of organic Se in the cockerel diets enhanced the semen quality traits, including the sperm count and motility and reduced the percentage of dead sperms in a dose-dependent manner. 4. In seminal plasma, organic Se supplementation ameliorated some of the adverse effects of heat stress on lipid peroxidation and antioxidative properties. The inclusion of organic Se (03 mg/kg) in the cockerel diets doubled seminal plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, compared to controls and reduced lipid peroxidation. 5. In conclusion, supplemental dietary organic Se improved semen quality characteristics when cockerels were subjected to heat stress. It increased both sperm count and motility, reduced the percentage of dead sperm and enhanced the antioxidative status of seminal plasma.",M2

The aim of the present study was to investigate which parameters among a battery of analyses could predict subsequent spermatozoa in vitro fertilization ability and hence blastocyst output in a goat model. Ejaculates were obtained by artificial vagina from 3 adult goats (Capra hircus) aged 2 years (A, B and C). In order to assess the predictive value of viability, computer assisted sperm analyzer (CASA) motility parameters and ATP intracellular concentration before and after thawing and of DNA integrity after thawing on subsequent embryo output after an in vitro fertility test, a logistic regression analysis was used. Individual differences in semen parameters were evident for semen viability after thawing and DNA integrity. Results of IVF test showed that spermatozoa collected from A and B lead to higher cleavage rates (0 &lt; 0.01) and blastocysts output (p &lt; 0.05) compared with C. Logistic regression analysis model explained a deviance of 72% (p &lt; 0.0001), directly related with the mean percentage of rapid spermatozoa in fresh semen (p &lt; 0.01), semen viability after thawing (p &lt; 0.01), and with two of the three comet parameters considered, i.e tail DNA percentage and comet length (p &lt; 0.0001). DNA integrity alone had a high predictive value on IVF outcome with frozen/thawed semen (deviance explained: 57%). The model proposed here represents one of the many possible ways to explain differences found in embryo output following IVF with different semen donors and may represent a useful tool to select the most suitable donors for semen cryopreservation.",M2

19897482,"Aminoquinoline surfen inhibits the action of SEVI (<e>semen</e>-derived enhancer of viral infection).In semen, proteolytic peptide fragments from prostatic acid phosphatase can form amyloid fibrils termed SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection). These fibrils greatly enhance human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity by increasing the attachment of virions to target cells. Therefore, SEVI may have a significant impact on whether HIV is successfully transmitted during sexual contact. Here, we demonstrate that surfen, a small molecule heparan sulfate proteoglycan antagonist, inhibits both SEVI- and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV type 1 infection. Surfen interferes with the binding of SEVI to both target cells and HIV type 1 virions but does not deaggregate SEVI fibrils. Because SEVI can increase HIV infectivity by several orders of magnitude, supplementing current HIV microbicide candidates with SEVI inhibitors, such as surfen, might greatly increase their potency.",M2

On 23 February (day 0), slow-release melatonin implants were inserted subcutaneously into rams (n = 8). Control animals (n = 8) received no treatment. In both groups, basic semen parameters (concentration, total motility, fast and slow forward motility, morphology), GnRH-induced testosterone response and basal IGF-I concentration were evaluated on days 0, 47 and 71. No differences were found in concentration of spermatozoa, total motility, and numbers of spermatozoa with fast and slow progressive motility and normal/abnormal morphology between the melatonin-treated and the control group. However, in melatonin-treated animals, basal and GnRH-induced testosterone levels were slightly elevated on day 47 and became significantly higher on day 71 (P &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls. There was no difference in plasma IGF-I levels between the groups.

The aim of this study was to define the relationship between IGF-I concentrations and reproductive performance over the breeding and non-breeding seasons in lines of New Zealand Romney rams that had been selected for low and high blood serum IGF-I concentration. Yearling rams from two selection lines (13 from the high line and 19 from the low line) were examined in July (winter), September (autumn) and November (summer) 2006 and March (spring) 2007. Scrotal circumference including the inguinal skin was recorded. <e>Semen</e> was collected by electroejaculation on 4 occasions over a 12-month period. Semen was evaluated according to standard procedures (volume, motility, density and morphology). Samples were collected from four animals from each group for measurements of mRNA for IGF-I and the IGF type 1 receptor (IGF 1R) in the testis, and IGF-I, IGF 1R and the insulin receptor (IR) in the liver. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture for the measurement of IGF-I, insulin and testosterone. The incidences of morphologically abnormal sperm cells, the scrotal circumference and sperm motility were higher in the breeding than in non-breeding season. Seasonal changes were found in the percentage of abnormal sperm, scrotal circumference, sperm motility and sperm density, but there were no differences between lines in any reproductive parameters. IGF-I mRNA levels were higher in the high than the low line in the liver but not in the testis, whereas the opposite was found for levels of IGF 1R mRNA. mRNA levels for the insulin receptor in the liver were higher in the high line. Plasma testosterone concentrations did not differ between lines, whereas the concentrations of IGF-I and insulin were higher in the high line. The results suggest that IGF-I may be locally produced in the liver and the testis, and that selection for high IGF-I may not be associated with improved reproductive performance in rams.",M2

In this study, we investigated the usefulness of the addition of OEP (0, 1, 2 and 4%) or SLS (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/ml) to cat ejaculates before freezing and their concentrations. Among the OEP addition groups, the 1% OEP group showed higher sperm motility than the other groups. Among the SLS addition groups, the 3 mg/ml SLS group showed slightly higher sperm motility and viability than the other groups. Comparison between the 1% OEP and 3 mg/ml SLS addition groups suggested a higher percentage of sperm with an acrosome cap in the 1% OEP group. The other sperm properties did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. These results indicate that addition of 1% OEP or 3 mg/ml SLS is effective for freezing of cat ejaculated semen.",M2

The objectives of this study were to compare the sperm quality and DNA integrity in men diagnosed with testicular and systemic malignancies before receiving treatment and to identify the optimum cryopreservation protocol for their samples including a remote semen collection option. In comparison with fertile donors, patients with testicular malignancies had significantly lower sperm concentration, while both testicular and systemic malignancy patients had significantly lower sperm motility and cryosurvival rates. In addition, the SCSA defined DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in patients with testicular and systemic malignancies compared with fertile donors. It was noted that the extent of deterioration in sperm quality and DNA integrity seen in cancer patients did not reach the previously defined statistical threshold for impaired fertility.

19889752,"The impact of body mass index on <e>semen</e> parameters and reproductive hormones in human males: a systematic review with meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that body mass index (BMI), especially obesity, is associated with subfertility in men. Semen parameters are central to male fertility and reproductive hormones also play a role in spermatogenesis. This review aimed to investigate the association of BMI with semen parameters and reproductive hormones in men of reproductive age. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases and references from relevant articles were searched in January and February 2009. Outcomes included for semen parameters were sperm concentration, total sperm count, semen volume, motility and morphology. Reproductive hormones included were testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, FSH, LH, inhibin B and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate sperm concentration and total sperm count. RESULTS: In total, 31 studies were included. Five studies were suitable for pooling and the meta-analysis found no evidence for a relationship between BMI and sperm concentration or total sperm count. Overall review of all studies similarly revealed little evidence for a relationship with semen parameters and increased BMI. There was strong evidence of a negative relationship for testosterone, SHBG and free testosterone with increased BMI. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review with meta-analysis has not found evidence of an association between increased BMI and semen parameters. The main limitation of this review is that data from most studies could not be aggregated for meta-analysis.

19883590,"Helical conformation of the SEVI precursor peptide PAP248-286, a dramatic enhancer of HIV infectivity, promotes lipid aggregation and fusion.In previous in vivo studies, amyloid fibers formed from a peptide ubiquitous in human seminal fluid (<e>semen</e>-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI)) were found to dramatically enhance the infectivity of the HIV virus (3-5 orders of magnitude by some measures). To complement those studies, we performed in vitro assays of PAP(248-286), the most active precursor to SEVI, and other polycationic polymers to investigate the physical mechanisms by which the PAP(248-286) promotes the interaction with lipid bilayers. At acidic (but not at neutral) pH, freshly dissolved PAP(248-286) catalyzes the formation of large lipid flocculates in a variety of membrane compositions, which may be linked to the promotion of convective transport in the vaginal environment rather than transport by a random Brownian motion. Furthermore, PAP(248-286) is itself fusiogenic and weakens the integrity of the membrane in such a way that may promote fusion by the HIV gp41 protein. An alpha-helical conformation of PAP(248-286), lying parallel to the membrane surface, is implicated in promoting bridging interactions between membranes by the screening of the electrostatic repulsion that occurs when two membranes are brought into close contact. This suggests that nonspecific binding of monomeric or small oligomeric forms of SEVI in a helical conformation to lipid membranes may be an additional mechanism by which SEVI enhances the infectivity of the HIV virus.",M2
19883580,"Transport theory for HIV diffusion through in vivo distributions of topical microbicide gels.Topical microbicide products are being developed for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

Gels may also provide partial barriers that slow virion diffusion from <e>semen</e> to vulnerable epithelium, increasing the time during which anti-HIV molecules can act. To explore the barrier function of microbicide gels, we developed a deterministic mathematical model for HIV diffusion through realistic gel distributions. We applied the model to experimental data for in vivo coating distributions of two vaginal gels in women. Time required for a threshold number of virions to reach the tissue surface was used as a metric for comparing different scenarios. Results delineated how time to threshold increased with increasing gel layer thickness and with decreasing diffusion coefficient. We note that for gel layers with average thickness &gt; approximately 100 microm, the fractional area coated, rather than the gel layer thickness, was the primary determinant of time to threshold. For gel layers &lt; approximately 100 microm, time to threshold was brief, regardless of fractional area coated. Application of the model to vaginal coating data showed little difference in time to threshold between the two gels tested. However, the protocol after gel application (i.e., with or without simulated coitus) had a much more significant effect. This study suggests that gel distribution in layers of thickness &gt;100 microm and fractional area coated &gt;0.8 is critical in determining the ability of the gel to serve as a barrier to HIV diffusion.",M2
19883297,"The effects of male age on <e>semen</e> parameters: analysis of 1364 men attending an andrology center.Although the effect of maternal age on fertility is well known, it is unclear whether paternal age also affects fertility. The aim of this retrospective study was to establish an association between the age of the individuals from Medellin, Colombia with semen volume, rapid progressive motility (a), total progressive motility (a + b) and concentration. We evaluated semen volume using a graduated tube, progressive motility using light microscopy (40 x) and sperm concentration using a Makler Chamber. Semen samples were grouped according to age into three arbitrary groups (&lt;or= to 30 years; between 31 and 39 years; and &gt;or= to 40 years). The semen volume, rapid progressive motility (a) and total progressive motility (a + b), concentration and total sperm count were found to be inversely related to age (p &lt; 0.05). The reduction in semen parameters of 1364 men attending an andrology center was associated with increasing age of the individuals.",M2
19860878,"The measurement of reactive oxygen species in human neat <e>semen</e> and in suspended spermatozoa: a comparison.BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that oxidative stress is an important factor in male infertility because it may impair the physiological function of spermatozoa at the molecular level. Nevertheless, although several approaches have been reported, the imbalance between production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activity of the antioxidant defense system in semen is difficult to investigate and remains poorly understood. METHODS: This study compares measurement of ROS production in neat semen and in washed spermatozoa obtained from the same ejaculate, and suspended in phosphate buffered saline using exactly the same luminol-mediated chemiluminescence method. Ninety one samples were obtained from males of infertile couples and 34 from volunteers with proven fertility. RESULTS: As expected, ROS levels were markedly lower in neat semen than in washed spermatozoa suspensions where seminal plasma with its potent antioxidant capacity was removed. In the cases of both neat semen and washed spermatozoa, ROS production was lowest in samples from normozoospermic males and highest in samples containing more than half million peroxidase-positive leukocytes per milliliter. For all samples, there was a significant positive correlation between ROS production by neat semen and that by washed spermatozoa suspension. CONCLUSION: Measurement of ROS production in neat semen better reflects actual oxidative status because it detects only the overproduction of ROS which are not effectively scavenged by antioxidant capacity of seminal fluid. The results of our study show a good commutability of both measurements for identification of semen samples with high ROS production. The measurement in neat semen is even less time consuming and therefore easier to implement into laboratory routine.",M2
19860697,"Is there a role for PDE5 inhibitors in the management of male infertility due to defects in testicular or epididymal function?This review study refers to the possibility to employ PDE5 inhibitors as an adjunct tool for the therapeutic management of male infertility. The literature tends to suggest that PDE5 inhibitors enhance the Leydig cell secretory function and play a role in the regulation of the contractility of the tunica albuginea and the epididymis. In addition, the literature suggests that PDE5 inhibitors increase the prostatic secretory function that results in an improvement in sperm motility in several cases. Some studies additionally demonstrate a role of PDE5 inhibitors in the regulation of sperm capacitation process. Additional placebo-controlled, randomized, blind studies are necessary to unequivocally suggest a therapeutic role of PDE5 inhibitors in the alleviation of <e>semen</e> disorders and male infertility.",M2
19858326,"Spermatozoa capture HIV-1 through heparan sulfate and efficiently transmit the virus to dendritic cells.<e>Semen</e> is the main vector for HIV-1 dissemination worldwide. It contains three major sources of infectious virus: free virions, infected leukocytes, and spermatozoa-associated virions. We focused on the interaction of HIV-1 with human spermatozoa and dendritic cells (DCs). We report that heparan sulfate is expressed in spermatozoa and plays an important role in the capture of HIV-1. Spermatozoa-attached virus is efficiently transmitted to DCs, macrophages, and T cells. Interaction of spermatozoa with DCs not only leads to the transmission of HIV-1 and the internalization of the spermatozoa but also results in the phenotypic maturation of DCs and the production of IL-10 but not IL-12p70. At low values of extracellular pH (approximately 6.5 pH units), similar to those found in the vaginal mucosa after sexual intercourse, the binding of HIV-1 to the spermatozoa and the consequent transmission of HIV-1 to DCs were strongly enhanced. Our observations support the notion that far from being a passive carrier, spermatozoa acting in concert with DCs might affect the early course of sexual transmission of HIV-1 infection.",M2
19852266,"[Effects of smoking on sperm apoptosis and <e>semen</e> quality of adult males in the main urban area of Chongqing]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of smoking on sperm apoptosis and semen quality of healthy adult males in the main urban area of Chongqing. METHODS: According to the smoking habit, we divided 235 healthy adult males into a non-smoking group (n = 89) and a smoking group (n = 146). Then we detected the routine semen parameters by the computer-assisted semen analysis system and obtained the parameters of sperm apoptosis (the ratios of AN-/PI-, AN+/PI-, AN+/PI+ and AN-/PI+ sperm) by flow cytometry combined with Annexin V-FITC/PI fluorescence staining. RESULTS: The rate of early apoptotic sperm (AN+/PI-) was higher in the smoking than in the non-smoking group ([8.1 +/- 5.1]% vs [6.8 +/- 3.8]%; P = 0.039), but there were no significant differences between the two groups in the rate of late apoptotic sperm (AN+/PI+) ([5.6 +/- 5.2]% vs [5.5 +/- 5.1]%; P = 0.87), as well as in such routine semen indexes as semen volume, sperm density, sperm motility, sperm vitality and normal sperm morphology (P = 0.30, 0.82, 0.37, 0.81 and 0.84, respectively). CONCLUSION: The rate of early apoptotic sperm is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, suggesting that smoking may induce early damage to sperm cells. Compared with routine semen parameters, sperm apoptosis is a more sensitive biomarker to reflect smoking-induced damage to sperm.",M2
19850425,"Raman spectroscopic signature of <e>semen</e> and its potential application to forensic body fluid identification.A great potential of Raman spectroscopy for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of body fluids at the crime scene has been reported recently (Virkler and Lednev, Forensic Sci. Int. 2008). However, that analysis was carried out on only one sample of each body fluid and did not take into account any variations that might occur between different donors of the same fluid. This paper reports on the role of heterogeneity within a sample as well as among multiple donors for human semen. Near-infrared (NIR) Raman spectroscopy was used to measure spectra of pure dried human semen samples from multiple donors in a controlled laboratory environment. The major chemical components that contributed to the Raman spectrum of semen were determined and used to tentatively identify the principal spectral components. The issue of potential spectral variations that could arise between different donors of semen was also addressed. Advanced statistical analysis of spectra obtained from multiple spots on dry samples showed that dry semen is heterogeneous and its Raman spectra could be presented as a linear combination of a fluorescent background and three spectral components. The relative contribution of each of the three components varies with donor, so no single spectrum could effectively represent an experimental Raman spectrum of dry semen in a quantitative way. The combination of the three spectral components could be considered to be a spectroscopic signature for semen. This proof-of-concept approach shows the potential for Raman spectroscopy to identify an unknown substance to be semen during forensic analysis.",M2
19850122,"An overview of male reproductive studies of boron with an emphasis on studies of highly exposed Chinese workers.Boron treatment of rats, mice, and dogs has been associated with testicular toxicity, characterized by inhibited spermiation at lower dose levels and a reduction in epididymal sperm count at higher dose levels. The no-adverse-effect level for reproductive effects in male rats is 17.5mg B/kg bw/day. Earlier studies in human workers and populations have not identified adverse effects of boron exposure on fertility, but outcome measures in these studies were relatively insensitive, based mainly on family size and did not include an evaluation of <e>semen</e> end points. A recent study of nearly 1000 men working in boron (B) mining or processing in Liaoning province in northeast China has been published in several Chinese and a few English language papers. This study included individual assessment of boron exposure, interview data on reproductive experience and semen analysis. Employed men living in the same community and in a remote community were used as controls. Boron workers (n=75) had a mean daily boron intake of 31.3mg B/day, and a subset of 16 of these men, employed at a plant where there was heavy boron contamination of the water supply, had an estimated mean daily boron intake of 125 mg B/day. Estimates of mean daily boron intake in local community and remote background controls were 4.25mg B/day and 1.40 mg/day, respectively. Reproductive outcomes in the wives of 945 boron workers were not significantly different from outcomes in the wives of 249 background control men after adjustment for potential confounders. There were no statistically significant differences in semen characteristics between exposure groups, including in the highly exposed subset, except that sperm Y:X ratio was reduced in boron workers. Within exposure groups the Y:X ratio did not correlate with the boron concentration in blood, semen and urine. In conclusion, while boron has been shown to adversely affect male reproduction in laboratory animals, there is no clear evidence of male reproductive effects attributable to boron in studies of highly exposed workers.",M2

19848266,"Recent advances in boar <e>semen</e> cryopreservation.Since 35 years ago boar semen has been frozen and used for artificial insemination (AI). However, fertility of cryopreserved porcine sperm has consistently been low as boar sperm are more sensitive to cellular stress imposed by changing osmotic balance, oxidative stress, low-temperature exposure, cryo-protectant intoxication etc. and are less able to compensate for these deficiencies at commercially applicable dosages. Additionally, differences in sperm freezability among individuals are well known. Here we review current advances on tests to screen sperm quality post-thaw, on ways of diminishing individual boar effects, on improvement of cryo-protection by novel extender components, on packaging and freezing protocols and freezing and thawing methods, and on the handling of sexed boar sperm. Major advances have been registered, which have improved cryo-survival and the capacity to process boar semen for commercial AI.",M2
19848265,"Optimal characteristics of spermatozoa for <e>semen</e> technologies in pigs.Despite the great potential of sperm technologies such as sperm cryopreservation and sperm sex sorting for the improvement of different aspects of swine production, artificial insemination with fresh or stored semen is currently the only sperm technology used at a commercial scale in the pig industry. The lower reproductive performance associated with the use of these sperm technologies is the reason for such limited use. Since optimal characteristics are required for successful application of frozen-thawed and sex-sorted boar spermatozoa, the present paper summarises the value of the current available methods for their functional assessment as well as the effects of these technologies on boar sperm functionality. In addition, strategies developed to reduce sperm damage and improve the yields of both sperm technologies in swine production are also reviewed with particular attention to the contributions of the authors.",M2
19848263,"The physiological roles of the boar ejaculate.During ejaculation in the boar, sperm cohorts emitted in epididymal cauda fluid are sequentially exposed and resuspended in different mixtures of accessory sex gland secretion. This paper reviews the relevance of such unevenly composed fractions of seminal plasma (SP) in vivo on sperm transport and sperm function and how this knowledge could benefit boar <e>semen</e> processing for artificial insemination (AI). The firstly ejaculated spermatozoa (first 10 ml of the sperm-rich fraction, SRF [P1]) remain mainly exposed to epididymal cauda fluid and its specific proteins i.e. various lipocalins, including the fertility-related prostaglandin D synthase; than to prostatic and initial vesicular gland secretions. P1-spermatozoa are hence exposed to less bicarbonate, zinc or fructose and mainly to PSP-I spermadhesin; than if they were in the rest of the SRF and the post-SRF (P2). Since the P1-SP is less destabilizing for sperm membrane and chromatin, P1-spermatozoa sustain most in vitro procedures, including cryopreservation, the best. Moreover, ejaculated firstly, the P1-spermatozoa seem also those deposited by the boar as a vanguard cohort, thus becoming overrepresented in the oviductal sperm reservoir (SR). This vanguard SR-entry occurs before the endometrial signalling of SP components (as PSP-I/PSP-II and cytokines) causes a massive influx of the innate defensive PMNs to cleanse the uterus from eventual pathogens, superfluous spermatozoa and the allogeneic SP. The SP also conditions the mucosal immunity of the female genital tract, to tolerate the SR-spermatozoa and the semi-allogeneic conceptus. These in vivo gathered data can be extrapolated into procedures for handling boar spermatozoa in vitro for AI and other biotechnologies, including simplified cryopreservation.",M2
19830550,"Galectin-3 is associated with prostasomes in human <e>semen</e>.Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding protein involved in immunomodulation, cell interactions, cancer progression, and pathogenesis of infectious organisms. We report the identification and characterization of galectin-3 in human semen. In the male reproductive tract, the approximately 30 kDa galectin-3 protein was identified in testis, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, seminal vesicle, and sperm protein extracts. In seminal plasma, galectin-3 was identified in the soluble fraction and in prostasomes, cholesterol-rich, membranous vesicles that are secreted by the prostate and incorporated into seminal plasma during ejaculation. Two-dimensional immunoblot analysis of purified prostasomes identified five galectin-3 isoelectric variants with a pI range of 7.0 to 9.2. Affinity purification and tandem mass spectrometry of beta-galactoside-binding proteins from prostasomes confirmed the presence of galectin-3 in prostasomes and identified a truncated galectin-3 variant. The intact galectin-3 molecule contains a carbohydrate recognition domain and a non-lectin domain that interacts with protein and lipid moieties. The identification of a monovalent galectin-3 fragment with conserved carbohydrate-binding activity indicates the functional relevance of this truncation and suggests a regulatory mechanism for galectin-3 in prostasomes. Surface biotinylation studies suggested that galectin-3 and the truncated galectin-3 variant are localized to the prostasome surface. Prostasomes are proposed to function in immunosuppression and regulation of sperm function in the female reproductive tract, are implicated in facilitating sexually-transmitted infections, and are indicated in prostate cancer progression. Given the overlap in functional significance, the identification of galectin-3 in prostasomes lays the groundwork for future studies of galectin-3 and prostasomes in reproduction, disease transmission, and cancer progression.",M2
19823179,"Quick recovery and characterization of cell-free DNA in seminal plasma of normozoospermia and azoospermia: implications for non-invasive genetic utilities.We established a quick and reliable method for recovering cell-free seminal DNA (cfsDNA), by using the binding-washing-elution procedure on the DNA purification column. Low variations (below 15%) among the triplicate values of cfsDNA quantity verified the reproducibility of our cfsDNA recovery method. Similar cfsDNA yield and size distribution between seminal plasma acquired by filtration and centrifugation confirmed the presence of cfsDNA. To investigate the general characterization of cfsDNA, the quantitation and size distribution of cfsDNA from normozoospermic and azoospermic <e>semen</e> were analyzed by real-time PCR and electrophoresis, respectively. CfsDNA concentration in semen with normozoospermia (n = 11) was 1.34 +/- 0.65 microg mL(-1), whereas a higher cfsDNA concentration was observed in azoospermia (2.56 +/- 1.43 microg mL(-1), n = 9). The continuous distribution of DNA fragments ranging from approximately 1 kb to 15 kb and a spectrum of multiples of 180-bp fragments were observed in each normozoospermic and azoospermic sample. Distinct characteristic DNA ladder fragmentations in some azoospermic samples implicated that cfsDNA originate partly from apoptotic cells. CfsDNAs of 36 selected azoospermic patients with known information of Y chromosome microdeletion were subjected to the same microdeletion analysis by multiplex PCR and PCR amplification of sY114 (1450 bp). All multiplex PCR reactions with cfsDNA amplified successfully and provided the same result as leukocyte DNA. PCR amplification of sY114 gave a 1450-bp amplicon as expected. Our data suggested the potential use of cfsDNA in search of biomarker or diagnostic procedures.",M2
19767087,"Cholesterol concentration in seminal plasma as a predictive tool for quality <e>semen</e> evaluation.The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lipid composition of bovine serum and seminal plasma, seasonality, and semen quality. The experiment was carried out in two groups of Simmental breeding bulls: Group I (ages 2 to 4 yr) and Group II (ages 5 to 10 yr). Blood samples were collected from jugular vein, and bovine semen was sampled with an artificial vagina once per season. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triacylglycerols, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), and lipoprotein electrophoretic patterns were determined. Seminal plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C were assayed. Serum concentration of triacylglycerols in young bulls was significantly higher in winter compared with that in autumn, whereas serum NEFA concentration was significantly higher in autumn compared with that in other seasons. Serum concentration of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and LDL lipoproteins in older bulls was significantly higher in winter than in spring. Seminal plasma concentration of total cholesterol in young bulls was significantly higher in spring compared with that in summer, whereas in older bulls it was significantly higher in winter compared with that in autumn samples. Sperm volume of both groups was significantly higher in summer compared with that in autumn and winter. Sperm motility in young bulls was lowest in summer and differed significantly from the values recorded in other seasons. The changes observed in seminal plasma cholesterol concentration were associated with extracellular lipid use and appeared to be applicable as a biochemical marker of sperm quality.",M2
19766298,"The influence of cryopreservation and seminal plasma on the chromatin structure of dog spermatozoa.It was the aim of the current study to investigate effects of seminal plasma on the chromatin structure of frozen-thawed canine (Canis lupus familiaris) spermatozoa. A total of 20 ejaculates were collected. Ejaculates were divided, and one half was centrifuged for removal of seminal plasma (c) while the other was left uncentrifuged (nc) before cryopreservation. This was performed according to the Uppsala system in a computerized freezing machine. Before freezing (bf) and after thawing (at), samples were investigated for motility (M), viability (CASA), and chromatin status (sperm chromatin structure assay; SCSA). Before freezing, the average DFI% and the SD-DFI from 20 nc ejaculates were 1.7+/-4.0% and 18.6+/-1.2, respectively. After thawing, all motility parameters decreased and were significantly lower in centrifuged than in noncentrifuged samples, whereas the percentage of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa (Morph) was significantly higher (nc: M bf, 84.1+/-20.6%; M at, 51.9+/-15%; c: M bf, 84.1+/-20.6%; M at, 43.3+/-22.2%; Morph nc: 28.3+/-7.8% vs. c: 31.0+/-9.8%). Furthermore, only in c samples did the DFI increase within 6h after thawing (DFI c: bf, 41.8+/-1.5%; 6h at, 45.4+/-6.6%; P&lt;0.01). The SD-DFI as well as the DFI% increased within 3h of storage in both groups (SD-DFI nc: bf, 18.6+/-1.2%; 3h at, 25.8+/-5.4%; DFI% nc: bf, 1.1+/-4.0%; 3h at, 6.1+/-12.9%; P&lt;0.05). For both parameters, there was no significant difference between c and nc samples at any time investigated. In conclusion, centrifugation of <e>semen</e> samples before freezing decreased postthaw motility and increased the percentage of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa as well as the degree of sperm chromatin denaturation over time. Centrifugation of canine ejaculates before cryopreservation can therefore no longer be recommended.",M2
19779210,"Raised inflammatory markers in <e>semen</e> from men with asymptomatic chlamydial infection.The aim of this study was to determine whether interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentrations, as well as numbers of seminal leukocytes in a population of infertile men, some of whom were Chlamydia trachomatis positive, were related to chlamydial infection. Our patient group included 255 men attending for diagnostic semen analysis as part of infertility investigations. Significantly raised levels of IL-8, but not IL-6, were found in C trachomatis-infected patients but not in uninfected patients. Raised IL-8 levels in semen were also associated with an increase in semen volume. There was a relationship between C trachomatis infection and lower progressive motile sperm, as well as an increase in seminal leukocytes. The overall prevalence rate for C trachomatis was 6.2%, and more infections were detected in semen than in first void urine. This study supports the suggestion that IL-8 might be used as a marker for male genital tract infection, especially when due to C trachomatis. In this study, there was a relationship between the presence of C trachomatis in semen and alterations of some semen parameters. Further investigations should be performed to understand the disparities of first void urine and semen testing for detection of C trachomatis in males.",M2
19773063,"Mycoplasma agalactiae detected in the <e>semen</e> of goat bucks.Contagious agalactia (CA) is among the most significant diseases affecting small ruminant populations in Mediterranean countries. This study was designed to detect the excretion in semen of CA-causing mycoplasmas in goats (Capra hircus) reared in Spain, where the disease is considered endemic. Culture techniques and PCR were conducted on 147 semen samples collected from 113 goat bucks to detect mycoplasmas. No animal showed clinical symptoms of CA at the moment of the screening. M. agalactiae was identified using both diagnostic methods in three semen samples collected from three different bucks. These animals belonged to a group of animals in which semen had been analyzed twice and only the second sample proved positive, suggesting the possibility of intermittent excretion. This is the first report of the isolation of M. agalactiae from semen collected from naturally infected goats. Future studies should investigate whether semen could be a real source of CA infection by determining if the agent may be transmitted during natural service or when semen is used for artificial insemination.",M2

19754595,"Effects of short-term hyper- and hypoprolactinaemia on hormones of the pituitary, gonad and -thyroid axis and on <e>semen</e> quality in male Beagles.Effects of a short-term hyper- and hypoprolactinaemia on serum concentrations of LH, testosterone and semen quality in six male Beagles were investigated. Blood samples were collected at 3-day intervals for 12 weeks. The time span was divided into five 3-week periods: pre-treatment, metoclopramide (MCP) treatment (0.2 mg/kg orally three times daily), cabergoline (CAB) treatment (5 microg/kg orally once daily), post-treatment 1 and post-treatment 2. In the latter, only semen characteristics were evaluated. Semen parameters were analyzed once per week during the whole 15-week investigation time. At the end of each period, the effects of a single intravenous injection of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 10 microg/kg) on the secretion of prolactin (PRL), LH, testosterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine (T4) were investigated. Pre-treatment serum PRL concentration increased under MCP (p &lt; 0.05), followed by a decrease under CAB administration (p &lt; 0.05). Luteinizing hormone and testosterone concentrations were not affected. Except for straight-line sperm velocity, semen quality did not differ between collection periods. A single iv TRH injection induced a significant PRL increase at 20 min in all experimental periods except during CAB treatment. Luteinizing hormone and testosterone did not show clear TRH-related changes. Basic T4 levels were significantly reduced after CAB treatment (p &lt; 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrate that MCP-induced short-term hyperprolactinaemia in male beagles does not seriously affect the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and semen quality.",M2
19762875,"Inseminating fresh or cryopreserved <e>semen</e> for maximum efficiency: implications for gene banks and industry.Developing gene bank germplasm collections for animal genetic resources requires establishing germplasm collection goals, that consider capturing the genetic diversity of the population in question and the amount of germplasm required for its reconstitution or other purposes, or both. Computing collection goals for chickens is complicated, compared with mammalian species, due to the multiple chances a single insemination of semen has to fertilize an egg. To address this issue, fertility data were used in conjunction with econometric procedures for determining production efficiency and diminishing returns. Experimental treatments consisted of inseminating fresh semen intravaginally (FIV), frozen-thawed semen inseminated intramagnally (FTIM), and frozen-thawed semen inseminated intravaginally (FTIV). Analysis revealed that the maximum efficiency for a single insemination was at postinsemination d 6, 8, and 3 for FIV, FTIM, and FTIV, respectively. But, additional benefit from a single insemination can be garnered by continuing to collect and incubate eggs to d 11, 17, and 11 for FIV, FTIM, and FTIV, respectively. By extending the insemination interval, the number of fertile eggs can be increased by 62 (FIV), 62 (FTIM), and 48% (FTIV). The ramifications of these results are profound when placed in the context of germplasm collection for gene banks. By using the FTIM treatment, the number of germplasm samples needed to secure a chicken breed, at the 150% level, can be reduced from the FAO projection of 2,454 to 386 straws (0.5 mL). Such a change represents a substantial reduction in collection, processing, and storage costs for gene banks. For industry, the results suggest that extending the time interval between inseminations will yield more fertile eggs and create opportunities to increase the number of hens mated to a rooster.",M2
19754601,"TRIS-lecithin extender supplemented with antioxidant catalase for chilling of canine <e>semen</e>.The aims were to evaluate the suitability of a non-commercial TRIS-lecithin (LC) extender and the effect of different concentrations of catalase (CAT) on motility, capacitation status (Chlortetracycline-assay) and zona pellucida (ZP) binding capacity of canine spermatozoa stored at +5 degrees C for 4 days. The sperm-rich fractions of the ejaculates of four stud dogs were divided into four aliquots. After centrifugation, sperm pellets were diluted (200 x 10(6) sperm/ml) in TRIS buffer, citric acid, fructose, antibiotics, supplemented with 20% egg yolk (TRIS-EY) or 0.04% soybean lecithin (TRIS-LC) with CAT (150 or 450 UI/ml) or without CAT, and then preserved at 5 degrees C for 4 days. The results showed that LC is a valid alternative to EY for chilling canine semen, as similar rates of motility, number of uncapacitated spermatozoa and of spermatozoa binding the oocyte ZP were obtained in semen chilled in TRIS-LC or TRIS-EY. Different concentrations of CAT in a TRIS-LC based extender did not improve the quality of semen after chilling. However, a concentration of 150 UI/ml CAT resulted in an increased number of spermatozoa bound to the oocyte ZP, after 4 days of chilling when compared to semen chilled with TRIS-EY and TRIS-LC. In conclusion, an animal protein-free extender with soybean LC, as a replacement of EY, is suitable for 4 days chilling of canine spermatozoa, but the addition of CAT does not improve general semen quality except for a slight effect on sperm-ZP binding.",M2
19815951,"Association of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene 3435C&gt;T polymorphism with male infertility.Infertility is a common problem affecting one in six couples, and in 30% of infertile couples, the male factor is a major cause due to defective sperm quality. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a product of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene, may be a link between genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of male infertility because pesticides (P-gp substrates) are well established factors of male infertility. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the MDR1 gene 3435C&gt;T polymorphism on male infertility. In total, 162 male patients undergoing <e>semen</e> analysis due to initial infertility workup were included in the study. The control group consisted of 191 healthy males with proven fertility. MDR1 3435C&gt;T genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Assessment of MDR1 genotypes among the infertile men showed that 17.9% of subjects were carriers of the CC genotype, 58.0% were CT and 24.1% were TT. Among fertile men, 30.4% of subjects were characterised by the CC genotype, 49.7% were CT and 19.9% were TT. In addition, the frequency of carriers of at least one T allele (i.e., CT and TT genotypes) among infertile and fertile subjects was 82.1% and 69.6%, respectively. The risk of infertility was significantly elevated by two-fold in individuals carrying at least one T allele (CT and TT genotypes: p = 0.009, OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.20-3.32). Furthermore, this elevated risk was still found when considering each of the CT and TT genotypes alone (TT genotype: p = 0.027, OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.09-3.86; CT genotype: p = 0.013, OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.16-3.36).

19811461,"The role of cytokine expression in different subgroups of subfertile men.PROBLEM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of seminal plasma cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 11 (IL-11), interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in male subfertility. METHOD OF STUDY: A total of 73 male partners of an infertile couple attending a regional andrology unit were recruited into this prospective study and subdivided into the various groups based on <e>semen</e> analysis. Concentrations of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the seminal plasma were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Significant higher concentrations (P &lt; 0.05) of IL-6 in the mild and severe oligospermic group, IL-8 and IL-10 in the asthenospermic group and IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the obstructed azoospermic group were determined. IL-10 concentrations correlated significantly with other cytokines in the obstructed azoospermic group and the asthenospermic group. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that cytokines rarely act in isolation, but rather in a network of other cytokines and may affect sperm function directly or indirectly. The presence of increased levels of cytokines in the obstructed azoospermic group suggests that the cytokines may not originate from the testis.",M2
