20504083,"Continuous monitoring of fetal scalp temperature in <e>labor</e>: a new technology validated in a fetal lamb model.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new technical equipment for continuous recording of human fetal scalp temperature in labor. DESIGN: Experimental animal study. METHODS: Two temperature sensors were placed subcutaneously and intracranially on the forehead of 10 fetal lambs and connected to a temperature monitoring system. The system records temperatures simultaneously on-line and stores data to be analyzed off-line. Throughout the experiment, the fetus was oxygenated via the umbilical cord circulation. Asphyxia was induced by intermittent cord compression, as assessed by pH in jugular vein blood. The intracranial (ICT) and subcutaneous (SCT) temperatures were compared with simple and polynomial regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and delta ICT and SCT changes. RESULTS: ICT and SCT were both successfully recorded in all 10 cases. With increasing acidosis, the temperatures decreased. The correlation coefficient between ICT and SCT had a range of 0.76-0.97 (median 0.88) by simple linear regression and 0.80-0.99 (median 0.89) by second grade polynomial regression. After an initial system stabilization period of 10 minutes, the delta temperature values (ICT minus SCT) were less than 1.5 degrees C throughout the experiment in all but one case. CONCLUSIONS: The fetal forehead SCT mirrored the ICT closely, with the ICT being higher.",M1
20502292,"Rapid polymerase chain reaction assay to detect herpes simplex virus in the genital tract of women in <e>labor</e>.OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the genital secretions of women that may be used in labor. METHODS: Samples of genital secretions from women in labor, swabs of active genital lesions, and swabs of buffer solution were analyzed using a newly developed rapid HSV PCR assay to detect HSV glycoprotein B gene and quantitate virion copy number. A previously validated TaqMan PCR to detect HSV glycoprotein B gene was performed as the comparator gold standard. Positivity determination that optimized sensitivity and specificity was determined with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The median time to result for rapid HSV PCR was 2 hours (range 1.5-3.5 hours). A positivity determination rule that required both wells of the rapid test to detect 150 copies or greater of HSV per milliliter maximized specificity (96.7%) without appreciable loss of sensitivity (99.6%). Among positive samples, the correlation between the rapid test and TaqMan for the quantity of HSV isolated was excellent (R=0.96, P&lt;.001). The rapid test had a positive predictive value of 96.7% and a negative predictive value of 99.6% in a population with HSV shedding prevalence of 10.8%, based on the prevalence of genital HSV previously found among HSV-2 seropositive women in labor. CONCLUSION: Rapid HSV PCR provides results with excellent sensitivity and specificity within a timeframe that could inform clinical decision making for identifying neonates at risk of neonatal HSV infection.

20486476,"Development and testing of nurses' perceptions of the use of hydrotherapy in <e>labor</e> questionnaire.While effective for labor pain, hydrotherapy is not often used. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an instrument of nurses' perceptions of the barriers to the use of hydrotherapy in labor. Following generation of items and review by content experts, the Nurses' Perceptions of the Use of Hydrotherapy in Labor (NPUHL) questionnaire was administered to 65 intrapartum nurses (phase I) and to 401 nurses (phase II). In phase I, the mean score of the NPUHL was significantly and negatively correlated with the Labor Support Scale (r = -.30, p = .016), indicating that nurses who demonstrated more labor-supportive behaviors also perceived fewer barriers to the use of hydrotherapy in labor. In phase II, exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors: Health Care Environment, Knowledge and Beliefs, Personal Concerns, Effort Required for Hydrotherapy, and Technology. There was a significant negative correlation (r = -.61) between use of hydrotherapy and the total NPUHL score and those of its subscales (r = -.12 to -.61); nurses with access to hydrotherapy tubs perceived fewer barriers to hydrotherapy than nurses without (t = 9.71, df= 387, p &lt; .01). For the revised 30-item NPUHL, Cronbach's alpha was .93, and subscale alphas ranged from .58 to .93. The 30-item NPUHL scale demonstrated evidence of good initial reliability and validity.",M1
20452493,"Human effector/initiator gene sets that regulate myometrial contractility during term and preterm <e>labor</e>.OBJECTIVE: Distinct processes govern transition from quiescence to activation during term (TL) and preterm labor (PTL). We sought gene sets that are responsible for TL and PTL, along with the effector genes that are necessary for labor independent of gestation and underlying trigger. STUDY DESIGN: Expression was analyzed in term and preterm with or without labor (n=6 subjects/group). Gene sets were generated with logic operations. RESULTS: Thirty-four genes were expressed similarly in PTL/TL but were absent from nonlabor samples (effector set); 49 genes were specific to PTL (preterm initiator set), and 174 genes were specific to TL (term initiator set). The gene ontogeny processes that comprise term initiator and effector sets were diverse, although inflammation was represented in 4 of the top 10; inflammation dominated the preterm initiator set. CONCLUSION: TL and PTL differ dramatically in initiator profiles. Although inflammation is part of the term initiator and the effector sets, it is an overwhelming part of PTL that is associated with intraamniotic inflammation.",M1
20452490,"Characterization of the transcriptome of chorioamniotic membranes at the site of rupture in spontaneous <e>labor</e> at term.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the transcriptome between the site of membrane rupture and the chorioamniotic membranes away from the site of rupture. STUDY DESIGN: The transcriptome of amnion and chorion (n=20 each) from and distal to the site of rupture from women with spontaneous labor and vaginal delivery at term after spontaneous rupture of membranes was profiled with Illumina HumanHT-12 microarrays. Selected genes were validated with the use of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-seven genes were differentially expressed in the chorion between the rupture and nonrupture sites (false discovery rate&lt;0.1; fold change&gt;1.5). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the differential expression in 10 of 14 genes. Enriched biological processes included anatomic structure development, cell adhesion and signal transduction. Extracellular matrix-receptor interaction was the most impacted signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The transcriptome of fetal membranes after spontaneous rupture of membranes in term labor is characterized by region- and tissue-specific differential expression of genes that are involved in signature pathways, which include extracellular matrix-receptor interactions.",M1
20437833,"[Progesterone neuroactive metabolites in human pregnancy]OBJECTIVE: Review of the physiological role of neuroactive and neuroprotective steroids in human pregnancy. DESIGN: A review article. SETTING: Gynecological-Obstetrical Clinic, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University and General Hospital, Prague. CONCLUSION: Human parturition is a multi-factorial process. Various mechanisms related to the onset of <e>labor</e> were suggested. Estrogens show accelerating increase in late pregnancy, which probably reflect the increasing activity of fetal zone of the fetal adrenal. This zone is stimulated by progressive increase of placental CRH resulting in excessive production of conjugated 3beta-hydroxy-5-en-steroids, which are transported by circulation to placenta and further metabolized to active hormones. Some progesterone metabolites probably participate in pregnancy sustaining via modulation of ligand-gated ion channels in the CNS and periphery. In this review, the question was addressed whether the catabolism of pregnancy sustaining progesterone metabolites accelerate like the estrogen formation.",M1
20426604,"Comparison between massage and music therapies to relieve the severity of <e>labor</e> pain.BACKGROUND: During labor, women experience a high level of intense, stressful and steady pain that may negatively affect both mothers and neonates. Painkillers have previously been used for childbearing women, but nowadays, owing to some well-known limitations and serious side effects, nonpharmacologic methods such as massage and music therapies are being broadly recommended. The present clinical trial was conducted to compare the effects of massage and music therapies on the severity of labor pain in the Ilam province of western Iran. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Overall, 101 primigravidae who were hospitalized for vaginal delivery were recruited and randomly stratified into two groups of either massage (n = 51) or music (n = 50) therapies. Pain was measured using the visual analog scale and the two groups were compared in terms of pain severity before and after the interventions. RESULTS: Mothers in the massage therapy group had a lower level of pain compared with those in the music therapy group (p = 0.009). A significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of pain severity after intervention (p = 0.01). Agonizing, or most severe, labor pain was significantly relieved after massage therapy (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Massage therapy was an effective method for reducing and relieving labor pain compared with music therapy and can be clinically recommended as an alternative, safe and affordable method of pain relief where using either pharmacological or nonpharmacological methods are optional.",M1
20423281,"Regulation of progesterone receptor A and B expression in human preterm, term, and postterm placental villi.OBJECTIVE: The progesterone receptor (PR)-A/B ratio in the myometrium is reported to be closely related to <e>labor</e> onset. This might represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions for postterm and preterm deliveries, though the mechanisms currently remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation mechanism of PR-A and B expression in human preterm, term, and postterm placental villi. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, China. POPULATION: Singleton women of preterm (PRNIL, not in labor, n = 10), term (TNIL, not in labor, n = 10; TIL, in labor, n = 10), and postterm (PONIL, not in labor, n = 10) cesarean deliveries. METHODS: The PR-A/PR-B mRNA and protein ratios were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blots in villi from preterm, term, postterm groups. PONIL and PRNIL villi were incubated with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PG) and indomethacin for 72 hours, respectively, and the PR-A/PR-B mRNA and protein ratios and p38 signaling pathway were explored. RESULTS: The PR-A/PR-B ratio was highest in TIL, followed by PRNIL, PONIL and TNIL. Indomethacin significantly up-regulated PR-B expression, thereby decreasing the PR-A/PR-B ratio (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, PG reduced the expression of PR-B and increased PR-A, leading to a significant increase in the PR-A/PR-B ratio (p &lt; 0.05). We also determined that the PR-A/PR-B ratio was mediated through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the PR-A/PR-B ratio plays a key role in the mechanisms regulating preterm, term, and postterm deliveries.",M1

20410778,"Multidisciplinary team training in a simulation setting for acute obstetric emergencies: a systematic review.OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of multidisciplinary teamwork training in a simulation setting for the reduction of medical adverse outcomes in obstetric emergency situations. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 2009. The search strategy contained medical subject heading terms ( patient care team  and  patient simulation  and  obstetrics  or  gynecology  and  education  or  teaching ) and additional text words ( teamwork,   simulation,   training ). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies describing and evaluating teamwork training programs with simulation models for <e>labor</e> ward staff in acute obstetric emergencies were selected. The search revealed 97 articles. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: All studies were assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) criteria. Only eight articles assessed the effect of teamwork training in a simulation setting. Four of them were randomized controlled trials and four were cohort studies. The only study that reported on perinatal outcome showed an improvement in terms of 5-minute Apgar score and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The seven other studies showed that teamwork training in a simulation setting resulted in improvement of knowledge, practical skills, communication, and team performance in acute obstetric situations. Training in a simulation center did not further improve outcome compared with training in a local hospital. CONCLUSION: Introduction of multidisciplinary teamwork training with integrated acute obstetric training interventions in a simulation setting is potentially effective in the prevention of errors, thus improving patient safety in acute obstetric emergencies. Studies on its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are needed before team training can be implemented on broad scale.",M1

20395896,"Epidural analgesia with ropivacaine and sufentanil is associated with transient fetal heart rate changes.AIM: Fetal heart rate (FHR) changes have been reported after regional <e>labor</e> analgesia. In this prospective single-blinded study, we aimed to assess whether epidural analgesia with ropivacaine and sufentanil is associated with significant changes in fetal heart rate. METHODS: Fetal heart rate traces from 120 women in active labor requesting epidural analgesia were recorded and analyzed by two reviewers 90 minutes before and after epidural analgesia for baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations, decelerations and long-term variability. RESULTS: A significantly decreased number of fetal heart rate accelerations (ANOVA P=0.0001) and a higher percentage of segments with decelerations (P&lt;0.05) were observed in the three segments after analgesia as compared to the three preceding segments. The minimum number of accelerations occurred during the 30 minutes immediately after analgesia was initiated. The reviewers were concordant in finding a significant change from the 60 minutes before to the 60 minutes after analgesia, a period in which there CONCLUSION: Epidural analgesia with ropivacaine and sufentanil is associated with fetal heart rate changes. These modifications are transient and should be considered when evaluating fetal heart rate monitoring during labor to prevent inappropriate obstetric management decisions to proceed with operative labor.",M1
20394248,"Epidural analgesia during <e>labor</e>--0.5% lidocaine with fentanyl vs. 0.08% ropivacaine with fentanyl.BACKGROUND: Although lidocaine is a cheap and globally available local anesthetic, yet it is not a popular drug for labor analgesia. This is claimed to its higher intensity of motor block, possibility of transient neurological symptoms (TNS) and its placental transfer with probable drawbacks on fetal well-being. However, these effects could be concentration dependent and, the evidence linking them to lidocaine is still lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5% epidural lidocaine plus fentanyl during labor. METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy full term nulliparous women in early labor with a single fetus presented by the vertex were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Parturient were assigned to receive epidural analgesia either with lidocaine 0.5% plus fentanyl 2 microg(-1 mL) (LF), or ropivacaine 0.08% plus fentanyl 2 microg(-1 ml) (RF) when their cervix was dilated to 4 centimeters. Analgesia was provided with 20 ml bolus of the study solution and maintained at 10 ml(-1) h. Upper level of sensory loss to cold, Visual Analogue Pain Score (VAPS), motor block (modified Bromage score), the duration of the first and second stages of labor, numbers of instrumental vaginal and cesarean deliveries, the neonatal apgar score, patient satisfaction and side effects, were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sensory level, pain scores, duration of the first and second stages of labor, numbers of instrumental and cesarean deliveries, the neonatal apgar scores, patient satisfaction or side effect between groups. Although motor block was significantly high in lidocaine group compared to ropivacaine group (p &lt; 0.05), all parturient were moving satisfactorily in bed. CONCLUSIONS: Dilute epidural lidocaine (0.5%) with fentanyl effectively and safely initiates epidural analgesia clinically indistinguishable from 0.08% epidural ropivacaine with fentanyl. Although it induces significant motor block compared to ropivacaine, it still preserves maternal ability to move satisfactorily in bed. Whether further reduction in lidocaine concentration could trim down the motor block, remains to be investigated.",M1
20378154,"Organochlorine pesticides in colostrums in case of normal and preterm <e>labor</e> (Iasi, Romania).Assessment of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in human body is important for human health because they have weak estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects and are considered endocrine disrupters. We used colostrum of women as indicator for levels of OCPs in human body for mothers with normal and preterm labor from eastern part of Romania. Sixty- three samples of colostrum were extracted by solid-phase extraction. Analyses were carried out using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). OCPs have been detected in all samples, with p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) being at the highest concentrations. Of the organochlorines measured in clostrum samples from women in preterm labor, median levels of DDTs (470 ng/g) and HCHs (99 ng/g) were higher than for the same compounds from women in normal labor (median of DDTs=268 ng/g and median of HCHs=96 ng/g). Normal labor had higher median concentrations of HCB (19.5 ng/g) versus preterm labor (14 ng/g). Statistical data show high Spearman correlation coefficients between various OCPs. We found a good correlation between alpha-, gamma-, beta- and delta- HCH isomers (p&lt;0.001) for both normal and preterm labor. The most abundant target compound was p,p'-DDE (median value 96 ng/g, and 137 ng/g for mother with normal and preterm labor, respectively) in all colostrum samples. The estimated daily intakes of HCHs by infants exceeded corresponding Health Canada guidelines.",M1

20237167,"Human <e>labor</e> is associated with reduced decidual cell expression of progesterone, but not glucocorticoid, receptors.CONTEXT: Unchanging plasma progesterone (P4) levels suggest that human labor is initiated by reduced P4 receptor (PR) expression, which elicits functional P4 withdrawal. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is also implicated in this process. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare PR and GR staining in human decidual cells (DCs) and interstitial trophoblasts (ITs) of gestational age-matched pre- and postcontraction specimens and to evaluate steroid effects on PR and GR expression in human DC cultures. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Decidua basalis and parietalis sections were immunostained for PR or GR and then for the cytoplasmic DC and IT markers vimentin and cytokeratin. Western blotting measured PR and GR levels in nuclear extracts of cultured leukocyte-free term DCs after incubation with estradiol-17beta (E2) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). RESULTS: PR histological scores (HSCOREs) were significantly higher in DC nuclei from pre- vs. post-uterine-contraction decidua basalis and parietalis sections with PR immunostaining absent from ITs. In contrast, immunoreactive GR was localized in IT and DC nuclei. GR HSCORES were significantly higher in ITs than DCs but similar in pre- vs. post-uterine-contraction specimens. In term DC monolayers, PR-A and PR-B were enhanced by E2 and inhibited by MPA, whereas E2 plus MPA produced intermediate PR expression. The GR was constitutively expressed. CONCLUSIONS: In post- vs. pre-uterine-contraction specimens, significantly lower HSCOREs in DC nuclei, but not IT, and unchanging GR levels in DCs and ITs suggest that functional P4 withdrawal may occur in DCs and is unlikely to involve the GR. Nuclear extracts from DC monolayer cultures express steroid-regulated PR-A and PR-B and constitutive GR.",M1
20225989,"Psychoprophylaxis during <e>labor</e>: associations with labor-related outcomes and experience of childbirth.OBJECTIVE: To study whether use of psychoprophylaxis during labor affects course of labor and experience of childbirth in nulliparous women. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Women were recruited from 15 antenatal clinics in Sweden between October 2005 and January 2007. SAMPLE: A total of 857 nulliparous women with a planned vaginal delivery. METHODS: Using data from a randomized controlled trial of antenatal education where the allocated groups were merged, we compared course of labor and experience of childbirth between women who used psychoprophylaxis during labor and those who did not. Data were collected by questionnaires in mid-pregnancy and three months after birth, and from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Logistic regression was used to assess associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mode of delivery, augmentation of labor, length of labor, Apgar score, pain relief and experience of childbirth as measured by the Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire. RESULTS: Use of psychoprophylaxis during labor was associated with a lower risk of emergency cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.88), but an increased risk of augmentation of labor (adjusted OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.23-2.28). No statistical differences were found in length of labor (adjusted OR 1.32; 95% CI 0.95-1.83), Apgar score &lt; 7 at five minutes (adjusted OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33-2.01), epidural analgesia (adjusted OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.84-1.53) or fearful childbirth experience (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.62-1.74). CONCLUSION: Psychoprophylaxis may reduce the rate of emergency cesarean section but may not affect the experience of childbirth.",M1
20215946,"Overcoming the challenges: maternal movement and positioning to facilitate <e>labor</e> progress.The benefits of maternal movement and position changes to facilitate labor progress have been discussed in the literature for decades. Recent routine interventions such as amniotomy, induction, fetal monitoring, and epidural anesthesia, as well as an increase in maternal obesity, have made position changes during labor challenging. The lack of maternal changes in position throughout labor can contribute to dystocia and increase the risk of cesarean births for failure to progress or descend. This article provides a historical review of the research findings related to the effects of maternal positioning on the labor process and uses six physiological principles as a framework to offer suggestions for maternal positioning both before and after epidural anesthesia.",M1

20207251,"Vaginal cleansing before cesarean delivery to reduce postoperative infectious morbidity: a randomized, controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether vaginal preparation with povidone iodine before cesarean delivery decreased the risk of postoperative maternal morbidities. STUDY DESIGN: The design of the study was a randomized, controlled trial in women undergoing cesarean delivery with subjects assigned to have a preoperative vaginal cleansing with povidone iodine or to a standard care group (no vaginal wash). The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative fever, endometritis, sepsis, readmission, wound infection, or complication. RESULTS: There were 155 vaginal cleansing subjects and 145 control subjects. Overall, 9.0% developed the composite outcome, with fewer women in the cleansing group (6.5%) compared with the control group (11.7%), although the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.11; P = .11). Length of surgery, being in <e>labor</e>, and having a dilated cervix were all associated with the composite morbidity outcome.

20207242,"Maternal and neonatal outcomes by <e>labor</e> onset type and gestational age.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine maternal and neonatal outcomes by labor onset type and gestational age. STUDY DESIGN: We used electronic medical records data from 10 US institutions in the Consortium on Safe Labor on 115,528 deliveries from 2002 through 2008. Deliveries were divided by labor onset type (spontaneous, elective induction, indicated induction, unlabored cesarean). Neonatal and maternal outcomes were calculated by labor onset type and gestational age. RESULTS: Neonatal intensive care unit admissions and sepsis improved with each week of gestational age until 39 weeks (P &lt; .001). After adjusting for complications, elective induction of labor was associated with a lower risk of ventilator use (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.53), sepsis (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26-0.49), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.48-0.57) compared to spontaneous labor. The relative risk of hysterectomy at term was 3.21 (95% CI, 1.08-9.54) with elective induction, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.24-5.58) with indicated induction, and 6.57 (95% CI, 1.78-24.30) with cesarean without labor compared to spontaneous labor. CONCLUSION: Some neonatal outcomes improved until 39 weeks. Babies born with elective induction are associated with better neonatal outcomes compared to spontaneous labor. Elective induction may be associated with an increased hysterectomy risk.",M1
20189129,"The coping with <e>labor</e> algorithm: an alternate pain assessment tool for the laboring woman.The documentation of pain in the labor and delivery setting is one of the essential tasks of all health care providers who care for women in labor. The Joint Commission standards mandate regular pain assessments, but compliance with this mandate in the highly unique patient population of laboring woman is problematic when using the standard 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale. Labor pain is always unique given the various contributing physiologic, emotional, social, and cultural components. This article describes the work of a process improvement group to create an alternative pain assessment tool named the Coping With Labor Algorithm. The group, consisting of nurses and nurse-midwives, used the FOCUS format and Deming's  Plan, Do, Check, and Act  cycle to create a formalized assessment tool for use with laboring women. The Coping With Labor Algorithm is currently in use in the labor unit of a large tertiary care facility, which successfully passed a Joint Commission inspection while using the coping algorithm. The value of the coping algorithm is two-fold: it provides a mechanism for pain documentation, and it provides nursing care suggestions for the laboring woman. This article reports nurses' perceptions of the tool.",M1
20178524,"Changes in 13, 14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2alpha levels in saliva during pregnancy, <e>labor</e> and the postpartum period.AIMS: To examine changes in the levels of 13, 14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGFM) in saliva during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period, and to evaluate the relationship between cervical dilatation or contraction interval and salivary PGFM levels during labor. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics in a hospital in Japan that has approximately 500 deliveries per year. Maternal and neonatal data were obtained from medical records. Saliva samples were collected during pregnancy (from 35 to 36 weeks gestation), labor and the postpartum period. RESULTS: Sixty-four healthy pregnant women were recruited and data from 30 subjects were analyzed. Salivary PGFM levels were almost constant during pregnancy, increased as labor progressed and decreased after delivery. Salivary PGFM levels during contraction intervals of 1-2 min were significantly higher than those when contraction intervals were 7-8, 5-6 or 3-4 min. CONCLUSIONS: PGFM levels in saliva significantly increased with labor progression, remained at the highest level until delivery of the placenta, and decreased after delivery. Salivary PGFM levels are related not to cervical dilatation but to contraction interval. It was found that salivary PGFM levels reflected the contraction status of the uterus as delivery progressed.",M1
20173318,"Ultrasound in <e>labor</e> and delivery.Ultrasound may play an important role in the management of labor and delivery. Induction of labor is a common obstetric intervention, performed in about 20% of pregnancies. Pre-induction cervical length, measured by transvaginal sonography, has been shown to have a significant association with the induction-to-delivery interval and the risk for cesarean section. In the management of labor there is extensive evidence that digital pelvic examination does not provide accurate assessment of the position and descend of the fetal head both during the first but also in the second stage of labor. Several recent studies using both two- and three-dimensional ultrasound have now described objective measures of progression of the fetal head during labor. In instrumental deliveries an important determinant of a successful and safe use of vacuum and forceps is the correct determination of the fetal head position and appropriate application of the instrument. However, ultrasound studies have shown that digital examination before instrumental delivery fails to identify the correct fetal position in a high proportion of cases. The use of ultrasound is of crucial importance in performing a safe operative delivery and can help in the prediction of whether a vaginal delivery would be successful.",M1
20163401,"Activation of the alternative pathway of complement is a feature of pre-term parturition but not of spontaneous <e>labor</e> at term.PROBLEM: Plasma concentrations of fragment Bb (FBb) are a marker for activation of the alternative pathway of the complement system. High concentrations of FBb in maternal blood, as early as the first trimester, are associated with subsequent spontaneous pre-term delivery &lt;34 weeks of gestation. The aim of this study was to determine whether spontaneous pre-term labor (PTL) with intact membranes, intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) or labor at term are associated with alterations in circulating maternal FBb concentrations. METHOD OF STUDY: This cross-sectional study included women in the following groups: (i) non-pregnant (n = 40); (ii) normal pregnancy (gestational age range 20-36, 6/7 weeks, n = 63); (iii) women at term not in labor (n = 70); (iv) women at term in spontaneous labor (n = 59); (v) patients with an episode of PTL who delivered at term (n = 62); (vi) PTL without IAI who delivered pre-term (n = 30); and (vii) PTL with IAI who delivered pre-term (n = 67). Maternal plasma FBb concentrations were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: (i) Among patients with PTL, those who had a pre-term delivery either with IAI (1.21 microg/mL, IQR 0.77-2.16) or without IAI (1.13 microg/mL, IQR 0.92-2.08) had a higher median maternal plasma FBb concentration than those who delivered at term (0.86 microg/mL, IQR 0.64-1.57; P = 0.007 and P = 0.026, respectively); (ii) there was no difference in the median plasma FBb concentration between patients with and without IAI who delivered pre-term (P = 0.9); (iii) in contrast, spontaneous labor at term was not associated with a significant change in the maternal plasma FBb concentration (P = 0.8); (iv) maternal plasma concentration of FBb did not differ significantly between normal pregnant women and the non-pregnant controls (P = 0.8) and were not correlated with advancing gestational age (r = -0.28, P = 0.8). CONCLUSION: (i) Pre-term parturition is associated with activation of the alternative complement pathway in maternal circulation; (ii) such activation is not detectable in spontaneous labor at term; (iii) IAI does not explain the activation of the alternative pathway of complement in PTL. Collectively, these observations suggest that pre-term and term labors have fundamental differences in the regulation of innate immunity.",M1

A gap in knowledge is whether spontaneous labor at term is associated with changes in the maternal and fetal concentrations of visfatin. The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of labor at term is associated with alterations in maternal and neonatal plasma visfatin concentrations. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 50 normal pregnant women at term and their appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates in the following groups: 1) 25 mother-neonate pairs delivered by elective cesarean section without spontaneous labor, and 2) 25 mother-neonate pairs who delivered vaginally following spontaneous labor. Maternal plasma and cord blood visfatin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analyses. RESULTS: 1) The median visfatin concentration was higher in umbilical cord plasma of neonates born following a spontaneous labor at term than that of those who were born by an elective cesarean section (P=0.02); 2) in contrast, the median maternal plasma visfatin concentration did not differ significantly between patients with and without labor (P=0.44); and 3) there was a significant correlation between umbilical cord plasma concentration of visfatin and both maternal visfatin concentration (r=0.54, P=0.005) and gestational age (GA) at delivery (r=0.58; P=0.002) only in the absence of labor. CONCLUSION: Term labor is associated with increased fetal, but not maternal, circulating visfatin concentrations. Previous reports indicate that preterm labor leading to preterm delivery is characterized by an increase in maternal plasma concentrations of visfatin. The observations reported herein support the view that there are fundamental differences in the endocrine and metabolic adaptations in normal labor at term and preterm labor.",M1
20139548,"Epidural anesthesia: views and outcomes of women in <e>labor</e> in a Nigerian hospital.BACKGROUND: Pain during childbirth is a well known cause of dissatisfaction amongst women in labor. The use of epidural analgesia in labor is becoming widespread due to its benefit in terms of pain relief. METHOD: After approval of the local Ethics Committee on Research and obtaining informed written consent, 50 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II consecutive multiparous women in labor requesting pain relief were enrolled in this prospective study. After providing description of the two options of pain relief available to them, they were allocated into two groups according to their request-to receive either parenteral opioid/sedative or epidural labor analgesia. Both groups received analgesia of choice at 4-cm cervical os dilatation. The epidural group received 0.125% plain bupivacaine, while the other group received pentazocine/promethazine intravenously. The time taken to locate the epidural space, catheter-related complications encountered and the amount of intravenous fluid used were documented. RESULT: The two groups were comparable in terms of socio-demographic data. The mean duration of the first and second stages of labor, respectively, were significantly shorter in the epidural group when compared with those in the non-epidural group ([P &lt; 0.01] and [P &lt; 0.02]). There was no difference in the rate of cesarean delivery between them - epidural analgesia (32% [8/25]) versus parenteral opioid/sedative (44% [11/25]), (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.19-1.90). The maternal blood loss from delivery was minimal, with no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.27). The neonatal outcome was the same in both groups. Closed questionnaire showed that the overall experience of labor was much better (it was also better than expected) in the epidural group when compared with that in the non-epidural group (80% versus 4%). Eighteen (72%) women had inadequate pain relief in the non-epidural group as compared to 2 (8%) women in the epidural group. CONCLUSION: The study shows that epidural labor analgesia is acceptable to women in our setting. More women in the epidural analgesia group were satisfied with the experience of labor than those who did not receive this form of analgesia than among those who received parenteral opioid/sedative.",M1
20137366,"Comparison of bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine with sufentanil for patient-controlled epidural analgesia during <e>labor</e>: a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine have been introduced into obstetric analgesic practice with the proposed advantages of causing less motor block and toxicity compared with bupivacaine. However, it is still controversial whether both anesthetics are associated with any clinical benefit relative to bupivacaine for labor analgesia. This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy, motor block and side effects of bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine at lower concentrations for patient-controlled epidural labor analgesia. METHODS: Four hundred and fifty nulliparous parturients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial. A concentration of 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.1%, 0.125% or 0.15% of either bupivacaine (Group B), ropivacaine (Group R) or levobupivacaine (Group L) with sufentanil 0.5 microg/ml was epidurally administered by patient-controlled analgesia mode. Effective analgesia was defined as a visual analogue scale score was &lt;or=30 mm. The relative median potency for each local anesthetic was calculated using a probit regression model. Parturients demographics, sensory and motor blockade, obstetric data, maternal side effects, hourly volumes of local anesthetic used, and others were also noted. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among groups in the numbers of effective analgesia, pain scores, hourly local anesthetic amount used, sensory and motor blockade, labor duration and mode of delivery, side effects and maternal satisfaction (P&gt;0.05). The relative median potency was bupivacaine/ropivacaine: 0.828 (0.602-1.091), bupivacaine/levobupivacaine: 0.845 (0.617-1.12), ropivacaine/levobupivacaine: 1.021 (0.774-1.354), respectively. However, a significantly less number of effective analgesia and higher hourly local anesthetic use were observed in the concentration of 0.05% than those of &gt;or=0.1% within each group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using patient-controlled epidural analgesia, lower concentrations of bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine with sufentanil produce similar analgesia and motor block and safety for labor analgesia. The analgesic efficacy mainly depends on the concentration rather than the type of anesthetics.",M1
20133986,"Immune response parameters during <e>labor</e> and early neonatal life.AIM: Selected cytokines, associated with Th1 and Th2 immune response and inflammation, were studied in order to evaluate the relation between their release into maternal and neonatal circulation, during labour, and after birth, in comparison with those in adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytokine concentrations were determined by very sensitive immunoassays, in maternal serum (MS), umbilical cord (UC), neonatal serum, the 1st (1N) and 5th (5N) day postpartum and in adult controls. RESULTS: Both IL-2 and IL-4 cytokine concentrations in UC were markedly elevated, compared to adult and MS ones. IL-2 decreased significantly in 5N, while IL-4 remained unchanged. IFN-gamma UC values were significantly lower than those in adults and MS, increasing significantly in 5N. Neonatal serum sIL-2R and sIL-4R were markedly higher than those in adults and MS. IL-1beta, IL-6, sIL-6R, sTNFRI and sTNFRII concentrations in MS and all with TNF-alpha in neonatal serum were significantly higher than in adults. IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-2R, IL-4R concentrations in MS, 1N and 5N were dependent on the mode of delivery. CONCLUSION: The results of this comparative study are indicative for a meaningful role for the studied cytokines and their receptors in: i) the development of neonatal immune system, ii) the regulation of immune response during labour and early life, and iii) the initiation of the processes of labour.",M1

20121428,"Academy of breastfeeding medicine founder's lecture 2009: Maternity care re-evaluated.Abstract In the 1990s a rising tide of medical, surgical, and instrumental interventions served to make childbirth almost treated like a disease. This report supports a different approach to childbirth. A case and discussions of induction are presented. A national survey of 1,573 pregnant women throughout the United States was collected. Although most U.S. childbearing women are low risk, childbirth is  procedure intensive.  Women reported significant interventions such as regional analgesia (76%), ruptured membranes (65%), forceful pushing (75%), and cesarean sections (32%). The U.S. rate of cesarean sections in 2005 was the fourth highest among 25 countries. The epidural has many negative features. When used in <e>labor</e> it extends the length of time from 5 to 7 h, causes a raised temperature greater than 100.4 degrees C in 15-30% of infants and mothers, and produces a very sleepy baby at birth, irritable and with increased crying for 3 weeks. The three hormones that relieve pain are turned off by the epidural or a cesarean section. Maternal and infant mortality was doubled as a result of cesarean section. After cesarean sections, subsequent pregnancies have types of abnormal attachments of the placenta to the uterus. British physicians recommend normal birth, defined as labor that starts on its own and uses no analgesia, no inductions, no interventions, no epidurals, and no cesarean sections. The doula's presence decreases labor length, significantly decreases cesarean sections, means less use of pain medicine, and gives greater breastfeeding rates.",M1

20107216,"Outcomes after internal versus external tocodynamometry for monitoring <e>labor</e>.BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that internal tocodynamometry, as compared with external monitoring, may provide a more accurate assessment of contractions and thus improve the ability to adjust the dose of oxytocin effectively, resulting in fewer operative deliveries and less fetal distress. However, few data are available to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled trial in six hospitals in The Netherlands to compare internal tocodynamometry with external monitoring of uterine activity in women for whom induced or augmented labor was required. The primary outcome was the rate of operative deliveries, including both cesarean sections and instrumented vaginal deliveries. Secondary outcomes included the use of antibiotics during labor, time from randomization to delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes (defined as any of the following: an Apgar score at 5 minutes of less than 7, umbilical-artery pH of less than 7.05, and neonatal hospital stay of longer than 48 hours). RESULTS: We randomly assigned 1456 women to either internal tocodynamometry (734) or external monitoring (722). The operative-delivery rate was 31.3% in the internal-tocodynamometry group and 29.6% in the external-monitoring group (relative risk with internal monitoring, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.2). Secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. The rate of adverse neonatal outcomes was 14.3% with internal monitoring and 15.0% with external monitoring (relative risk, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.2). No serious adverse events associated with use of the intrauterine pressure catheter were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Internal tocodynamometry during induced or augmented labor, as compared with external monitoring, did not significantly reduce the rate of operative deliveries or of adverse neonatal outcomes.

We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry to study Na, K-ATPase expression in uterine samples from nonlaboring elective and laboring emergency caesarean sections (CSs). Transcripts of alpha1 to 3, beta1 to 3, and FXYD1 isoforms were detected in all samples, but FXYD2 was only present in hysterectomy samples. Abundant immunoreactivity of alpha1 and moderate alpha2 was localized in myometrial smooth muscle and secretory glands of all groups. Smooth muscle and gland epithelia showed diffuse cytoplasmic alpha3 immunoreactivity. beta isoforms were detected in all groups but beta3 showed much denser immunoreactivity in myometrial samples taken from women in <e>labor</e>. In pregnancy, there was a switch in isoform expression, resulting in increased beta3 and decreased FXYD2 at the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels.

20063224,"A randomized trial of increased intravenous hydration in <e>labor</e> when oral fluid is unrestricted.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased intravenous (IV) hydration is associated with decreased labor duration and oxytocin augmentation in nulliparous women when oral fluid is restricted. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of increased IV hydration on the duration of labor when access to oral fluid was unrestricted. METHODS: Term, nulliparous women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies were randomly assigned to receive lactated ringers at 250 ml per hour (IV fluid group) throughout active labor or usual care. All women were allowed unrestricted access to oral fluids. RESULTS: Eighty women completed the study, 37 in the IV fluid group and 43 in the usual care group. There was no difference in the primary outcome of total duration of labor (9.5 versus 9.4 hours) or in the secondary outcomes of duration of the first stage (7.9 versus 8.0 hours), duration of second stage (1.6 versus 1.4 hours), or rate of oxytocin augmentation (51% versus 44%).

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of women with a single prior low transverse cesarean was conducted. LUS thickness was quantified by transabdominal ultrasound with repeated transvaginal measurement when necessary. The thinnest measurement was considered as the dependent variable. Potential related factors were evaluated with nonparametric analyses and multivariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five women were recruited at a mean gestational age of 36.7 +/- 1.3 weeks. The full LUS was thicker in women who had their previous cesarean during the latent phase (2.8 mm; interquartile [IQ], 2.0-3.3 mm) or the active phase of labor (3.1 mm; IQ 2.5-3.9 mm) than in women with previous cesarean prior to labor (2.4 mm; IQ 2.0-3.2 mm). The association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Presence of labor at previous cesarean is associated with a thicker LUS in a subsequent pregnancy.",M1

20032760,"The lived experience of Jordanian women who received family support during <e>labor</e>.PURPOSE: Policies regarding childbirth in Jordan currently exclude attendance by a female relative to provide support. This study was done in order to describe the experience of a group of Jordanian women who had been afforded support from a female relative during a nursing research project. DESIGN AND METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 women at 6 weeks postpartum. All of the women had given birth at the main hospital in the southern region of Jordan. FINDINGS: Women had positive experiences with their female relative support. Four themes were identified as common to the women involved: (1) increased sense of security, (2) provision of physical help, (3) communicating the woman's needs/wishes to her professional caregivers, and (4) emotional support and encouragement. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results show that the support of a female relative was helpful for this small group of Jordanian women experiencing their first labor and birth. Since the literature clearly shows that support in labor is appropriate and produces improved outcomes, public health practitioners in maternal and child health, along with hospitals, should emphasize this as a valuable resource for pregnant women. Non-Western or developing countries could benefit from more fully using evidence currently in the literature on a range of practices, including that of emotional and social support in labor.",M1

Messages about what characteristics are normal (or expected) in childbirth are disseminated in a variety of ways, including popular childbirth education books, but little study of them has been conducted. The purpose of this investigation is to address that gap by examining the discussions about childbirth in the 10 top-selling books in the United States. METHODS: Discourse analysis (relating to the public, personal, and political discussions about a specific phenomenon) was used to study 10 best-selling United States childbirth advice books marketed to childbearing women during the first week of November 2007. RESULTS: Book styles ranged from clinical descriptions of pregnancy and birth primarily offering reassurance, self-help information, and danger signs to more folksy and humorous commentaries. Presentation of scientific evidence to support recommendations was uneven and at times inaccurate. Five focal areas of discourse included body image, <e>labor</e> and birth, pain, power and control, and life preparation for motherhood. CONCLUSIONS: Top-selling books shine an interesting light on the current state of United States maternity practices. Women and health professionals should assess them carefully and engage with each other about their recommendations and implications for childbirth.",M1
20002423,"Men's psychological transition to fatherhood: an analysis of the literature, 1989-2008.BACKGROUND: The most recent review on men's transition to fatherhood was published in 1986. The present paper reports on how the literature has portrayed fatherhood over the past 20 years. The aim was to investigate men's psychological transition to fatherhood from pregnancy of the partner through the infant's first year of life. METHODS: The PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, Ingenta, Ovid, EMBASE, and WoS databases were accessed to conduct a literature search on the topic. The concepts of self-image transformation, triadic relationship development, and social environment influence were used to examine the complexity of the fatherhood transition process. Specific focus was placed on men's intrapsychic relational and social dimensions. RESULTS: Our analysis of the yielded results revealed three specific fatherhood stages: prenatal, <e>labor</e> and birth, and postnatal periods. Partner pregnancy was found to be the most demanding period in terms of psychological reorganization of the self. Labor and birth were the most intensely emotional moments, and the postnatal period was most influenced by environmental factors. The latter was also experienced as being the most interpersonally and intrapersonally challenging in terms of coping with the new reality of being a father. CONCLUSIONS: Men's transition to fatherhood is guided by the social context in which they live and work and by personal characteristics in interplay with the quality of the partner relationship. Men struggle to reconcile their personal and work-related needs with those of their new families.",M1
19997613,"Differing prevalence and diversity of bacterial species in fetal membranes from very preterm and term <e>labor</e>.BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection may play a role in preterm delivery due to spontaneous preterm labor (PTL) and preterm prolonged rupture of membranes (PPROM). Because bacteria previously associated with preterm delivery are often difficult to culture, a molecular biology approach was used to identify bacterial DNA in placenta and fetal membranes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used broad-range 16S rDNA PCR and species-specific, real-time assays to amplify bacterial DNA from fetal membranes and placenta. 74 women were recruited to the following groups: PPROM &lt;32 weeks (n = 26; 11 caesarean); PTL with intact membranes &lt;32 weeks (n = 19; all vaginal birth); indicated preterm delivery &lt;32 weeks (n = 8; all caesarean); term (n = 21; 11 caesarean). 50% (5/10) of term vaginal deliveries were positive for bacterial DNA. However, little spread was observed through tissues and species diversity was restricted. Minimal bacteria were detected in term elective section or indicated preterm deliveries. Bacterial prevalence was significantly increased in samples from PTL with intact membranes [89% (17/19) versus 50% (5/10) in term vaginal delivery p = 0.03] and PPROM (CS) [55% (6/11) versus 0% (0/11) in term elective CS, p = 0.01]. In addition, bacterial spread and diversity was greater in the preterm groups with 68% (13/19) PTL group having 3 or more positive samples and over 60% (12/19) showing two or more bacterial species (versus 20% (2/10) in term vaginal deliveries). Blood monocytes from women with PTL with intact membranes and PPROM who were 16S bacterial positive showed greater level of immune paresis (p = 0.03). A positive PCR result was associated with histological chorioamnionitis in preterm deliveries. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Bacteria are found in both preterm and term fetal membranes. A greater spread and diversity of bacterial species were found in tissues of women who had very preterm births. It is unclear to what extent the greater bacterial prevalence observed in all vaginal delivery groups reflects bacterial contamination or colonization of membranes during labor. Bacteria positive preterm tissues are associated with histological chorioamnionitis and a pronounced maternal immune paresis.",M1
19996953,"Blood pressure, but not cerebrospinal fluid fentanyl concentration, predicts duration of <e>labor</e> analgesia from spinal fentanyl.BACKGROUND: There is a wide variability in dilution of drugs in cerebrospinal fluid after spinal injection, as measured near the site of injection. With local anesthetics, there is a wide variability in speed of onset, which correlates with block duration. The authors tested whether local cerebrospinal fluid drug concentrations and onset time would predict duration of analgesia from spinal fentanyl in laboring women. METHODS: After written informed consent, fentanyl (50 microg) was injected using the combined spinal epidural method in 56 women requesting analgesia for labor. The stylet was reinserted in the spinal needle, and 60 s later, the cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated for fentanyl assay. Time to analgesia and duration of analgesia were recorded, and data were analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: Fifty-two women were included for data analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid fentanyl concentrations were 3.1 +/- 5.9 microg/ml, with a 7-fold range (0.9-5.9 microg/ml). Fentanyl concentration did not correlate with onset, initial sensory level at 5 and 10 min, or duration of analgesia. Decreased diastolic and increased systolic blood pressure and lower parity, but not fentanyl concentrations, correlated with longer labor analgesia. The resultant model was predictive when applied to data from four previous studies of spinal opioid analgesia duration. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, the local concentration of fentanyl in the cerebrospinal fluid 1 min after injection was not correlated with onset or duration of labor analgesia. The unexpected but consistent relationship between blood pressure and combined spinal epidural analgesia duration suggests that resting hemodynamic state affects the distribution and/or clearance of intrathecally administered opioids.",M1
19964460,"Electrohysterographic conduction velocity estimation.Monitoring and analysis of the fetal-heart and the uterine-muscle activity, referred to as electrohysterogram (EHG), is essential to permit timely treatment during pregnancy. While remarkable progress is reported for monitoring of the fetal cardiac activity, the EHG measurement and interpretation remains challenging, and limited knowledge is available on the underlying physiological processes. In particular, little attention has been paid to the analysis of the EHG propagation, whose characteristics might indicate the presence of coordinated uterine contractions leading to intrauterine pressure increase. Therefore, this study focuses for the first time on the noninvasive estimation of the conduction velocity of EHG action potentials by means of multichannel EHG recording and surface high-density electrodes. A maximum likelihood algorithm, initially proposed for skeletal-muscle electromyog-raphy, is modified for the required EHG analysis. The use of clustering and weighting is introduced to deal with poor signal similarity between different channels. The presented methods were evaluated by specific simulations, proving the combination of weighting and clustering to be the most accurate method. A preliminary EHG measurement during <e>labor</e> confirmed the feasibility of the method. An extensive clinical validation will however be necessary to optimize the method and assess the relevance of the EHG conduction velocity for pregnancy monitoring.",M1

Cervical biopsies were taken from 58 women: 20 at preterm labor, 24 at term labor, 10 at term not in labor and 4 from non-pregnant women. Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA expression, and immunohistochemistry and ELISA for protein analysis. HMGB1, RAGE, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins were localized and their mRNA expression was detected in the cervix. There was more extranuclear HMGB1 in the cervical epithelium and stroma in preterm and term labor compared to the term not in labor. TLR2 mRNA expression was upregulated 5-fold in term labor and 3-fold in preterm labor compared to term not in labor and non-pregnant controls. There was lower expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNAs in preterm labor compared to term. Lower mRNA expression of HMGB1 was found in the subgroup with preterm premature rupture of membranes than in the rest of the preterm group, where levels were significantly higher than in term labor. In conclusion, extranuclear expression of HMGB1 during labor suggests a possible role of HMGB1 during the process of cervical ripening. Changes in expression of mRNAs encoding HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 in preterm labor suggest differences in the mechanism of cervical ripening at preterm and term delivery.",M1

METHODS: Fetal oxygen saturation values were compared in term pregnant women who received epidural analgesia (epidural group) with those in women who did not (control group). Mode of delivery, Apgar score, fetal oxygen saturation, cord blood gas analysis and fetal outcomes were also compared. RESULTS: A total of 150 pregnant women (75 in each group) gave written consent and were enrolled. The average fetal oxygen saturation during the first stage of labor (active phase) was 45.6 +/- 8.1% for the epidural group and 45.9 +/- 7.4% for the control group (NS); saturations for the second stage of labor were 44.9 +/- 8.8% and 45.3 +/- 6.7%, respectively (NS). In the epidural group, the duration of the first stage of labor was significantly longer (565 +/- 217 min) than the control group (434 +/- 222 min; P= 0.001). Cesarean delivery rates, neonatal cord blood gas analysis, Apgar scores, and neonatal outcomes were similar in the two groups.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on cord blood gas samplings from 7,617 singleton and cephalic deliveries at &gt; or =37 weeks of gestation. In this population, 450 fetal scalp blood samples (FBS) were performed for abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Microvolume scalp lactate measurements were compared to scalp pH, neonatal cord blood gas parameters (pH, lactate, base deficit) and the Apgar score. RESULTS: Scalp lactate correlated significantly with scalp pH (r = -0.56, p = 0.001), umbilical artery pH (r = -0.39, p = 0.03), umbilical artery lactate (r = 0.48, p = 0.01) and umbilical artery base deficit (r = 0.51, p = 0.01), but not with Apgar scores. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, a scalp lactate cutoff value of 5 mmol/l was the most predictive for neonatal acidosis. Sampling failure with scalp lactate was inferior to scalp pH (1.3 vs. 14%, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Lactate microsampling in fetal scalp blood was found to be an attractive alternative to pH analysis and a useful 2nd-line tool for monitoring fetal asphyxia during labor.",M1
19930280,"Barriers to the use of hydrotherapy in <e>labor</e>.OBJECTIVE: To determine nurses' perceived barriers to the use of hydrotherapy in labor. While effective in relieving pain, reducing anxiety, encouraging relaxation, and promoting a sense of control, hydrotherapy is rarely used during labor. DESIGN: Comparative descriptive survey design. SETTING: A national convention and perinatal listserves. PARTICIPANTS: Intrapartum nurses (N=401) attending a national convention (Association of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, 2007; n=225) and members of perinatal listserves (n=176) were recruited. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed for this study (Nurses' Perception of the Use of Hydrotherapy in Labor). The questionnaire was available in paper format and online. RESULTS: Institutional but not individual characteristics (age, education, and role) were associated with Nurses' Perception of the Use of Hydrotherapy in Labor. Nurses who reported higher epidural rates (r=.45, p=.000) and Cesarean section rates (r=.30, p=.000) reported more barriers. There was no difference in perception of barriers for nurses at hospitals providing different levels of care; there were significant differences when primary care providers were considered. Intrapartum nurses in facilities where certified nurse-midwives do most deliveries reported significantly fewer barriers than nurses who worked in facilities where physicians attended most deliveries (F=6.84, df=2, p=.000). CONCLUSION: The culture of the birthing unit in which nurses provide care influences perception of barriers to the use of hydrotherapy in labor. Providing hydrotherapy requires a supportive environment, adequate nursing policies and staffing, and collaborative relationships among the health care team.",M1
19922998,"Decreased adherence and spontaneous separation of fetal membrane layers--amnion and choriodecidua--a possible part of the normal weakening process.INTRODUCTION: The fetal membrane (FM) layers, amnion and choriodecidua, are frequently noted to have varying degrees of separation following delivery. FM layers normally separate prior to rupture during in vitro biomechanical testing. We hypothesized that the adherence between amnion and choriodecidua decreases prior to delivery resulting in separation of the FM layers and facilitating FM rupture. METHODS: FM from 232 consecutively delivered patients were examined to determine the extent of spontaneous separation of the FM layers at delivery. Percent separation was determined by the weight of separated FM tissue divided by the total FM weight. Separately, the adherence between intact FM layers was determined. FM adherence was tested following term vaginal delivery (13), term unlabored cesarean section (10), and preterm delivery (6). RESULTS: Subjects enrolled in the two studies had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. FM separation was present in 92.1% of membranes. Only 4.3% of FM delivered following spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes (SROM) had no detectable separation. 64.7% of FM had greater than 10% separation. FM from term vaginal deliveries had significantly more separation and were less adherent than FM of term unlabored, elective cesarean section (39.0+/-34.4% vs 22.5+/-30.9%, p=.046 and 0.041+/-0.018N/cm vs 0.048+/-0.019N/cm, p&lt;.005). Preterm FM had less separation and were more adherent than term FM (9.95+/-17.7% vs 37.5+/-34.4% and 0.070+/-0.040N/cm vs 0.044+/-0.020N/cm; both p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Separation of the amnion from choriodecidua at delivery is almost universal. Increased separation is associated with decreased adherence as measured in vitro. Increased separation and decreased adherence are seen both with increasing gestation and with <e>labor</e> suggesting both biochemical and mechanical etiologies. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that FM layer separation is part of the FM weakening process during normal parturition.",M1
19922252,"Effect of acupuncture on induction of <e>labor</e>.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to review the existing scientific evidence on the potential role of acupuncture on induction of labor during pregnancy. DESIGN: The Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), and NCCAM (The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) databases were searched to identify relevant monographs from 1970 to 2008. INCLUSION CRITERIA: These criteria included all available human acupuncture studies on pregnant women carrying a viable fetus due for third trimester induction of labor. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: These criteria included studies not meeting the inclusion criteria, in languages other than English, or animal studies. RESULTS: Ten (10) studies on labor induction were identified. The duration of labor as a result of acupuncture treatment ranged from 10 hours 20 minutes to 29.1 hours. All of the studies demonstrated labor induction by acupuncture treatment. However, because two randomized controlled trials reported that there was no statistically significant effect of acupuncture, these results are more suggestive than definitive. Furthermore, although the relationship between cervical ripening and interleukin-8 (IL-8), prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)), and beta-endorphin is well documented in the literature, there is no evidence to suggest that acupuncture alters these mediators. Serum levels of IL8, beta-endorphin, and PGF(2alpha) were not found to be significantly influenced by acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Although the definitive role of acupuncture in inducing labor is still yet to be established, the existing studies suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial in labor induction. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate this further.",M1
19889381,"MicroRNA expression profiling of the human uterine cervix after term <e>labor</e> and delivery.OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. The objective of this study was to determine the miRNA expression profile of the human uterine cervix after spontaneous term labor (TL). STUDY DESIGN: The miRNA expression pattern of cervical tissue was characterized using microarrays. Samples were collected at term from patients with (n = 8) and without (n = 9) TL. Moderated t tests and false discovery rate correction were applied. Results were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 226 miRNAs were expressed in human cervical tissue. miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c were overexpressed in cervical tissue of patients with TL compared to those without. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays confirmed these findings (miR-223 [fold change {FC} = 5.7], miR-34b [FC = 4.5], miR-34c [FC = 6.2]; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: This is the first report of miRNA expression in the human uterine cervix in pregnancy. Cervical remodeling after TL and delivery was associated with changes in miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c.",M1

19832548,"Does low molecular weight heparin shorten term <e>labor</e>?Dalteparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is given to pregnant women with thrombotic disorders. Clinical observations together with the documented changes of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in normal and protracted labor fostered the idea that LMWH shortens delivery time. Labor time was retrospectively determined among nulliparous pregnant women treated with dalteparin because of previous venous thromboembolism (VTE), thrombophilia or acute VTE during current pregnancy. Their labor time was compared to matched untreated controls. The proportion of instrumental deliveries and neonatal outcome was also compared. The dalteparin-treated group showed a significantly (30%) shorter labor time compared to matched controls. Total instrumental deliveries were the same in the two groups but operative intervention due to protracted labor was significantly less common in dalteparin-treated women. There was no difference in neonatal outcome. Dalteparin most likely shortens parturition time and may decrease the number of operative interventions due to protracted labor.",M1
19801538,"Antioxidant enzyme expression, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation in human myometrium with parturition.Oxygen levels fluctuate considerably during human <e>labor</e> leading to hypoxia and reoxygenation of the uteroplacental unit and in some cases may compromise the progression of labor. Our aim was to assess the possible contribution of oxidative stress to the onset of labor. Thiobarbituric acid was used as a marker of lipid peroxidation along with Western blotting using anti-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to assess protein carbonylation in myometrial samples obtained before and after the onset of term and preterm labor. Levels of key antioxidative enzymes were also compared. Higher levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in myometrial samples obtained during term or preterm labor. Reduced levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were also encountered in these 2 groups. Conversely, protein carbonyl content was higher in laboring term and preterm myometrial samples. Levels of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were unaltered across all 4 groups. Lipids in the laboring myometrium are susceptible to oxidative injury possibly due to diminished protection as a result of lower GSHPx activity. The reason for enhanced protein carbonylation suggests differential mechanisms governing protein turnover in the pregnant compared with the parturient uterus. Localized, oxidant damage of human myometrium may be a causal factor in difficult deliveries.",M1
19778252,"On the relation of oxidative stress in delivery mode in pregnant women; a toxicological concern.The objective was to investigate the effect two modes of <e>labor</e> (vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section) on thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) as markers of lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant power (ferric reducing ability, TAP), and total thiol molecules (TTM) in blood of mothers and their newborns. One hundred and twenty women with normal pregnancy and normal blood biochemical parameters were divided into groups of vaginal delivery (VD) and elective cesarean surgery (ECS). Blood samples were obtained firstly in the time 37-40 weeks of pregnancy and secondly during labor phase for VD or during ECS. Blood samples from umbilical cord arterial of newborns were also obtained at birth after separation of cord. Plasma levels of TBARS, TAP, and TTM were determined. There was no significant differences between VD and ECS mothers before labor in plasma levels of TBARS, TTM, and TAP. Mothers in the VD group showed a significant increase in TBARS (p &lt; 0.05) after delivery. And TTM level showed a significant increase in ECS group (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to pre-delivery levels. Comparing oxidative stress variables between VD and ECS groups after labor, plasma levels of TBARS, and TTM significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in VD mothers. TAP was not significantly different between VD and ECS groups. Newborn of VD mothers showed a significant increase in TBARS (p &lt; 0.05), and TAP (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to newborn of ECS. TTM was not significantly different between two groups of newborns. The results indicate that mothers in VD and their newborns are in more oxidative stress than those who underwent ECS for delivery. Linking oxidative stress to severe neonatal diseases, it may be reasonable to assess whether antioxidant supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the frequency of neonatal diseases.",M1

19751323,"Relations between fetal head descent and cervical dilatation during individual uterine contractions in the active stage of <e>labor</e>.The relationship between instantaneous changes in fetal head station and cervical dilatation within the individual contraction during the active stage of labor were studied and an index of labor progress was suggested. Cervix dilatation and fetal head station were measured continuously in 30 nullipara women (mean age 27.5, standard deviation 4.8). The continuous measurements enabled the analysis of each variable and the analysis of the relations between these two variables. The relationship between the head station and the cervical dilatation were demonstrated by plotting one against the other during a contraction. This led to the definition of a contraction vector that integrates the interaction between the two variables. The angle of this vector, that indicates this relation, was plotted against mean head station to demonstrate change along the delivery process regardless of time to normalize the progress and allow comparison between different women with different labor durations. This plot showed a sharp change from almost zero into a steep curve at about zero head station. A zero angle indicates that the cervix dilates during a contraction with little effect on head station while a steep angle indicates a significant effect of cervical dilatation on head station during the contraction. The contraction-vector angle reflects the changing intra-contraction relationship between head station and cervical dilatation. The angle of this vector may serve as an indicator of labor progress.",M1
19748682,"Placental blood leukocytes are functional and phenotypically different than peripheral leukocytes during human <e>labor</e>.Rupture of the fetal membranes during human labor is associated with an inflammatory process localized to the maternal-fetal interface. There is evidence that specific leukocytes subsets are attracted to the choriodecidua, and that after homing they condition a local inflammatory microenvironment, possibly being directly involved in rupture of the membranes. In this study our aim was to compare the phenotypes and function of leukocytes located in the placental intervillous blood with peripheral leukocytes obtained before or after labor, including expression of modulators of inflammation in these cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the proportion of CD14(+) cells is increased in intervillous blood, suggesting the participation of monocytes/macrophages during labor. Real time qRT-PCR showed that at term gestation and particularly during labor, placental blood leukocytes adopt a different expression pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokines than leukocytes in peripheral blood, including IL-1beta and IL-1RA. During labor, both placental and peripheral leukocytes increase their secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Moreover, we showed that placental leukocytes respond differently than peripheral leukocytes to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, secreting differential amounts of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. Finally, a preliminary proteomic characterization of placental leukocytes revealed a significantly higher number of individual proteins than in peripheral leukocytes. Our results support the existence of selective subsets of leukocytes recruited to the maternal-fetal interface that may participate in the triggering of parturition.",M1

The use of water immersion by women for relaxing during <e>labor</e> is being used worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the controversies surrounding water birth and to find out the interest of Iranian women in this delivery method. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 106 pregnant women were assigned to control and experimental groups. The experimental group underwent the labor and delivery in standardized warm water pools. The control group gave birth by conventional delivery method at the hospital. A questionnaire was completed during the labor for women in both control and experimental groups including the method of delivery; labor length; use of different drugs such as analgesics, opiates, antispasmodic, and oxytocin; use of episiotomy, and newborn's Apgar score and weight. RESULTS: Totally, 53 cases and 53 controls with the mean age of 26.4+/-5.9 and 27.1+/-5.9 years, respectively, completed the study. Women in the control group required oxytocin, antispasmodics, opiates, and analgesics more frequently than those in the experimental group (P&lt;0.001). Meanwhile, the active phase and the third stage of labor were shorter experimental group by 72 and 1.3 minutes, respectively (P&lt;0.004, and P&lt;0.04). All the participants in the experimental group gave birth naturally, whereas only 79.2&lt; of the controls had normal vaginal delivery. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the advantage of water birth delivery. Those who gave water birth experienced less pain and completed the delivery sooner. Meanwhile, normal vaginal delivery was accomplished more frequently with this group.

19687492,"Systematic review: elective induction of <e>labor</e> versus expectant management of pregnancy.BACKGROUND: The rates of induction of labor and elective induction of labor are increasing. Whether elective induction of labor improves outcomes or simply leads to greater complications and health care costs is commonly debated in the literature. PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of elective induction of labor and expectant management of pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (through February 2009), Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through March 2009), bibliographies of included studies, and previous systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Experimental and observational studies of elective induction of labor reported in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors abstracted study design; patient characteristics; quality criteria; and outcomes, including cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal morbidity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 6117 potentially relevant articles, 36 met inclusion criteria: 11 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and 25 observational studies. Overall, expectant management of pregnancy was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of cesarean delivery than was elective induction of labor (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.39]; absolute risk difference, 1.9 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 3.7 percentage points]) in 9 RCTs. Women at or beyond 41 completed weeks of gestation who were managed expectantly had a higher risk for cesarean delivery (OR, 1.21 [CI, 1.01 to 1.46]), but this difference was not statistically significant in women at less than 41 completed weeks of gestation (OR, 1.73 [CI, 0.67 to 4.5]). Women who were expectantly managed were more likely to have meconium-stained amniotic fluid than those who were electively induced (OR, 2.04 [CI, 1.34 to 3.09]). Limitations: There were no recent RCTs of elective induction of labor at less than 41 weeks of gestation. The 2 studies conducted at less than 41 weeks of gestation were of poor quality and were not generalizable to current practice. CONCLUSION: RCTs suggest that elective induction of labor at 41 weeks of gestation and beyond is associated with a decreased risk for cesarean delivery and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. There are concerns about the translation of these findings into actual practice; thus, future studies should examine elective induction of labor in settings where most obstetric care is provided.",M1
19671907,"Rates of and factors associated with delivery-related perinatal death among term infants in Scotland.CONTEXT: Rates of obstetric intervention in <e>labor</e>, including cesarean delivery, have increased significantly in most developed countries. It is, however, unclear if this has been paralleled by decreased rates of perinatal and neonatal death associated with complications of labor at term. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether rates of perinatal death at term, either during labor or in the neonatal period, have changed in Scotland during the last 20 years and whether this was associated with a reduction in deaths ascribed to intrapartum anoxia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, retrospective cohort study of linked data from a registry of births (Scottish Morbidity Record 02) and a registry of perinatal deaths (Scottish Stillbirth and Infant Death Survey) between 1988 and 2007. Participants included all births of a singleton infant in a cephalic presentation at term (N = 1,012,266), excluding those with perinatal death due to congenital anomaly or antepartum stillbirth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Delivery-related perinatal death, defined as intrapartum stillbirth or neonatal death unrelated to congenital abnormality. These events were also subdivided into those events ascribed to intrapartum anoxia and all other causes. The risk of death was modeled using logistic regression and analyses were adjusted for maternal age, height, parity, socioeconomic deprivation status, gestational age, birth weight percentile, fetal sex, onset of labor, and the annual number of births per hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, the risk of delivery-related perinatal death decreased from 8.8 to 5.5 per 10,000 births (unadjusted change, -38%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -51% to -21%). When analyzed by the cause of death, there was a significant decrease in the risk of death ascribed to intrapartum anoxia (5.7 to 3.0 per 10,000 births; unadjusted change, -48%; 95% CI, -62% to -29%), but no significant change in the risk of death ascribed to other causes. When deaths ascribed to intrapartum anoxia were analyzed by the time of death in relation to delivery, the reduction was similar comparing intrapartum stillbirths (2.6 to 1.1 per 10,000 births; unadjusted change, -60%; 95% CI, -75% to -34%) and neonatal deaths (3.1 to 1.9 per 10,000 births; unadjusted change, -38%; 95% CI, -59% to -7%). Adjustment for maternal, fetal, and obstetric factors was without material effect. CONCLUSION: Rates of intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal death at term decreased in Scotland between 1988 and 2007. This decrease was only significant for deaths ascribed to intrapartum anoxia.",M1

METHOD: We randomly assigned 160 nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy at term who needed induction of labor to one of 3 treatments: 50 mg of meperidine (n=53), 16 mg of valethamate bromide (n=53), or a normal saline solution as placebo (n=54). All medications were given by slow intravenous infusion. Labor duration was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: The intervals between infusion and complete cervical dilation and between infusion and delivery were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01) in the meperidine group (103.0+/-64.5 minutes and 119.8+/-70.2 minutes), in contrast to the placebo group (173.9+/-74.8 minutes and 192.2+/-82.8 minutes). However, differences were not significant between the 2 treatment groups (139.6+/-63.1 minutes and 160.6+/-71.9 minutes), or between the valethamate bromide and the placebo group.

STUDY DESIGN: Fetal membranes obtained from women between 38-42 weeks of gestation, after (1) vaginal delivery with spontaneous labor and (2) prelabor elective cesarean section (no labor), were assayed for catechol-O-methyltransferase expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. Prostaglandin E(2) secretion from amnion and choriodecidua explants treated with or without catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis. RESULTS: Amnion layer of fetal membranes from laboring women expressed significantly higher levels of catechol-O-methyltransferase, compared with those from women with no labor. Catechol-O-methyltransferase was higher in the amnion layer than in choriodecidua. Selective catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition significantly decreased prostaglandin E(2) production from fetal membranes. CONCLUSION: Labor increases catechol-O-methyltransferase expression in the amnion of human fetal membranes. Selective catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition decreased prostaglandin E(2) secretion in fetal explant cultures, suggesting a role for catechol-O-methyltransferase in human labor and delivery.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively studied patients who requested first-trimester biochemical screening for Down syndrome. RESULTS: Among the 1037 women who were enrolled, 152 women (14.7%) had a low first-trimester PAPP-A value, and 855 women (85.3%) had a normal first-trimester PAPP-A value. Excluding elective CS, 19 of 117 women (16.2%) with low PAPP-A values vs 59 of 749 women (7.9%) with normal PAPP-A values underwent CS for concerning fetal status during labor (P = .003; odds ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-3.97). This difference remained significant after correction for possible confounders (hypertension, preterm delivery, small for gestational age, labor induction). Among these 78 women, umbilical artery pH was significantly lower in fetuses from mothers with low vs normal PAPP-A values (pH = 7.19 [range, 6.95-7.39] vs pH = 7.26 [range, 7.02-7.39]; P = .022). CONCLUSION: Low PAPP-A levels at first-trimester screening are associated independently with higher rates of emergency CS for nonreassuring fetal status during labor and lower pH.",M1

We first review the functional anatomy of the female pelvic floor, the normal loads acting on the pelvic floor in activities of daily living, and the functional capacity of the pelvic floor muscles. Computer models show that the stretch ratio in the pelvic floor muscles can reach an extraordinary 3.26 by the end of the second stage of <e>labor</e>.

STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 468 patients in the following groups: (1) women in the mid-trimester of pregnancy (14-18 weeks) who underwent amniocentesis for genetic indications and delivered a normal neonate at term (n = 52); (2) normal pregnant women at term with (n = 49) and without (n = 41) spontaneous labor; (3) patients with an episode of PTL and intact membranes who were classified into: (a) PTL who delivered at term (n = 149); (b) PTL who delivered preterm (&lt;37 weeks gestation) without IAI (n = 108); and (c) PTL with IAI (n = 69). Adiponectin concentration in AF was determined by ELISA. RESULTS: (1) The median AF adiponectin concentration at term was significantly higher than in the mid-trimester (35.6 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 26.4-52.7 vs. 29.9 ng/ml, IQR 19.9-35.2; p = 0.01); (2) among women with PTL and intact membranes, the median AF adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in patients with IAI than in those without IAI who delivered either at term (54.3 ng/ml, 39.0-91.8 vs. 50.1 ng/ml, 33.2-72.8; p = 0.02) or preterm (47.6 ng/ml, 32.6-74.6; p = 0.01); and (3) among women at term, there was no significant difference in the median AF adiponectin concentration between those with and without labor (33.7 ng/ml, IQR 21.7-53.9 vs. 35.6 ng/ml, IQR 26.4-52.7; respectively p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Adiponectin is a physiologic constituent of AF; and (2) adiponectin concentrations in AF are increased significantly with advancing gestation and in the presence of IAI. Collectively, these findings suggest that adiponectin plays a dynamic role in normal gestation and in the presence of IAI.",M1
19588432,"Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal Group B streptococcal colonization.BACKGROUND: Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal infection by vertical transmission. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during <e>labor</e> has been associated with a reduction in early onset GBS disease (EOGBSD). However, treating all colonized women during labor exposes a large number of women and infants to possible adverse effects without benefit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of IAP for maternal GBS colonization on neonatal: 1) all cause mortality and 2) morbidity from proven and probable EOGBSD, late onset GBS disease (LOD), maternal infectious outcomes and allergic reactions to antibiotics. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials assessing the impact of maternal IAP on neonatal GBS infections were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (involving 852 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The risk of bias was high. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I(2) 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups.One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce EOGBSD, but this result may well be a result of bias as we found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution. There is lack of evidence from well designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce neonatal EOGBSD.Ideally the effectiveness of IAP to reduce neonatal GBS infections should be studied in adequately sized double-blind controlled trials. The opportunity to conduct such trials has likely been lost, as practice guidelines (albeit without good evidence) have been introduced in many jurisdictions.",M1

METHODS: As part of a cluster randomized trial of labor ward-based prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Lusaka, Zambia, we determined predictors of testing acceptance and nevirapine (NVP) administration in labor. HIV counseling and testing were offered to women unaware of their HIV status. NVP was administered to women who tested positive, and an inert (calcium) tablet was provided to women who tested negative, to avoid stigmatization. RESULTS: Among the 2435 women who presented in labor, 393 (16%) were unaware of their HIV status, of whom 278 (71%) met eligibility criteria. We offered counseling to 217 (78%) of eligible women: 146 (67%) agreed, 82 (56%) of those counseled were tested for HIV, and 23 (28%) were seropositive. Testing rates were higher among primigravida women [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 2.1] and among those not offered HIV testing during their pregnancy (AOR 3.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 5.1). Cervical dilation &lt;or=3 cm at the time of admission was associated strongly with NVP ingestion &gt;1 hour (AOR 11.5; 95% CI: 4.5 to 29.2) and &gt;2 hours (AOR 11.4; 95% CI: 4.7 to 27.5) before delivery. CONCLUSION: Labor ward HIV testing is feasible in this resource-limited setting.",M1
19562561,"Association between aerobic fitness in late pregnancy and duration of <e>labor</e> in nulliparous women.It is established that the level of physical activity in the population generally is too low, and data indicate that pregnant women are no exception. Studies of the effects of aerobic fitness on delivery outcomes are limited. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of aerobic fitness on duration of labor in nulliparous women who started labor spontaneously. Maximal oxygen uptake was measured in 40 nulliparous women at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Duration of labor was defined as the time between 3 cm cervical dilation with regular uterine contractions and delivery. The mean (SD) maximal oxygen uptake was 2.1 (0.3) L/min and duration of labor 583 (317) minutes. Duration of labor was inversely associated with maximal oxygen uptake after adjusting for birthweight (p = 0.034). We conclude that measurement of maximal oxygen uptake is safe in pregnancy at 35-37 weeks and that increased aerobic fitness was associated with shorter labor in nulliparous women who started labor spontaneously.",M1
19549792,"Detection of EETs and HETE-generating cytochrome P-450 enzymes and the effects of their metabolites on myometrial and vascular function.Cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzymes of the CYP2 and -4 family in humans metabolize arachidonic acid to generate bioactive epoxyeicosatrienenoic acids (EETs) and hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acids (HETEs). We report significantly higher levels of CYP 2J2 protein expression following the onset of <e>labor</e> (n = 6, P &lt; 0.05), implying increased EET-generating capacity within the uterus. Myometrial relaxation to 8,9-EET and 5,6-EET was observed, with the latter being inhibited by preincubation with 1 muM paxilline and is supported by whole cell recordings showing a modest effect of 5,6-EET on myometrial outward-current density (n = 4, P &lt; 0.05). Only 5,6-EET of the EETs tested affected vascular reactivity (n = 6). Both 12- and 20-HETE (n = 5-6) caused vasoconstriction of partially depolarized blood vessels, with glibenclamide (n = 5) enhancing the effect of 12-HETE alone. Our findings signify a role for CYP2C9/19, -2J2, and -4A11/22 in late pregnancy, possibly related to the synthesis of lipid metabolites and downstream effects on vascular remodeling in the term pregnant uterus. The presence of CYP4A11/22 and their resultant procontractile metabolites could argue either a role in the control and initiation of labor and/or modification of the vascular delivery system to influence blood flow to the laboring uterus. The differential effects of the EETs and HETEs in the pregnant human uterus identify the CYP pathway as a novel modulator of myometrial and vascular physiology during late pregnancy.",M1

The retrospective, descriptive analysis included documented nursing events for 900 Labor and Delivery patients at three hospitals over the 2-month period of January and February 2006. Two models were used to produce quantified measurements of nursing care received by each patient. The first model considered only the hourly census of nurses and patients. The second model considered the size of nurses' patient loads as represented by computerized nurse-entered documentation. Significant relationships were identified between durations of labor and nursing care scores generated by the second model. In addition to the clinical associations identified, the study demonstrated an approach with global application for representing the amount of nursing care received at the individual patient level in analyses of patient outcomes.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in labor unit of Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, India, between October 2003 and September 2004. Women were randomized to receive AI (group I) and not to receive it (group II). RESULTS: A total of 150 women (75 in each group) were included in the study. There was significant relief of variable decelerations in group I and no difference in overall cesarean section rate but significant reduction in cesarean section rate for fetal distress in group I, and significant reduction in cesarean section rate for fetal distress in nulliparous women of group I. Neonatal acidemia was also significantly reduced in the nulliparous women receiving AI. The duration of maternal postpartum hospital stay was significantly reduced in group I. There were no adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: AI was a beneficial therapeutic intervention in women patients showing fetal distress in first stage of labor, and it reduced cesarean section for fetal distress and neonatal acidemia.",M1

19512882,"Success of spinal and epidural <e>labor</e> analgesia: comparison of loss of resistance technique using air versus saline in combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia technique.BACKGROUND: Comparison of air versus saline for loss of resistance technique (LORT) in combined spinal epidural labor analgesia (CSE) has not been evaluated, and neither has the relation between CSE characteristics (the presence/absence of initial spontaneous clear fluid return or upon aspiration) and spinal/epidural analgesia outcomes. The authors hypothesized that there is no difference in the spinal analgesia success or epidural catheter efficacy between using air versus saline LORT for CSE. METHODS: A total of 360 patients were randomized to air or saline LORT for CSE. Primary outcome was spinal analgesia success as defined by verbal pain score of no more than 3 at 15 min after spinal dose administration. Secondary outcomes were CSE characteristics, catheter replacement, and average hourly epidural drug consumption. RESULTS: Results from 345 patients were analyzed. Spinal analgesia success, epidural catheter replacement, and drug consumption were not different between using air or saline LORT and were also independent of the presence/absence of fluid return on aspiration if initial spontaneous fluid returned to the spinal needle. However, epidural catheters inserted in absence of initial fluid return had a significantly higher catheter replacement rate (28.6%) than the 4.1% among those with initial fluid return (P &lt; 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal analgesia success rate and epidural efficacy are independent of whether air or saline is used for LORT during CSE. Practice of aspiration for fluid after observing initial fluid return may be unnecessary because this practice does not alter spinal/epidural analgesia outcomes. However, epidural catheters inserted with the absence of initial fluid returned to spinal needle may pose a high failure risk.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1279 deliveries, 197 women had at least one fetal scalp pH measurement. Using the CTG-Player, STVs were calculated from the electronically saved cardiotocography (CTG) traces and related to the fetal scalp pH measurements. RESULTS: There was no correlation between STV and fetal scalp pH measurements (r=-0.0592). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal STV is an important parameter with high sensitivity for antenatal fetal acidosis. This study shows that STV calculations do not correlate with fetal scalp pH measurements during labor, hence are not helpful in identifying fetal acidosis.",M1
19492913,"Inappropriate use of vancomycin for preventing perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease in laboring patients.OBJECTIVE: The 2002 CDC guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcus (GBS) stipulate that vancomycin is reserved for penicillin-allergic women at high risk for beta-lactam anaphylaxis with resistance to clindamycin or erythromycin. Our objective was to evaluate practitioner adherence to these guidelines. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to <e>labor</e> and delivery who received vancomycin for GBS prophylaxis from January 1st, 2005 to June 1st, 2007. Identification and documentation of allergic reactions to beta lactams and performance of GBS sensitivities at the time of screening were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients reporting a penicillin allergy received vancomycin during labor. In 71 patients screened at 35-37 weeks, sensitivities were not performed for 55 patients, of which 10 reported an anaphylactic-like reaction to penicillin. Of 15 patients who had sensitivities performed at the time of screening and were resistant to clindamycin and/or erythromycin, only two patients, however, described an anaphylactic-like reaction to penicillin. Fourteen patients received vancomycin due to an unknown GBS status at &lt;35 weeks of gestation and only three patients from this group reported an anaphylactic-like reaction to penicillin. There were deviations from the CDC protocol in 82 (94%) of 87 patients who received intrapartum vancomycin there were deviations in the CDC protocol. CONCLUSION: Most patients receiving intrapartum vancomycin for perinatal GBS prophylaxis either did not have a culture with sensitivities performed at the time of GBS screening due to a history of anaphylactic-like reactions to penicillin or received vancomycin for a mild or unknown allergy. Physician adherence to the CDC guidelines with regards to the use of vancomycin is far from optimal.",M1

We made simple but radical modifications to a hospital labor room, which included the removal of the standard hospital bed and the addition of equipment to promote relaxation, mobility, and calm. We designed a pilot study, the objectives of which were to test the feasibility of a randomized trial and the acceptability of the modified labor room to women and their care providers. METHODS: Women were assessed and invited to participate just before their admission to the labor and delivery suite. Sixty-two women at two Toronto teaching hospitals were randomly allocated to either the standard labor room or the  ambient room.  Data about labor and birth events were abstracted from the medical records. Participants and their nurses and physicians completed questionnaires to elicit their views of their experiences with the labor rooms. RESULTS: Women's and practitioners' evaluations of the ambient room were generally very positive. Nineteen women (65.5%) in the ambient group, compared with 4 (13.3%) in the standard group, reported spending 50 percent or less of their hospital labor in the standard labor bed. Twelve women allocated to the ambient room had artificial oxytocin infusions, compared with 21 allocated to the standard room (X (2) = 4.73, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ambient labor room should be evaluated in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial.",M1

METHODS: 360 nulliparous parturients were randomized according to cervix dilation. Latent group (cervix dilation &lt; 3 cm) received 0.1% ropivacaine with 0.5 microg/ml sufentanil and active group (cervix dilation &gt; or = 3 cm) receive 0.15% ropivacaine with 0.5 microg/ml sufentanil, both followed by an infusion of 0.1% ropivacaine with 0.5 microg/ml sufentanil through PCEA. The PCEA pump was programmed to infuse a 6 ml bolus with a lockout interval of 15-20 min. The following were recorded: (1) pain intensity evaluated using VAS (0-10), (2) motor block assessed using modified Bromage scale, (3) onset of analgesia after epidural injection, (4) fetal heart rate, (5) maternal vital signs, (6) apgar score, (7) labor process, (8) mode of delivery and (9) the total amount of analgesic consumed. RESULTS: Both groups provided good analgesia. Early administration of epidural analgesia did not prolong the duration of first and second stage of labor. However, group L had a significant higher caesarean section rate and a significant lower instrumental delivery rate than group A. The reasons of cesarean section in both groups were arrested active phase and fetal distress. The reasons of instrumental delivery in both groups were fetal distress. The neonates had good outcome in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with epidural analgesia in active phase of labor, early administration of epidural analgesia in latent phase did not prolong labor, however, the caesarean section rate was increased and instrumental delivery rate was decreased.",M1

The regulating mechanisms of progesterone synthesis and the mechanism responsible for the spontaneous onset of <e>labor</e> in women are still not fully understood. Progesterone is thought to have been involved in human parturition. The objective of this study was to compare the levels of progesterone in the human placentas, at the end of the gestation (37-41 weeks) in vaginal versus cesarean deliveries, and to evaluate the pattern of progesterone accumulation, instantly following its synthesis by the human placenta at the end of the pregnancy. METHODS: Progesterone levels in human placental tissue were determined by immunochemiluminescent analysis, following tissue homogenization. Progesterone secretion and accumulation pattern in the placental tissue was demonstrated using the ex vivo, closed, dual perfusion system of isolated human placental cotyledon. RESULTS: Immunochemiluminescent analysis of progesterone levels in human normal and cesarean-delivered placentas showed that placentas following normal vaginal delivery store higher concentrations of progesterone, and produce progesterone more intensively. Results obtained from 120-min perfusions (of vaginal and cesarean-delivered placentas) showed that progesterone tended to accumulate in the maternal rather than the fetal compartment. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that progesterone levels continuously rise till the end of pregnancy, with no apparent drop in progesterone levels during the labor process. In addition, progesterone is released from the syncytiotrophoblast preferably into the maternal component of the placental tissue.",M1

METHODS: Participants were 18,865 primiparous women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Data about obstetric outcomes were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Pelvic floor muscle training was categorized as less than once per week, one to two times per week, and at least three times per week both before and during pregnancy. The results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of women who performed pelvic floor muscle training less than once per week, 7.2% sustained a third-degree or fourth-degree laceration compared with 6.3% of women who performed pelvic floor muscle training at least three times per week. A similar pattern was present for rates of episiotomy (29.1% compared with 24.9%), vacuum/forceps delivery (15.9% compared with 15.0%), and acute cesarean delivery (9.5% compared with 7.5%). Adjusting for factors that might be associated with pelvic floor muscle training and the outcomes under study did not distort the effect of pelvic floor muscle training. Exercising at least three times per week was not associated with third-degree and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, episiotomy, vacuum/forceps delivery, or acute cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.60-1.24], 0.82 [0.67-1.01], 0.95 [0.74-1.22], and 0.75 [0.53-1.05], respectively).

OBJECTIVES: Estimates of average hourly, annual, and lifetime economic productivity, both market and household, were calculated in 2007 US dollars for 5-year age groups for men, women, and both sexes in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data from the American Time Use Survey were used to estimate hours of paid work and household services and hourly and annual earnings and household productivity. Present values of discounted lifetime earnings were calculated for each age group using the 2004 US life tables and a discount rate of 3% per year and assuming future productivity growth of 1% per year. SUBJECTS: The estimates of hours and productivity were calculated using the time diaries of 72,922 persons included in the American Time Use Survey for the years 2003 to 2007. RESULTS: The present value of lifetime productivity is approximately $1.2 million in 2007 dollars for children under 5 years of age. For adults in their 20s and 30s, it is approximately $1.6 million and then it declines with increasing age. Productivity estimates are higher for males than for females, more for market productivity than for total productivity.

METHODS: Longitudinal study of 5,914 births that took place in the city of Pelotas, Southern Brazil, in 1982. Data was collected by means of questionnaires applied on young adults when accompanying the 1982 cohort in 2004-5. Information was gathered concerning educational level and insertion in the <e>labor</e> market. Poisson Regression was utilized to study the effect of demographic and socioeconomic variables, as well as birth weight and maternal breastfeeding, on the outcomes. RESULTS: On the average, these young adults had 9.4 (+/- 3.1) years of schooling and 42% of them were attending school in 2004-5. One in five young adults had entered a university and approximately two thirds were working during the month prior to the interview. Entry in the university was determined by economic conditions. Furthermore, women's birth weight and breastfeeding among men influenced this outcome. Insertion in the labor market was more frequent among the poorer men, but this did not affect women's outcomes in this respect. CONCLUSIONS: The low inclusion in the university and the need to enter the labor market among the poor families maintains a vicious circle that reproduces the dominant social hierarchy.",M2

METHODS: Participants with inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis were interviewed at 4 time points, 18 months apart, using a structured questionnaire. At baseline (T1), all participants (n = 490; 381 women, 109 men) were employed. At T2, T3, and T4, the sample decreased to 413, 372, and 349 participants, respectively. Respondents were recruited using community advertising and from rheumatology and rehabilitation clinics. Work transitions considered were productivity losses (absenteeism, job disruptions), work changes (reduced hours, changing jobs), and leaving employment. Also measured were demographic, illness, work context, and psychological variables. Generalized estimation equations modeled predictors of work transitions over time. RESULTS: Although 63.1% of respondents remained employed throughout the study, work transitions were common (reported by 76.5% of participants). Productivity losses, especially job disruptions such as being unable to take on extra work, were the most frequently reported. Work transitions were related to subsequently making other work transitions, including leaving employment. Age, sex, education, activity limitations, control, depression, and arthritis-work spillover were also associated with work transitions. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on a process of diverse employment changes that may occur in the lives of many individuals with arthritis. It emphasizes the interrelationships among work transitions, as well as other factors in predicting work transitions, and it provides insight into work changes that may signal impending difficulties with remaining employed.",M2

This is why preventive strategies over the lifespan turned more important for meeting today's challenges and increasingly those of tomorrow. As refers to innovation and markets, longevity creates numberless opportunities especially in terms of new products and markets. On the other hand, the term  productive ageing  has been widely used for defining the increasing trend towards a life style in an ageing society.

Of particular concern is cancer's effect on productivity and work ability, which in turn is important for persons' financial situation, life satisfaction, and social relationships. We explored the extent to which Norwegian cancer survivors stay affiliated to working life compared to the cancer-free population, and quantified cancer-associated earning declines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Logistic regression models were estimated to explore the impact of cancer on employment using register data covering the entire Norwegian population in 2001, 567,000 men and 549,300 women 40-59 years old, of whom 34,000 were diagnosed with cancer. These analyses revealed that a cancer diagnosis was strongly associated with not being employed. Log-linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of cancer on <e>labor</e> earnings in 2001 for those employed. Cancer was associated with a 12% decline in earnings overall. Leukemia, lymphomas, lung, brain, bone, colorectal, and head-and-neck cancer resulted in the largest reductions in employment and earnings. Earning declines were strongly associated with educational level. In addition, linear regression models were used to estimate differentials in earnings before and after cancer. These results accorded well with those from cross-sectional models. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors are less likely to be employed than the cancer-free population, and undertake modifications in their employment, e.g. reduce work-hours or hold lower-wage jobs, which result in reduced earnings. A social class gradient is present and must be addressed to accommodate appropriate intervention from welfare societies.",M2
18545093,"Working overtime is associated with anxiety and depression: the Hordaland Health Study.OBJECTIVE: To examine whether long work hours are associated with increased levels and prevalences of anxiety and depression. METHODS: Overtime workers (n = 1350) were compared with a reference group of 9092 workers not working overtime regarding anxiety and depression by means of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Self-reported information on various work-related factors, demographics, lifestyle, and somatic health was included. RESULTS: Overtime workers of both genders had significantly higher anxiety and depression levels and higher prevalences of anxiety and depressive disorders compared with those working normal hours. Findings suggest a dose-response relationship between work hours and anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Working overtime is associated with increased levels of anxiety and depression. The working groups differed significantly regarding several factors including income and heavy manual <e>labor</e>.",M2
18534353,"John Stuart Mill, innate differences, and the regulation of reproduction.In this paper, we show that the question of the relative importance of innate characteristics and institutional arrangements in explaining human difference was vehemently contested in Britain during the first half of the nineteenth century. Thus Sir Francis Galton's work of the 1860s should be seen as an intervention in a pre-existing controversy. The central figure in these earlier debates-as well as many later ones-was the philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill. In Mill's view, human nature was fundamentally shaped by history and culture, factors that accounted for most mental and behavioral differences between men and women and among people of different classes, nationalities, and races. Indeed, Mill's whole program of social reform depended on the assumption that human differences were not fixed by nature. To identify the leading figures in these disputes about difference and the concrete context in which they occurred, we explore three debates in which Mill played a key role: over the capacities and rights of women, the viability of peasant proprietorship in India and Ireland, and the status of black <e>labor</e> in Jamaica. The last two draw our attention to the important colonial context of the nature-nurture debate. We also show that ideas that for us seem of a piece were not always linked for these earlier thinkers, nor did views on innateness necessarily have the political correlates that we now take for granted.",M2
18383414,"Impact of ankylosing spondylitis on work and family life: comparisons with the US population.OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) on work disability, nonparticipation in the <e>labor</e> force, marriage, divorce, and childbearing. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, we asked AS patients (n = 591, 72.8% men, mean age 48.9 years) from the Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco, and Washington, DC metropolitan areas about work and family life. The proportion of patients who were work disabled, did not participate in the labor force, had never been married, were divorced, or had a biological child were compared with the proportions expected for each outcome based on data from population surveys. RESULTS: Patients with AS were more likely to be work disabled (13.3% versus 5.7%; P &lt; 0.0001) and somewhat more likely to not participate in the labor force compared with the proportion expected (25.1% versus 21.8%; P = 0.07). These associations were stronger among patients age &gt; or =45 years and those with AS for &gt; or =20 years. AS patients were more likely than expected to have never been married (22.8% versus 15.4%; P &lt; 0.0001) or to be divorced (13.2% versus 10.0%; P = 0.02). Women with AS were less likely than expected to have had children (54.7% versus 64.9%; P = 0.02), but the proportion of men with AS who had children was not different from that of the general population. CONCLUSION: Patients with AS in this study were more likely to have never been married, more likely to be divorced, and more than twice as likely to be work disabled than members of the general population. Women with AS were also less likely to have had children than women in the general population.",M2

Patients were surveyed regarding clinical outcome and activity level, and were queried about actual participation in 40 different athletic activities. One thousand two hundred six patients (74%) responded at a mean of 5.7 years after arthroplasty. Average age at TKA was 67 years. Average University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity level rating was 7.1. Satisfaction with activity level was 91%.

18006129,"Is sleep really for sissies? Understanding the role of work in insomnia in the US.This study explores the role of work in patient narratives about their experiences with insomnia.  Work  includes such facets as the nature of one's occupation, the associated volume or amount of work required, mental demands related to work, work schedules and work-related stress. Interviews conducted with 24 patients aged between 22 and 74 receiving treatment for insomnia at one of two sleep medicine clinics in Oregon and Texas, USA, suggest that work is a pivotal influence in shaping interpretations of the nature of insomnia, its causes, and the efficacy of medical treatment. Results suggest correlations between sleeplessness and modern working lifestyles in American culture, in which <e>labor</e> seems to transcend the physical workplace, manifesting itself in the form of cognitive labor or continued problems into retirement. Patients often cite work as the primary causal agent in the development of their insomnia, their primary reason for needing  good  sleep, their impetus for seeking medical attention, and behavioral compliance with a medically prescribed regimen. Insomnia as an illness experience thus serves as a mechanism through which respondents consciously or unconsciously comment on the nature of work in their lives. The medical and social implications of these results are discussed.",M2
17929638,"Working potential evaluation in the territory of an oil-and-gas complex development in Siberia.Health estimation as the main component of the quality of working potential (WP) of Natives was studied in the territory of an oil-and-gas development complex. Social-medical and epidemiological methods were used on potential adult and teenaged workers in the northern territory of the Irkutsk region. The realization of an adventurous and active strategy of personnel policy is discussed. The adaptation of temporary workers from central regions to unfavorable social, climatic and occupational factors is difficult. It may lead to the appearance of psychosomatic diseases and a decreased capacity for work. The attraction of Natives' WP is connected with the expenses for conversion training and the development of a social infrastructure. The estimation of risks of main pathological syndromes has shown a low share in basically healthy persons among the adults and teenagers (27.5% and 44.4%). In adults, the most frequent risks were of neurological infringements, arterial hypertension and cordial ischemia, in teenagers it was for disorders of the gastro-intestinal systems, boundary mental frustration, and neurological infringements. For development resources of the Irkutsk region, the realization of a program of social and economic development as part of a region's overall development is necessary.

17905359,"Making another world possible: the Torah, Louis Kelso, and the problem of poverty.Why is it that after centuries of concerted efforts to eliminate it, and decades of unprecedented economic growth that should have accomplished it, poverty not only is still with us but actually is increasing? Starting with a passage in the Old Testament, the source of moral behavior for believers of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, this author argues that the postulation of the <e>labor</e> theory of value and scarcity by Adam Smith, and accepted as part of the basic framework of the discipline of economics, has prevented us from formulating public policies that would enable us to implement the way the God of the Abrahamic faiths intended the poor to be cared for.

17475283,"When does division of <e>labor</e> lead to increased system output?This paper develops a set of simplified dynamical models with which to explore the conditions under which division of labor leads to optimized system output, as measured by the rate of production of a given product. We consider two models: in the first model, we consider the flow of some resource into a compartment, and the conversion of this resource into some product. In the second model, we consider the growth of autoreplicating systems. In this case, we divide the replication and metabolic tasks among different agents. The general features that emerge from our models is that division of labor is favored when the resource to agent ratio is at intermediate values, and when the time cost associated with transporting intermediate products is small compared to characteristic process times. The results of our model are consistent with the behavior of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discodeum, which switches from a single-celled to a multi-celled state when resources become limited. We also argue that division of labor in the context of our replication model suggests an evolutionary basis for the emergence of the stem-cell-based tissue architecture in complex organisms. Finally, the results of this paper may be useful for understanding how, in an economic context, firm productivity is maximized at intermediate firm sizes.",M2

16835050,"Organophosphate pesticide exposure and work in pome fruit: evidence for the take-home pesticide pathway.Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are commonly used in the United States, and farmworkers are at risk for chronic exposure. Using a sample of 218 farmworkers in 24 communities and <e>labor</e> camps in eastern Washington State, we examined the association between agricultural crop and OP pesticide metabolite concentrations in urine samples of adult farmworkers and their children and OP pesticide residues in house and vehicle dust samples. Commonly reported crops were apples (71.6%), cherries (59.6%), pears (37.2%), grapes (27.1%), hops (22.9%), and peaches (12.4%). Crops were grouped into two main categories: pome fruits (apples and pears) and non-pome fruits. Farmworkers who worked in the pome fruits had significantly higher concentrations of dimethyl pesticide metabolites in their urine and elevated azinphos-methyl concentrations in their homes and vehicles than workers who did not work in these crops. Among pome-fruit workers, those who worked in both apples and pears had higher urinary metabolites concentrations and pesticide residue concentrations in dust than did those who worked in a single pome fruit. Children living in households with pome-fruit workers were found to have higher concentrations of urinary dimethyl metabolites than did children of non-pome-fruit workers. Adult urinary concentrations showed significant correlations with both the vehicle and house-dust azinphos-methyl concentrations, and child urinary concentrations were correlated significantly with adult urinary concentrations and with the house-dust azinphos-methyl concentration. The results provide support for the take-home pathway of pesticide exposure and show an association between measures of pesticide exposure and the number of pome-fruit crops worked by farmworkers.",M2
16541738,"Structure of safety climates and its effects on workers' attitudes and work safety at Japanese construction work sites.In this study, the nature of safety climates at construction work sites and workers' safety attitudes was ascertained, and the effect of safety climates on workers' safety attitudes and work site safety was examined. A self-rating questionnaire prepared for this study was delivered to 300 employees who were working at construction sites and 300 foremen of affiliated companies. Eight factors were extracted for the safety climate of work sites. Similarly, by factor analysis, eight factors were obtained from workers' safety attitudes, including four factors representing positive aspects of safety attitudes and four negative safety attitudes. The scores of negative safety attitudes in companies with fewer <e>labor</e> accidents were smaller than those in companies with more accidents. Negative safety attitudes were affected by safety climate more than positive ones, and this tendency was more remarkable for foremen than employees. These results suggest the importance of promoting safety climates for raising workers' safety attitudes and work site safety by diminishing negative safety attitudes.",M2
16249536,"The impact of diabetes on employment and work productivity.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the effect of diabetes on <e>labor</e> market outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using secondary data from the first two waves (1992 and 1994) of the Health and Retirement Study, we identified 7,055 employed respondents (51-61 years of age), 490 of whom reported having diabetes in wave 1. We estimated the effect of diabetes in wave 1 on the probability of working in wave 2 using probit regression. For those working in wave 2, we modeled the relationships between diabetic status in wave 1 and the change in hours worked and work-loss days using ordinary least-squares regressions and modeled the presence of health-related work limitations using probit regression. All models control for health status and job characteristics and are estimated separately by sex. RESULTS: Among individuals with diabetes, the absolute probability of working was 4.4 percentage points less for women and 7.1 percentage points less for men relative to that of their counterparts without diabetes. Change in weekly hours worked was not statistically significantly associated with diabetes. Women with diabetes had 2 more work-loss days per year compared with women without diabetes. Compared with individuals without diabetes, men and women with diabetes were 5.4 and 6 percentage points (absolute increase), respectively, more likely to have work limitations. CONCLUSIONS: This article provides evidence that diabetes affects patients, employers, and society not only by reducing employment but also by contributing to work loss and health-related work limitations for those who remain employed.",M2

Anderson and Charles Weijer take the wage payment model proposed by Neil Dickert and Christine Grady and extend the analogy of research participation to unskilled wage <e>labor</e> to include just working conditions. Although noble in its intentions, this moral extension generates unsavory outcomes. Most notably, Anderson and Weijer distinguish between two types of research subjects: occasional and professional.

The problem is that meaningful work can itself be a form of inducement, and consequently, may in fact increase the incidence of inducement contrary to the intentions of the wage payment model.",M2
16175329,"The impact of diagnosis and treatment of rectal cancer on paid and unpaid <e>labor</e>.PURPOSE: This study was designed to describe the consequences of diagnosis and treatment of rectal cancer for paid and unpaid labor over time and to identify sociodemographic-related factors, treatment-related factors, and quality of life-related factors associated with paid and unpaid labor. METHODS: Data were assessed prospectively in two samples of patients with primary rectal cancer, participating in a multicenter clinical trial, who were randomized to receive surgery with or without 5 x 5-Gy preoperative radiotherapy. For paid labor, 292 patients who indicated paid labor before treatment filled out quality of life questionnaires, which included questions on paid labor at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. For unpaid labor, another sample of 92 patients also filled out the Health and Labor questionnaire, which included questions on unpaid labor, before treatment, and at 3 and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: From 3 to 18 months after surgery, paid labor resumption increased from 19 to 63 percent (P &lt; 0.001). At 24 months after surgery, paid labor resumption was 61 percent. In a multivariate analysis, age older than 55 years (P &lt;or= 0.001), lower education level (P &lt;or= 0.003), shorter time since surgery (P &lt; 0.001), preoperative radiotherapy (P = 0.02), lower valuation of overall health (P &lt; 0.01), more physical symptom distress (P &lt; 0.001), and more limitations in daily activities (P &lt; 0.001) were all associated with less or later resumption of paid labor. The average amount of unpaid labor increased from 17.3 hours per week at 3 months to 21 hours per week at 12 months after surgery. In a multivariate analysis, only shorter time since surgery (P = 0.03) and male gender (P &lt; 0.001) were related to less unpaid labor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and treatment of rectal cancer affect paid and unpaid labor. The impact on paid labor is most pronounced. Multiple other sociodemographic and quality of life-related variables also were associated with paid labor. Patient information and decision making on preoperative radiotherapy should include the effects on paid labor, and interventions focused on promoting paid labor participation in patients with rectal cancer should be tailored to the specific characteristics and needs of those patients.",M2
16045938,"Influence of caste polyethism on longevity of workers in social insect colonies.Different patterns of division of <e>labor</e> can affect the expected longevity of social insects workers. It has been earlier suggested that when tasks performed inside and outside colony are equally risky then the expected longevity of workers in colonies with caste polyethism is greater than that in colonies without polyethism. To verify these predictions I used a model assuming two sets of tasks, associated with different mortality rates. In the colony without polyethism the workers preformed safe and risky tasks in turn, while in the colony with caste polyethism the workers specialized in only one set of tasks. The outcomes suggest that the expected longevity of workers in colonies with caste polyethism cannot be greater than that in colonies without polyethism. Only if there is no aging and under some special and rare conditions are there no differences in expected longevity between colonies with and without caste polyethism. If aging is independent of activity, caste polyethism does not shorten longevity when all tasks in the colony are equally risky. The results can explain why caste polyethism is not as widespread among social insects as age polyethism.",M2

A broader definition that incorporates non-economic as well as economic measures may better describe their participation in the <e>labor</e> force and the meanings they ascribe to these activities. Because productive activity has been linked to successful aging, it is important to understand how elders perceive work. Twenty-six community-residing older adults were interviewed over a two-year period. Participants were mostly female and represented diverse cultural, religious and educational backgrounds. All these individuals participated in some activities they perceived as work. Three themes emerged as describing their attributions of meaning or importance to productive activities: contribution to self-concept, giving back to community, and staying engaged. Findings suggest that the productive activities of older adults contribute to quality of life for them and have implications for society as well.",M2
15450708,"A review of empirical studies on the model of effort-reward imbalance at work: reducing occupational stress by implementing a new theory.The present study reviews empirical studies of a new occupational stress model of effort-reward imbalance at work to examine its validity as an occupational stress measure and the theory-based intervention approach to occupational stress reduction. The effort-reward imbalance model is valid for demonstrating a stressful work environment that reflects the current <e>labor</e> market and predicts health conditions among a wide range of working populations. The stressful aspects of work measured by the effort-reward imbalance model are different from those shown in the job demand-control model, and the adverse health effects are independent of each other, which suggests that the two models are complementary. The evidence indicates that it is efficient to select psychosomatic symptoms as short-range target outcomes and sick leave as a medium-range target outcome of the theory-based intervention. In addition, it would be preferable to simultaneously measure job satisfaction, morale, motivation, and performance as organizational level outcomes. Although employees engaged in diverse occupations can be target populations, high effectiveness is expected, particularly in service occupations that work shifts. Studies are necessary to determine how long and how intensely interventions are implemented. Target work environments are selected from the perspective of securing or improving employees' sense of fairness and reciprocity by approaching them. Since the theory-based intervention depends largely on organizational changes that are beyond the individual employees' ability, the cooperation of employers is necessary.",M2
15449635,"Costs and benefits of influenza vaccination and work productivity in a Colombian company from the employer's perspective.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of an employee influenza vaccination campaign, measured in terms of health and economic benefits. METHODS: Colombian bank employees volunteered to take part in this prospective observational study involving two groups: vaccinated and nonvaccinated. Socioeconomic and health status information, including influenza-like symptoms, sick leave, and postvaccination adverse events, were collected via questionnaires. Cost-benefit analyses were performed to determine whether the employer would save money overall by paying for the vaccination program. RESULTS: Between October 2000 and May 2001, 424 vaccinated subjects and 335 nonvaccinated subjects volunteered to join the study. Cumulative incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) was lower among vaccinated (14.6%) than nonvaccinated subjects (39.4%). Fever was the most common ILI symptom (93% of all reported ILI). Absence rates because of ILI were similar in the two groups (2.59%-2.69%). Assuming that employees with ILI who continue to work have reduced effectiveness (30%-70% of normal) the employer can save 6.4 US dollars to 25.8 US dollars per vaccinated employee based on <e>labor</e> costs alone. This saving increases to 89.3 US dollars to 237.8 US dollars when operating income is also considered. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the vaccination program will be cost saving for vaccination coverage above 20% and ILI rates above 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Among the studied volunteers, ILI has significant impact on work productivity in terms of indirect costs. Implementing an influenza vaccination program would reduce the burden of ILI and save substantial amounts of money for the company.",M2
15315243,"Children's work: the less-considered childhood occupation.Children's work has largely been overlooked by researchers of many disciplines due to sociohistorical trends that fostered the notion that childhood should be a time free of work. Likewise, it has received little attention in occupational therapy most likely due to the influence of these historical developments on occupational therapy rhetoric and values. This paper begins by describing the influence of child <e>labor</e> laws and reformation on children's participation in work. Next, using a comprehensive review of the literature gathered from social sciences, a critical examination of the historical and current research on children's work is provided. This synthesis is framed in concepts of occupational science analyzing the evidence that describes the nature, form, function, and meaning of children's work. For occupational therapists working with children with disabilities, this research provides beginning guidelines for occupation-based work interventions and typical expectations for nondisabled children that may be applied using clinical reasoning to populations with disabilities.",M2

We demonstrate how constructions of masculine identity organize the experience of embodied social suffering among workers who are rendered vulnerable by the structural conditions of undocumented immigrant status. Theoretical concepts from critical medical anthropology and gender studies extend the scholarly analysis of structural violence beyond the primarily economic to uncover how it is embodied at the intimate level as a gendered experience of personal and familial crisis, involving love, respect, betrayal and patriarchal failure. A clinical ethnographic focus on socially structured patriarchal suffering elucidates the causal relationship between macro-forces and individual action with a fuller appreciation of the impact of culture and everyday lived experience.",M2
15171842,"[Gender, paid work, domestic chores and health in Spain]The present study reviews gender-related differences and inequalities in paid work and domestic chores in Spain. The impact of both types of work on health are analyzed and the main policies of the European Union (EU) and Spain to achieve gender equality at work are described. In Spain, fewer women are in paid work than in other EU countries. The <e>labor</e> market displays horizontal segregation (men and women work in different sectors), as well as vertical segregation (men hold more senior positions), leading to gender-related differences in employment conditions and exposure to occupational hazards. The precariousness of work is significantly higher in women (19% unemployment in women versus 9% in men) and women are more likely than men to have temporary contracts. Men are more frequently exposed to physical risks and suffer a greater number of occupational accidents; women, especially manual workers, are more frequently exposed to psychosocial risks. Most domestic chores continue to be performed by women, even by working women, which negatively affects their health. The EU has made an increase in female employment a priority, which means that from 2000-2010 Spain should create 3 million jobs for women and implement work/family policies. Achieving gender equality at work requires employment policies that would guarantee equal opportunities for both sexes, as well as shared responsibility for domestic chores between men and women. In Spain, moreover, there is an urgent need to significantly increase public childcare facilities and resources for the care of other dependent individuals.",M2
15068101,"Emotional <e>labor</e>: relevant theory for occupational health practice in post-industrial America.The occupational experience of workers in service-oriented jobs can have profound effects on their health and well being, such as burnout, inauthenticity, and job dissatisfaction. The growing service economy and resultant proliferation of service-oriented jobs in current times and in the future must be acknowledged and investigated. The move from an economy driven by manufacturing industries to one dominated by service industries has taken place and currently prevails in the United States. In recognizing this shift in the  work  experience of the American work force, the changing nature of work related hazards must also be considered. Emotional labor has come to be known as an appreciable aspect of work involving direct interactions with clients and customers that can lead to adverse psychosocial outcomes. These relationships reveal the potential unpleasantness of service employment in which the performance of emotional labor is unavoidable. Although worker attributes can influence the emotional experience on the job, emotional labor is also likely to threaten the well being of workers through significantly high demands to express organizationally desired emotions and low control over what emotions can be felt and displayed. Recognition and investigation of emotional labor is necessary to understand its effects on worker populations. Conceptual models featuring emotional labor are available to guide research. However, discrimination among them based on utility and application in relation to identified study objectives and needs is essential.",M2

Data were collected from April to August 2000 through semi-structured interviews. The results revealed that work is valued by all families as a source of health and financial resources, besides being important for individuals' character formation; that most CRI patients do not carry out any remunerated activities and, when they do, they count on the help and understanding of the boss and relatives. We conclude that CRI and its treatment do not directly or absolutely impede the realization of this kind of activity, but entail important limitations. We consider it is necessary for health professionals to join in the search for support by relatives and society, so that these people can be inserted in the <e>labor</e> market when they want to and are in the right conditions.",M2
14974873,"A review of self-report instruments measuring health-related work productivity: a patient-reported outcomes perspective.Health impairment often leads to work impairment in the form of both absenteeism and presenteeism (i.e. reduced productivity while at work). Several self-report productivity instruments have been designed over the past few years to measure the impact of illness on productivity at work and/or in non-work activities. In a review of the literature we identified six generic subjective instruments - the Endicott Work Productivity Scale, Health and <e>Labor</e> Questionnaire, Health and Work Questionnaire, Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) - that could theoretically be used in any working population. These instruments were usually validated against other subjective measures (such as health-related QOL). Each productivity instrument has benefits in certain research settings, but the psychometric properties of the WPAI have been assessed most extensively. It was the most frequently used instrument and has also been modified to measure productivity reductions associated with specific diseases (e.g. allergic rhinitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, chronic hand dermatitis). The WLQ has also been tested extensively to measure the general health impact and impact of specific conditions. Two migraine-specific subjective instruments were also identified: the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire and the Migraine Work and Productivity Loss Questionnaire, of which the latter was found to have better psychometric properties. Productivity outcomes are useful in that they characterise the impact of an illness in the workplace and show the effect of treatment on productivity. Evidence of psychometric properties and generalisability of different instruments was found to a varying degree. Thus, further research is needed to assess the accuracy and usefulness of individual instruments in certain research settings. Health-related productivity has been increasingly recognised as an important component of the burden of illness associated with a given disease; without it, one cannot reliably assess this burden.",M2

Recipe design and diet planning for a space mission should therefore incorporate the time required to prepare the recipes as a critical factor. In this study, videotape analysis of an experienced chef was used to develop a database of recipe preparation time. The measurements were highly consistent among different measurement teams. Data analysis revealed a wide variation between the active times of different recipes, underscoring the need for optimization of diet planning. Potential uses of the database developed in this study are discussed and illustrated in this work.",M2

12820192,"Issues of work intensity, pace, and sustainability in relation to work context and nutritional status.This article raises issues about work intensity, pace, and sustainability during physical activity, focusing attention on the nature of work in <e>labor</e>-intensive societies, the management of exertion in habitual tasks, and the health and broad socioeconomic correlates of alternative ways to regulate work patterns. At the heart of this review are concerns to document human adaptability (in terms of the physical and behavioral management of heavy work) and to renew debate regarding the conceptualization and measurement of work intensity (variously evaluated in absolute or relative terms, as indexed by oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, percentage maximal work capacity, heart rate elevation, time and motion indicators, or physiological cost). Three questions are examined: Is heavy work primarily a matter of time or energy intensity? How is heavy work habitually sustained? What is the bigger picture relating work performance to work context and to nutritional or health status? It is argued that many arduous activities, such as carrying loads, demand endurance over time rather than intensive effort per unit time, and that work pace management lies in regulating both the rate of work and the time in rest during physical activity. Furthermore, strategies that maximize long-term endurance (adopted by  tortoises ) and those that maximize short-term productivity (adopted by  hares ) are appropriate to different work contexts (e.g., a subsistence or wage-labor economy) and suit individuals with different health status and ability. Thus, work intensity is an important aspect of the links between physical activity, health, productivity, and society, as noted in literature reviewing objectives for sustainable development and public health messages for disease risk management. These areas of scholarship are underresearched, partly because consensus has been slow in agreeing on which are the best measures of work pace and work intensity for use in field situations, and which are the most meaningful thresholds for evaluating absolute or relative effort across a range of populations.",M2

The social behavior of insects is a result of complex interactions at different levels of biological organization. Genes give rise to proteins and peptides that build the nervous and muscular systems, regulate their own synthesis, interact with each other, and affect the behavior of individuals. Social behavior emerges from the complex interactions of individuals that are themselves far removed from the direct effects of the genes. In order to understand how social organization evolves, we must understand the mechanisms that link the different levels of organization. In this review, we discuss how behavior is influenced by genes and the neural system and how social behavior emerges from the behavioral activities of individuals. We show how different levels of organization share common features and are linked through common mechanisms. We focus on the behavior of the honey bee, the best studied of all social insects.",M2

It is estimated that more than 23 million of them are economically active, including 642,000 persons in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the workplace, HIV/AIDS reduces incomes, imposes added costs on companies, and undermines fundamental labor laws due to the discrimination and rejection that infected individuals suffer. In response, the International Labor Organization (ILO) has produced a document entitled An ILO code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work, which is summarized in this piece. The ILO document aims to help those in the workplace to cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic through a set of guidelines related to: (a) preventing infection, (b) managing and reducing the impact that HIV/AIDS has on the workplace, (c) delivering care and support for infected workers and, in general, to all the people affected by this epidemic, and (d) eliminating discrimination against persons who are infected or are suspected of being infected. The ILO Code is intended to help in preparing and adopting specific measures in the workplace, thus promoting dialogue and other forms of cooperation among the government, employers, workers and their representatives, workplace health and safety officers, HIV/AIDS specialists, and other interested parties. The intention is also for the Code recommendations to be implemented and integrated with national laws, policies, and programs; company or business agreements; and workplace policies and action plans. This ILO Code is an important step in the struggle against HIV/AIDS. Aimed at governments, employers, and workers throughout the world, the Code recommendations constitute a useful tool in addressing the problem of HIV/AIDS in the workplace, in a just manner.

National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Units Network.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively determine the relationship between occupational fatigue and spontaneous preterm delivery segregated into the etiologically distinct categories of spontaneous preterm <e>labor</e>, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and indicated preterm delivery. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 2929 women with singleton pregnancies at 22 to 24 weeks' gestation were enrolled in a multicenter (10 sites) Preterm Prediction Study. Patients reported the number of hours worked per week and answered specific questions designed to determine the following 5 sources of occupational fatigue described by Mamelle et al: posture, work with industrial machines, physical exertion, mental stress, and environmental stress. Fatigue was quantified (0-5 index) according to the number of these sources positively reported. Simple and Mantel-Haenszel chi2 tests were used to test the univariate association and hypothesis of a linear trend between sources of occupational fatigue and spontaneous preterm delivery. Covariables were considered by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Women who did not work outside the home were considered separately from those who worked but did not report any sources of occupational fatigue. RESULTS: Each source of occupational fatigue was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes among nulliparous women but not among multiparous women. The risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes increased (P = .002) with an increasing number of sources of occupational fatigue-not working outside the home, 2.1%; working but not reporting fatigue, 3.7%; working with 1 source of fatigue, 3.2%; working with 2 sources of fatigue, 5.2%; working with 3 sources of fatigue, 5.1%; and working with 4 or 5 sources of fatigue, 7.4%. There was also a significant relationship (P = .01) between preterm premature rupture of membranes and an increasing number of hours worked per week among nulliparous women. Neither spontaneous preterm labor nor indicated preterm delivery was significantly associated with occupational fatigue among either nulliparous or multiparous women. CONCLUSION: The occupational fatigue index of Mamelle et al discriminated a group of nulliparous women at increased risk for preterm premature rupture of membranes. The relationship between preterm premature rupture of membranes and occupational fatigue or hours worked may provide guidelines according to which nulliparous women and their employers can be advised.",M2

11116674,"An approach to human work systems development under the circumstances of an aging society and international business operations.At least three serious aspects of problems exist as obstacles for the national economy in Japan to grow or even to maintain its present level: the lack of natural resources, the trends of a decreasing young <e>labor</e> force, and an increase in the shift of domestic business operations to foreign countries. Although top managers make the decisions of product or service planning, or both, work systems designers are also responsible for conserving the resources. An action against the decrease of the young work force is needed to maintain work systems in an operable condition. The business shifts to foreign countries affect all the people, who are losing job opportunities. The present paper presents an approach to reorienting human work systems within the scope of the work systems designers' roles under the circumstance of these social environments. The following discussion is based on the assumptions that work organizations be productive for themselves and the world, effective and efficient for themselves, and contributive to their communities and the world.

The actual pattern of the odds ratios suggests a modifying effect of gender in the association between employment status and CMD. However, the interaction term added to the final model was statistically significant for informal work, but not for unemployment. The results of the present study suggest that the experience of informal work may be different for men and women.

METHODS: Activities reported in an elderly sample stratified for age and gender (N = 485, Age: 70-103 years) were aggregated into three classes: regenerative, productive, and consumptive activities and regressed on income, presence of a partner in the household, education, walking mobility, and <e>labor</e> force participation. RESULTS: Levels in productive and consumptive activities were decreased in the old-old. Moreover, young-old women spent more time working in the household than any other group. Most of the age- and gender-related variance in activity levels could be explained by differences in available resources. For men, living with a partner was associated with less time spent for productive activities and enhanced leisure time, whereas for women, the reverse was observed. The expected reduction of unpaid work time as a function of income (income effect) was not observed. DISCUSSION: Elderly individuals do contribute to societal production.

A cross-cultural comparative method was used which controls for the statistical effects of similarity due to common ancestry (Galton's problem). Cross-cultural variation in sexual dimorphism in stature is negatively associated with women's contribution to subsistence. Women are taller, relative to men, in societies where women contribute more to food production. This may be because female nutritional status is better in these societies.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of patients with back pain in whom chronic back problems develop after a follow-up of 7 years, to compare health outcomes and <e>labor</e> force participation of patients with and without chronic back problems and to identify determinants of chronicity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The incidence and prevalence of back pain are very high. A large proportion of the costs related to medical consumption, absence from work, and disability are probably caused by chronic back problems. It is unknown what proportion of back problems become chronic, especially after a long follow-up period, and which factors can predict chronicity. METHODS: Data on the course of the symptoms and medical consumption from the period between 1987-1988 and 1991 were gathered retrospectively. Data on several health outcomes, including LFP, and data on some work characteristics were collected prospectively in 1991. A more extensive data set on health outcomes including psychologic status and working situation was collected in 1994. RESULTS: Chronic back problems developed in 28% of the patients. These patients reported more pain, higher levels of medical resource consumption, worse health outcomes, and lower labor force participation. Episodes of back pain before 1987-1988, severe pain in 1991, and disability score in 1991 were positively associated with chronicity in 1994, difficulties with job performance in 1991, and frequent stooping in the subgroup of patients who held a paying job in the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Even after a follow-up of 7 years, the proportion of people with chronic back problems was high. The consequences for quality of life, labor force participation, and consumption of medical resources are clear. Further research is necessary to examine determinants and ways to prevent chronicity.",M2

Most beneficiaries began working without attributing this decision to an improvement in their health. Individuals pursued different methods of job search. No single approach emerged as the most successful. Job search modes did not vary for different groups and different jobs. Four activities were most likely to lead to job offers: persons checking where they had worked before, asking a friend, answering an ad, and following up a vocational rehabilitation lead. These findings were not conclusive because small numbers of persons engaged in these activities. Thirty percent of DI workers returned to their preentitlement employer. The beneficiaries' first postentitlement jobs had less exertion, fewer hours, and lower pay than did their job held prior to award. The likelihood of working was the same across a broad range of disabling health conditions. In terms of work return policy, formal work return programs aimed at young beneficiaries and those with higher levels of educational attainment would produce the greatest number of job placements. It appears that no targeting of programs is necessary along gender lines. The anomalous finding of an absence of the relationship between improvement in health and labor-force reentry requires further investigation. Any followup in this area of inquiry should plan to have the data collected close to the time of postentitlement job entry.",M2

Participants were assigned to small groups based on occupational status. Groups met for five weekly 3-hr sessions in didactic or small- and large-group formats. Two evaluations following the didactic session and the small and large group sessions elicited information on satisfaction with each of the formats, self-reported change in stress, awareness of interpersonal and sociopolitical issues affecting Black women in the <e>labor</e> force, assessing support networks, and usefulness of specific discussion topics to stress reduction. Results indicated the usefulness of the small- and large-group formats in reduction of self-reported stress and increases in personal and professional sources of support. Discussions on race and sex discrimination in the workplace were effective in overall stress reduction. The study highlights labor force participation as a potential source of stress for Black women, and supports the development of culture- and gender-appropriate community interventions as viable and cost-effective methods for stress reduction.",M2

A comprehensive measure of women's combined work and family experiences across the adult life course was created. Employing data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation, we applied multinomial logistic regression techniques to examine the association between work-family experiences and later life labor supply. Our findings generally support an attachment hypothesis, showing that women who were the most work-oriented throughout the life course were more likely than women who experienced family-related spells of nonlabor-market activity to participate in the labor force, either full-time or part-time, later in life.",M2

Specific attention is directed at how shifts in the retirement life cycle are related to LFPRs. Based on Current Population Survey data for the 1970s, a life table modeling approach showed that LFPRs are relatively weak indicators of the work-to-retirement transition. This was demonstrated by the relative stability in older men's age profiles of LFPRs despite significant changes in the timing and  organization  of the work-to-retirement transition. The 1970s evidenced a contraction of the main career and the expansion of both post-retirement work activity and retirement, yet none of these changes substantially altered the age profiles of older men's labor force participation rates.",M2
8128666,"<e>Labor</e> and cost in AIDS family caregiving.When the costs of care for persons with AIDS are calculated, the assumption is made that the care provided by the family or other social support network members is a social and not also an economic contribution. This article challenges the flawed assumption of  free  care, focuses on the labor and economic dimensions of family home care, and presents a calculation of the dollar value of this care for persons with AIDS (PWAs). The sample consisted of 53 persons, each of whom identified themselves as the primary caregiver for a PWA. Study findings revealed caregiver estimates of 5 hours a week of housework performed specifically for the PWA. Caregivers spent an average of 8.5 hours a day performing personal care tasks for the PWA. The three most common activities were providing companionship, running errands, and performing food/meal-related activities. Gender comparisons revealed that women performed more hours of housework than men but that both provided similar types of personal care for similar numbers of hours. Using a market valuation method, the value of a day's caregiving work was estimated to be $43.78. The annual value of unpaid care, including housework, for one PWA was calculated to be $25,857.88. These data document a significant economic contribution by families and friends caring for PWAs. This subsidy must be included as part of the policy and planning work essential to addressing the AIDS epidemic.",M2
8200881,"Comparison of effects of breast-feeding practices on birth-spacing in three societies: nomadic Turkana, Gainj, and Quechua.Variation in the duration and pattern of breast-feeding contributes significantly to inter-population differences in fertility. In this paper, measures of suckling frequency and intensity are used to compare the effects of breast-feeding practices on the duration of lactational amenorrhoea, and on the length of the birth interval in three prospective studies undertaken during the 1980s, among Quechua Indians of Peru, Turkana nomads of Kenya, and Gainj of Papua New Guinea. In all three societies, lactation is prolonged well into the second year postpartum, and frequent, on-demand breast-feeding is the norm. However, the duration of lactational amenorrhoea and the length of birth intervals vary considerably. Breast-feeding patterns among Gainj and Turkana are similar, but Turkana women resume menses some 3 months earlier than do the Gainj. The average birth interval among the Gainj exceeds that of nomadic Turkana by over 15 months. Suckling activity decreases significantly with increasing age of nurslings among both Gainj and Quechua, but not among Turkana. Earlier resumption of menses among Turkana women may be linked to the unpredictable demands of the pastoral system, which increase day-to-day variation in the number of periods of on-demand breast-feeding, although not in suckling patterns. This effect is independent of the age of infants. The short birth intervals of Turkana women, relative to those of the Gainj, may be related to early supplementation of Turkana nurslings with butterfat and animals' milk, which reduces energetic demands on lactating women at risk of negative energy balance.Between July 1989 and late February 1990. an anthropologist observed breast feeding patterns of 24 mother-infant pairs of the nomadic Ngisonyoka Turkana in Kenya to determine suckling frequency and intensity and their effect on the duration of lactational amenorrhea and the length of the birth interval.  She compared her results with those of studies of the Gainj of Papua New Guinea and of the Quechua Indians of Peru, studies which used the same unite of analysis as the Turkana study.  Prolonged lactation and frequent, on-demand ruled in each group. Turkana infants suckled all day and night, with each nursing period being 1-2 minutes long and with 10-15 minutes between each period.  The Gainj also had prolonged lactation and similar nursing sessions.  On the other hand, the Quechua clumped their breast feeding sessions, which were longer than those of both the Turkana and the Gainj.  Turkana birth intervals were shorter than those of Gainj (29 vs. 44.3 months). Turkana women also had a higher fertility rate than did the Gainj (6.5 vs. 4 live births).  Suckling activity fell considerably as age increased for Gainj and Quechua infants, but not for Turkana infants. Early introduction of butterfat from goats' and camels' milk during the first few weeks after birth and the daily difference in amount of suckling during the lactational period due to variable maternal work schedules (based on the <e>labor</e> demand of the pastoral system of the Turkana) reduced the effect of age.  In conclusion, differences in the length and pattern of breast feeding practices account for much of the interpopulation variation in fertility.",M2

Advocates of reform initially built a rationale for protective legislation primarily from informal, lay observations of the broad developmental outcomes of premature employment. In this endeavor, they projected a dismal scenario of impending national deterioration. This argument received strong criticism for the inadequacy of its corroborating evidence. In response, Progressive reformers emphasized the specific, measurable consequences of particular occupations. Increasingly, liberal advocates of the exclusion of boys and girls from the work force drew upon statistical compilations of occupational injuries and illnesses diagnosed by physicians. Despite their turn toward scientism, Progressives remained somewhat ambivalent about the sufficiency of quantitative data alone to achieve their aims.",M2

1496119,"Women's workload and its impact on their health and nutritional status.This paper highlights various issues in relation to the workload of women in developing countries and its impact on health and nutritional status. The determining factors in women's workload and work-time and the methods employed for assessment are described. The drawbacks of the methods used and the resulting inconsistencies in the data are reviewed. How women are subjected to different health stresses owing to their productive and reproductive roles has been examined under three categories of work: economic, domestic and agricultural. The interaction of women's workload and health is complex and multifactorial owing to variations in the environment and socio-economic conditions within developing countries. There is a critical need to re-examine the assumptions existing about women's workload in programmes aimed at reducing work-time and workload of women in developing countries.The methodology of a variety of studies assessing the impact of women;s workload on their health and nutrition is critically reviewed.  The following aspects of women's work have been assessed:  1) energy cost and duration of activities of women combined with energy expenditure and energy intake, 2) energy cost of activities and energy expenditure and 3) duration of activities.  Women are subjected to different health stresses from economic, domestic, and agricultural work.  Energy expenditure or the metabolic rate of resting and the duration of activities often has been measured by indirect calorimetry using either Douglas Bag or Kofirany Michaelis respirometer or Max-Planck respirometer.  Measurement methods of energy intake have varied vis-a-vis female farmers, carpet weavers, or pregnant and lactating mothers.  Data collection on food and energy intake occurred via 1) weighing and recording food intake in surveys and 2) food intake by the 24-hour recall questionnaire method.  In parts of East Africa, women work 16 hours a day.  In a Tanzanian village, women work 11 hours during the nonfarming season and almost 14 hours during the farming season.  Women contribute more than 40% of agricultural <e>labor</e> in 52 developing countries and more than 50% in 24 of them.  In Gambia, the energy intake of pregnant and lactating women varied from 1250 kcal/day to 1489 kcal/day in the wet season to 1680 kcal/day during the dry season.  The energy intake of pregnant female farmers in rural Tanzania was markedly less than their energy expenditure.  Low energy intakes among female farmers which led to weight loss were observed during the rainy season of heavy agricultural work.  In Kenya, 709% of all trips for water collection are made by females over 15 years old as compared to 25% by males in the corresponding age group.  On a global basis, 42% of the female population over age 15 is  in the labor force, and these women comprise more than a third of the total labor force.  It is crucial to re-examine the assumptions about women's workload in programs that seek to reduce the work-time and workload of women in developing countries.",M2

The percentage of patients returning to work was the highest during the first and third years posttreatment. This was attributed to extension of temporary invalidity period and rehabilitation of group 2 invalids, respectively.

On the basis of the results, the authors established that with the major share of the examined labourers (nine percent of them) it was impossible to carry out the exercises because of contraindication, and in the case of 46 percent the exercises had to be interrupted because of occurring of certain symptoms and exhaustion. The physical performance was unfavourably affected by the fact that the relative majority of the examined persons are overweight, and the lungs function, especially the MVV-value does not reach the predicted level. Only 32 percent has the optimal body weight, while 20-26 percent is overweight. The MVV-value is under the predicted level in the case of 67-76 percent. The estimated relative aerobe capacity reached 84-86 percent of the predicted value with those whose physical performance is moderate. The authors evaluated the accomplished examinations individually as well and summarized them in records of examination. The records were distributed among the factory medical consultants who applied them effectively in the health provision of the examined persons.",M2
1861048,"Gender, time use, and health.One of the continuing paradoxes facing social epidemiologists concerns sex differences in morbidity and mortality. Although women live longer than men, they apparently get sick more. We hypothesize that women's higher morbidity levels result from less paid work and lower wages combined with more hours spent in household <e>labor</e>, child care, and helping others, and fewer hours of leisure and sleep. Men and women hold different social roles; men hold most of the highly rewarding roles. We operationalize social roles as time commitments to various role-related activities. This approach provides interval-level measures such as time spent in caring for children instead of simple dichotomies such as parent/nonparent. We find that when gender differences in social roles are controlled, being male is associated with poorer health than being female. We conclude that if gender roles were more equal, women would experience better health than men, more consistent with their greater longevity.",M2
