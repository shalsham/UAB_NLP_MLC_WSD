20465854,"Effect of neck strength training on health-related quality of life in females with chronic neck pain: a randomized controlled 1-year follow-up study.BACKGROUND: Chronic neck pain is a common condition associated not only with a decrease in neck muscle strength, but also with decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While neck strength training has been shown to be effective in improving neck muscle strength and reducing neck pain, HRQoL among patients with neck pain has been reported as an outcome in only two short-term exercise intervention studies. Thus, reports on the influence of a long-term neck strength training intervention on HRQoL among patients with chronic neck pain have been lacking. This study reports the effect of one-year neck strength training on HRQoL in females with chronic neck pain. METHODS: One hundred eighty female office workers, 25 to 53 years of age, with chronic neck pain were randomized to a strength training group (STG, n = 60), endurance training group (ETG, n = 60) or control group (CG, n = 60). The STG performed high-intensity isometric neck strengthening <e>exercises</e> with an elastic band while the ETG performed lighter dynamic neck muscle training. The CG received a single session of guidance on stretching exercises. HRQoL was assessed using the generic 15D questionnaire at baseline and after 12 months. Statistical comparisons among the groups were performed using bootstrap-type analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline values as covariates. Effect sizes were calculated using the Cohen method for paired samples. RESULTS: Training led to statistically significant improvement in the 15D total scores for both training groups, whereas no changes occurred for the control group (P = 0.012, between groups). The STG improved significantly in five of 15 dimensions, while the ETG improved significantly in two dimensions. Effect size (and 95% confidence intervals) for the 15D total score was 0.39 (0.13 to 0.72) for the STG, 0.37 (0.08 to 0.67) for the ETG, and -0.06 (-0.25 to 0.15) for the CG. CONCLUSIONS: One year of either strength or endurance training seemed to moderately enhance the HRQoL. Neck and upper body training can be recommended to improve HRQoL of females with neck pain if they are motivated for long-term regular exercise.

20464755,"Balance training (proprioceptive training) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of falls due to impairments in lower-extremity joints, which may result in either mobility, or postural stability problems. There is evidence in the literature suggesting that balance, agility and coordination training techniques can induce changes in lower-extremity muscle activity patterns that result in improvement in dynamic joint stability.The mechanoreceptors present in and around the joints are responsible for maintaining postural control and joint position sense. These receptors are integrated to compose the somatosensorial system. In combination with visual and auditory inputs, which improve our spatial perception even further, the systems are able to maintain a stable body posture.However, there is a lack of information on the efficacy of balance training alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of balance training (proprioceptive training) to improve functional capacity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (January 1966 to December 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2008), LILACS (January 1982 to December 2008), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2008), PEDro and Scirus (inception to 2008). We also handsearched conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) comparing balance training (proprioceptive training) with any other intervention or with no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed titles or abstracts, or both, for inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: The electronic search identified 864 studies. From this search, 17 studies described general <e>exercises</e> in rheumatoid arthritis patients as the main topic. After analysing them, we observed that the main interventions were exercises to improve muscle strength, endurance, and dynamic exercises (swimming, walking, etc). As we did not find any studies investigating the effects of balance training alone or in combination with other therapies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it was not possible to include any data regarding the chosen topic in this systematic review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no research available examining the efficacy of balance training alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The effectiveness and safety of balance training to improve functional capacity of these patients remains unclear. We suggest that future research should give more importance to balance training by either increasing the number and duration of sessions or investigating its efficacy alone.",M1
20451791,"Brodie bite with an extracted mandibular first molar in a young adult: a case report.Total buccal crossbites are rare, but, when they occur, they can be extremely difficult to correct, even with surgery and orthodontics. In most patients with in-locking crossbites, the maxillary teeth erupt past their mandibular antagonists, creating severe occlusal difficulties. This article presents an adult patient with scissors-bite or partial telescoping bite bilaterally in the posterior region and an extracted mandibular first molar on the right side. She was treated with expansion of the mandibular arch, and the subsequent open bite was closed with the help of masticatory muscle <e>exercises</e> and high-pull headgear.

20420957,"The impact of home-based physiotherapy interventions on breathlessness during activities of daily living in severe COPD: a systematic review.OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of home-based physiotherapy interventions on breathlessness during activities of daily living (ADL) in severe chronic obstructive disease (COPD). DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) were searched from their inception to Week 20 2008. Bibliographies of all potentially relevant retrieved studies, identified relevant systematic reviews and international guidelines were searched by hand. REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion criteria consisted of individuals over 18 years of age with severe COPD (defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second &lt; or = 50% predicted) without cardiovascular co-morbidities, home-based interventions and valid, reliable breathlessness ADL outcome measures. The PEDro scale assessed methodological quality. Data extraction included baseline characteristics, treatment intervention, frequency of training, level of supervision, breathlessness ADL outcome measure and results. Where possible, a random-effects meta-analysis was applied to appropriate trial data to produce overall quantitative results. RESULTS: Seven studies, providing nine data sets, met the inclusion criteria. Trial PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 7 out of 10. Studies were homogenous at baseline regarding age and COPD severity, although subjects were predominantly male. Five studies investigated inspiratory or expiratory muscle training, and two studies investigated <e>exercises</e>. Statistically significant breathlessness ADL outcome improvements were reported for all interventions except expiratory muscle training. Five studies demonstrated clinical significance (four for inspiratory muscle training and one for exercise). However, due to heterogeneity among study interventions and outcomes, meta-analysis was only considered clinically appropriate on one occasion to pool three inspiratory muscle training studies in relation to breathlessness score. The random-effects meta-analysis indicated that, on average, inspiratory muscle training improved the breathlessness score significantly by 2.36 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 3.96) compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Inspiratory muscle training and exercise are home-based physiotherapy interventions that may improve breathlessness during ADL in severe COPD. Administration can only be advocated tentatively in outpatient services and primary care at this stage because further higher quality, more homogeneous research with larger sample sizes is required to substantiate the current findings.",M1
20411224,"Upper limb spasticity reduction following active training: a robot-mediated study in patients with chronic hemiparesis.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on spasticity of 2 robot-mediated therapies in patients with chronic hemiparesis. DESIGN: Groups comparison. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients, divided into 2 homogeneous groups. METHODS: Outcome measures were: motor status score, Modified Ashworth scale, and range of motion. A pattern of reaching <e>exercises</e> was implemented, in which the direction and length of the movements were modified with the aim of reducing activity of the flexor muscles and improving extension of the arm. A 3-month follow-up was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found in both groups after treatment. Some differences were found in elbow motor improvement between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Comparison between groups confirms that active movement training does not result in increased hypertonia, but results in spasticity reduction in antagonist muscles by activating the reciprocal inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, robot-mediated therapy contributes to a decrease in motor impairment of the upper limbs in subjects with chronic hemiparesis, resulting in a reduction in shoulder pain.",M1
20397759,"Postpartum sexual function of women and the effects of early pelvic floor muscle <e>exercises</e>.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of early pelvic floor muscle training after vaginal delivery on sexual function. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTINGS: Urogynecology clinic of a tertiary medical center in Istanbul, Turkey. POPULATION: Total of 75 primiparous women. METHODS: Pelvic floor-muscle strength was assessed during rest and straining in primiparous women in their 4th postpartum month, after which the women were randomized into training (n = 37) and control (n = 38) groups. Patients were re-evaluated in the 7th postpartum month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Female sexual function and pelvic muscle strength scores. RESULTS: Desire, pain and total female sexual index scores were significantly higher in the 7th month compared to 4th month in both groups (p &lt; 0.05). However, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction scores were improved in the 7th month in the training group (paired t-test, p &lt; 0.001), but not significantly in the control group (p &gt; 0.05). All domains except satisfaction were significantly higher in the training group compared with the controls. Pelvic floor-muscle strength was found to be increased in the 7th month in the training group (Wilcoxon rank test, Z = 4.123, p &lt; 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference between the 4th and 7th month measurements in the controls (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pelvic floor-muscle training improves pelvic floor-muscle function, and starting after the puerperal period, exercise appears to have positive effects on female sexual function.",M1
20390664,"Urinary incontinence and sport: first and preliminary experience with a combined pelvic floor rehabilitation program in three female athletes.A relationship between sport or fitness activities and urinary incontinence (UI) previously has been described in women. We report our preliminary experience with the use of a complete pelvic floor rehabilitation program in three female athletes affected by UI. The athletes were submitted to a combined pelvic floor rehabilitation program, including biofeedback, functional electrical stimulation, pelvic floor muscle <e>exercises</e>, and vaginal cones. After the scheduled rehabilitation scheme, none of the patients reported incontinence, nor referred to urine leakage during sport or during daily life. We therefore conclude that UI that affects female agonistic athletes may be effectively treated with this combined approach.",M1
20383229,"Evaluation of exercise and potassium chloride supplementation on blood pressure and nociceptive threshold in hypertensive rats.Hypertensive subjects present an increased nociceptive threshold, and the lack or delay of pain perception may impede detection of angina and myocardial infarction. Nutritional interventions, like potassium chloride (KCl) diet supplementation, and <e>exercises</e> are common nonpharmacological indications for treating hypertension. Spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive male Wistar rats were submitted to a combination of exercise and KCl diet supplementation. Exercise reduced the nociceptive threshold in SHR; however, this effect was inhibited by KCl supplementation. Exercise and KCl supplementation did not alter systolic blood pressure. Reduction of the nociceptive threshold by exercise may be important for the detection of angina and myocardial infarction in hypertensive individuals.",M1
20382286,"Scapular muscle activity in overhead athletes with symptoms of secondary shoulder impingement during closed chain <e>exercises</e>.OBJECTIVE: To determine the amount of muscle activation in 4 scapular muscles in overhead athletes with and without a history of secondary shoulder impingement, during 3 upper extremity closed chain exercises. DESIGN: One-between (group), one-within (exercise) repeated measures. SETTING: Controlled laboratory study. PARTICIPANTS: Overhead athletes (n=15; mean age +/- SD, 21.0+/-2.5 y; mean height +/- SD, 176.0+/-7.8 cm; mean weight +/- SD, 76.1+/-13.4 kg) demonstrating with symptoms of shoulder impingement and overhead athletes (n=15; mean age +/- SD, 20.4+/-3.8 y; mean height +/- SD, 174.1+/-9.7 cm; mean weight +/- SD, 73.3+/-11.7 kg) with no shoulder pathologies. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed 5 individual trials of a standard push-up, a push-up on an unstable surface, and a revolution on a shoulder rehabilitation device while electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity of the serratus anterior, upper trapezius, middle trapezius, and lower trapezius. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean EMG data for the 4 muscles from the standard push-up, push-up on an unstable surface, and shoulder rehabilitation device trials were normalized as a percentage of a maximum voluntary isometric contraction for each muscle. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant interaction for the middle trapezius (F(2,56)=3.856; P=.027). The shoulder impingement push-up on an unstable surface (33.76%+/-26.45%) had significantly greater activation compared with the shoulder impingement standard push-up (25.88%+/-13.76%), the shoulder impingement shoulder rehabilitation device (9.40%+/-5.86%), and the nonpathology push-up on an unstable surface (19.49%+/-7.73%). The shoulder impingement standard push-up had significantly greater activation compared with the shoulder impingement shoulder rehabilitation device and nonpathology standard push-up (17.99%+/-7.31%). The nonpathology standard push-up and nonpathology push-up on an unstable surface had significantly greater activation compared with the nonpathology shoulder rehabilitation device (7.95%+/-4.30%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the muscle activation of the middle trapezius differs in overhead athletes with a history of secondary shoulder impingement compared with those who lack this history during closed chain exercise, as well as within the 3 closed chain exercises. The levels of muscle activation of the serratus anterior and upper trapezius during these closed chain exercises were similar between the 2 groups. These results support the use of closed chain exercises in the rehabilitation process of overhead athletes with secondary shoulder impingement. However, clinicians should consider the muscle(s) of interest when selecting an exercise.",M1
20382279,"Effects of combining electric stimulation with active ankle dorsiflexion while standing on a rocker board: a pilot study for subjects with spastic foot after stroke.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of combining electric stimulation (ES) with active ankle dorsiflexion while standing on a rocker board in subjects with plantarflexor spasticity after stroke. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A rehabilitation medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=15) with spastic foot after stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group received ES of ankle dorsiflexors in concert with a motor training paradigm that required the subject to dorsiflex the ankles in response to a cue while standing on a rocker board. After 30 minutes of this exercise, subjects received ambulation training focusing on ankle control for 15 minutes. The control group received general range of motion and strength <e>exercises</e> for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of ambulation training focusing on ankle control. Sessions occurred 3 times a week for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dynamic spasticity of plantarflexors, dorsiflexor muscle strength, balance performance, gait kinematics, and functional gait performance as assessed by the Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (EFAP) were used as outcome measurements. RESULTS: The experimental group demonstrated a greater decrease in dynamic ankle spasticity at a comfortable gait speed (P=.049), a greater improvement in spatial gait symmetry (P=.015), and a greater improvement in functional gait ability as indicated by the EFAP (P=.015) than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that repeated ES with volitional ankle movements can decrease dynamic ankle spasticity in subjects with stroke. Furthermore, such improvement parallels better gait symmetry and functional gait performance.",M1
20378679,"Effect of a home program of hip abductor <e>exercises</e> on knee joint loading, strength, function, and pain in people with knee osteoarthritis: a clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Hip abductor muscle weakness may result in impaired frontal-plane pelvic control during gait, leading to greater medial compartment loading in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of an 8-week home strengthening program for the hip abductor muscles on knee joint loading (measured by the external knee adduction moment during gait), strength (force-generating capacity), and function and pain in individuals with medial knee OA. DESIGN: The study design was a nonequivalent, pretest-posttest, control group design. SETTING: Testing was conducted in a motor performance laboratory. PATIENTS: An a priori sample size calculation was performed. Forty participants with knee OA were matched for age and sex with a control group of participants without knee OA. INTERVENTION: Participants with knee OA completed a home hip abductor strengthening program. MEASUREMENTS: Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed to obtain peak knee adduction moments in the first 50% of the stance phase. Isokinetic concentric strength of the hip abductor muscles was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. The Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test was used to evaluate functional performance. Knee pain was assessed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the OA group demonstrated significant improvement in hip abductor strength, but not in the knee adduction moment. Functional performance on the sit-to-stand test improved in the OA group compared with the control group. The OA group reported decreased knee pain after the intervention. LIMITATIONS: Gait strategies that may have affected the knee adduction moment, including lateral trunk lean, were not evaluated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Hip abductor strengthening did not reduce knee joint loading but did improve function and reduce pain in a group with medial knee OA.",M1

20346133,"The cost-effectiveness of a treatment-based classification system for low back pain: design of a randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have shown that exercise therapy and spinal manipulation are both more effective for low back pain (LBP) than no treatment at all. However, the effects are at best modest. To enhance the clinical outcomes, recommendations are to improve the patient selection process, and to identify relevant subgroups to guide clinical decision-making. One of the systems that has potentials to improve clinical decision-making is a treatment-based classification system that is intended to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to direction-specific <e>exercises</e>, manipulation, or stabilisation exercises. METHODS/DESIGN: The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial will be to assess the effectiveness of a classification-based system. A sample of 150 patients with subacute and chronic LBP who attend a private physical therapy clinic for treatment will be recruited. At baseline, all participants will undergo a standard evaluation by trained research physical therapists and will be classified into one of the following subgroups: direction-specific exercises, manipulation, or stabilisation. The patient will not be informed about the results of the examination. Patients will be randomly assigned to classification-based treatment or usual care according to the Dutch LBP guidelines, and will complete questionnaires at baseline, and 8, 26, and 52 weeks after the start of the treatment. The primary outcomes will be general perceived recovery, functional status, and pain intensity. Alongside this trial, an economic evaluation of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility will be conducted from a societal perspective. DISCUSSION: The present study will contribute to our knowledge about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of classification-based treatment in patients with LBP.

METHODS: A total of 168 residents who live in a long term care facility were screened. The trial began with 78 eligible participants and they were randomly grouped as combined exercises program (COM) group that includes stretching, strength and aerobic exercises, and COM plus jumping (COMpJ) group. 66 of the participants finished the trial. The groups were convened three times a week for six weeks. Each group had a warm-up, effective training and a cooling down periods. The total exercising time was no longer than 45 minutes in each group. Berg balance test and Biodex Balance System for the assessment of the dynamic balance and fall risk, short form 36 (SF 36) for the health related quality of life and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for evaluation of the depression status were used. RESULTS: The balance improvement and fall risk reduction were observed in both of the groups at the end of the trial; however, the improvements were statistically better in jumping combined group. Also health related quality of life improved in both groups. CONCLUSION: Regular group exercise in a long term care facility have several beneficial effects on the elderly residents in regard to balance improvement, fall risk reduction and quality of life. The addition of jumping to strength, stretching and aerobic exercises provides important contributions to balance improvement and fall risk reduction.",M1
20332469,"Pelvic floor rehabilitation for continence recovery after radical prostatectomy: role of a personal training re-educational program.Purpose: radical prostatectomy (RP) is affected by urinary incontinence (UI) that, even if temporary, can severely impact patients quality of life. We investigated if a post surgery tutored and personal trained pelvic floor re-educational program improves continence recovery more than pelvic floor <e>exercises</e> performed by patients on their own. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 332 incontinent (&gt;1 pad/daily) patients (pts) submitted to RP between 2006 and 2008 were prospectively randomized in group A (166 pts) and group B (166 pts). The first group performed an intensive tutored pelvic training program and the second formed the control group. The follow-up was at one year and the self report of recovery of continence was measured every 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: the median time of continence recovery in group A was 44+/-2 days, while in group B it was 76+/-4 days. Patients enrolled in the pelvic floor re-educational dedicated program (group A) achieved continence earlier than the control group (group B). In fact, the number of incontinent patients at the different follow-up intervals was higher for the control group than for the treatment group. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that a post RP personal training program of pelvic muscle re-education supported by a physician and nurses expert in continence disorders have a benefit in future continence.",M1
20331372,"Effects of electrical stimulation on House-Brackmann scores in early Bell's palsy.ABSTRACT Limited evidence may support the application of electrical stimulation in the subacute and chronic stages of facial palsy, yet some physiotherapists in South Africa have been applying this modality in the acute stage in the absence of published evidence of clinical efficacy. This preliminary study's aim was to determine the safety and potential efficacy of applying electrical stimulation to the facial muscles during the early phase of Bells palsy. A pretest posttest control vs. experimental groups design composed of 16 patients with Bell's palsy of less than 30 days' duration. Adult patients with clinical diagnosis of Bell's palsy were systematically (every second patient) allocated to the control and experimental groups. Each group (n = 8) was pretested and posttested using the House-Brackmann index. Both groups were treated with heat, massage, <e>exercises</e>, and a home program. The experimental group also received electrical stimulation. The House-Brackmann Scale of the control group improved between 17% and 50% with a mean of 30%. The scores of the experimental group ranged between 17% and 75% with a mean of 37%. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant (two-tailed p = 0.36). Electrical stimulation as used in this study during the acute phase of Bell's palsy is safe but may not have added value over spontaneous recovery and multimodal physiotherapy. A larger sample size or longer stimulation time or both should be investigated.",M1
20235009,"[Segmental stabilization in low back pain: a systematic review]BACKGROUND: Segmental Stabilizing <e>Exercises</e> (SSE) has a strong theoretical basis in treatment and prevention of Low Back Pain (LBP). The clinical effectiveness has not been clearly established. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of clinical- and randomized. controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of SSE for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent LBP. METHODS: Electronic database PubMed was searched for reviews of SSE from November 2008 to March 2009. Keywords were low back pain, lumbar stabilization, segmental stabilizing exercises, spinal stabilization exercises. For chronic LBP, four comparisons were made: Effectiveness of SSE versus minimal intervention, effectiveness of SSE as a supplement, effectiveness of SSE versus other physiotherapy treatment and effectiveness of SSE versus surgery. RESULTS: 17 trials were included. For acute LBP, SSE is equally effective as treatment by general practitioner in reducing short- term pain or disability. For long-term effects after an acute episode of LBP, SSE is more effective in reducing recurrence. For chronic LBP, SSE is more effective than a minimal intervention and may be as effective as other physiotherapeutic treatments in reducing pain and disability. Equal improvement in both groups was measured for surgery. There are no results concerning subacute LBP. CONCLUSION: For LBP, SSE is more effective than a minimal intervention, but it is not more effective than other physiotherapy interventions.",M1
20231787,"Physical therapy treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.BACKGROUND: Given the dearth of high quality research on conservative treatment for spinal stenosis, an empirical understanding of the scope of physical therapy provided in the community can help focus research and build standards of care. OBJECTIVES: Provide preliminary insight into current physical therapy practice in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), from both patient and physical therapist perspectives. METHODS: Patients greater than 50 years of age with LSS diagnosed by a spine surgeon were recruited to participate in a telephone survey regarding treatment. Physical therapists were recruited to complete a survey regarding treatments offered to patients with LSS. RESULTS: Of the patients participating in the study (n=75), 44 (59%) reported receiving physical therapy treatment. Treatments most frequently reported by patients were massage (27%), strengthening <e>exercises</e> (23%), flexibility exercises (18%), and heat/ice (14%). The most frequently advocated treatments by the 76 physical therapists included flexibility (87%), stabilization (86%) and strengthening exercises (83%), followed by heat/ice (76%), acupuncture (63%) and joint mobilization (62%). CONCLUSIONS: These results can guide both clinical research priorities and standards of care for physical therapy treatments of LSS. Based on the results of this study, future research foci should include massage, flexibility and strengthening exercises, stabilization techniques and heat/ice treatments.",M1
20230175,"Outcomes of a home-based pulmonary maintenance program for individuals with COPD: a pilot study.This preliminary pilot study explores sustained benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) attending a 12-month home-based pulmonary maintenance program. The incidence of COPD is high and ageing populations will see this continue and possibly increase. PR programs are effective, however, benefits may dissipate if the program is not continued. The maintenance program involved: strength retraining <e>exercises</e>; collaborative goal setting; regular telephone calls; and home visits. Around half of the 29 participants remained in contact with the program for 12 months and 21 completed final or 6-month assessment. Most participants maintained: respiratory functioning; quality of life; and self-efficacy, with some showing improvements. Outcomes provide knowledge for improving patient care through a home-based strategy to maintain benefits of PR programs. Results suggest that in light of likely decline in benefits 6-12 months after PR, the maintenance program contributed to sustained benefits for COPD individuals and also provide information to aid investigators planning the design of similar larger research with this population.",M1
20205581,"Effects of an intensive, task-specific rehabilitation program for individuals with chronic stroke: a case series.PURPOSE: The purpose of this case series was to determine feasibility and evaluate changes in activity and participation outcomes in persons with chronic stroke after an intensive, task-specific rehabilitation program incorporating whole-body and client-centred interventions. METHOD: Participants with chronic stroke (N = 12) who were ambulatory and had at least minimal arm/hand function were recruited. The program included whole-body goal-focused activities, gait training and strengthening <e>exercises</e> for 4 h, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Daily educational sessions and a home activities program were also included. Activity-based measures including the Wolf motor function test, Berg balance scale, timed up and go test and 6-min walk test and participation-based measures including the Stroke Impact Scale and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure were collected at pre-test, immediate post-test and 5-month retention. RESULTS: The effect of the intervention on participation-based outcomes was much greater than on the activity-based outcomes. Minimal detectable differences in self-perceived participation were reported for most participants. CONCLUSIONS: The intensive, task-specific intervention was a feasible program for these participants with stroke. Although minimal changes in activity-based outcomes were found, the participants perceived improvements in participation with personal goal-related activities that resulted in large effect sizes that were maintained for 5-months after the intervention.",M1
20201159,"Effectiveness of holistic physiotherapy for low back pain.BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a term used to designate a wide and complete assemblage of symptoms that has become a cause of disability in the 21th century man. Until recently, it was believed that low back pain caused by intervertebral disc disease and degenerative progresses. At present, an increasing number of studies are linking the condition to conditions of osteoarticular and musculoligamentous structures in the spine and the associated statics of the pelvis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study compared the outcomes of two different plysiotherapeutic approaches to treatment of low pack pain in group of 60 female patients. In the experimental group, a customised programme of treatment was based on postisometric relaxation of muscles and ligaments, active mobilisation of the spine, Kibler Fold mobilisation, Kinesiology Taping and Maigne's relaxing <e>exercises</e>. the control group underwent electrotherapy procedures and performed a set of exercises usually recommended for low back pain. Intensity of pain and difficulty in performing daily activities were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the treatment: the measurements included mobility of the spine, static balance of the pelvis, tenderness and tension of muscles and ligaments and presence of cell-pain zones. Statistics analysis used basic statistics concerning the distribution of the examined characteristics and a comparison of means in independent groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: As a result of the treatment, low back pain was reduced in about 90% of patients in the experimental group, while static balance of the pelvis, tone of the muscles and ligaments and spinal mobility improved in approximately 80% of these patients. In the control group, radiating pain decreased and ligaments in 25% of participants, white the other parameters did not change significantly. The results were statistically significant at &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSION: These results confirm a high holistic physiotherapy including elements of osteopathy such as post-isometric muscle relaxation, active mobilisation, Kibler Fold mobilisation, customised self-therapy and Kinesiology Taping.",M1
20200451,"Activation of the shoulder musculature during pendulum <e>exercises</e> and light activities.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, single-group, repeated-measures design. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate electromyographic (EMG) signal amplitude in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and deltoid muscles during pendulum exercises and light activities in a group of healthy subjects. BACKGROUND: There are numerous rehabilitation protocols used after rotator cuff repair. One of the most commonly used exercises in these protocols is the pendulum. Patients can easily perform these exercises incorrectly, and may also perform light activities of daily living without knowing that they may be putting excessive stress on the repair. The effect of improperly performed pendulum exercises and light activities after rotator cuff repair is unknown. METHODS: Muscle activity was recorded in 13 subjects performing pendulum exercises incorrectly and correctly in both large (51-cm) and small (20-cm) diameters, and while typing, drinking, and brushing their teeth. RESULTS: Incorrect and correct large pendulums and drinking elicited more than 15% maximum voluntary isometric contraction in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The supraspinatus EMG signal amplitude was greater during large, incorrectly performed pendulums than during those performed correctly. Both correct and incorrect large pendulums resulted in statistically higher muscle activity in the supraspinatus than the small pendulums. CONCLUSION: Larger pendulums may require more force than is desirable early in rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair.",M1
20195019,"Time line for noncopers to pass return-to-sports criteria after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVES: Determine effective interventions for improving readiness to return to sports postoperatively in patients with complete, unilateral, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture who do not compensate well after the injury (noncopers). Specifically, we compared the effects of 2 preoperative interventions on quadriceps strength and functional outcomes. BACKGROUND: The percentage of athletes who return to sports after ACL reconstruction varies considerably, possibly due to differential responses after acute ACL rupture and different management. Prognostic data for noncopers following ACL reconstruction is absent in the literature. METHODS: Forty noncopers were randomly assigned to receive either progressive quadriceps strength-training <e>exercises</e> (STR group) or perturbation training in conjunction with strength-training exercises (PERT group) for 10 preoperative rehabilitation sessions. Postoperative rehabilitation was similar between groups. Data on quadriceps strength indices [(involved limb/uninvolved limb force) x 100], 4 hop score indices, and 2 self-report questionnaires were collected preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare functional differences between the groups. Chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies of passing functional criteria and reasons for differences in performance between groups postoperatively. RESULTS: Functional outcomes were not different between groups, except a greater number of patients in the PERT group achieved global rating scores (current knee function expressed as a percentage of overall knee function prior to injury) necessary to pass return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months after surgery. Mean scores for each functional outcome met return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Frequency counts of individual data, however, indicated that 5% of noncopers passed RTS criteria at 3, 48% at 6, and 78% at 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Functional outcomes suggest that a subgroup of noncopers require additional supervised rehabilitation to pass stringent criteria to return to sports.

20194956,"Early versus late start of isokinetic hamstring-strengthening exercise after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft.BACKGOUND: Hamstring strengthening after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a vital component of the rehabilitation program. PURPOSE: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of hamstring isokinetic training used in the early phase of the rehabilitation program on the stability, strength, symptoms, and functional outcomes of patients throughout 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty-eight men underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patients were randomly assigned to perform daily isokinetic hamstring <e>exercises</e> at postoperative 3 weeks (group I) or to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 9 weeks (group II). The patients were evaluated monthly for the first 4 months and at the 12th month for postoperative hamstring and quadriceps strength, as well as for knee function via the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee form. RESULTS: Hamstring isometric strength at 30 degrees of knee flexion (at the first and second months) and concentric isokinetic strength (at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months) at the angular velocity of 60 deg/s were significantly (P &lt;.05-.01) greater in group I compared with group II. Average scores of the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale for symptoms were significantly (P &lt;.05-.001) higher in group I compared with group II at all evaluation periods. Walking and stair-climbing scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months and squatting score at all evaluation periods were also better (P &lt;.05-.01) in group I compared with group II. In addition, group I exhibited better (P &lt;.01-.001) Lachman test results compared with group II for all postoperative evaluation periods. The International Knee Documentation Committee final rating scores were significantly (P &lt;.01) greater at 2, 3, and 4 months in group I compared with group II. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that hamstring as well as quadriceps strength can be increased via early hamstring strengthening after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with no negative impact on knee function.",M1
20193940,"Electromyographical assessment of passive, active assistive, and active shoulder rehabilitation <e>exercises</e>.OBJECTIVE: To determine the electromyographical (EMG) activation levels of shoulder musculature during early rehabilitation exercises to regain active range of motion. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: University clinical research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ten asymptomatic volunteers (age, 25 +/- 5 years; height, 171 +/- 7 cm; weight, 78 +/- 15 kg). INTERVENTION: Fine-wire (supraspinatus and infraspinatus) and surface (anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior) electrodes recorded EMG activity from each muscle during 12 therapeutic exercises completed during a single testing session in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: EMG root mean squared amplitude normalized to a percentage of maximum voluntary contraction (% MVC). RESULTS: Passive exercises generated the lowest mean EMG activity (&lt;10%) for all muscles studied. The standing active shoulder elevation exercises generated the greatest mean EMG activity with an upper boundary of 95% CI (40% MVC). Overall the active-assistive exercises generated a small (&lt;10%) increase in muscle activity compared with the passive exercises for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which was not a significant increase (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSION: This electrophysiological data in normal volunteers suggest that many exercises used during the early phase of rehabilitation to regain active elevation do not exceed 20% MVC. Progression from passive to active-assisted can potentially be performed without significantly increasing muscular activation levels exercises. Upright active exercises demonstrated a consistent and often a statistically significant increase in muscular activities supporting that these exercises should be prescribed later in a rehabilitation program.",M1
20189463,"Magnetic resonance imaging and stadiometric assessment of the lumbar discs after sitting and chair-care decompression exercise: a pilot study.BACKGROUND: Sitting is associated with loss of the lumbar lordosis, intervertebral disc (IVD) compression, and height loss, possibly increasing the risk of lower back pain. With a trend toward more sitting jobs worldwide, practical strategies for preventing lumbar flattening and potentially associated low back pain (LBP) are important. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using upright magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and stadiometry to measure changes in height and configuration of the lumbar spine before and after normal sitting and a seated unloading exercise intervention. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a hospital-based pilot study involving pre-post assessments in a single group. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample comprises six asymptomatic hospital employees involved in either general patient care or research writing/data collection. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were lumbar total midsagittal cross-sectional IVD area, vertical height, lordotic angle derived from digitized MRI examinations, and seated body height measured directly with a stadiometer. METHODS: Midsagittal MRI scans were performed before sitting, after 15 minutes of relaxed sitting ( postsitting ), immediately after seated unloading <e>exercises</e>, and approximately 7 minutes after exercise. Subsequently, seated stadiometry assessments were performed after 10 minutes of supine recumbency, 15 minutes of relaxed sitting, and every 10 seconds after seated unloading exercises until three consecutive height measurements were identical. Digitized midsagittal images were used to derive MRI-based outcome measures. Measurements at postsitting were compared with the corresponding ones at other time points using multiple paired t-tests. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple pairwise comparisons. MAIN RESULTS: After 15 minutes of sitting, mean total IVD area, lordotic angle, and vertical height of the lumbar spine decreased 18.6 mm(2), 6.2 degrees , and 12.5 mm, respectively, whereas after seated unloading exercises, these parameters increased by 87.9 mm(2), 5.0 degrees , and 21.9 mm, respectively. Similarly, mean seated height on stadiometry decreased by 6.9 mm after 15 minutes of sitting and subsequently increased by 5.7 mm after unloading exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Seated upright MRI and stadiometry, as performed in this study, appear to be feasible methods for detecting compressive and decompressive spinal changes associated with normal sitting and, alternately, seated unloading exercises. Larger studies are encouraged to determine normative values of our study measurements and to determine if morphological changes induced by seated unloading predict treatment response and/or reductions in the incidence of sitting-related LBP.",M1
20189136,"Are postpartum women in denmark being given helpful information about urinary incontinence and pelvic floor <e>exercises</e>?INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine where and from whom postpartum women recalled receiving information about urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic floor exercises (PFEs), the helpfulness of this information, and their preferred sources of help with UI. METHODS: Women who had recently given birth in a Danish hospital (N = 439) were mailed a survey that elicited information about their experiences of receiving information about UI and PFEs. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 266 women, representing a response rate of 61%. Although almost all participants recalled receiving information about PFEs (95%), only half (55%) recalled being provided with information about UI. Midwives were the health care professionals who most commonly provided women with information about UI (33%) and PFEs (55%). Women generally perceived the information as being helpful, with the information from physiotherapists obtaining the highest mean ratings for helpfulness. Postpartum women indicated that they would prefer to consult with continence nurses or general nurses if they experienced UI. Health care professionals did not consistently provide postpartum women with information on UI and PFEs. DISCUSSION: A coordinated multidisciplinary approach is needed to ensure that women are adequately informed about the risk of developing UI after childbirth and the ways in which this condition can be managed or resolved.",M1
20185613,"Development of a therapeutic exercise program for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No detailed exercise programs specifically for patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) have been described in the literature. This lack of data creates a gap between the recommendation that people with OA should exercise and the type and dose of <e>exercises</e> that they should perform. The purpose of this case report is to describe and demonstrate the use of a therapeutic exercise program for a patient with hip OA. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old woman with hip OA completed a 12-week therapeutic exercise program (TEP) with a 6-month follow-up. The patient reported hip pain, joint stiffness, and limited physical function, and she had decreased hip range of motion (ROM) at baseline. OUTCOMES: The patient performed 19 sessions during the TEP, with a mean of 19.5 exercises per session. She increased the resistance in 3 of 5 strength (force-generating capacity) training exercises and achieved the highest degree of difficulty in all functional exercises. During the TEP and follow-up, the patient reported improvements in pain, joint stiffness, and physical function. Performance improved on the following physical tests: isokinetic peak torque strength (60 degrees /s) in hip extension (40%), hip flexion (27%), knee extension (17%), and knee flexion (42%); hip ROM extension (8 degrees ); and 6-minute walk distance (83 m). DISCUSSION: The patient experienced less pain and improved physical function and physical test outcomes after intervention and at the 6-month follow-up. The main challenges when prescribing an exercise program for a patient with hip OA are monitoring the exercises to provide improvements without provoking persistent pain and motivating the patient to achieve long-term adherence to exercising. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this TEP in patients with hip OA.",M1
20185357,"An alternative intervention for urinary incontinence: retraining diaphragmatic, deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscle coordinated function.This study was a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of treating women with stress or mixed urinary incontinence (SUI or MUI) by diaphragmatic, deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) retraining. Seventy women were randomly allocated to the training (n = 35) or control group (n = 35). Women in the training group received 8 individual clinical visits and followed a specific exercise program. Women in the control group performed self-monitored PFM <e>exercises</e> at home. The primary outcome measure was self-reported improvement. Secondary outcome measures were 20-min pad test, 3-day voiding diary, maximal vaginal squeeze pressure, holding time and quality of life. After a 4-month intervention period, more participants in the training group reported that they were cured or improved (p &lt; 0.01). The cure/improved rate was above 90%. Both amount of leakage and number of leaks were significantly lower in the training group (p &lt; 0.05) but not in the control group. More aspects of quality of life improved significantly in the training group than in the control group. Maximal vaginal squeeze pressure, however, decreased slightly in both groups. Coordinated retraining diaphragmatic, deep abdominal and PFM function could improve symptoms and quality of life. It may be an alternative management for women with SUI or MUI.",M1
20175947,"The effect of an exercise program on the health-quality of life in older adults. A randomized controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: An essential public health goal is to reduce age-related disabilities in the elderly. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise program on-health-quality of life (HQL) in older adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects were sixty healthy adult volunteers over the age of 55 years. None of the subjects had any experience in exercise programs but were physically active and able to perform activities of daily living independently. The subjects were randomly assigned into one of two groups each with 30 people: test (exercise) group and control (no exercise) group. The test group was taken into a 12-week aerobic exercise program. The <e>exercises</e> included a 5-10 minute circulatory warm-up, a 15 minute walking and a 5-10 minute stretching/cool-down period. The exercises were performed three times per week under supervision of an experienced instructor. No exercise program was prescribed for the control group. Both groups were assessed before and after the exercise program. The LEIPAD questionnaire was used to measure HQL. RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements in all domains of the LEIPAD questionnaire whilst the level of HQL did not change and none of the scores obtained by the LEIPAD were significant. Measures of HQL improved with exercise so that there were no HQL changes in the control but significant changes were observed in the exercise group. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that an exercise program has resulted in a significant improvement in HQL in older adults.",M1

20163739,"Effects of an exercise and manual therapy program on physical impairments, function and quality-of-life in people with osteoporotic vertebral fracture: a randomised, single-blind controlled pilot trial.BACKGROUND: This randomised, single-blind controlled pilot trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of a physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy, in reducing impairments and improving physical function and health-related quality of life in people with a history of painful osteoporotic vertebral fracture. METHODS: 20 participants were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 11) or control (n = 9) group. The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home <e>exercises</e> with adherence monitored by a self-report diary. The control group received no treatment. Blinded assessment was conducted at baseline and 11 weeks. Questionnaires assessed self-reported changes in back pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Objective measures of thoracic kyphosis, back and shoulder muscle endurance (Timed Loaded Standing Test), and function (Timed Up and Go test) were also taken. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs). For the perceived change in back pain over the 10 weeks, 9/11 (82%) participants in the intervention group rated their pain as 'much better' compared with only 1/9 (11%) participants in the control group. CONCLUSION: Despite the modest sample size, these results support the benefits of exercise and manual therapy in the clinical management of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but need to be confirmed in a larger sample.

20150396,"Visuo-proprioceptive training reduces risk of falls in patients with multiple sclerosis.Lack of balance and falls are common and disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel visuo-proprioceptive feedback training in ameliorating balance and reducing the risk of falls. Patients with multiple sclerosis with unrestricted walking ability and healthy age/sex-matched controls were recruited. After a baseline clinical evaluation, including a postural assessment in double- (stabilometric test) and single-leg stance (monopodalic test) by a computerized postural recorder device, patients were submitted to a run-in period lasting 6 weeks without any rehabilitative intervention. Two further clinical and postural evaluations before and after a 6-week period of training were performed. The training protocol provided static and dynamic <e>exercises</e> both in double- and single-leg stance, with and without a translating Freeman-like board. Visual feedback was shown on the computer screen during the exercises. We recruited 40 consecutive patients and 12 controls. Patients had significantly poorer postural performances than controls. Twenty-eight patients completed the study follow-up. No significant changes in risk of falls emerged after the run-in period. A significant reduction in the median percentage of risk of falls in single-leg stance (open eyes: 39.3 versus 15.7; closed eyes: 67.3 versus 52.6; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) were observed after rehabilitation. Moreover, an improvement in walking speed (median time: 7.4 s versus 6.3; p = 0.001) was detected in the absence of Expanded Disability Status Scale changes.

20147878,"Treatment of chronic low back pain: a randomized, clinical trial comparing group-based multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation and intensive individual therapist-assisted back muscle strengthening <e>exercises</e>.STUDY DESIGN: A stratified randomized single-blinded clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of 2 active therapies for chronic low back pain (CLBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Both a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation program and an intensive individual therapist-assisted back muscle strengthening exercise program used in Denmark have been reported to be effective for the treatment of CLBP. METHODS: A total of 286 patients with CLBP were randomized to either a group-based 12-week program comprising 73 hours of therapist exposure (approximately 12 h/patient): 35 hours of hard physical exercise, 22 hours of light exercise/occupational therapy, and 16 hours of education (group A) or a 12-week program comprising 1 hour of personal training twice a week, i.e., therapist exposure 24 h/patient (group B). At baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, patients filled out questionnaires on pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]-pain average, which was the primary outcome measure), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, global perceived outcome, and 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey. Data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Of the 286 patients, 14 patients did not start treatment. Of the remaining patients, 25 (9%) dropped out of therapy. The 2 groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristic. After treatment, significant improvements were observed with regard to pain, disability, and most of the quality of life dimensions. These effects were sustained over the 24-month follow-up period. There were some statistically significant differences between the 2 groups relating to secondary end points, Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, and in the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey the  physical functioning  dimension and the  physical component summary.  CONCLUSION: Both groups showed long-term improvements in pain and disability scores, with only minor statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The minor outcome difference in favor of the group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is hardly of clinical interest for individual patients.",M1
20147760,"Biomechanics of off-center monoarticular <e>exercises</e> with lever selectorized equipment.We have developed a 2-D analytical biomechanical model for monoarticular open kinetic-chain exercises with lever selectorized equipment, and different relative placement between the joint center of rotation (J) and the center of rotation (C) of the resistance input lever ( off-center  exercises). All the relevant geometrical aspects of such exercises have been characterized: the change with the joint angle of the distance between the resistance pad (P) and J, and of the angle between CP and JP (i.e., the angle between the resistance input lever and the exercising limb). These changes may strongly affect the joint load and the muscle torque in inverse dynamic problems, given the joint kinematics and the mass of the selected weight stack. Therefore, the muscle torque, the shear and axial components of the joint load have been calculated analytically as a function of the relative positioning of C and J, and the length CP, in addition to the parameters that define the joint kinematics, the equipment mechanics, and the external load. From these results we have derived the optimal cam profiles for  off-center  exercises, as well as the geometrical  off-center  setting that minimizes the shear component of the tibiofemoral joint load in leg extension equipment.",M1
20140407,"Effects of group-based versus individual-based exercise training on motor performance in children with developmental coordination disorder: a randomized controlled study.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of group-based and individual-based motor skill training on motor performance in children with developmental coordination disorder. DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot intervention study. SUBJECTS/PATIENTS: Twenty-three children (4 girls) with developmental coordination disorder (mean age (standard deviation (SD)) 8 years (1 year and 2 months)). METHODS: Twelve children were randomly assigned to undergo a motor training programme once a week for 8 consecutive weeks in a group setting, and 11 children received the same training on an individual basis during the same period. Each child was also instructed to perform home <e>exercises</e> on a daily basis. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) was used to assess motor ability. Home exercise compliance and parental satisfaction with the programmes were also evaluated. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the MABC total impairment score was found following both group-based (mean -4.4 (SD 5.0), p = 0.003) and individual-based training (mean -5.2 (SD 5.1), p = 0.016). However, the change in total impairment score did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (p = 0.379). There was similarly no significant between-group difference in home exercise compliance (p = 0.288) and parental satisfaction (p = 0.379). CONCLUSION: Group-based training produced similar gains in motor performance to individual-based training. Group-based training may be the preferred treatment option due to the associated cost savings.",M1
20138321,"[Neurorehabilitation in parkinsonian syndromes]Parkinson's disease is a frequent and major source of motor disability, for which physical therapies currently involve less than a third of ambulatory patients and are thus underutilized when compared to chemical and surgical treatments. However, dopaminergic therapies alone prove unable to prevent worsening of motor disability after a number of years. There is rising interest about physical neurorehabilitative therapy for Parkinson's disease, for its symptomatic therapeutic properties, but also for its potential neuroprotective effects in the light of compelling, recent animal literature. The approach to therapy in an individual patient may be governed at the most basic level by the disease stage. For moderate stages of Parkinson's disease (ambulatory patients who have retained a certain degree of physical independence), therapy may focus on the teaching of <e>exercises</e> to the patient: strategies established in controlled studies when used over few weeks periods include motor strengthening programs in the lower limb, high intensity aerobic exercises, attentional strategies using in particular verbal instruction sets, sensory cueing, active axial rotation exercises and high-number repetition of specific tasks. A randomized protocol will soon evaluate the concept of asymmetric motor training, combining a strengthening program in extensor, abductor, external rotator and supinator muscles and a stretching program in their antagonists. For advanced stages (individuals with compromised sit-to-stand, ambulation and significant disability), the therapeutic focus may shift to the teaching of compensation strategies to the patient and the caregiver, both to lessen the effects of motor impairment and to optimize safety. A number of these compensatory strategies are reviewed, some being validated in controlled protocols. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease, clinicians must continue evaluating the symptomatic and perhaps neuroprotective value of physical treatment strategies used over the long term. In atypical parkinsonism, physical treatments often remain the only realistic methods to improve motor behavior and reduce functional deficiencies. The relatively short duration of the effects of physical therapies implies that such programs be pursued over long periods of time, or repeated frequently, for their benefits to be maintained over time.",M1
20130673,"Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology position stand: The use of instability to train the core in athletic and nonathletic conditioning.The use of instability devices and <e>exercises</e> to train the core musculature is an essential feature of many training centres and programs. It was the intent of this position stand to provide recommendations regarding the role of instability in resistance training programs designed to train the core musculature. The core is defined as the axial skeleton and all soft tissues with a proximal attachment originating on the axial skeleton, regardless of whether the soft tissue terminates on the axial or appendicular skeleton. Core stability can be achieved with a combination of muscle activation and intra-abdominal pressure. Abdominal bracing has been shown to be more effective than abdominal hollowing in optimizing spinal stability. When similar exercises are performed, core and limb muscle activation are reported to be higher under unstable conditions than under stable conditions. However, core muscle activation that is similar to or higher than that achieved in unstable conditions can also be achieved with ground-based free-weight exercises, such as Olympic lifts, squats, and dead lifts. Since the addition of unstable bases to resistance exercises can decrease force, power, velocity, and range of motion, they are not recommended as the primary training mode for athletic conditioning. However, the high muscle activation with the use of lower loads associated with instability resistance training suggests they can play an important role within a periodized training schedule, in rehabilitation programs, and for nonathletic individuals who prefer not to use ground-based free weights to achieve musculoskeletal health benefits.",M1
20130672,"The use of instability to train the core musculature.Training of the trunk or core muscles for enhanced health, rehabilitation, and athletic performance has received renewed emphasis. Instability resistance <e>exercises</e> have become a popular means of training the core and improving balance. Whether instability resistance training is as, more, or less effective than traditional ground-based resistance training is not fully resolved. The purpose of this review is to address the effectiveness of instability resistance training for athletic, nonathletic, and rehabilitation conditioning. The anatomical core is defined as the axial skeleton and all soft tissues with a proximal attachment on the axial skeleton. Spinal stability is an interaction of passive and active muscle and neural subsystems. Training programs must prepare athletes for a wide variety of postures and external forces, and should include exercises with a destabilizing component. While unstable devices have been shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of low back pain and increasing the sensory efficiency of soft tissues, they are not recommended as the primary exercises for hypertrophy, absolute strength, or power, especially in trained athletes. For athletes, ground-based free-weight exercises with moderate levels of instability should form the foundation of exercises to train the core musculature. Instability resistance exercises can play an important role in periodization and rehabilitation, and as alternative exercises for the recreationally active individual with less interest or access to ground-based free-weight exercises. Based on the relatively high proportion of type I fibers, the core musculature might respond well to multiple sets with high repetitions (e.g., &gt;15 per set); however, a particular sport may necessitate fewer repetitions.",M1
20130671,"What I always wanted to know about instability training.A very popular mode of training in recent years has been the use of instability devices and <e>exercises</e> to train the core musculature. Instability training is viewed by many as the most effective way to train the core; however, evidence on this topic paints a slightly different picture. An extensive review of the literature by Behm et al. 2010 (Appl. Physiol. Metab. Nutr. 35(1): 91-108) identified the fact that instability training can increase core muscle activation, but it may not be the best choice in all situations. Unstable training can reduce overall muscular power output, which may have important implications if the goal of a given training program is to maximize the output or physiological stress on a given muscle, as is the case in certain types of athletic training or in certain clinical exercise situations. Nevertheless, the balance of this evidence leads to the recommendations in the position stand (Behm et al. 2010, Appl. Physiol. Metab. Nutr. 35(1): 109-112) that instability training can play an important role as part of an overall periodized program for an athlete, as part of a rehabilitation program in recovery from injury, or as an interesting and novel training mode for the general population in pursuit of musculoskeletal health benefits who may not have access to or want to complete more intensive free-weight training programs. More research is needed to establish the effectiveness of instability training in preventing injury in sports, enhancing on-field sport performance, or for use in various clinical situations outside of rehabilitation for low back pain.",M1

Feasibility and outcomes of a home-based exercise program on improving balance and gait stability in women with lower-limb osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis: a pilot study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and gait stability and balance outcomes of a 4-month individualized home exercise program for women with arthritis. DESIGN: Pre-post interventional study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Women (N=49) (volunteers) with lower-limb osteoarthritis or lower-limb rheumatoid arthritis were enrolled. Only 39 subjects were eligible and completed the study. INTERVENTION: After completion of the initial assessment, all participants received home balance <e>exercises</e> from an experienced physiotherapist based on assessment findings and exercises available from commercially available kits. All measures were repeated 4 months later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Falls risk (Falls Risk of Older People-Community Setting) and balance measures. RESULTS: Thirty-nine women (mean age, 69.3y; 95% confidence interval, 65.7-72.9) completed the 4-month program. At baseline, 64% of participants reported falling in the preceding 12 months, and the average falls risk (Falls Risk of Older People-Community Setting) score was 14.5, with 42% rated as moderate risk (16-23). Participants achieved improved performance on most balance and related measures after the exercise program, including falls risk (P=.01), activity levels (P=.015), fear of falling (P=.022), functional reach test (P=.001), rising index for sit to stand (P=.001), step width in walking (P=.001), and body mass index (P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: An individualized balance training home exercise program is feasible for older women with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and may improve stability during walking and other functional activities.",M1

RESULTS: Significant univariate relationships were identified between LM muscle activation and the number of prognostic factors present (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] =-.558, P=.001), as well as the individual factors of a positive prone instability test (point biserial correlation coefficient [r(pbis)]=.376, P=.018) and segmental hypermobility (r(pbis)=.358, P=.025). The multivariate analyses indicated that after controlling for other variables, the addition of the variable  number of prognostic factors present  resulted in a significant increase in R(2) (P=.006). No significant univariate or multivariate relationships were observed between the prognostic factors and TrA muscle activation. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased LM muscle activation, but not TrA muscle activation, is associated with the presence of factors predictive of clinical success with a stabilization exercise program. Our findings provide researchers and clinicians with evidence regarding the construct validity of the prognostic factors examined in this study, as well as the potential clinical importance of the LM muscle as a target for stabilization <e>exercises</e>.",M1
20093325,"Comprehensive facial rehabilitation improves function in people with facial paralysis: a 5-year experience at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.BACKGROUND: The Facial Grading Scale (FGS) is a quantitative instrument used to evaluate facial function after facial nerve injury. However, quantitative improvements in function after facial rehabilitation in people with chronic facial paralysis have not been shown. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to use the FGS in a large series of consecutive subjects with facial paralysis to quantitatively evaluate improvements in facial function after facial nerve rehabilitation and to describe the management of chronic facial paralysis. DESIGN: The study was a retrospective review. METHODS: A total of 303 individuals with facial paralysis were evaluated by 1 physical therapist at a tertiary care facial nerve center during a 5-year period. Facial rehabilitation included education, neuromuscular training, massage, meditation-relaxation, and an individualized home program. After 2 months of home <e>exercises</e>, the participants were re-evaluated, and the home program was tailored as necessary. All participants were evaluated with the FGS before the initiation of facial rehabilitation, and 160 participants were re-evaluated after receiving treatment. All participants underwent the initial evaluation at least 4 months after the onset of facial paralysis; for 49 participants, the evaluation took place more than 3 years after onset. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in FGS scores were seen after treatment (P&lt;.001, t test). The average initial score was 56 (SD=21, range=13-98), and the average score after treatment was 70 (SD=18, range=25-100). LIMITATIONS: A limitation of this study was that evaluations were performed by only 1 therapist. CONCLUSIONS: For 160 patients with facial paralysis, statistically significant improvements after facial rehabilitation were shown; the improvements appeared to be long lasting with continued treatment. The improvements in the FGS scores indicated that patients can successfully manage symptoms with rehabilitation and underscored the importance of specialized therapy in the management of facial paralysis.",M1
20091596,"<e>Exercises</e> for prevention of recurrences of low-back pain.BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common disorder that has a tendency to recur. It is unclear if exercises, either as part of treatment or as a post-treatment programme, can reduce back pain recurrences. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of exercises for preventing new episodes of low-back pain or low-back pain-associated disability. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to July 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were: participants who had experienced back pain before, an intervention that consisted of exercises without additional specific treatment and outcomes that measured recurrence of back pain or time to recurrence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently judged if references met the inclusion criteria. The same review authors independently extracted data and judged the risk of bias of the studies. Studies were divided into post-treatment intervention programmes and treatment studies. Study results were pooled with meta-analyses if participants, interventions, controls and outcomes were judged to be sufficiently homogenous. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 articles reporting on nine studies with nine interventions. Four studies with 407 participants evaluated post-treatment programmes and five studies with 1113 participants evaluated exercise as a treatment modality. Four studies had a low risk of bias, one study a high risk and the remainder an unclear risk of bias.We found moderate quality evidence that post-treatment exercises were more effective than no intervention for reducing the rate of recurrences at one year (Rate Ratio 0.50; 95% Confidence Interval 0.34 to 0.73). There was moderate quality evidence that the number of recurrences was significantly reduced in two studies (Mean Difference -0.35; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.10) at one-half to two years follow-up. There was very low quality evidence that the days on sick leave were reduced by post-treatment exercises (Mean Difference -4.37; 95% CI -7.74 to -0.99) at one-half to two years follow-up.We found conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of exercise treatment in reducing the number of recurrences or the recurrence rate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence that post-treatment exercise programmes can prevent recurrences of back pain but conflicting evidence was found for treatment exercise. Studies into the validity of measurement of recurrences and the effectiveness of post-treatment exercise are needed.",M1
20091582,"Interventions to improve adherence to exercise for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a major health problem, accounting for approximately one-quarter of general practice (GP) consultations in the United Kingdom (UK). Exercise and physical activity is beneficial for the most common types of CMP, such as back and knee pain. However, poor adherence to exercise and physical activity may limit long-term effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the trials registers of relevant Cochrane Review Groups. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index and reference lists of articles to October 2007. We consulted experts for unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating interventions that aimed to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity in adults with pain for three months and over in the axial skeleton or large peripheral joints. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two of the four authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 trials with 8243 participants, mainly with osteoarthritis and spinal pain. Methods used for improving and measuring adherence in the included trials were inconsistent. Two of the 17 trials that compared different types of exercise showed positive effects, suggesting that the type of exercise is not an important factor in improving exercise adherence. Six trials studied different methods of delivering exercise, such as supervising exercise sessions, refresher sessions and audio or videotapes of the <e>exercises</e> to take home. Of these, five trials found interventions improved exercise adherence. Four trials evaluated specific interventions targeting exercise adherence; three of these showed a positive effect on exercise adherence. In eight trials studying self-management programmes, six improved adherence measures. One trial found graded activity was more effective than usual care for improving exercise adherence. Cognitive behavioural therapy was effective in a trial in people with whiplash-associated disorder, but not in trials of people with other CMP. In the trials that showed a positive effect on adherence, association between clinical outcomes and exercise adherence was conflicting. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions such as supervised or individualised exercise therapy and self-management techniques may enhance exercise adherence. However, high-quality, randomised trials with long-term follow up that explicitly address adherence to exercises and physical activity are needed. A standard validated measure of exercise adherence should be used consistently in future studies.",M1
20091523,"Physical conditioning programs for improving work outcomes in workers with back pain.BACKGROUND: Physical conditioning programs aim to improve work status for workers on sick leave. This is an update of a Cochrane Review (Work conditioning, work hardening and functional restoration for workers with back and neck pain) first published in 2003. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of physical conditioning programs in reducing time lost from work for workers with back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to June/July 2008: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 3), MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982, PsycINFO from 1967, and PEDro. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs that studied workers with work disability related to back pain and who were included in physical conditioning programs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-seven references, reporting on 23 RCTs (3676 workers) were included, 13 of which had a low risk of bias. In 14 studies, physical conditioning programs were compared to usual care. In workers with acute back pain, there was no effect on sickness absence. For workers with subacute back pain, we found conflicting results, but subgroup analysis showed a positive effect of interventions with workplace involvement. In workers with chronic back pain, pooled results of five studies showed a small effect on sickness absence at long-term follow-up (SMD: -0.18 (95% CI: -0.37 to 0.00)). In workers with chronic back pain, physical conditioning programs were compared to other exercise therapy in six studies, with conflicting results. The addition of cognitive behavioural therapy to physical conditioning programs was not more effective than the physical conditioning alone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of physical conditioning programs in reducing sick leave when compared to usual care or than other <e>exercises</e> in workers with back pain remains uncertain. In workers with acute back pain, these programs probably have no effect on sick leave, but there may be a positive effect on sick leave for workers with subacute and chronic back pain. Workplace involvement might improve the outcome. Better understanding of the mechanism behind physical conditioning programs and return-to-work is needed to be able to develop more effective interventions.",M1
20077989,"A trial of a comprehensive nursing rehabilitation program for nursing home residents post-hospitalization.This pilot study examined the feasibility of implementing a comprehensive nursing rehabilitation program (CNRP) designed to promote the physical functioning of moderately frail nursing home residents post-hospitalization. The 4-week to 8-week CNRP incorporated three interventions: the Capacity Intervention (improving strength and balance), Performance Intervention (fostering daily mobility and activity), and Facilitating Intervention (providing education, support, and stress management). A longitudinal design was used with a convenience sample of 24 moderately frail residents. The CNRP was found to be not practical as designed because the intervention occurred too close to hospital discharge, and many prospective participants did not  feel up  to participating in a voluntary nursing rehabilitation program in addition to other prescribed rehabilitation. Regardless, participants were found to be able to perform the <e>exercises</e> safely and the CNRP was easily implemented in nursing homes. Testing the efficacy of the CNRP with nursing home residents is recommended after the initial post-hospitalization period.",M1
20072041,"Effectiveness of strengthening and stretching <e>exercises</e> for the postural correction of abducted scapulae: a review.Abnormal postural alignment can be detrimental to muscle function, is aesthetically unpleasing, and might contribute to joint pain. It has been unclear as to whether stretching or strengthening exercises can correct faulty posture such as abducted scapulae. It has been postulated that short and tight scapular abductor muscles or weak and lengthened scapular retractor muscles or a combination cause an abducted scapulae posture and that exercise can correct this condition. The purpose of this review was to compile the information on factors influencing scapular position at rest, examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions in altering scapular position, and make recommendations for future research. When examining the different methods that have been used to determine the position of the scapula, attention should be paid to their respective reliability and validity. Correlational studies have failed to detect a significant association between muscle strength and scapular position but found a significant relationship between muscle length and scapular position. Prospective intervention studies have shown that stretching the anterior chest muscles on its own or in combination with strengthening the scapular retractors can alter the position of the scapula at rest in individuals with abducted scapulae. Although these results are encouraging, there is a dearth of high-quality studies and more research is required to address the limitations of the studies. None of the intervention studies measured strength or flexibility pre or post intervention, so it is unclear how effective the intervention was in changing these factors and the actual mechanism behind the change. To determine which component of the intervention is most effective and whether the results are additive, future research should include stretching only, strengthening only, and combined stretching and strengthening groups. Follow-up measurements at some period after completion of the intervention would also provide important information as to the permanency of any changes. The practical implication is that caution must be displayed when considering the promotion of strengthening exercises to try and correct for abnormal scapular posture until further evidence becomes available.",M1
20070145,"Effects of Feldenkrais <e>exercises</e> on balance, mobility, balance confidence, and gait performance in community-dwelling adults age 65 and older.BACKGROUND: Falls and fall-related injuries are a major public health concern, a financial challenge for health care providers, and critical issues for older adults. Poor balance and limited mobility are major risk factors for falls. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine effects of Feldenkrais exercises in improving balance, mobility, and balance confidence in older adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 47, mean age 75.6) were randomly assigned to a Feldenkrais group (FG, n = 25) or to a control group (CG, n = 22). The FG group attended a 5-week Feldenkrais program, 60 minutes three times per week, while the CG group was a waitlist control. The outcome measures were balance (tandem stance), mobility (Timed Up and Go), gait characteristics (GAITRite Walkway System), balance confidence (Balance Confidence Scale; ABC), and fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale). Pre- and post-tests were conducted. RESULTS: After completion of the program, balance (p = 0.030) and mobility (p = 0.042) increased while fear of falling (p = 0.042) decreased significantly for the FG group. No other significant changes were observed. However, participants of the FG group showed improvements in balance confidence (p = 0.054) and mobility while performing concurrently a cognitive task (p = 0.067). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Feldenkrais exercises are an effective way to improve balance and mobility, and thus offer an alternative method to help offset age-related declines in mobility and reduce the risk of falling among community-dwelling older adults. A long-term follow-up study of balance and mobility is warranted. Further research is needed to identify whether Feldenkrais exercises may impact cognitive processes.",M1
20068432,"Exercise intervention research on persons with disabilities: what we know and where we need to go.The purpose of this article was to provide a comprehensive review of the exercise intervention literature on persons with physical and cognitive disabilities. Electronic searches were conducted to identify research articles published from 1986 to 2006. Of the 80 physical activity/exercise interventions identified in the literature, only 32 were randomized controlled trials. The remaining studies were nonrandomized controlled trials with (n = 16) and without (n = 32) a control group. There was a mixture of exercise training modalities that involved aerobic (26%), strength (25%), and combined aerobic and strength (23%) <e>exercises</e>, but there were no overlapping studies using the same dose of exercise for any of the 11 disability groups. Almost half the studies targeted stroke (20%), multiple sclerosis (15%), and intellectual disability (13%), with significantly fewer studies targeting other disability groups. The current literature on exercise and disability is extremely broad in scope and has limited generalizability to any specific disability group. A new body of evidence is needed with stronger research designs that adhere to precise dosing characteristics for key health outcomes (e.g., pain/fatigue reduction, improved cardiorespiratory health). Multicenter trials will be needed for low-prevalence populations to strengthen research designs and increase generalizability of study findings.",M1

20068208,"Platelet-rich plasma injection for chronic Achilles tendinopathy: a randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT: Tendon disorders comprise 30% to 50% of all activity-related injuries; chronic degenerative tendon disorders (tendinopathy) occur frequently and are difficult to treat. Tendon regeneration might be improved by injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an increasingly used treatment for releasing growth factors into the degenerative tendon. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a PRP injection would improve outcome in chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A stratified, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single center (The Hague Medical Center, Leidschendam, The Netherlands) of 54 randomized patients aged 18 to 70 years with chronic tendinopathy 2 to 7 cm above the Achilles tendon insertion. The trial was conducted between August 28, 2008, and January 29, 2009, with follow-up until July 16, 2009. INTERVENTION: Eccentric <e>exercises</e> (usual care) with either a PRP injection (PRP group) or saline injection (placebo group). Randomization was stratified by activity level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The validated Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire, which evaluated pain score and activity level, was completed at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 weeks. The VISA-A score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores corresponding with less pain and increased activity. Treatment group effects were evaluated using general linear models on the basis of intention-to-treat. RESULTS: After randomization into the PRP group (n = 27) or placebo group (n = 27), there was complete follow-up of all patients. The mean VISA-A score improved significantly after 24 weeks in the PRP group by 21.7 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0-30.5) and in the placebo group by 20.5 points (95% CI, 11.6-29.4). The increase was not significantly different between both groups (adjusted between-group difference from baseline to 24 weeks, -0.9; 95% CI, -12.4 to 10.6). This CI did not include the predefined relevant difference of 12 points in favor of PRP treatment. CONCLUSION: Among patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy who were treated with eccentric exercises, a PRP injection compared with a saline injection did not result in greater improvement in pain and activity.

20054643,"Pre-operative assessment enables early diagnosis and recovery of shoulder function in patients with breast cancer.In order to determine the extent and time course of upper limb impairment and dysfunction in women being treated for breast cancer (BC), and followed prospectively, a novel physical therapy surveillance model post-treatment was used. Subjects included adult women with newly diagnosed, untreated, unilateral, Stage I to III BC, and normal physiological and biomechanical shoulder function. Subjects were excluded if they had a previous history of BC, or prior injury or surgery of the affected upper limb. Measurements included body weight, shoulder ranges of motion (ROM), manual muscle tests, pain levels, upper limb volume, and an upper limb disability questionnaire (ULDQ). Measurements were taken at baseline (pre-surgery), and 1, 3-6, and 12 months post-surgery. All subjects received pre-operative education and exercise instruction and specific physical therapy (PT) protocol after surgery including ROM and strengthening <e>exercises</e>. All measures of function were significantly reduced 1 month post-surgery, but most recovered to baseline levels by 1-year post-surgery. Some subjects developed signs of lymphedema 3-12 months post-surgery, but this did not compromise function. Shoulder abduction, flexion, and external rotation, but not internal rotation ROM, were associated with the ULDQ. Most women in this cohort undergoing surgery for BC who receive PT intervention may expect a return to baseline ROM and strength by 3 months. Those who do not reach baseline, often continue to improve and reach their pre-operative levels by 1-year post-surgery. Lymphedema develops independently of shoulder function 3-12 months post-surgery, necessitating continued monitoring. A prospective physical therapy model of surveillance allows for detection of early and later onset of impairment following surgery for BC in this specific cohort of patients.",M1
20051618,"Effect of 6 weeks wobble board <e>exercises</e> on static and dynamic balance of stroke survivors.Balance is a complex motor skill and it is frequently disturbed among stroke survivors. Rehabilitation experts are still facing challenges in achieving good stability. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of a wobble board exercise program on static and dynamic balance of hemiplegic subjects. Seventeen (17) stroke survivors were randomly selected into two groups. The subjects in the experimental group were trained on wobble board for six weeks while the control group received only the baseline treatment programs. The modified version of the timed balance test was used to assess balance while the foursquare step test was used to assess dynamic balance. Descriptive statistics and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the data obtained. The result showed that there was significant difference in the static balance (eye closed) (F=7.49, P&lt; 0.05) and dynamic balance (F3.20, P&lt; 0.05) between the groups but there was no significant difference in static balance (eye opened) (F= 1.75, P&gt; 0.05).

20048519,"A lower-limb training program to improve balance in healthy elderly women using the T-bow device.Ageing impairs balance, which increases the risk of falls. Fall-related injuries are a serious health problem associated with dependency and disability in the elderly and results in high costs to public health systems. This study aims to determine the effects of a training program to develop balance using a new device called the T-Bow. A total of 28 women &gt; 65 years were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) (n = 18; 69.50 [0.99] years), or a control group (CG) (n = 10; 70.70 [2.18] years). A program for lower limbs was applied for 8 weeks using 5 <e>exercises</e> on the T-Bow: squat, lateral and frontal swings, lunges, and plantarflexions. The intensity of the exercises was controlled by time of exposure, support base, and ratings of perceived exertion. Clinical tests were used to evaluate variables of balance. Static balance was measured by a 1-leg balance test (unipedal stance test), dynamic balance was measured by the 8-foot-up-and-go test, and overall balance was measured using the Tinetti test. Results for the EG showed an increase of 35.2% in static balance (P &lt; 0.005), 12.7% in dynamic balance (P &lt; 0.005), and 5.9% in overall balance (P &gt; 0.05).

20045807,"What's in team rehabilitation care after arthroplasty for osteoarthritis? Results from a multicenter, longitudinal study assessing structure, process, and outcome.BACKGROUND: Clinical course and outcome connected to rehabilitation after hip or knee arthroplasty have been studied extensively, but few studies have assessed the content of team rehabilitation care for these patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to provide a thorough description of the structure, process, and outcome of team rehabilitation care for patients with hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. DESIGN: This was a multicenter, longitudinal observational study. METHODS: Patients (N=183) from 6 rehabilitation centers in Norway who were undergoing inpatient rehabilitation following hip or knee arthroplasty were included in the study. Structure and process components were recorded by participants and health care professionals in a patient diary. Participants also completed questionnaires regarding their experiences during their rehabilitation stay and recorded data for outcome measures at admission, at discharge, and 6 months after discharge. The main outcome measures were pain intensity and physical function, as assessed with the physical function scale of the Medical OUTCOMES: Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Data were complete for 172 participants (94%) at discharge and for 148 patients (81%) at the 6-month follow-up. Health care professionals, physical therapists, nurses, and physicians were most often involved in team care. Occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists were seldom part of the rehabilitation team. <e>Exercises</e> provided by physical therapists were the most common treatment modality. Patient education, massage, and manual therapy also frequently were provided. The participants were very satisfied with their care and its organization, information, and communication and with the availability of health care professionals. They were moderately satisfied with the social environment of the rehabilitation setting. The participants had large improvements in the outcome measures during the rehabilitation stay and at the 6-month follow-up. LIMITATIONS: For typical physical therapy modalities such as exercises, electrotherapy, and acupuncture, there are limited descriptions and assessments of treatment doses. CONCLUSIONS: Current team rehabilitation care involves a traditional team with physical therapists, nurses, and physicians. Several types of treatment modalities are used, with greatest emphasis on physical training. This detailed description of current team rehabilitation practice might help clinicians and researchers in planning clinical trials within a rehabilitation setting, as well as in improving rehabilitation practice.",M1
20044704,"Effects of a wobble board-based therapeutic exergaming system for balance training on dynamic postural stability and intrinsic motivation levels.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of wobble board <e>exercises</e> with and without feedback provided through integrating the wobble board movement into a computer game system, by comparing changes in postural stability and motivation. BACKGROUND: Therapeutic exergaming systems may offer a solution to poor adherence to postural control exercise regimes by improving motivation levels during exercise performance. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy adults, randomly assigned to an exergaming group (n = 11) and a control group (n = 11), completed 12 exercise sessions. Dynamic postural stability was quantified at baseline and follow-up using the star excursion balance test and the dynamic postural stability index during a jump-landing task. Intrinsic motivation was measured at baseline using the Self-Motivation Inventory and at follow-up using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. RESULTS: Star excursion balance test scores showed a statistically significant (P&lt;.008) improvement in the posteromedial and posterolateral direction for both groups. No within-group change for the dynamic postural stability index or between-group difference for star excursion balance test or dynamic postural stability index scores were observed. The  interest and enjoyment  category of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory showed significantly higher scores (P&lt;.001) in the exergaming group at follow-up, which was 1 of the 5 Intrinsic Motivation Inventory categories evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that exercising with the therapeutic exergaming system showed similar improvements in dynamic postural stability and showed a greater level of interest and enjoyment when compared to a group doing similar balance training without the game system.

A randomized controlled trial comparing effectiveness of two walking exercise programmes late after stroke.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate spatial and temporal gait characteristics and endurance late after stroke in people who had received two different walking <e>exercises</e>. A secondary aim was to compare the outcomes in relation to length of time exercising and number of exercise occasions between the two. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A private rehabilitation centre. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine people with stroke entered the study, and five dropped out. INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill training versus walking outdoors. MAIN MEASURES: Six-Minute Walk Test, a 10-metre walk test and pulse rates at rest and in activity. RESULTS: There were significant differences in favour of the treadmill group in Six-Minute Walk Test distance (P = 0.04), Six-Minute Walk Test speed (P = 0.03), 10-m walking speed (P = 0.03), bilateral stride length (right leg; P = 0.009, left leg; P = 0.003) and step width (P = 0.01), indicating more symmetrical use of the legs in the treadmill group (1.02-1.10 m versus 0.97-0.92 m). There were no significant differences between groups in cadence (P = 0.78). All participants complied 100% with their respective programmes. Exercise frequency did not differ between the groups but significantly less time was spent exercising on the treadmill compared with walking exercise outdoors (107 versus 316 minutes, P = 0.002). There were no differences in use of assistive aids between the groups on arrival at the clinic or at departure. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that treadmill walking improves spatial and temporal gait characteristics more effectively than walking outdoors.",M1

This study determines the effect of two treatment protocols on five occupationally subgrouped male LBP patients. METHODS: A total of 102 occupational male, 20-40 yrs of age, with sub-acute or chronic nonspecific LBP were randomized and treated either with conventional treatment a combination of two electrotherapy (ultrasound and short wave diathermy) and one exercise therapy (lumbar strengthening <e>exercises</e>) or dynamic muscular stabilization techniques (DMST) an active approach of stabilizing training. At the end of the treatment, subjects of both the groups were further stratified in five subgroups on the basis of their occupation. The pain was the primary outcome measure while physical strength [back pressure changes (BPC) and abdominal pressure changes (APC)] the secondary. RESULTS: The Pain, BPC and APC of all subgroups improved significantly (P &lt; 0.01) in the both treatments but more in DMST. For each variable, improvement in subgroups differed within and between the treatments. Overall improvement in all assessed variables were evident on Desk workers followed by Shop keepers the most while BPC of Movement job, APC of Others and Pain of Sedentary and Shop keepers improved the least. CONCLUSIONS: Study concluded that for the management of occupational LBP, DMST is more effective than conventional treatment. The Pain of Sedentary and Shopkeepers and physical strength of Movement job and Others may need more clinical attention. Findings of this study may be helpful in the management of occupational LBP.",M1
20019617,"Musculoskeletal rehabilitation in the person with scleroderma.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to examine current evidence for the efficacy of rehabilitation techniques for musculoskeletal impairments in persons with scleroderma. RECENT FINDINGS: The current literature on rehabilitation techniques consists of studies evaluating the effectiveness of paraffin wax treatment, hand and face stretching <e>exercises</e>, connective tissue massage and joint manipulation, splints, and aerobic exercise and resistance training. Only four randomized controlled trials were found and except for those studies, the majority of studies involved small sample sizes and no control groups. However, except for splints, these studies show improvement in joint motion, hand function, and cardiopulmonary endurance. SUMMARY: Although the results from these small studies are promising, larger, randomized controlled studies are needed to fully determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation techniques for persons with scleroderma.",M1
19995464,"Predictive factors of adherence to frequency and duration components in home exercise programs for neck and low back pain: an observational study.BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that to facilitate physical activity sedentary people may adhere to one component of exercise prescriptions (intensity, duration or frequency) without adhering to other components. Some experts have provided evidence for determinants of adherence to different components among healthy people. However, our understanding remains scarce in this area for patients with neck or low back pain. The aims of this study are to determine whether patients with neck or low back pain have different rates of adherence to exercise components of frequency per week and duration per session when prescribed with a home exercise program, and to identify if adherence to both exercise components have distinct predictive factors. METHODS: A cohort of one hundred eighty-four patients with chronic neck or low back pain who attended physiotherapy in eight primary care centers were studied prospectively one month after intervention. The study had three measurement periods: at baseline (measuring characteristics of patients and pain), at the end of physiotherapy intervention (measuring characteristics of the home exercise program) and a month later (measuring professional behaviors during clinical encounters, environmental factors and self-efficacy, and adherence behavior). RESULTS: Adherence to duration per session (70.9% +/- 7.1) was more probable than adherence to frequency per week (60.7% +/- 7.0). Self-efficacy was a relevant factor for both exercise components (p &lt; 0.05). The total number of <e>exercises</e> prescribed was predictive of frequency adherence (p &lt; 0.05). Professional behaviors have a distinct influence on exercise components. Frequency adherence is more probable if patients received clarification of their doubts (adjusted OR: 4.1; p &lt; 0.05), and duration adherence is more probable if they are supervised during the learning of exercises (adjusted OR: 3.3; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: We have shown in a clinic-based study that adherence to exercise prescription frequency and duration components have distinct levels and predictive factors. We recommend additional study, and advise that differential attention be given in clinical practice to each exercise component for improving adherence.",M1

METHODS: Seventy one cases were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty six cases in the observation group were treated with acupuncture on Zhongji (CV 3), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Chize (LU 5) etc. and tortoise-shell moxibustion on Shenque (CV 8) combined with pelvic floor muscle exercises; while thirty five cases in the control group were treated with only pelvic floor muscle exercises. The scores of the International Consultation Committee on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICI-Q-SF) and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36) were evaluated before and after treatment, and the scores of SF-36 were also compared with 35 cases in normal group. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 91.7% in the observation group was higher than that of 77.1% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The dimensions of SF-36 of stress urinary incontinence patients were remarkably lower than those of normal group (all P &lt; 0.05). The scores of ICI-Q-SF were decreased while the scores of SF-36 were increased obviously after treatment in both the observation group and the control group, there were pronounced improvements on physiological function, pain, physical activity, social function and affection function in the observation group (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The quality of life for female stress urinary incontinence patients may be poor, however the dog-day acupuncture and tortoise-shell moxibustion combined with pelvic floor muscle exercises can improve the symptoms of urinary incontinence and increase the quality of life of patients.",M1
19969179,"Body weight-supported treadmill training for patients with hip fracture: a feasibility study.Giangregorio LM, Thabane L, deBeer J, Farrauto L, McCartney N, Adachi JD, Papaioannou A. Body weight-supported treadmill training for patients with hip fracture: a feasibility study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) as a strategy for improving independent ambulation among patients who had sustained a hip fracture. DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a stable hip fracture and at least 50% weight-bearing. INTERVENTION: BWSTT in lieu of standard walking <e>exercises</e> throughout stay in rehabilitation. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Feasibility outcomes included the number of patients agreeing to participate in treadmill walking, the number who returned for follow-up assessments, compliance, and the number of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, the Timed Up &amp; Go test, a 2-minute walk test, and the Falls Self-Efficacy Scale. Univariate regression was used to assess the group effect on score changes from baseline to discharge and from baseline to follow-up. RESULTS: Among 41 potentially eligible patients, 21 (51%) agreed to participate and 14 returned for follow-up assessments. The recruitment goal of 12 patients agreeing to BWSTT was achieved; however, retention by 3-month follow-up was 67%. The average compliance was 3 sessions a week; however, several patients were below average. No adverse events of BWSTT were reported. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: BWSTT may be a feasible method for retraining gait among patients with hip fracture. However, future studies evaluating its efficacy need rigorous methods for ensuring compliance and retention.",M1
19966605,"Randomized controlled trial shows biofeedback to be superior to pelvic floor <e>exercises</e> for fecal incontinence.PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare manometric biofeedback with pelvic floor exercises for the treatment of fecal incontinence in a randomized controlled trial controlling for nonspecific treatment effects. METHODS: After excluding patients who were adequately treated with medication, education, and behavioral strategies (21%), 108 patients (83 females; average age, 59.6 years) underwent either pelvic floor exercises alone (n = 63) or manometric biofeedback plus pelvic floor exercises (n = 45). Patients in both groups were taught behavioral strategies to avoid incontinence. RESULTS: At three-month follow-up, biofeedback patients had significantly greater reductions on the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (P = 0.01) and fewer days with fecal incontinence (P = 0.083). Biofeedback training increased anal canal squeeze pressure more than pelvic floor exercises did (P = 0.014) and with less abdominal tension during squeeze (P = 0.001). Three months after training 76% of patients treated with biofeedback vs. 41% patients treated with pelvic floor exercises (chi-squared = 12.5, P &lt; 0.001) reported adequate relief. Before treatment, the groups did not differ on demographic, physiologic, or psychologic variables, symptom severity, duration of illness, quality-of-life impact, or expectation of benefit. At 12-month follow-up, biofeedback patients continued to show significantly greater reduction in Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores (F = 4.83, P = 0.03), and more patients continued to report adequate relief (chi-squared = 3.64, P = 0.056). CONCLUSION: This investigation provides definitive support for the efficacy of biofeedback. Biofeedback training resulted in greater reductions in fecal incontinence severity and days with fecal incontinence. Biofeedback was also more effective than pelvic floor exercises alone in producing adequate relief of fecal incontinence symptoms in patients for whom conservative medical management had failed.",M1
19964430,"Mobile tools for home-based cardiac rehabilitation based on heart rate and movement activity analysis.Cardiac rehabilitation programs are traditionally carried out in hospitals and health centers under the direct personal supervision of mentoring clinicians. Patient barriers, such as time constraints and distance from treatment centers, have lead to poor uptake of programs among eligible patients. To overcome these barriers, home-based care models have been proposed as a viable alternative to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. We have developed a measurement system and software tools on a mobile phone platform enabling patients to participate in a home-based cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. A mobile application, TuneWalk, gives guidance to the patients during home <e>exercises</e> using heart rate and physical activity analysis and also stores long-term information about their progress during the weeks of the rehabilitation program. The measured data are also sent to a server for remote exercise performance analysis and consultation by the patient's personal mentor.",M1
19963669,"Rate estimation for the monitoring of rehabilitation <e>exercises</e>.This study investigates the rate estimation problem encountered in rehabilitation exercise monitoring by using noninvasive portable sensors. The purpose of this paper has two main parts. The first part is to find suitable approaches for the rate detection of tri-axial accelerometer (TA) signals and ECG signals respectively. It is found that the integral type approaches (the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) and autocorrelation function (ACF)) are particularly suitable for TA signal pre-processing, while differential type approaches are very efficient for electrocardiographic (ECG) signal pre-processing. The second part is to develop a square wave matching method to detect the rate from the pre-processed signals. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can effectively detect pace rate from TA and heart rate from ECG and remove undesirable spikes.",M1
19962601,"Sensory retraining after orthognathic surgery: effect on patient report of altered sensations.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether, over a 2-year period after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, patients who received facial sensory-retraining <e>exercises</e> with standard opening exercises in the first 6 months after surgery were as likely to report an alteration in facial sensation as those who received standard opening exercises only. METHODS: 186 subjects were enrolled in a multi-center, double-blind, stratified-block, randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups. Patient reports of altered sensations were obtained before surgery, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. A marginal model was fit to examine the effect of sensory retraining while controlling for potential explanatory effects related to demographic, psychological, and clinical factors on the odds of postoperative altered sensations being reported. RESULTS: Age (P &lt;0.0001) and severity of presurgical psychological distress (P &lt;0.0001) were significantly associated with the presence of altered sensations after controlling for the exercise training received. After controlling for age and psychological distress, patients who received opening exercises only were approximately 2.2 times more likely to report postoperative altered sensations than those who also received sensory-retraining exercises (P &lt;0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a simple noninvasive exercise program started shortly after orthognathic surgery can lessen the likelihood that a patient will report altered sensations in the long term after orthognathic surgery.",M1
19954546,"A randomised clinical trial of a comprehensive exercise program for chronic whiplash: trial protocol.BACKGROUND: Whiplash is the most common injury following a motor vehicle accident. Approximately 60% of people suffer persistent pain and disability six months post injury. Two forms of exercise; specific motor relearning <e>exercises</e> and graded activity, have been found to be effective treatments for this condition. Although the effect sizes for these exercise programs, individually, are modest, pilot data suggest much larger effects on pain and disability are achieved when these two treatments are combined. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this comprehensive exercise approach for chronic whiplash. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred and seventy-six participants with chronic grade I to II whiplash will be recruited in Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. All participants will receive an educational booklet on whiplash and in addition, those randomised to the comprehensive exercise group (specific motor relearning and graded activity exercises) will receive 20 progressive and individually-tailored, 1 hour exercise sessions over a 12 week period (specific motor relearning exercises: 8 sessions over 4 weeks; graded activity: 12 sessions over 8 weeks). The primary outcome to be assessed is pain intensity. Other outcomes of interest include disability, health-related quality of life and health service utilisation. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 14 weeks, 6 months and 12 months by an assessor who is blinded to the group allocation of the subjects. Recruitment is due to commence in late 2009. DISCUSSION: The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a simple treatment for the management of chronic whiplash.

19949280,"Resistive vibration exercise reduces lower limb muscle atrophy during 56-day bed-rest.OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a resistive vibration exercise countermeasure during prolonged bed-rest in preventing lower-limb muscle atrophy. METHODS: 20 male subjects underwent 56-days of bed-rest and were assigned to either an inactive control, or a countermeasure group which performed high-load resistive <e>exercises</e> (including squats, heel raises and toe raises) with whole-body vibration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower-limbs was performed at two-weekly intervals. Volume of individual muscles was calculated. RESULTS: Countermeasure exercise reduced atrophy in the triceps surae and the vastii muscles (F&gt;3.0, p&lt;.025). Atrophy of the peroneals, tibialis posterior and toe flexors was less in the countermeasure-subjects, though statistical evidence for this was weak (F&lt;or=2.3, p&gt;or=.071). Atrophy in the hamstring muscles was similar in both groups (F&lt;1.1, p&gt;.38). The adductor longus, sartiorius and rectus femoris muscles showed little loss of muscle volume during bed-rest (F&lt;1.7, p&gt;.15).

19939723,"Experiences of individuals with chronic low back pain during and after their participation in a spinal stabilisation exercise programme - a pilot qualitative study.Spinal stabilisation <e>exercises</e> are commonly used in the management of low back pain (LBP). There is limited evidence relating to patients' experiences of their involvement in such programmes. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of a sample of individuals with chronic LBP who participated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the most efficacious dosage and frequency of spinal stabilisation exercises. The qualitative study involved nine participants who took part in focus group discussions. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis and provided insights into the experiences of the participants. Four themes emerged: Physical dimensions of the LBP experience, emotional and psychological dimensions of the LBP experience and perceived effects of the programme and lastly, the impact of the treatment programme on participants' knowledge, understanding and adherence. In conclusion participants' experiences were not limited to the positive effects of stabilisation exercises on pain, functional disability and quality of life, but also reflected increases in confidence, the formulation of self help strategies and the ability to exert better control over their LBP. The findings highlight the importance of well planned associated educational support packages in the treatment of LBP paving the way for future qualitative research.",M1
19929770,"People with low back pain who have externalised beliefs need to see greater improvements in symptoms to consider <e>exercises</e> worthwhile: an observational study.QUESTION: Does health locus of control predict the smallest worthwhile effect of motor control exercise or spinal manipulative therapy when adjusted for severity of pain? DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: 86 people with non-specific low back pain who had not yet commenced physiotherapy intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors were severity of pain measured over the last 7 days using an 11-point scale from 0 to 10, and external and internal health loci of control measured using Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale. The outcome of interest was smallest worthwhile effect which was measured in terms of the percentage perceived change necessary to make two evidence-based physiotherapy interventions for non-specific low back pain (motor control exercise and spinal manipulative therapy) worthwhile. Data were collected before intervention commenced. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that when adjusted for pain and internal locus of control, external locus of control predicted the smallest worthwhile effect for motor control exercise (B 0.79; CI 0.10 to 1.48), explaining 0.07 of the variance. None of the predictors significantly predicted the smallest worthwhile effect for spinal manipulative therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with low back pain who have externalised beliefs and agree more strongly with the notion that others are responsible for their condition report higher estimates of smallest worthwhile effect of an active intervention such as motor control exercise than patients who do not have externalised beliefs.",M1
19926285,"Apparatus for monitoring load bearing rehabilitation <e>exercises</e> of a transfemoral amputee fitted with an osseointegrated fixation: a proof-of-concept study.The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to determine the relevance of direct measurements to monitor the load applied on the osseointegrated fixation of transfemoral amputees during static load bearing exercises. The objectives were (A) to introduce an apparatus using a three-dimensional load transducer, (B) to present a range of derived information relevant to clinicians, (C) to report on the outcomes of a pilot study and (D) to compare the measurements from the transducer with those from the current method using a weighing scale. One transfemoral amputee fitted with an osseointegrated implant was asked to apply 10 kg, 20 kg, 40 kg and 80 kg on the fixation, using self-monitoring with the weighing scale. The loading was directly measured with a portable kinetic system including a six-channel transducer, external interface circuitry and a laptop. As the load prescribed increased from 10 kg to 80 kg, the forces and moments applied on and around the antero-posterior axis increased by four-fold anteriorly and 14-fold medially, respectively. The forces and moments applied on and around the medio-lateral axis increased by nine-fold laterally and 16-fold from anterior to posterior, respectively. The long axis of the fixation was overloaded and underloaded in 17% and 83% of the trials, respectively, by up to + or - 10%. This proof-of-concept study presents an apparatus that can be used by clinicians facing the challenge of improving basic knowledge on osseointegration, for the design of equipment for load bearing exercises and for rehabilitation programs.",M1
19920281,"Conservative management of idiopathic scoliosis--guidelines based on SOSORT 2006 Consensus.BACKGROUND: Idiopathic scoliosis, defined as a lateral curvature of the spine of above 10 degrees (Cobb angle), is seen in 2-3% of the growing age population, while curves above 20 degrees , requiring conservative treatment, are found in 0.3-0.5%. In our observation, both under-treatment of progressive curves and over-treatment of stable cases are common during conservative management of scoliosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A model of therapeutic management is presented based on the experience of Polish clinicians specialising in the treatment of scoliosis as well as the effects of work of a panel of experts of SOSORT (Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment). The model comprises the indications for conservative treatment according to age, curve type and size and Risser grading. The aetiology, classifications, usefulness of the Lonstein and Carlson factor of progression and other methods of determining the probability of scoliosis progression, as well as the psychological aspects of conservative management are presented. RESULTS: Based on the knowledge of the natural history of idiopathic scoliosis, factors of progression and on the SOSORT experts' opinion, guidelines are proposed for clinicians treating children and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, including the timing and course of brace treatment and the types of <e>exercises</e>.

19910823,"Comparison of resistance and concurrent resistance and endurance training regimes in the development of strength.Resistance and endurance training are often performed concurrently in most exercise programs and in rehabilitative settings in an attempt to acquire gains in more than 1 physiologic system. However, it has been proposed that by simultaneously performing these 2 modes of exercise training, the strength gains achieved by resistance training alone may be impaired. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of 16 weeks of resistance training and concurrent resistance and endurance training on muscular strength development in 38 sedentary, apparently healthy males (25 yr +/- 8 mo). Subjects were age-matched and randomly assigned to either a control (Con) group (n = 12), resistance training (Res) group (n = 13), or concurrent resistance and endurance training (Com) group (n = 13). After 16 weeks, no changes were found in the strength of the subjects in the Con group. Resistance training and concurrent resistance and endurance training significantly (p &lt; or = 0.05) improved strength in all of the 8 prescribed <e>exercises</e>. The data also indicated that 16 weeks of concurrent resistance training and endurance training was as effective in eliciting improvements in strength as resistance training alone in previously sedentary males. As such, concurrent resistance and endurance training does not impede muscular strength gains and can be prescribed simultaneously for the development of strength in sedentary, apparently healthy males and thus may invoke all the physiologic adaptations of resistance and endurance training at once.",M1
19910807,"Electromyographic analysis of the gluteus medius in five weight-bearing <e>exercises</e>.Weight-bearing exercises are frequently used to train and strengthen muscles of the hip. These exercises have been advocated in the rehabilitation of a variety of hip and knee dysfunctions. Limited evidence is available to describe the level of muscle activation occurring with specific weight-bearing exercises. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of activation of the gluteus medius muscle as measured by electromyographic (EMG) signal amplitude in 5 weight-bearing exercises. Twenty healthy subjects aged 21 to 30 years participated in the study. The EMG surface electrodes were positioned over the muscle belly of the gluteus medius. Subjects performed 5 exercises that consisted of bilateral stance, single limb stance, single limb stance on both a firm surface and an Airex cushion, and single limb squat on a firm surface and an Airex cushion. Statistical differences (rho &lt; 0.05) in gluteus medius EMG values were found between single limb stance as compared with double limb stance, and single limb squat as compared with single limb stance. Single limb stance places more demands on the gluteus medius than double limb stance, whereas single limb squats are more demanding than single limb stance. Although exercises performed on an Airex cushion produced greater EMG values as compared with a firm surface, the difference was not statistically significant. The results, however, suggest that if the goal is to increase the challenge to the gluteus medius, dynamic, single limb exercises performed on unstable surfaces, such as a balance cushion, may place greater demands on the gluteus medius than similar exercises performed on stable surfaces.",M1

A randomized controlled clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether surface electrical stimulation can increase the effectiveness of task-related <e>exercises</e> for improving the walking capacity of patients with chronic stroke. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Home-based programme. SUBJECTS: One hundred and nine hemiparetic stroke survivors were assigned randomly to: (1) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), (2) TENS + exercise, (3) placebo stimulation + exercise, or (4) control group. INTERVENTIONS: The TENS group received 60 minutes of electrical stimulation. Both the TENS + exercise group and placebo stimulation + exercise group did 60 minutes of exercises, followed respectively by 60 minutes of electrical and placebo stimulation. Treatment was given five days a week for four weeks. The control group had no active treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Comfortable gait speed was measured using a GAITRite II walkway system. Walking endurance and functional mobility were measured by the distance covered during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and by timed up and go test scores before treatment, after two weeks and after four weeks of treatment, and at follow-up four weeks after treatment ended. RESULTS: When compared with the other three groups, only the combined TENS + exercise group showed significantly greater absolute and percentage increases in gait velocity (by 37.1-57.5%, all P&lt;0.01) and reduction in timed up and go scores (by -14.9 to -23.3%, P&lt;0.01) from week 2 onwards. When compared with the control and TENS groups, only the combined TENS + exercise group covered significantly more distance in the 6MWT (by 22.2-34.7%, P&lt;0.01) from week 2 onwards. CONCLUSION: TENS can improve the effectiveness of task-related exercise for increasing walking capacity in hemiparetic stroke survivors.",M1
19892856,"Motor control exercise for chronic low back pain: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The evidence that exercise intervention is effective for treatment of chronic low back pain comes from trials that are not placebo-controlled. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of motor control exercise for people with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in an outpatient physical therapy department in Australia. Patients The participants were 154 patients with chronic low back pain of more than 12 weeks' duration. INTERVENTION: Twelve sessions of motor control exercise (ie, <e>exercises</e> designed to improve function of specific muscles of the low back region and the control of posture and movement) or placebo (ie, detuned ultrasound therapy and detuned short-wave therapy) were conducted over 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were pain intensity, activity (measured by the Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and patient's global impression of recovery measured at 2 months. Secondary outcomes were pain; activity (measured by the Patient-Specific Functional Scale); patient's global impression of recovery measured at 6 and 12 months; activity limitation (measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) at 2, 6, and 12 months; and risk of persistent or recurrent pain at 12 months. RESULTS: The exercise intervention improved activity and patient's global impression of recovery but did not clearly reduce pain at 2 months. The mean effect of exercise on activity (measured by the Patient-Specific Functional Scale) was 1.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.3 to 1.8), the mean effect on global impression of recovery was 1.5 points (95% CI=0.4 to 2.5), and the mean effect on pain was 0.9 points (95% CI=-0.01 to 1.8), all measured on 11-point scales. Secondary outcomes also favored motor control exercise. Limitation Clinicians could not be blinded to the intervention they provided. CONCLUSIONS: Motor control exercise produced short-term improvements in global impression of recovery and activity, but not pain, for people with chronic low back pain. Most of the effects observed in the short term were maintained at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: Randomised, single-blind, controlled trial. SETTING: One secondary care teaching hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients were recruited. The follow-up rate was 28 (93%) at 4 weeks and 23 (77%) at 3 months. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to an intervention group commencing exercises within 2 hours after surgery, or a control group commencing exercises on the first postoperative day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included the time taken for the patient to become independently mobile and attain discharge criteria following surgery. Secondary outcome measures were disability and pain scores collected before surgery, and 4 weeks and 3 months after surgery; and return to work rates. RESULTS: The two groups were similar at baseline. The results indicated significantly reduced time to independent mobility [median 7 vs 19 hours, median difference 9 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 14.5, P=0.009] and return to work (median 6 vs 8 weeks, median difference 2 weeks, 95% CI 0 to 6, P=0.002) in the intervention group compared with the control group.

There were no significant differences in disability and pain scores at 4 weeks and 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate commencement of exercises following first-time single-level lumbar microdiscectomy enabled patients to become independently mobile more rapidly and return to work sooner. Immediate commencement of exercises may enable patients to be discharged earlier, with associated cost benefits to health care and no increase in the rate of revision surgery.",M1
19888840,"The effect of a foot gymnastic exercise programme on gait performance in older adults: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Aged-related loss of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and toe plantarflexor strength play an important role in gait performance. Further, conventional strength, balance and gait training can significantly improve the lower extremity muscle power and functional abilities of older individuals. It remains unclear, however, whether training effects can be enhanced by augmenting ankle ROM and toe plantarflexor strength complementary to training. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of physical exercise combined with foot gymnastics on the gait performance in older adults. METHODS: Fifty-six independent living, older adults aged 66-91 years were randomly assigned to either foot gymnastics group (FG; n = 28) or training group (TG; n = 28). Further, 14 subjects were integrated as a control group (CG; n = 14) (no exercise). The FG and TG completed the same training program consisting of aerobic <e>exercises</e>, progressive resistance strength training and stretching exercises twice per week for 12 weeks, whereas the FG performed additional foot gymnastic exercises at the end of the training session and a 10-min foot gymnastics home-program daily. Assessments included the Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I), Expanded Timed Get-up-and-Go test (ETGUG), gait analysis and muscle power measurements of the knee and ankle joint at pre- and post-training. Results. No significant change in FES-I score occurred in either group. The FG showed a significant improvement of ankle ROM. There were significant time x group interactions in walking speed, step length, in several muscle power measurements and in ETGUG. The positive effects of gait parameters ranged between 1 and 11% and between 2 and 12%, of muscle power between 14 and 34% and 14 and 46% and of ETGUG were 10 and 8% for the FG and TG, respectively. The FG and TG did not differ significantly in their improvements. The CG showed a trend to deteriorations between 0 and -6% for gait parameters, between -4 and -14% for muscle power and 0% for ETGUG. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence of significant improvements in gait performance, muscle power and ETGUG after a conventional training program in independent living, older adults. However, there is no additional effect on physical performance after foot gymnastic exercises.",M1
19883474,"Maternal perceptions of infant exercise in the neonatal intensive care unit.OBJECTIVE: To identify important factors that influence mothers' perceptions of engaging in exercise with their preterm infants. DESIGN: Qualitative, semistructured individual interviews. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen mothers of preterm infants who were in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. METHODS: Two researchers conducted interviews with mothers in English or Spanish. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. RESULTS: Mothers tended to view infant exercise as beneficial but feared for the safety of their infants. They perceived nurses as experts who could safely exercise their infants but feared that they themselves might harm their infants. Factors that influenced their beliefs included previous experiences with infant exercise and views regarding the fragility or the strength of their own infants. Mothers identified nurses, doctors, family members, and research studies as trusted sources of information on exercise efficacy and safety. CONCLUSION: Understanding and addressing mothers' perceptions is a crucial component of a nursing intervention that teaches parents to do assisted <e>exercises</e> at home with their preterm infants.",M1

METHODS: Forty female patients with unilateral PFPS were randomly divided into two groups to receive exercises with the hip internally rotated (n=20, mean age 39.1 + or - 8.0 years) or externally rotated (n=20, mean age 36.1 + or - 8.7 years) with the use of the Monitored Rehab Functional Squat (MRFS) System. The duration of exercises was four weeks with a total of 20 sessions. Both groups were evaluated before therapy, after four weeks of exercises, and after six weeks of home exercise program with the MRFS System for muscle strength and proprioception, with a visual analog scale for pain, and with the Kujala questionnaire for functional assessment. RESULTS: Among baseline features, the only significant difference between the two groups was in the mean height (p&lt;0.05). Pain severity decreased significantly in both groups after treatment and home exercises (p&lt;0.05). Concentric and eccentric peak forces, concentric proprioceptive deficit, and Kujala scores improved significantly in both groups after treatment (p&lt;0.05), whereas improvements after home exercises were not significant in this respect (p&gt;0.05). Eccentric proprioceptive deficit, however, did not change significantly both after treatment and home exercises (p&gt;0.05). No significant differences were observed between the two groups during the study period with respect to the parameters assessed (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results show that functional knee squat exercises with internally and externally rotated hip positions provide similar improvements in muscle strength and proprioception in patients with PFPS.",M1

19873857,"Tackling persistent low back pain in primary care.Non-specific low back pain is pain or discomfort felt in the lower back, where there is no cause identified. It may include symptoms referred to the lower limbs. Those patients who develop chronic pain and disability persisting for more than a year are unlikely to resume normal activities. There is no reliable method of identifying structures responsible for non-specific low back pain. X-rays and MRI are considered to be unhelpful in improving treatment success, and are only recommended for those patients for whom surgery is being considered, or where serious pathology needs to be excluded. Patients should be encouraged to stay active, exercise and carry on with their normal activities. The following approach is recommended initially for persistent low back pain: advice and a stepped approach to analgesics with referral to a pain specialist if longer-term, strong opioids are required. In addition, patients should also be offered up to 12 weeks of one of the following: tailored <e>exercises</e>; manual therapy; or acupuncture. A second option should be offered if the first choice does not provide satisfactory improvement. Combined physical and psychological treatment for up to eight weeks is recommended for patients with severe disability and/or significant psychological distress who have had at least one of the above options.",M1
19858754,"Efficacy of dynamic muscular stabilization techniques (DMST) over conventional techniques in rehabilitation of chronic low back pain.Low back pain (LBP) is a common health problems. Although it is multifactorial, its treatment varies considerably, including medication, physical therapy modalities, and exercise therapy, and each have several interventions. Despite their effectiveness, their head-to-head comparisons are limited. This study was aimed at 1 such comparison. A total of 30 hockey players, 18 to 28 years of age, with subacute or chronic LBP were randomly assigned equally in 2 groups. One group was treated with conventional treatment--a combination of 2 electrotherapies (ultrasound and short-wave diathermy) and 1 exercise therapy (lumbar strengthening <e>exercises</e>)--and the other group was treated with dynamic muscular stabilization techniques (DMST), an active approach of stabilizing training. The results showed that both the treatments are effective in the management of LBP, but DMST was found to be more effective than conventional treatment. The walking, stand ups, climbing, and pain improved 4.7, 2.0, 1.4, and 2.1 times, respectively, more with DMST than with conventional treatment. With time (days), walking, stand ups, climbing, and pain improved (correlation) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in DMST (r = 0.83 to 0.92) than in conventional treatment (r = 0.40 to 0.75), and their rate of improvement (regression beta coefficients) were also significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in DMST (beta = -0.16 to 0.73) than in conventional treatment (beta = -0.07 to 0.15). Subjects matching were perfect (p &lt; 0.01) and test-retest reliability of all dependent variables was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) high (intraclass correlation coefficient approximately 1). No major adverse effects were recorded in any of the patients in either group. This study concluded that for early recovery, DMST is more suitable than conventional treatment.",M1
19858353,"Mechanisms of exercise limitation and pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with neuromuscular disease.Indications for exercise and pulmonary rehabilitation extend to neuromuscular diseases tough these conditions pose particular challenges given the associated skeletal muscle impairment and respiratory muscle dysfunction. These challenges are compounded by the variety of exercise prescriptions (aerobic, muscle strengthening, and respiratory muscle training) and the variety of neuromuscular disorders (muscular, motor neuron, motor nerve root, and neuromuscular transmission disorders). Studies support a level II evidence of effectiveness (i.e., likely to be effective) for a combination of aerobic exercise and strengthening <e>exercises</e> in muscular disorders, and for strengthening exercises in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The potential deleterious effects of work overload in the dystrophinopathies have not been confirmed in Becker muscular dystrophy. Adjunctive pharmacologic interventions (e.g., theophylline, steroids, PDE5 inhibitors, creatine), training recommendations (e.g., interval or lower intensity training) and supportive techniques (e.g., noninvasive ventilation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and diaphragm pacing) may result in more effective training but require more study before formal recommendations can be made. The exercise prescription should include avoidance of inspiratory muscle training in hypercapnia or low vital capacity, and should match the desired outcome (e.g., extremity training for task-specific performance, exercise training to enhance exercise performance, respiratory muscle training where respiratory muscle involvement contributes to the impairment).",M1
19848008,"Conservative treatment for recurrent dislocation of temporomandibular joint.OBJECTIVE: Recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is difficult to treat with nonsurgical methods. A new nonsurgical method for the treatment of this condition is presented. METHODS: Routine dental arch bars were applied to the teeth, and two latex elastic bands were placed between the two arch bars on either side of the dental arch. Muscular <e>exercises</e> (i.e. active mouth opening) were then performed regularly over approximately three months. RESULTS: Patients were followed up for two to five years, and the treatment proved successful in five of five cases (i.e. no recurrence was seen). The advantages of this treatment are its simplicity and the lack of special equipment needed. No surgery is required, although patients must perform regular muscular exercises. Surgical complications such as trismus and facial nerve palsy are avoided. The disadvantages of this method are the requirement for patient compliance, and its lack of usefulness in patients without teeth. CONCLUSIONS: The described method is useful for patients complaining of recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint.",M1

DESIGN: Open label randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practice and sport physician practice. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a new episode of patellofemoral pain syndrome recruited by their general practitioner or sport physician. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a standardised exercise programme for 6 weeks tailored to individual performance and supervised by a physical therapist, and were instructed to practise the tailored <e>exercises</e> at home for 3 months. The control group were assigned usual care, which comprised a  wait and see  approach of rest during periods of pain and refraining from pain provoking activities. Both the intervention group and the control group received written information about patellofemoral pain syndrome and general instructions for home exercises. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were self reported recovery (7 point Likert scale), pain at rest and pain on activity (0-10 point numerical rating scale), and function (0-100 point Kujala patellofemoral score) at 3 months and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 131 participants were included in the study: 65 in the intervention group and 66 in the control group. After 3 months, the intervention group showed better outcomes than the control group with regard to pain at rest (adjusted difference -1.07, 95% confidence interval -1.92 to -0.22; effect size 0.47), pain on activity (-1.00, -1.91 to -0.08; 0.45), and function (4.92, 0.14 to 9.72; 0.34). At 12 months, the intervention group continued to show better outcomes than the control group with regard to pain (adjusted difference in pain at rest -1.29, -2.16 to -0.42; effect size 0.56; pain on activity -1.19, -2.22 to -0.16; effect size 0.54), but not function (4.52, -0.73 to 9.76). A higher proportion of patients in the exercise group than in the control group reported recovery (41.9% v 35.0% at 3 months and 62.1% v 50.8% at 12 months), although the differences in self reported recovery between the two groups were not statistically significant. Predefined subgroup analyses revealed that patients recruited by sport physicians (n=30) did not benefit from the intervention, whereas those recruited by general practitioners (n=101) showed significant and clinically relevant differences in pain and function in favour of the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Supervised exercise therapy resulted in less pain and better function at short term and long term follow-up compared with usual care in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome in general practice. Exercise therapy did not produce a significant difference in the rate of self reported recovery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN83938749.",M1
19842866,"Building motivation and sustainability into the prescription and recommendations for physical activity and exercise therapy: the evidence.Client adherence to <e>exercises</e> prescribed by a physical therapist is very important to successful treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, many clients struggle with adherence and thus efficient and effective motivational interventions are desirable. The purpose of this article was to review the available evidence for: 1) the modifiable factors associated with adherence to physical therapy recommended exercise and 2) the efficacy of exercise intervention efforts to make conclusions and suggestions toward practice. Articles were limited to English peer-reviewed journals and published from 1993 to 2008. Major findings from 13 studies were summarized based on common subtopics of: outcome expectations, self-efficacy expectations, cognitive-behavioural and educational interventions, and intervention medium. The review provided evidence for the importance of self-efficacy in exercise adherence to physical therapy, but it showed that current cognitive-behavioural interventions have had limited effectiveness. It was recommended that future research broaden the scope of predictor variables with social ecological designs, increase the length of prospective follow-up in assessments, include larger and more diverse samples, and focus on innovative aesthetic and affective-based intervention strategies.",M1
19841837,"Effects of physiotherapy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome: a systematic review of the literature.OBJECTIVE: To critically summarize the effectiveness of physio-therapy in patients presenting clinical signs of shoulder impingement syndrome. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were searched electronically and manually from 1966 to December 2007. Study quality was independently assessed by 2 reviewers using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. If possible, relative risks and weighted mean differences were calculated for individual studies, and relative risks or standardized mean differences for pooled data, otherwise results were summarized in a best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included, with a mean quality score of 6.8 points out of 10. Many different diagnostic criteria for shoulder impingement syndrome were applied. Physio-therapist-led <e>exercises</e> and surgery were equally effective treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome in the long term. Also, home-based exercises were as effective as combined physiotherapy interventions. Adding manual therapy to exercise programmes may have an additional benefit on pain at 3 weeks follow-up. Moderate evidence exists that passive treatments are not effective and cannot be justified. CONCLUSION: This review shows an equal effectiveness of physiotherapist-led exercises compared with surgery in the long term and of home-based exercises compared with combined physiotherapy interventions in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome in the short and long term; passive treatments cannot be recommended for shoulder impingement syndrome. However, in general, the samples were small, and different diagnostic criteria were applied, which makes a firm conclusion difficult.

The effects of this telerehabilitation approach were compared with traditional motor rehabilitation methods. DESIGN: Randomized single-blind controlled trial. PATIENTS: A total of 36 patients with mild arm motor impairments due to ischaemic stroke in the region of the middle cerebral artery. METHODS: The experimental treatment was a virtual reality-based system delivered via the Internet, which provided motor tasks to the patients from a remote rehabilitation facility. The control group underwent traditional physical therapy for the upper limb. Both treatments were of 4 weeks duration. All patients were assessed one month prior to therapy, at the commencement and termination of therapies and one month post-therapy, with the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, the ABILHAND and the Ashworth scales. RESULTS: Both rehabilitative therapies significantly improved all outcome scores after treatment, but only the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale showed differences in the comparison between groups. CONCLUSION: Both strategies were effective, but the experimental approach induced better outcomes in motor performance. These results may favour early discharge from hospital sustained by a telerehabilitation programme, with potential beneficial effects on the use of available resources.",M1
19828418,"[A new method for prosthetisation of vascular patients with lower limb amputation: initial experiences with osseointegration technique]INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Prostheses use for lower limb amputees is difficult, while the socket is hard, the prosthesis is heavy. Drawbacks of conventional prosthesis are mainly associated with the socket, therefore osseointegration technique is a promising solution, since it doesn't require a socket. Our aim was to introduce this technique in Hungary and extend indication for vascular patients. METHODS: The method includes two operative and one rehabilitation phases: during first operation a titanium screw is fixed into the femoral bone marrow cavity, this connects to an abutment, which also penetrates the skin, making a direct connection between the femur and the prosthesis during the second intervention. During rehabilitation the patient makes loading <e>exercises</e> and learns to walk with new prosthesis. RESULTS: This method was launched in Hungary in 2005. Two female amputees were operated on initially, their second surgery was performed in 2006 (when titanium screw was applied in the male patients, as well). Incorporation of titanium screw was exquisite, and rehabilitation was successful. One of our male patients died eight months after his first operation due to myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experiences, the osseointegration technique facilitates rehabilitation of vascular patients for prostheses use. Adequate follow-up and stable vascular diseases are not contraindications, although further clinical trials are needed to determine its indication.",M1
19821388,"Dynamic exercise programs (aerobic capacity and/or muscle strength training) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: An up-to-date overview of the effectiveness and safety of dynamic exercise therapy (exercise therapy with a sufficient intensity, duration, and frequency to establish improvement in aerobic capacity and/or muscle strength) is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of short-term (&lt; three months) and long-term (&gt; three months) dynamic exercise therapy programs (aerobic capacity and/or muscle strength training), either land or water-based, for people with RA. To do this we updated a previous Cochrane review (van den Ende 1998) and made categories for the different forms of dynamic exercise programs. SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature search (to December 2008) within various databases was performed in order to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs that included an exercise program fulfilling the following criteria were selected: a) frequency at least twice weekly for &gt; 20 minutes; b) duration &gt; 6 weeks; c) aerobic exercise intensity &gt; 55% of the maximum heart rate and/or muscle strengthening <e>exercises</e> starting at 30% to 50% of one repetition maximum; and d) performed under supervision. Moreover, the RCT included one or more of the following outcome measures: functional ability, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, pain, disease activity or radiological damage. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, rated the methodological quality, and extracted data. A qualitative analysis (best-evidence synthesis) was performed and, where appropriate, a quantitative data analysis (pooled effect sizes). MAIN RESULTS: In total, eight studies were included in this updated review (two additional studies). Four of the eight studies fulfilled at least 8/10 methodological criteria. In this updated review four different dynamic exercise programs were found: (1) short-term, land-based aerobic capacity training, which results show moderate evidence for a positive effect on aerobic capacity (pooled effect size 0.99 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.68). (2) short-term, land-based aerobic capacity and muscle strength training, which results show moderate evidence for a positive effect on aerobic capacity and muscle strength (pooled effect size 0.47 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.93). (3) short-term, water-based aerobic capacity training, which results show limited evidence for a positive effect on functional ability and aerobic capacity. (4) long-term, land-based aerobic capacity and muscle strength training, which results show moderate evidence for a positive effect on aerobic capacity and muscle strength. With respect to safety, no deleterious effects were found in any of the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence, aerobic capacity training combined with muscle strength training is recommended as routine practice in patients with RA.",M1

METHODS: From 2006.8 to 2008.3, 120 patients with shoulder and back fasciitis were randomly divided into control group (n = 60, including 21 females and 39 males, the average age was (47.0 +/- 12.0) years, and the average course of disease was (14.1 +/- 12.0) months) and treatment group (n = 60,including 19 females and 41 males, the average age was (43.7 +/- 9.9) years, and the average course of disease was (16.4 +/- 13.4) months). The patients in the control group received massage therapy and the ones in the treatment group were treated with massage therapy and horizontal bar exercise. After 3 weeks treatment, the curative effects of the patients in two groups were observed. All the patients were followed up for 6 to 26 months, the recurrence were observed. RESULTS: After 3 weeks treatment, the scores of pain, sense of heaviness, strip sign, tenderness, shoulder and back function of the patients in two groups had significant differences compared with those before treatment (all P &lt; 0.01). After treatment, the scores of pain, sense of heaviness, strip sign, tenderness, shoulder and back function of the patients in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Neurology outpatient clinics in three Dutch hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 205 patients with symptoms and signs of cervical radiculopathy of less than one month's duration INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with a semi-hard collar and taking rest for three to six weeks; 12 twice weekly sessions of physiotherapy and home <e>exercises</e> for six weeks; or continuation of daily activities as much as possible without specific treatment (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time course of changes in pain scores for arm and neck pain on a 100 mm visual analogue scale and in the neck disability index during the first six weeks. RESULTS: In the wait and see group, arm pain diminished by 3 mm/week on the visual analogue scale (beta=-3.1 mm, 95% confidence interval -4.0 to -2.2 mm) and by 19 mm in total over six weeks. Patients who were treated with cervical collar or physiotherapy achieved additional pain reduction (collar: beta=-1.9 mm, -3.3 to -0.5 mm; physiotherapy: beta=-1.9, -3.3 to -0.8), resulting in an extra pain reduction compared with the control group of 12 mm after six weeks. In the wait and see group, neck pain did not decrease significantly in the first six weeks (beta=-0.9 mm, -2.0 to 0.3). Treatment with the collar resulted in a weekly reduction on the visual analogue scale of 2.8 mm (-4.2 to -1.3), amounting to 17 mm in six weeks, whereas physiotherapy gave a weekly reduction of 2.4 mm (-3.9 to -0.8) resulting in a decrease of 14 mm after six weeks. Compared with a wait and see policy, the neck disability index showed a significant change with the use of the collar and rest (beta=-0.9 mm, -1.6 to -0.1) and a non-significant effect with physiotherapy and home exercises. CONCLUSION: A semi-hard cervical collar and rest for three to six weeks or physiotherapy accompanied by home exercises for six weeks reduced neck and arm pain substantially compared with a wait and see policy in the early phase of cervical radiculopathy.

19801813,"Trapezius muscle timing during selected shoulder rehabilitation <e>exercises</e>.STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. OBJECTIVES: To examine the timing of the 3 portions of the trapezius muscle in relation to the posterior deltoid (PD) muscle and in relation to one another during 4 selected shoulder exercises: (1) prone extension, (2) forward flexion in side lying, (3) external rotation in side lying, and (4) prone horizontal abduction with external rotation. BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in trapezius muscle recruitment have been identified in patients with shoulder pain. Alterations in the trapezius muscle activation level and timing have been identified in previous research. Scapular muscle exercises in which the middle trapezius (MT) and lower trapezius (LT) muscle showed optimal activity with minimal upper trapezius (UT) muscle participation have been recently identified. However, it is currently unknown if these exercises also promote early activation of the scapular stabilizing musculature. METHODS: The intermuscular and intramuscular timing of muscle activation (based on an activation level of greater than 10% maximum voluntary contraction beyond basic activity) of the 3 portions of the trapezius muscle during 4 exercises were examined by surface EMG in 30 healthy subjects on the dominant side (14 males, 16 females). A 1-sample t test was used to determine which portions of the trapezius muscle were activated significantly earlier or later than the PD (intermuscular timing). An analysis of variance for repeated measures (3 levels) was used for each exercise to determine possible timing differences among the 3 portions of the trapezius muscle (intramuscular timing). RESULTS: Intermuscular and intramuscular differences in timing of the portions of the trapezius muscle were found. The UT was activated significantly later than the PD (P&lt;.01), and the MT was activated significantly earlier than the PD (P&lt;.01), during the prone extension exercise. During the horizontal abduction with external rotation exercise, the MT (P&lt;.01) and the LT (P = .01) were activated significantly earlier than the PD. During prone extension, side-lying external rotation, and prone horizontal abduction with external rotation, significant differences were found between the UT and MT, between the UT and LT, but not between the MT and LT. In these exercises the MT and LT were activated significantly earlier than the UT. During forward flexion in side lying, no significant timing differences were found between the activation of the portions of the trapezius. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of the LT during prone extension, the prone extension exercise and the prone horizontal abduction with external rotation exercise promote early activation of the MT and LT in relation to the scapular and glenohumeral prime mover. Taking into account the limited generalizability of the results due to a narrow age range, these exercises are potentially promising for the treatment of intermuscular and intramuscular timing disorders of the trapezius muscle.",M1

20404050,"Acute circuit-resistance exercise increases expression of lymphocyte agouti-related protein in young women.Exercise-induced leukocytosis and lymphocytosis is accompanied by up-regulation and down-regulation of hundreds of genes in white blood cells (WBCs). Agouti-related protein (AgRP) is an orexigenic peptide secreted predominantly from the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus. AgRP affects feeding behavior and plays a role in energy and glucose homeostasis and adiposity. The purpose of the study was to determine effects of circuit resistance exercise (CRE) (9 <e>exercises</e>, 25 s per exercise) at different intensities on peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) AgRP mRNA expression and its concentrations in lymphocytes and plasma. Twenty-five young female college students were randomly divided into five groups: control, 40% 1-repetition maximum (1-RM), 60% 1-RM, 80% 1-RM and combined (40 + 60 + 80% 1-RM) loads. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by a lymphocyte density gradient centrifugation method for AgRP mRNA expression. Lymphocyte ATP, glycogen, AgRP, growth hormone (GH), and plasma AgRP, GH and glucose concentrations were measured. CRE increased AgRP mRNA lymphocyte expression significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) at all intensities. A higher and significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase was found in the 60% 1-RM group when compared with the other groups. The CRE-induced lymphocyte AgRP expression was accompanied by elevations in plasma AgRP, glucose and GH levels as well as higher WBCs, lymphocytes and neutrophil counts. Lymphocyte AgRP and GH concentrations were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05). Lymphocyte ATP content was unchanged and glycogen was reduced in the combined group but not in the other groups. Data indicate that AgRP mRNA is expressed in PBLs and that CRE increases its expression. Data also reveal that the expression of AgRP was accompanied with higher plasma AgRP and GH concentrations. Findings suggest that AgRP may provide an important signal in the immune environment and that the lymphocyte may be considered as an extra-hypothalamic source of plasma AgRP following exercise stress.",M2
20402569,"L-tryptophan supplementation can decrease fatigue perception during an aerobic exercise with supramaximal intercalated anaerobic bouts in young healthy men.Physical exercise is often terminated not due to muscle fatigue but because of inadequate neural drive in the serotonergic system. Modifications in activity levels of the serotonergic system, induced by variations in the availability of L-tryptophan (a serotonin precursor) may alter neural drive. We examined the effect of L-tryptophan supplementation on physical performance by combining aerobic work with brief periods of supramaximal intensity that closely mimics the activity typical of team sports. Twenty healthy young sportsmen (mean age 21.2 +/- 0.7 years) performed a submaximal exercise on a cycle ergometer, with a workload corresponding to 50% of their respective VO(2) max for 10 min, followed by a maximal intensity exercise for 30 s. This sequence was repeated three times and, after the fourth series, each participant continued to exercise at the highest speed that he could sustain for 20 min. This protocol was performed twice: once with and finally without supplementation of L-tryptophan, in random order and double-blind. Peak power output, average anaerobic power output, and power output during the last 20 min of the trial were higher on the trials performed with L-tryptophan supplementation than on those performed with placebo. The distance covered during the last 20 min of the trial was 11,959 +/- 1,753 m on placebo and 12,526 +/- 1,617 m on L-tryptophan (p &lt; .05).

20307323,"Intensity level for exercise training in fibromyalgia by using mathematical models.BACKGROUND: It has not been assessed before whether mathematical models described in the literature for prescriptions of exercise can be used for fibromyalgia syndrome patients. The objective of this paper was to determine how age-predicted heart rate formulas can be used with fibromyalgia syndrome populations as well as to find out which mathematical models are more accurate to control exercise intensity. METHODS: A total of 60 women aged 18-65 years with fibromyalgia syndrome were included; 32 were randomized to walking training at anaerobic threshold. Age-predicted formulas to maximum heart rate ( 220 minus age  and  208 minus 0.7 x age ) were correlated with achieved maximum heart rate (HRMax) obtained by spiroergometry. Subsequently, six mathematical models using heart rate reserve (HRR) and age-predicted HRMax formulas were studied to estimate the intensity level of exercise training corresponding to heart rate at anaerobic threshold (HRAT) obtained by spiroergometry. Linear and nonlinear regression models were used for correlations and residues analysis for the adequacy of the models. RESULTS: Age-predicted HRMax and HRAT formulas had a good correlation with achieved heart rate obtained in spiroergometry (r = 0.642; p &lt; 0.05). For exercise prescription in the anaerobic threshold intensity, the percentages were 52.2-60.6% HRR and 75.5-80.9% HRMax. Formulas using HRR and the achieved HRMax showed better correlation. Furthermore, the percentages of HRMax and HRR were significantly higher for the trained individuals (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Age-predicted formulas can be used for estimating HRMax and for exercise prescriptions in women with fibromyalgia syndrome. Karnoven's formula using heart rate achieved in ergometric test showed a better correlation. For the prescription of <e>exercises</e> in the threshold intensity, 52% to 60% HRR or 75% to 80% HRMax must be used in sedentary women with fibromyalgia syndrome and these values are higher and must be corrected for trained patients.",M2

The purpose of this study was to compare the acute effects of different warm-up methods on soccer performance. Twenty-six professional soccer players (23.3 +/- 3.2 years, 178.2 +/- 6.1 cm, and 73.0 +/- 6.5 kg) performed 4 different warm-up routines in random order on nonconsecutive days. The warm-up methods consisted of only 5 minutes of jogging (Method A), 5 minutes of jogging and static stretching (Method B), 5 minutes of jogging and dynamic exercise (Method C), and 5 minutes of jogging and a combination of static stretching and dynamic exercise (Method D). After each warm-up session, subjects were tested on the sprint, slalom dribbling, and penalty kick performance. Methods A-D were compared by repeated-measures analyses of variance and post hoc comparisons. In this study, existence of a significant drop in sprint, slalom dribbling, and penalty kick performances of Method C has been determined in comparison with that of Method A (p &lt; 0.05).

20231740,"Evaluating patellar kinematics through magnetic resonance imaging during open- and closed-kinetic-chain <e>exercises</e>.PURPOSE: To evaluate patellar kinematics of volunteers without knee pain at rest and during isometric contraction in open-and closed-kinetic-chain exercises. METHODS: Twenty individuals took part in this study. All were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during rest and voluntary isometric contraction (VIC) in the open and closed kinetic chain at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees of knee flexion. Through MRI and using medical e-film software, the following measurements were evaluated: sulcus angle, patellar-tilt angle, and bisect offset. The mixed-effects linear model was used for comparison between knee positions, between rest and isometric contractions, and between the exercises. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed that the sulcus angle decreased as knee flexion increased and revealed increases with isometric contractions in both the open and closed kinetic chain for all knee-flexion angles. The patellar-tilt angle decreased with isometric contractions in both the open and closed kinetic chain for every knee position. However, in the closed kinetic chain, patellar tilt increased significantly with the knee flexed at 15 degrees. The bisect offset increased with the knee flexed at 15 degrees during isometric contractions and decreased as knee flexion increased during both exercises. CONCLUSION: VIC in the last degrees of knee extension may compromise patellar dynamics. On the other hand, it is possible to favor patellar stability by performing muscle contractions with the knee flexed at 30 degrees and 45 degrees in either the open or closed kinetic chain.",M2

METHODS: Thirty-two women (age= 53.26+/-6.61 yr) were assigned to two different groups based on their functional capacity and symptoms as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and pain. Subjects were submitted twice to a maximum treadmill incremental test until participants achieved volitional exhaustion (VO2max). Expired respiratory gases, ventilator parameters and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously through exercise, and rate perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed once a minute during the test. RESULTS: Peak VO2 values for the moderately affected group (Group 1) were significantly different from those of severely affected group (Group 2) (26.2+/-2.1 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (Group 1) and 22.1+/-2.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (Group 2)). Additionally taking into account VO2 at ventilatory threshold (VO2VT), significant differences between groups were found in both tests. Some notable differences in all parameters evaluated were also found. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the aerobic capacity of patients with FMS was different according to how severely affected they were by the condition; therefore, physical activity of the same intensity should not be prescribed for both groups. According to these results, health professionals could prescribe physical activity with confidence to this patient group.",M2

However, the direct relationship between the type of aerobic exercise (i.e. constant versus interval) and the alteration in arterial stiffness has been poorly explored. We evaluated the hemodynamic responses of 11 healthy males (22.5 +/- 0.7 years, height 177.7 +/- 1.1 cm, body mass 70.5 +/- 2.4 kg) following acute constant (CE) and intermittent cycling exercise (IE). Exercise duration and intensity (mean heart rate) were matched during both exercises (142.9 +/- 2.4 bpm for CE and 144.2 +/- 2.4 bpm for IE). Heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO) were measured throughout the whole session, while blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured during pre exercise and 30 min recovery. Arterial stiffness and cardiac autonomic control were assessed through PWV and heart rate variability, respectively. After IE, lower limb arterial stiffness was significantly and steadily decreased compared to pre exercise value (from 8.6 +/- 0.1 to m s(-1) to 7.6 +/- 0.3 to m s(-1) at 30 min) and was lower than after CE (8.2 +/- 0.3 m s(-1) at 30 min, which did not significantly change compared to pre exercise: 8.7 +/- 0.2 m s(-1)). We hypothesized that the higher HR and lower arterial stiffness after IE were likely due to variations in peripheral vascular changes during the exercise which may trigger the release of endothelial or metabolic vasoactive factors. These data appear to show that IE may result in a greater stimulus for vascular adaptations when compared to CE.",M2

20140787,"[Electromyostimulation (EMS) in cardiac patients. Will EMS training be helpful in secondary prevention?]BACKGROUND: Current guidelines concerning the treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) include ergospirometry-directed dynamic <e>exercises</e> on a daily basis. Several prospective, randomized trials have confirmed its positive influence on clinical symptoms and prognosis of the disease. Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) can benefit from a 27% reduction of mortality, as shown in meta-analyses of several studies. By contrast, patients with CHF have traditionally been discouraged from physical activities, which may have had detrimental consequences. They became even less able to participate in daily activities that in turn hastened the disease-driven atrophies of skeletal muscles. On the other hand, well-adjusted endurance training at 50-70% of maximum oxygen uptake was shown to improve overall fitness. In a recent metaanalysis, the mortality of patients with CHF was reduced by 35% by sports, and the rate of hospitalizations dropped by 28%. It is a well-perceived clinical problem that successful treatment is not possible without intensive guidance and a close therapeutic relationship. Being left in their routine situation and circumstances, the majority of patients cannot cope with the day-to-day challenge of an independent, active lifestyle. Among the primary reasons not to sustain physical activity are mental, psychological or social barriers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors have begun, in a cohort of patients with CHF, a prospective pilot study to investigate the impact of, and attitude to, electromyostimulation (EMS). Unique features of this treatment include its passive nature that remains independent of mental attitude. RESULTS: An up to 96% increase of peak oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold could be shown (pre- vs. posttraining phase, VO(2at) 19.39 [+/- 5.3] ml/kg vs. 24.25 [+/- 6.34] ml/kg). The diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly. A 14% gain in muscle volume was observed, while overall body weight remained unchanged. All patients kept up the training until the conclusion of the study and found their overall fitness to be considerably improved. CONCLUSION: The results may indicate the enormous potential of EMS for the treatment of patients within the cardiologic arena, especially those with CHF.",M2
20124792,"Transient effect of core stability <e>exercises</e> on postural sway during quiet standing.This study aimed to examine the transient effect of core stability exercises on the motion of the center of pressure (COP) during quiet standing. Seventeen healthy young adults (7 women and 10 men) were required to perform elbow-toe and hand-heel exercises for 30 seconds in both cases. Before and 1 minute after the execution of the 2 exercises, the subjects repeated 30 seconds of quiet standing with eyes closed 3 times on a force platform with intervals of 10 seconds between trials. The intervention of the 2 exercises induced significant decreases in the maximal range of mediolateral sway (34.7 +/- 7.0 mm to 30.2 +/- 6.1 mm, p = 0.0001), standard deviation of mediolateral sway (6.4 +/- 1.2 mm to 5.8 +/- 1.0 mm, p = 0.0006), the mean speed of anteroposterior sway (14.1 +/- 2.5 mm per second to 13.2 +/- 2.3 mm per second, p = 0.004), mean speed of mediolateral sway (22.8 +/- 2.8 mm per second to 20.9 +/- 2.3 mm per second, p = 0.004), sway speed (29.3 +/- 3.9 mm per second to 27.0 +/- 3.2 mm per second, p = 0.002), and sweep speed (73.2 +/- 23.4 mm per second to 62.0 +/- 19.7 mm per second, p = 0.005) of the COP trajectory, calculated from the force platform data. This result indicates that the practice of core stability exercises transiently decreases the area of the COP trajectory and its mediolateral and total excursions during quiet standing with the eyes closed. Performing core stability exercises as part of warm-up programs may be useful for temporarily improving postural control during standing in main exercise programs.",M2
20117890,"Effect of physical training on age-related reduction of GH secretion during exercise in normally cycling women.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prolonged physical activity (25 km/week running for 8 years) modifies GH decline. DESIGN: The GH response to maximal exercise on bicycle-ergometer was tested in younger (26-30 years) and older (42-46 years) healthy women. Each age group included 2 subgroups of 10 sedentary and 10 runners, which were compared. The workload was increased at 3 min intervals from time 0 until exhaustion. Subjects with a low maximal capacity (as established in a preliminary test) pedalled for 3-4 min against no workload at the beginning of the test, so that <e>exercises</e> lasted about 15 min in all individuals. RESULTS: At exhaustion, heart rate and systolic pressure were significantly higher in sedentary than in trained subjects, whereas V(O(2)max), blood glucose and plasma lactate levels were similar in all groups. Exercise induced similar GH responses in younger sedentary and exercise-trained subjects and in older exercise-trained subjects, with mean peak levels 7.5 times higher than baseline. In contrast, in older sedentary women peak GH level was only 4.4 times higher than baseline and was significantly lower than in the other groups. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that in women prolonged physical training exerts protective effects against age-dependent decline in GH secretion.",M2

Neuromuscular-training programs have been advocated as a means of injury prevention, but little is known about the benefits of these programs on balance in high school athletes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are balance gains after participation in a neuromuscular-training program in high school athletes. DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial. SETTING: All data were collected at each participating high school before and after a 6-wk intervention or control period. PARTICIPANTS: 62 female high school basketball players recruited from the local high school community and assigned to a training (n = 37) or control (n = 25) group. INTERVENTION: Training-group subjects participated in a 6-wk neuromuscular-training program that included plyometric, functional-strengthening, balance, and stability-ball <e>exercises</e>. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected for the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) and Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) before and after the 6-wk intervention or control period. RESULTS: The authors found a significant decrease in total BESS errors in the trained group at the posttest compared with their pretest and the control group (P = .003). Trained subjects also scored significantly fewer BESS errors on the single-foam and tandem-foam conditions at the posttest than the control group and demonstrated improvements on the single-foam compared with their pretest (P = .033). The authors found improvements in reach in the lateral, anteromedial, medial, and posterior directions in the trained group at the posttest compared with the control group (P &lt; .05) using the SEBT.

20105046,"The effect of body fat, aging, and diabetes on vertical and shear pressure in and under a waist belt and its effect on skin blood flow.BACKGROUND: Much attention has been given to the effect of pressure on skin blood flow in the feet of older people and people with diabetes. However, little attention has been paid to other areas of the body, especially under the belt at the waist where pressure might be high during body movements associated with exercise. This may be very important when devices such as heat packs are worn during the day under the belt because their safety relies on appropriate skin blood flow to dissipate the heat; in diabetes populations burns have been seen. METHODS: Forty male and female subjects, with and without diabetes, were examined in two series of experiments to assess the vertical and shear pressure under a belt worn during different common <e>exercises</e>. Vertical and shear pressure under the belt, belt tension, and shear pressure were measured with a Tactilus (Sensor Products, Madison, NJ) pressure mapping system. Eleven different body movements were examined. Then, from the recorded pressures, a second series of experiments examined skin blood flow at these same pressures. RESULTS: The results of the experiments showed that there was little shear and vertical pressure in thin subjects during 10 different exercises. However, for overweight subjects, pressure under the belt was as high as 150 kPa. At these high levels of pressure, skin circulation was occluded. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with diabetes who are generally overweight and have impaired circulation, hot packs should be used with caution because of the low blood flows at rest and occlusion of the circulation under the belt with body movement.",M2

During the first trial, subjects did not ingest fluids during exercise (dehydration (DH) trial). In the second and third trials, subjects received mineral water (MW) and hypotonic fluid containing carbohydrate (HF), respectively, in amounts equaling their weight loss in the DH trial. At the end of exercise, the overall rating of perceived exertion (RPE-O) was lower in the MW and HF trials than in the DH trial (14.3+/-1.0 and 13.7+/-0.6 vs 17.7+/-1.0, p&lt;0.05, respectively). RPE-cardiovascular and RPE-legs were lower at the end of exercise in the HF trial compared with the DH trial. V(O2), heart rate (HR), and rectal temperature increased during exercise in the three trials. At the end of exercise, the drift in V(O2) was lower in the MW and HF trials than in the DH trial (304+/-41 and 339+/-40 vs 458+/-33 mL, p&lt;0.05, respectively). HR at the end of exercise in the HF trial was lower than in the DH trial (158+/-5 vs 173+/-7 bpm, p&lt;0.05).

20072056,"Facilitating activation of the peroneus longus: electromyographic analysis of <e>exercises</e> consistent with biomechanical function.Exercises for the ankle are often used to improve sport performance through balance and stability or to prevent or recover from ankle injury. Ankle training programs often include exercises for the primary muscle of the lateral ankle, the peroneus longus (PL). However, many exercises for the PL are non-weight bearing and unidirectional. However, data from biomechanical studies show that peak activity of the PL occurs neither in non-weight-bearing nor during uniplanar movements. This lack of congruency may limit the effectiveness of PL training. Exercises more consistent with the biomechanical function of the PL may increase the efficacy of ankle training. This study examined and compared the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the PL during 2 exercises that specifically address the known biomechanical function of the PL and a traditional non-weight-bearing unidirectional PL exercise. Twenty healthy college-aged men and women (age 24.8 +/- 2.7 years) without history of ankle injury were examined in a single-session repeated measures design. The average root means square (RMS) values of the PL during each of the 3 exercises were measured and compared to assess for differences in magnitude of muscular activity. The RMS activity of the PL was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) in each of the biomechanically correct exercises when compared with the conventional exercise. However, no significant difference was noted in EMG activity between the 2 biomechanical exercises. This study provides evidence for increased activity from the PL during 2 exercises that more accurately reflect its biomechanical function. Use of these exercises when training the PL for sports performance or rehabilitation may increase the effectiveness of ankle training programs that include PL activity.",M2
20052963,"Physical activity guidelines for older adults.Few older adults in the United States achieve the minimum recommended amount of physical activity. Lack of physical activity contributes to many chronic diseases that occur in older adults, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, Alzheimer disease, hypertension, and cancer. Lack of physical activity, combined with poor dietary habits, has also contributed to increased obesity in older persons. Regular exercise and increased aerobic fitness are associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality and morbidity, and are proven to reduce disease and disability, and improve quality of life in older persons. In 2008, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released guidelines to provide information and guidance on the amount of physical activity recommended to maintain health and fitness. For substantial health benefits, the guidelines recommend that most older adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination of each per week. Older adults should also engage in strengthening activities that involve all major muscle groups at least two days a week.

METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, anthropometric measurements were taken in 20 adult overweight women. Ventilation of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and heart rate were measured using a portable gas-analysis system. After each exercise, a Borg's scale score was assessed. Exercises were performed on a vibration platform with a frequency of 35 Hz and with the intensity set on  high  (amplitude of 4 mm). Two dynamic exercises (squatting and calf raises) and one static exercise (standing) were performed during 3 minutes with and without vibration in a randomized order, with 10 minutes rest between exercises. Mean values of the third minute of exercise were compared. RESULTS: Ventilation of oxygen and carbon dioxide were consistently, significantly higher in the exercises with vibration compared with the exercises without vibration. Borg's scale scores only showed a significant difference between calf raises with and without vibration. CONCLUSION: The addition of whole body vibration to both static and dynamic exercises appears to significantly increase oxygen uptake in overweight and obese women. More research is needed to determine the physiological pathway and clinical relevance of this increase.",M2
20048509,"Prescribing physical activity: applying the ACSM protocols for exercise type, intensity, and duration across 3 training frequencies.When physicians advise patients to attain more physical activity, they usually recommend a walking program. However, in a similar way to no exercise, those embarking on a walking program will typically lose 4 to 6 lb of lean weight and reduce their resting metabolic rate 2% to 3% every decade. These effects may be mitigated by the inclusion of resistance exercise. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) minimum exercise guidelines recommend 20 minutes of aerobic activity 3 days per week, and 1 set (8-12 repetitions) of 8 to 10 resistance <e>exercises</e> to train the major muscle groups 2 days per week. However, large-scale testing of these recommendations in a field setting has been minimal. Men and women between 21 and 80 years (N = 1725) [corrected] participated in a 10-week combined strength and aerobic activity program based on the ACSM protocols for exercise intensity and duration across 3 training frequencies (1, 2, or 3 sessions/week). Across all training frequencies, mean changes included a reduction in body fat of 1.97%, a decrease in fat weight of 1.7 kg, an increase in lean weight of 1.35 kg, a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 3.83 mm Hg, and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 1.73 mm Hg. More frequent weekly training sessions were associated with greater improvements in body fat percent, fat weight, and lean weight.

Twelve female collegiate volleyball players (mean +/- SD; age 19.5 +/- 1.1 yr; height 1.71 +/- 0.06 m; mass 71.3 +/- 8.54 kg) volunteered for this study. Data collection lasted a total of 3 weeks, and each subject performed all 3 stretching protocols, 1 session per week, with 1 week between sessions. The order of the stretching protocols was randomized for each subject. During each testing session, all subjects performed a 5-minute light jog as a warm-up, followed by 8 minutes of 1 of the stretching protocols. One minute after the completion of each protocol, 5 maximal CMJ were performed on a force platform, with each jump separated by 1 minute of passive recovery. Jump heights were calculated by integrating the vertical force trace. There were no significant differences between the SS, DS, and NS conditions for any of the jumps (p &gt; 0.05).

Since these conditions can cause pain and esthetics impairments, lead in adulthood to an higher incidence of spinal and shoulder pain, and evolve during growth, it is important to manage this deformity. The aim of this paper was to present the state of the art about HK and its treatment. Scheuermann Disease (SCHK) is the better known cause of HK; other causes can be idiopathic or postural, trunk extensor muscles weakness or neurological problems. Despite etiology a specific treatment can be required during growth to prevent evolution and reach a better spinal alignment in adulthood. It is at the base of treatment and allow monitoring. There are some validated methods that can be used in a comprehensive rehabilitation approach. Evidence in this field is scanty, even if there is quite a consensus on possible treatments. They aim at improving posture and esthetics, and abolishing pain; they include: <e>exercises</e>, used mainly in mobile postural/idiopathic HK, and in SCHK without HK; braces (plus exercises, in this case aimed at reducing brace impairments), that in rigid HK and in most of SCHK patients also allow a better vertebral growth; surgery could be used in worst cases, even if it should be carefully considered, because it requires fusion and loss of spinal function.",M2
20032902,"Are swimming or aerobic exercise better than conventional exercise in ankylosing spondylitis patients? A randomized controlled study.AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of conventional exercise (CE), swimming and walking on the pulmonary functions, aerobic capacity, quality of life, Bath indexes and psychological symptoms in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: Forty-five patients were randomised into either swimming (group 1), walking (group 2), CE group (group 3). Patients in Group 1 performed CE and swimming, patients in Group 2 performed CE and walking and patients in Group 3 performed CE only. Exercise sessions were performed three times a week for a period of six weeks. Patients were assessed before and after the rehabilitation program, with respect to, pulmonary function test (forced vital capacity [FVC, mL], forced expiration volume in one second [FEV1, mL], FEV1/FVC (%) and vital capacity [VC, mL]), maximal oxygen uptake (pV.O2), 6-minute walking test (6MWT), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, Nottingham Health Profile and Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: There were significant increases in pVO2 and 6MWT after treatment in Groups 1 and 2 (P&lt;0.05). FeV1, FVC and VC improved significantly with treatment in all three groups (P&lt;0.05). A statistically significant improvement was observed in energy, emotional reaction and physical mobility sub-scores of NHP in three exercise groups after completion of the exercise program (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Swimming, walking and CE had beneficial effects on the quality of life and pulmonary functions. Aerobic <e>exercises</e> such as swimming and walking in addition to CE increased functional capacities of patients.",M2

If particular <e>exercises</e> can achieve multiple training functions, the number of exercises and the time needed to achieve a training goal may be decreased. It was the objective of this study to compare the extent of trunk muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity during running and callisthenic activities. EMG activity of the external obliques, lower abdominals (LA), upper lumbar erector spinae (ULES), and lumbosacral erector spinae (LSES) was monitored while triathletes and active nonrunners ran on a treadmill for 30 min at 60% and 80% of their maximum heart rate (HR) reserve, as well as during 30 repetitions of a partial curl-up and 3 min of a modified Biering-Sørensen back extension exercise. The mean root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the EMG signal was monitored over 10-s periods with measures normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction rotating curl-up (external obliques), hollowing exercise (LA), or back extension (ULES and LSES). A main effect for group was that triathletes had greater overall activation of the external obliques (p &lt; 0.05), LA (p = 0.01), and LSES (p &lt; 0.05) than did nonrunners. Main effects for exercise type showed that the external obliques had less EMG activity during 60% and 80% runs, respectively, than with the curl-ups (p = 0.001). The back extension exercise provided less ULES (p = 0.009) and LSES (p = 0.0001) EMG activity than the 60% and 80% runs, respectively. In conclusion, triathletes had greater trunk activation than nonrunners did while running, which could have contributed to their better performance. Back-stabilizing muscles can be activated more effectively with running than with a prolonged back extension activity. Running can be considered as an efficient, multifunctional exercise combining cardiovascular and trunk endurance benefits.",M2
20010131,"Insulin-like growth factor I as a biomarker of health, fitness, and training status.Whereas there are many varied roles of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and it exists in different biocompartments, there is abundant scientific evidence demonstrating that IGF-I is an important metabolic biomarker associated with a variety of health- and exercise-related outcomes. In most cases (muscle, bone, tendon, body composition, and cognitive function), elevated IGF-I concentrations are considered beneficial; however, cancer remains a notable exception. Although the fact that both increased and decreased IGF-I concentrations can be considered as reflective of favorable and beneficial health outcomes and may seem as a paradox and even contradictory, it is important to emphasize that, in both cases, measured IGF-I concentrations do offer important insight into physiological processes. The precise and relative role of systemic versus locally produced IGF-I in mediating the outcomes of physical activity is still not clearly delineated, but it does seem as though local IGF-I is consistently upregulated with both acute and chronic <e>exercises</e>; whereas in certain situations, circulating IGF-I may actually decrease. Although perhaps counterintuitive to the known anabolic role that IGF-I exerts, positive neuromuscular training adaptations can occur in the presence of decreases or no changes in circulating IGF-I. These observations, however, should not be interpreted to conclude that the role of circulating IGF-I lacks importance or relevance in contributing to enhanced musculoskeletal health as evidenced by the liver IGF-I-deficient mouse model. Because of the ubiquitous nature of IGF-I, prospective experimental approaches involving physical activity that can sample and measure IGF-I in the body's various biocompartments (i.e., blood, interstitial fluid, muscle) with the most biologically relevant assays are encouraged. We believe that such endeavors will provide greater understanding in the complex role that IGF-I possesses in mediating exercise-induced adaptations.",M2

METHODS: The study was conducted in Australia from July 2008 to June 2009. Participants [n=108, mean age (SD)=15.0 (0.7) years] were randomized to free weights (n=37) or elastic tubing (n=41) RT groups and a control group was recruited (n=30). Participants in the RT groups completed 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions on 10 <e>exercises</e> for 8 weeks. Waist circumference, body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and muscular strength (bench press and leg press) were assessed at baseline and posttest. RESULTS: Boys (p&lt;0.001) and girls (p&lt;0.01) in both RT groups improved their body composition over the study period. Boys in both RT groups significantly improved both upper and lower body strength and their improvements were significantly greater than changes observed in the control group.

19996781,"Effects of musical cadence in the acute physiologic adaptations to head-out aquatic <e>exercises</e>.The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationships between musical cadence and the physiologic adaptations to basic head-out aquatic exercises. Fifteen young and clinically healthy women performed, immersed to the breast, a cardiovascular aquatic exercise called the  rocking horse.  The study design included an intermittent and progressive protocol starting at a 90 b.min(-1) rhythm and increasing every 6 minutes, by 15 b.min(-1), up to 195 b.min(-1) or exhaustion. The rating of perceived effort (RPE) at the maximal heart rate achieved during each bout (HRmax), the percentage of the maximal theoretical heart rate estimated (%HRmax), and the blood lactate concentration ([La-]) were evaluated. The musical cadence was also calculated at 4 mmol.L(-1) of blood lactate (R4), the RPE at R4 (RPE@R4), the HR at R4 (HR@R4), and the %HRmax at R4 (%HRmax@R4). Strong relationships were verified between the musical cadence and the RPE (R2 = 0.85; p &lt; 0.01), the HRmax (R2 = 0.66; p &lt; 0.01), the %HRmax (R = 0.61; p &lt; 0.01), and the [La-] (R2 = 0.54; p &lt; 0.01). The R4 was 148.13 +/- 17.53 b.min, the RPE@R4 was 14.53 +/- 2.53, the HR@R4 was 169.33 +/- 12.06 b.min, and the %HRmax@R4 was 85.53 +/- 5.72%. The main conclusion is that increasing musical cadence created an increase in the physiologic response. Therefore, instructors must choose musical cadences according to the goals of the session they are conducting to achieve the desired intensity.",M2
19967584,"Effects of agonist-antagonist complex resistance training on upper body strength and power development.The objective of this study was to examine the chronic effects on strength and power of performing complex versus traditional set training over eight weeks.

The traditional set group performed the pulling before the pushing exercise sets, whereas the complex set group alternated pulling and pushing sets. The complex set training sessions were completed in approximately half the time. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was monitored during both test sessions in an attempt to determine if it was affected as a result of the training programme. Although there were no differences in the dependent variables between the two conditions, bench pull and bench press 1-RM increased significantly under the complex set condition and peak power increased significantly under the traditional set condition. Effect size statistics suggested that the complex set was more time-efficient than the traditional set condition with respect to development of 1-RM bench pull and bench press, peak velocity and peak power. The EMG activity was not affected. Complex set training would appear to be an effective method of exercise with respect to efficiency and strength development.",M2

The maximal oxygen uptake test caused decrease of the mean duration of peaks in SDP, decreasing the stability level, without modify the rates of central and muscular torque controls. Conversely, 60 min exercise increased the mean time interval between two consecutive peaks in SDP, thus decreasing the control rate but not changing the stability level. Visual privation had a greater effect on body sway than these exercises, which were applied to muscles that are not the main actuators in body sway control. Concluding, the changes in postural control are dependent on the intensity and duration of exercise.",M2

19960352,"Correspondences between continuous and intermittent <e>exercises</e> intensities in healthy prepubescent children.The aim of this article is to determine correspondences between three levels of continuous and intermittent exercise (CE and IE, respectively) in terms of steady-state oxygen uptake (VO(2SS)) and heart rate (HR) in children. Fourteen healthy children performed seven exercises on a treadmill: one graded test for the determination of maximal aerobic speed (MAS), three CE at 60, 70 and 80% of MAS (CE60, CE70 and CE80) and three IE (alternating 15 s of exercise intercepted with 15 s of passive recovery) at 90, 100 and 110% of MAS (IE90, IE100 and IE110). Mean VO(2SS) and mean HR were determined for both continuous and intermittent exercises. For comparison, three associations were designed: CE60 versus IE90, CE70 versus IE100 and CE80 versus IE110. No VO(2SS) difference was observed for CE60 versus IE90 and CE70 versus IE100 whereas a significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) was found for CE80 versus IE110 (1.36 +/- 0.45 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.38 L min(-1), respectively). Significant linear regressions were found for the three CE versus IE associations for VO(2SS) (0.60 &lt; r (2) &lt; 0.99, P &lt; 0.05). For the three associations, mean HR presented no significant difference. Only one significant relation was found for CE80 versus IE110 association (r(2) = 0.49, P &lt; 0.05). Correspondences between CE and IE intensities are possible in terms of VO(2SS) whatever the level of exercise; even if for high intensities, VO(2SS) was higher during CE. These results demonstrated that it is possible to diversify the exercise modality while conserving exercise individualization.",M2
19959776,"Rest versus exercise hemodynamics for middle cerebral artery aneurysms: a computational study.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise is an accepted method of improving cardiovascular health; however, the impact of increases in blood flow and heart rate on a cerebral aneurysms is unknown. This study was performed to simulate the changes in hemodynamic conditions within an intracranial aneurysm when a patient <e>exercises</e>. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rotational 3D digital subtraction angiograms were used to reconstruct patient-specific geometries of 3 aneurysms located at the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery. CFD was used to solve for transient flow fields during simulated rest and exercise conditions. Inlet conditions were set by using published transcranial Doppler sonography data for the middle cerebral artery. Velocity fields were analyzed and postprocessed to provide physiologically relevant metrics. RESULTS: Overall flow patterns were not significantly altered during exercise. Across subjects, during the exercise simulation, time-averaged WSS increased by a mean of 20% (range, 4%-34%), the RRT of a particle in the near-wall flow decreased by a mean of 28% (range, 13%-40%), and time-averaged pressure on the aneurysm wall did not change significantly. In 2 of the aneurysms, there was a 3-fold order-of-magnitude spatial difference in RRT between the aneurysm and surrounding vasculature. CONCLUSIONS: WSS did not increase significantly during simulated moderate aerobic exercise. While the reduction in RRT during exercise was small in comparison with spatial differences, there may be potential benefits associated with decreased RRT (ie, improved replenishment of nutrients to cells within the aneurysmal tissue).",M2

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ellagitannin supplementation from Wonderful variety pomegranate extract (POMx) improved recovery of skeletal muscle strength after eccentric exercise. METHODS: Recreationally active males were randomized into a crossover design with either pomegranate extract (POMx) or placebo (PLA), each given during a period of 9 d.To produce delayed-onset muscle soreness, subjects performed two sets of 20 maximal eccentric elbow flexion <e>exercises</e> with one arm.Maximal isometric elbow flexion strength and muscle soreness as well as serum measures of creatine kinase, myoglobin, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein were made at baseline and 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after exercise. RESULTS: With both treatments, strength was similarly reduced 2 h after exercise (i.e., 72% of baseline), and recovery of strength was incomplete after 96 h (i.e., 91% of baseline).However, strength was significantly higher in POMx compared with that in PLA at 48 h (85.4% +/- 2.5% and 78.3% +/- 2.6%, P = 0.01) and 72 h (88.9% +/- 2.0% and 84.0% +/- 2.0%, P = 0.009) after exercise.

The purpose of this study was to assess predictors of adherence to an intervention involving walking and balance <e>exercises</e>. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up. Sedentary women (n = 137) aged &gt; or =70 randomized to the exercise intervention were evaluated in their homes. The exercise prescription included walking 30 minutes per day 5 days per week and completing 11 balance exercises twice per week. The main outcome measure was exercise adherence of the intervention group only. RESULTS: The average number of minutes walked per week was 95.2 (SD 68.8); 17% walked the recommended 150 minutes or greater. The average number of times the balance exercises were done was 1.5 (SD 1.6) per week. Results of regression analysis for walking adherence showed clinical variables accounted for the greatest variance (17%) of all the blocks, and cognitive variables were second highest (12%). The final model explained 19% of the variance in predicting adherence to walking. Results of regression analysis for adherence to balance exercises showed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) variables accounted for the greatest variance (14%), followed by cognitive variables (12%). The final model explained 24% of the variance in predicting adherence to balance exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to exercise was below recommended goals, although this study demonstrated that sedentary women can adopt and continue regular exercise long term. Predictors of adherence varied with different forms of exercise. Individually tailored exercise interventions may be most amenable to older women.",M2

We used this approach to investigate biochemical changes due to acute and chronic physical exercise. Twenty-two women using identical oral contraceptives were segregated into an untrained (n = 10) or trained (n = 12) group depending on their physical training background. The subjects performed two <e>exercises</e> in a randomized order: a prolonged exercise test (75% of their VO(2 max) until exhaustion) and a short-term, intensive exercise test (short-term, intensive exercise anaerobic test). Urine specimens were collected before and 30 min after each test. The samples were analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and multivariate statistical techniques were utilized to process the data. Distinguishing characteristics were observed only in the urine profiles of specimens collected before vs. 30 min after the short-term, intensive exercise test. The metabolites responsible for such changes were creatinine, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, and hypoxanthine. In both groups, the excretion of lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and hypoxanthine increased similarly after the completion of the short-term, intensive exercise test (p &lt; 0.03).

METHODS: Sixteen males performed bouts of 90 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions over 6 consecutive days (B1-B6) at either small (n=8) or large (n=8) range of motion. Average of peak torque (Mp) of each of the 90 contraction trials were calculated, plasma creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were measured before, 24 h, 48 h and 6 d after B1. Muscle soreness was evaluated every day during the experiment. RESULTS: At B3 Mp reduced more in group L than in group S. From B1 to B6 group S increased Mp, while in group L Mp did not return to the baseline level. In both groups CK activity elevated 24 h following B1. CK activity was significantly higher in group L 6d after B1. In group L muscle soreness was higher at 48 h, 72 h, 4 d and 5 d after B1. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, consecutive eccentric knee extensor exercise training at large range of motion may induce greater development of muscle damage and force deficit, than training at small range of motion.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of lumbar disc herniation in China. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In China, along with the economic development, people's living environment and working conditions have undergone some tremendous changes, such as the accelerating life pace and competition. In this situation, it is important to know whether the risk factors of lumbar disc herniation have changed or not. This case-control study, including the possible social and psychological factors based on the literature, attempted to search the new risk factor, therefore provide better prevention measures for lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: A total of 2010 hospitalized patients, diagnosed with lumbar disc protrusion by CT and/or MRI were selected as cases. A total of 2070 people from communities and hospitals, without history of low back pain and sciatica, were selected as controls. All patients and controls were investigated for their family history, occupational characters' smoking status, working psychosocial factors, etc. The risk factors were analyzed by multiple nonconditional logistic regression method. RESULTS: Family history (OR = 3.6) was the most important risk factor for lumbar disc protrusion in this study, followed by lumbar load (OR = 2.1), hard-working (OR = 1.8), and time urgency (OR = 1.1). Additionally, physical <e>exercises</e> (OR = 0.5) and bed characteristics (OR = 0.4) appeared to be the protective factors for lumbar disc protrusion. After stratified by age, family history (OR = 14.5), occupational character (OR = 5.2), and physical exercises (OR = 0.2) stronger association with lumbar disc protrusion was seen in subjects younger than 30 years. In subjects from 30 to 55 years, family history (OR = 5.1), lumbar load (OR = 1.91), hard-working (1.9), physical exercises (OR = 0.5), time urgency (OR = 1. 3), bed characteristics (OR = 0.4) were significantly important. In subjects older than 55 years, lumbar load (OR = 2.9) and bed characteristics (OR = 0.4) were closely related to lumbar disc protrusion. CONCLUSION: Family history, lumbar load, hard-working, and time urgency are the major risk factors for lumbar disc herniation, and physical exercises and sleeping on the hard bed might be the protective factors.",M2
19930615,"Evaluating the effectiveness of psychosocial resilience training for heart health, and the added value of promoting physical activity: a cluster randomized trial of the READY program.BACKGROUND: Depression and poor social support are significant risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), and stress and anxiety can trigger coronary events. People experiencing such psychosocial difficulties are more likely to be physically inactive, which is also an independent risk factor for CHD. Resilience training can target these risk factors, but there is little research evaluating the effectiveness of such programs. This paper describes the design and measures of a study to evaluate a resilience training program (READY) to promote psychosocial well-being for heart health, and the added value of integrating physical activity promotion. METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster randomized trial, 95 participants will be allocated to either a waitlist or one of two intervention conditions. Both intervention conditions will receive a 10 x 2.5 hour group resilience training program (READY) over 13 weeks. The program targets five protective factors identified from empirical evidence and analyzed as mediating variables: positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, social support, life meaning, and active coping. Resilience enhancement strategies reflect the six core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy processes (values, mindfulness, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, committed action) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy strategies such as relaxation training and social support building skills. Sessions include psychoeducation, discussions, experiential <e>exercises</e>, and home assignments. One intervention condition will include an additional session and ongoing content promoting physical activity. Measurement will occur at baseline, two weeks post intervention, and at eight weeks follow-up, and will include questionnaires, pedometer step logs, and physical and hematological measures. Primary outcome measures will include self-reported indicators of psychosocial well-being and depression. Secondary outcome measures will include self-reported indicators of stress, anxiety and physical activity, and objective indicators of CHD risk (blood glucose, cholesterol [mmol.L-1], triglycerides, blood pressure). Process measures of attendance, engagement and fidelity will also be conducted. Linear analyses will be used to examine group differences in the outcome measures, and the product of coefficients method will be used to examine mediated effects. DISCUSSION: If successful, this program will provide an innovative means by which to promote psychosocial well-being for heart health in the general population. The program could also be adapted to promote well-being in other at risk population subgroups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12608000017325.",M2

It is unknown how long this situation persists after very intense exercise or whether it differs between intense exhausting and non-exhausting exercise. It is also not known to what extent the redistribution differs between different types of non-active tissues. Therefore nine healthy young men cycled first for 2 min at 328 W (non-exhausting exercise, mean). Blood velocity in thigh and arm (ultrasound-doppler), perfusion of forearm skin (non-acral skin) and finger tip (acral skin, with arterio-venous anastomoses) were measured for 30 min after exercise (laser-doppler). To be able to study vascular resistance and central circulation, blood pressure (Finometer), heart rate (ECG), and stroke volume (ultrasound-doppler) were measured. Thereafter the subjects cycled at the same power to exhaustion (4 min), and the measurements were repeated. After both <e>exercises</e> mean blood pressure was unchanged (&lt; or = 80 mm Hg) despite increased cardiac output (&gt; or = + 30% vs. pre-exercise).

Blood perfusion of non-acral skin was unchanged from pre-exercise level after 2 min of non-exhausting exercise, but it was twice as high after 4 min cycling to exhaustion as at rest (p=0.02). Blood perfusion of acral skin rose after both exercises and did not differ between exhausting and non-exhausting exercise.

Twenty-three subjects participated in this study (mean +/- SD, age 21.2 +/- 1.4 years; body mass 77.8 +/- 16.2 kg). Kinetic data were obtained via a force platform for the test <e>exercises</e> modes, which included walking, jogging, depth jumps, loaded jump squats, and the back squat. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for I, GRF, and RFD (p &lt; or = 0.001).

The depth jump demonstrated the highest GRF and RFD, while the back squat produced the highest I. The jump squat produced the second highest value for all the variables assessed. Thus, the depth jump, jump squat, and back squat appear to offer the greatest potential as osteogenic stimuli and a mixed mode training strategy including exercises such as these is recommended. These results suggest that walking and jogging may have less osteogenic potential.",M2

19915502,"WISE-2005: exercise and nutrition countermeasures for upright VO2pk during bed rest.PURPOSE: Exercise prescriptions for spaceflight include aerobic and resistive countermeasures, yet few studies have evaluated their combined effects on exercise responses after real or simulated microgravity. We hypothesized that upright aerobic capacity (VO2pk) is protected during a 60-d bed rest (BR) in which intermittent (40%-80% pre-BR VO2pk) aerobic exercise (supine treadmill exercise against lower body negative pressure) was performed 2-4 d x wk(-1) and resistive exercise (inertial flywheel <e>exercises</e>) was performed 2-3 d x wk(-1). Further, we hypothesized that ingestion of an amino acid supplement that was shown previously to counteract muscle atrophy, would reduce the decline in VO2pk in nonexercising subjects during BR. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy women (8 nonexercise controls (CON), 8 exercisers (EX), and 8 nonexercisers with nutritional supplementation (NUT)) underwent a 20-d ambulatory baseline period, 60 d of 6 degrees head-down tilt BR, and 21 d of ambulatory recovery. VO2pk was measured pre-BR and on the third day of recovery from BR (R3). RESULTS: In the EX group, VO2pk (mean +/- SE) was not different from pre-BR (-3.3 +/- 1.2%) on R3, although it decreased significantly in the CON (-21.2 +/- 2.1%) and NUT (-25.6 +/- 1.6%) groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that alternating aerobic and resistive exercise on most days during prolonged microgravity simulated by BR is sufficient to preserve or allow quick recovery of upright aerobic capacity in women but that a nutritional supplementation alone is not effective.",M2
19911088,"Elbow joint position sense after neuromuscular training with handheld vibration.CONTEXT: Clinicians use neuromuscular control <e>exercises</e> to enhance joint position sense (JPS); however, because standardizing such exercises is difficult, validations of their use are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effects of a neuromuscular training exercise with a handheld vibrating dumbbell on elbow JPS acuity. DESIGN: Crossover study. SETTING: University athletic training research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one healthy, college-aged volunteers (16 men, 15 women, age = 23 + or - 3 years, height = 173 + or - 8 cm, mass = 76 + or - 14 kg). INTERVENTION(S): We measured and trained elbow JPS using an electromagnetic tracking device that provided auditory and visual biofeedback. For JPS testing, participants held a dumbbell and actively identified the target elbow flexion angle (90 degrees ) using the software-generated biofeedback, followed by 3 repositioning trials without feedback. Each neuromuscular training protocol included 3 exercises during which participants held a 2.55-kg dumbbell vibrating at 15, 5, or 0 Hz and used software-generated biofeedback to locate and maintain the target elbow flexion angle for 15 seconds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We calculated absolute (accuracy) and variable (variability) errors using the differences between target and reproduced angles. RESULTS: Training protocols using 15-Hz vibration enhanced accuracy and decreased variability of elbow JPS (P &lt; or = .005), whereas 5-Hz vibration did not affect accuracy (F(1,61) = 2.625, P = .100) but did decrease variability (F(1,61) = 7.250, P = .009). The control condition and 0-Hz training protocol had no effect on accuracy or variability (P &gt; or = .200). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest these neuromuscular control exercises, which included low-magnitude, low-frequency handheld vibration, may enhance elbow JPS. Future researchers should examine vibration of various durations and frequencies, should include injured participants and functional multijoint and multiplanar measures, and should examine long-term effects of training protocols on JPS and injury.",M2
19907801,"Comparison of aerobic and combined aerobic and resistance training on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in men.While aerobic training and, to a lesser degree, resistance training are known to reduce blood concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), little is known about the effects of a combination of aerobic and resistance training on LDL-C concentrations. The aim of the investigation was to examine the effects of 16 weeks of no exercise, aerobic training or a combination of aerobic and resistance training on lowering blood concentrations of LDL-C. Thirty-eight healthy, previously untrained men (mean age: 25 years and six months) with borderline high blood LDL-C concentrations volunteered to participate in this investigation. Each subject's blood LDL-C concentrations were measured following a nine- to 12-hour fasting period and prior to any exercise. Aerobic training consisted of exercise using a combination of treadmills, rowers, steppers and cycle ergometers. Combined aerobic and resistance training consisted of a combination of aerobic training at 60% of heart rate maximum, and resistance training using eight prescribed <e>exercises</e> performed for two sets of 15 repetitions at 60% of the estimated one-repetition maximum (1-RM). The no-exercise group was found to have had no significant (p &lt; or = 0.05) change in blood LDL-C concentrations (from 4.12 +/- 0.27 to 4.21 +/- 0.42 mmol.l- (1)), whereas the aerobic training and combined training groups showed significant and similar (p = 0.123) decreases in blood LDL-C concentrations (from 3.64 +/- 2.87 to 2.87 +/- 0.64 mmol.l- (1) and from 4.39 +/- 1.04 to 3.23 +/- 0.71 mmol.l- (1), respectively). This investigation indicates that a larger dose of aerobic exercise does not necessarily equate to a greater improvement in LDL-C concentrations if the lost aerobic exercise time is replaced with resistance exercise.",M2
19902242,"Intense physical exercise increases systemic 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in healthy adult subjects.Intense physical exercise activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis but little is known about changes in glucocorticoid sensitivity at the target cell level. No data are available on the acute effects of exercise on 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) type 1 activity, which generates biologically active cortisol from inactive cortisone and is expressed also in skeletal muscle. Fifteen healthy, trained males (age mean +/- SE 28 +/- 1) were assessed on three non-consecutive days: at rest, during an endurance and strength sessions. During each session, between 1000 and 1600 hours, 6-h urine and four salivary samples were collected. Urinary total tetrahydrocortisol (THF) + alloTHF, tetrahydrocortisone (THE), cortisol (F) and cortisone (E) were measured with HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry; urinary-unconjugated F and E were measured by HPLC-UV. Salivary cortisol and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured by RIA and ELISA, respectively. Both endurance and strength <e>exercises</e> caused an increase in (THF + alloTHF)/THE ratio (mean +/- SE 1.90 +/- 0.07 and 1.82 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.63 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively), consistent with increased systemic 11beta-HSD type 1 activity. No relationship was found with age, BMI, VO(2max) maximal power load or perceived exertion. No significant change was apparent in F/E ratio, an index of 11beta-HSD type 2 activity. No effect of exercise on salivary cortisol and IL-6 was observed, whereas a significant effect of sampling time was found. Intense physical exercise acutely increases systemic 11beta-HSD type 1 activity in humans. Such an increase may lead to higher cortisol concentration in target tissues, notably in skeletal muscle where it could contribute to limit exercise-induced muscle inflammatory response.",M2
19891202,"Kinematics and kinetics of the bench-press and bench-pull <e>exercises</e> in a strength-trained sporting population.Understanding how loading affects power production in resistance training is a key step in identifying the most optimal way of training muscular power - an essential trait in most sporting movements. Twelve elite male sailors with extensive strength-training experience participated in a comparison of kinematics and kinetics from the upper body musculature, with upper body push (bench press) and pull (bench pull) movements performed across loads of 10-100% of one repetition maximum (1RM). 1RM strength and force were shown to be greater in the bench press, while velocity and power outputs were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads. While power output was at a similar level for the two movements at a low load (10% 1RM), significantly greater power outputs were observed for the bench pull in comparison to the bench press with increased load. Power output (Pmax) was maximized at higher relative loads for both mean and peak power in the bench pull (78.6 +/- 5.7% and 70.4 +/- 5.4% of 1RM) compared to the bench press (53.3 +/- 1.7% and 49.7 +/- 4.4% of 1RM). Findings can most likely be attributed to differences in muscle architecture, which may have training implications for these muscles.",M2
19858327,"Mirrors and resistance exercise, do they influence affective responses?The purpose of this study was to examine affective responses during and following resistance exercise in a mirrored environment. Thirty-two females completed three sessions. During session one, exercise intensity was determined for the subsequent two sessions. During the next two sessions participants performed eight <e>exercises</e> either with or without mirrors. Affect was measured prior to, during, immediately following and 15 minutes post-exercise. Affect was more pleasant and activated during and following exercise, but did not differ by condition. The inability to find a difference in mirrored condition may be a result of participants using the mirrors for technique as opposed to self-evaluation purposes.",M2
19855343,"Effect of plyometric training on swimming block start performance in adolescents.This study aimed to identify the effect of plyometric training (PT), when added to habitual training (HT) regimes, on swim start performance. After the completion of a baseline competitive swim start, 22 adolescent swimmers were randomly assigned to either a PT (n = 11, age: 13.1 +/- 1.4 yr, mass: 50.6 +/- 12.3 kg, stature: 162.9 +/- 11.9 cm) or an HT group (n = 11, age: 12.6 +/- 1.9 yr, mass: 43.3 +/- 11.6 kg, stature: 157.6 +/- 11.9 cm). Over an 8-week preseason period, the HT group continued with their normal training program, whereas the PT group added 2 additional 1-hour plyometric-specific sessions, incorporating prescribed <e>exercises</e> relating to the swimming block start (SBS). After completion of the training intervention, post-training swim start performance was reassessed. For both baseline and post-trials, swim performance was recorded using videography (50 Hz Canon MVX460) in the sagital plane of motion. Through the use of Silicon Coach Pro analysis package, data revealed significantly greater change between baseline and post-trials for PT when compared with the HT group for swim performance time to 5.5 m (-0.59 s vs. -0.21 s; p &lt; 0.01) and velocity of take-off to contact (0.19 ms vs. -0.07 ms; p &lt; 0.01). Considering the practical importance of a successful swim start to overall performance outcome, the current study has found that inclusion of suitable and safely implemented PT to adolescent performers, in addition to HT routines, can have a positive impact on swim start performance.",M2
19855334,"Traditional <e>exercises</e> do not have a significant impact on abdominal peak force in healthy young adults.The abdominals are vital to activities of daily living, for the prevention of lumbar pathologies, and during sport performance. The purpose of this study was to determine if training without external resistance was a sufficient overload to improve abdominal strength as defined by peak force. Seventy-one healthy men and women (age 19-40 years) participated in the 11-week study. Subjects were matched on baseline abdominal strength and then randomly assigned to 1 of 3 categories based on the number of days they performed abdominal exercises (0 days, 3 days, or 6 days per week). The results indicated that performing abdominal exercises 3 or 6 times per week did not improve either concentric or eccentric strength. These results suggest that the exercises used during this study were not enough of a stimulus to significantly improve concentric or eccentric strength values in either exercise group.",M2
19826833,"Can HRV be used to evaluate training load in constant load <e>exercises</e>?The overload principle of training states that training load (TL) must be sufficient to threaten the homeostasis of cells, tissues, organs, and/or body. However, there is no  golden standard  for TL measurement. The aim of this study was to examine if any post-exercise heart rate variability (HRV) indices could be used to evaluate TL in exercises with different intensities and durations. Thirteen endurance-trained males (35 +/- 5 year) performed MODE (moderate intensity, 3 km at 60% of the maximal velocity of the graded maximal test (vVO(2max))), HI (high intensity, 3 km at 85% vVO(2max)), and PRO (prolonged, 14 km at 60% vVO(2max)) exercises on a treadmill. HRV was analyzed with short-time Fourier-transform method during rest, exercise, and 15-min recovery. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate (BLa), and HFP(120) (mean of 0-120 s post-exercise) described TL of these exercises similarly, being different for HI (P &lt; 0.05) and PRO (P &lt; 0.05) when compared with MODE. RPE and BLa also correlated negatively with HFP(120) (r = -0.604, -0.401), LFP(120) (-0.634, -0.601), and TP(120) (-0.691, -0.569). HRV recovery dynamics were similar after each exercise, but the level of HRV was lower after HI than MODE. Increased intensity or duration of exercise decreased immediate HRV recovery, suggesting that post-exercise HRV may enable an objective evaluation of TL in field conditions. The first 2-min recovery seems to give enough information on HRV recovery for evaluating TL.",M2
19826301,"Comparison of hamstring and gluteus muscles electromyographic activity while performing the razor curl vs. the traditional prone hamstring curl.This study examined the muscle activation of the razor curl functional hamstring exercise (the razor curl has the total body extended and then requires the hips and knees to flex to 90 degrees simultaneously with full contraction of the hamstrings to further the knee flexion) to the traditional prone hamstring curl. Eight healthy, female intercollegiate athletes participated (mean age 20.8 +/- 3.9 y; mean height, 177.8 +/- 10.9 cm; mean weight, 67.3 +/- 9.9 kg). Electromyographic (EMG) data were collected on the following muscles: medial hamstring (semimembranosus and semitendinosus), biceps femoris, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus while participants performed the 2 <e>exercises</e>: razor curl and the traditional prone curl. Results revealed no significant differences between muscle activations during the 2 exercises (p &lt;or= 0.05). Also noted that, when examining the means of each muscle's percent of their maximum isometric voluntary contraction, the razor curl displayed a greater total activation. The investigators were able to conclude that the prone hamstring curl does, indeed, target the musculature of the hamstrings. However, it has been shown here that the more functional position of the razor curl does, indeed, achieve activation of not only the hamstring muscle group but also the gluteus medius and maximus. Both the traditional prone hamstring and the razor curl allow for hamstring and gluteals activation. However, if one wants to fully train the hamstrings functionally, one should focus on the razor curl. Due to its functionality, the razor curl is designed to increase hamstring contractibility by placing the hip into flexion. The razor curl is easily implemented on a back extension machine, where first one should focus on the form and then on functional speed.",M2

Twenty obese boys (BMI-SDS 3.04 +/- 0.52, %Fat Mass 38.2 +/- 2.1%) aged 14-16 years (pubertal stage &gt;3) participated in this study. Maximal oxygen uptake (V'O(2max)) and maximal fat oxidation rate were determined with indirect calorimetry using a graded exercise test on a treadmill. EE and substrate oxidation rate during equicaloric low-intensity (LI, 42% V'O(2max) for 45 min) and high-intensity (HI, 67% V'O(2max) for 30 min) exercises on a treadmill and during post-exercise recovery period (60 min) were determined with indirect calorimetry. Maximal fat oxidation rate was observed at 42 +/- 6% V'O(2max) (62 +/- 5% HR(max)) and fat oxidation rate was 0.45 +/- 0.07 g/min. The total amounts of EE, during the LI and HI exercises, and the post-exercise recovery periods were not significantly different (1,884 +/- 250 vs. 1,973 +/- 201 kJ, p = 0.453), but the total amount of fat oxidised was significantly higher (+9.9 g, +55.7%, p &lt; 0.001) during the LI exercise than during the HI exercise. However, fat oxidation rates during the post-exercise recovery periods were not significantly different following LI and HI exercises. Total fat oxidised was significantly higher during the LI than during the HI exercise in obese adolescents. However, the equicaloric exercise intensity did not influence EE, fat and carbohydrate oxidation rate during the recovery period.",M2
19816220,"Elastic band prediction equations for combined free-weight and elastic band bench presses and squats.Elastic bands added to traditional free-weight techniques have become a part of suggested training routines in recent years. Because of the variable loading patterns of elastic bands (i.e., greater stretch produces greater resistance), it is necessary to quantify the exact loading patterns of bands to identify the volume and intensity of training. The purpose of this study was to determine the length vs. tension properties of multiple sizes of a set of commonly used elastic bands to quantify the resistance that would be applied to free-weight plus elastic bench presses (BP) and squats (SQ). Five elastic bands of varying thickness were affixed to an overhead support beam. Dumbbells of varying weights were progressively added to the free end while the linear deformation was recorded with each subsequent weight increment. The resistance was plotted as a factor of linear deformation, and best-fit nonlinear logarithmic regression equations were then matched to the data. For both the BP and SQ loading conditions and all band thicknesses tested, R values were greater than 0.9623. These data suggest that differences in load exist as a result of the thickness of the elastic band, attachment technique, and type of exercise being performed. Facilities should adopt their own form of loading quantification to match their unique set of circumstances when acquiring, researching, and implementing elastic band and free-weight <e>exercises</e> into the training programs.",M2
19816218,"Effect of an acute bout of whole body vibration exercise on muscle force output and motor neuron excitability.The purpose of the current investigation was to assess the effect of an acute bout of whole body vibration (WBV) exercise on muscle force output and motor neuron excitability. Nineteen recreationally trained college-aged males were randomly assigned to a WBV (n = 10) or a sham (S, n = 9) group. The WBV group completed a series of static, body weight squats on a vibrating platform at 30 Hz and an amplitude of approximately 3.5 mm (vertical), whereas the S group performed the same series of <e>exercises</e> but without vibration. Measurements were performed before (Pre) and then immediately post-exercise (Imm Post), 8 minutes post-exercise (8-Min Post), or 16 minutes post-exercise (16-Min Post) during 3 different testing sessions. The measurements involved a ballistic isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the triceps surae muscle complex and electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve for assessment of motor neuron excitability by analyzing H-reflex and M-wave responses (H(max)/M(max) ratio). Electromyography was also obtained from the triceps surae muscle complex during the MVCs. The WBV group significantly (p &lt; or = 0.05) increased peak force at Imm Post (9.4%) and 8-Min Post (10.4%). No significant change in peak force was observed in the S group. No significant changes were observed in either group for average integrated EMG, H(max)/M(max) ratio, or rate of force development at Imm Post, 8-Min Post, or 16-Min Post. The results from this investigation indicate that an acute bout of static, body weight squat exercises, combined with WBV, increases muscle force output up to 8 minutes post-exercise. However, this increase in muscle force is not accompanied by a significant increase in motor neuron excitability or muscle activation. Thus, it is plausible to use WBV as a method for acute increase in muscle force output for athletes immediately before competition.",M2
19809232,"[The effect of group exercise on postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteopenia]OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of group exercise on bone mineral density (BMD), pain, and quality of life in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and osteopenia. METHODS: The study included 16 osteoporotic (mean age 55.2 years) and 17 osteopenic (mean age 55.4 years) postmenopausal women whose diagnoses were made by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) showing T-scores of less than -2.5 and in a range of -1 to -2.5, respectively. Subjects having orthopedic, neurological, respiratory, vascular, metabolic, or mental problems were excluded. Each group received the same group exercise program for one hour three times a week for 21 weeks, supervised by a physiotherapist, and including breathing, warm-up, stretching, strengthening, balance, stabilization, and cooling <e>exercises</e>. All participants were evaluated before and after the exercise program by a visual analog scale for pain severity, by DEXA for BMD, and by QUALEFFO-41 (Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis) for quality of life. RESULTS: The two groups were similar with respect to age, height, and body mass index (p&gt;0.05), but osteopenic women had a higher body weight (p&lt;0.05). After the exercise program, both groups exhibited significant improvements in T-score, pain score, BMD, and all parameters of the QUALEFFO-41 (p&lt;0.05). The mean T-scores before and after exercise were -2.7 + or - 0.2 and -2.4 + or - 0.5 in osteoporotic women, and -1.8 + or - 0.5 and -1.4 + or - 0.5 in osteopenic women, respectively. Following exercise, 43.8% of osteoporotic women had a T-score showing osteopenia, and 23.5% of osteopenic women had a T-score falling within the normal range. The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the differences between the mean improvements obtained after the exercise program (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates the effectiveness of physiotherapist-supervised group exercise programs in decreasing pain and increasing BMD and quality of life of both osteoporotic and osteopenic women.",M2
19789433,"Comprehensive directed breathing retraining improves exertional dyspnea for men with spirometry within normal limits.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of comprehensive directed breathing retraining with traditional diaphragmatic breathing on male smokers with exertional dyspnea but normal spirometry. DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized clinical trial in an exercise laboratory at a university hospital. Twenty-four nonmedicated exertional dyspnea subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (comprehensive directed breathing) and control (traditional diaphragmatic breathing) groups. Forty-four physiologic parameters associated with exertional dyspnea were studied before and after interventions for both groups at rest and at 40-W constant exercise for 10 mins. The interventions for both groups included diaphragmatic breathing <e>exercises</e>, walking, and arm exercises for 90 mins, 5 days/wk for 4 wks. In addition, the comprehensive directed breathing group was taught the anatomy and physiology of ventilation; they observed their ventilatory dyssynchrony in a mirror; they were shown their ventilatory rhythm on a spirogram; diaphragmatic movement was demonstrated in an educational movie; and verbal feedback was used to correct respiratory asynchrony. RESULTS: We compared the relative changes of lung function parameters before and after intervention for each group. The comprehensive directed breathing group improvements were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than those of traditional diaphragmatic breathing for 34 of 44 lung function parameters.

19778552,"Does regular practice of physical activity reduce the risk of dysphonia?OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between regular physical activity and the prevalence of dysphonia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 3142 teachers from 129 municipal public schools in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The dependent variable, dysphonia, was classified (absent or present) according to reported symptoms (fatigue when speaking and loss of voice quality), their frequency (occasionally and daily), and duration (past 15 days). The independent variable was regular physical activity. The degree of association was estimated based on the prevalence ratio and a 95% confidence interval obtained by the Poisson regression adapted for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: In the study sample, the prevalence of dysphonia in teachers was 15.63%. Nearly half (47.52%) of the teachers reported no regular practice of physical <e>exercises</e>. The remaining teachers (52.48%) walked and did physical exercises, sports, and other activities; 31.25% undertook these activities once or twice a week, and 21.23% exercised three or more times a week.

CONCLUSION: Regular physical activity was associated positively with the prevalence of dysphonia.",M2
19775693,"Biomechanical characteristics of the eccentric Achilles tendon exercise.BACKGROUND: Eccentric exercise has been shown to provide good short-term clinical results in the treatment of painful mid-portion chronic Achilles tendinopathies. However, the mechanisms behind the positive effects of eccentric rehabilitation regimes are not known, and research into the biomechanics of the exercise may improve our understanding. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects performed one-legged full weight bearing ankle plantar and dorsiflexion <e>exercises</e> during which three-dimensional ground reaction forces (GRF), ankle joint kinematics and surface electromyography (EMG) of the lower leg muscles were recorded. Joint kinematics, GRF frequency contents, average EMG amplitudes, and Achilles tendon loads were calculated. FINDINGS: The eccentric movement phase was characterized by a higher GRF frequency content in the 8-12 Hz range, and reduced EMG activity in the lower leg muscles. No differences in Achilles tendon loads were found. INTERPRETATION: This descriptive study demonstrates differences in the movement biomechanics between the eccentric and concentric phases of one-legged full weight bearing ankle dorsal and plantar flexion exercises. In particular, the findings imply that although the tendon loads are similar, the tendon is vibrated at higher frequencies during the eccentric phase than during the concentric phases. This study provides data that may explain the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of eccentric exercises used in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathies.",M2

Fourteen healthy adults (7 males, 7 females, mean age+/-S.D.=21.8+/-3.8 years) performed abdominal exercises in a randomised order following maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Muscle activity of the URA and LRA was assessed using surface electromyography. Results indicated that activity of the URA was significantly greater than muscle activity of the LRA for the curl-up, Swiss ball curl-up and Swiss ball rollout. LRA muscle activity was greater than URA during the jacknife exercise. Muscle activity during the curl-up was significantly lower than muscle activity during the other exercises. To conclude, muscle activity was greater when exercises were performed on a Swiss ball in comparison to a stable surface and LRA muscle activity was maximized during the Swiss ball jacknife.",M2

19760431,"The effects of low-intensity resistance training with vascular restriction on leg muscle strength in older men.The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of two types of resistance training protocols on the adaptation of skeletal muscle strength in older men. Thirty-seven healthy male subjects (50-64 years) participated in this study. Subjects were assigned to one of three groups: high-intensity (80% 1-RM) resistance training (RT80); low-intensity (20% 1-RM) resistance training with vascular restriction (VR-RT20); and a control group (CON) that performed no exercise. Subjects in both exercise groups performed three upper body (at 80% 1-RM) and two lower body <e>exercises</e> either with (20% 1-RM) or without (80% 1-RM) vascular restriction three times a week for 6 weeks. As expected, the RT80 and VR-RT20 groups had significantly (p &lt; 0.01) greater strength increases in all upper body and leg press exercises compared with CON, however, absolute strength gains for the RT80 and VR-RT20 groups were similar (p &gt; 0.05). It should be noted that the percentage increase in leg extension strength for the RT80 group was significantly greater than that for both the VR-RT20 (p &lt; 0.05) and CON groups (p &lt; 0.01), while the percentage increase in leg extension strength for the VR-RT20 group was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) greater than that for the CON. The findings suggested that leg muscle strength improves with the low-load vascular restriction training and the VR-RT20 training protocol was almost as effective as the RT80 training protocol for increasing muscular strength in older men.",M2

Sixteen male soccer players (21.3 +/- 1.1 years; 175.0 +/- 6.0 cm; 70.7 +/- 6.3 kg) completed LIST and performed a soccer match separated by 2 weeks and data were collected before, 30 min, 24, 48 and 72 h after LIST and match. HR, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, myoglobin (Mb), uric acid (UA), protein sulfhydryls (-SH), malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, total antioxidant status (TAS), blood leukocyte counts, delayed onset muscle soreness, 20 m sprint and jump performances, and maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion were analyzed. HR after LIST was significantly lower than after the match. Post-match TAS was lower and UA was higher than after LIST. Thirty minutes and 24 h after soccer MDA was higher and -SH was lower than after LIST (P &lt; 0.05). LIST and soccer match induced elevation in total leukocytes and a reduction in lymphocytes at 30 min. This reduction in blood lymphocytes 30 min after match was lower than after LIST. In conclusion, the impact of both <e>exercises</e> did not differ regarding the observed muscle damage markers and some neuromuscular parameters, although soccer requires higher cardiac demand and induced higher changes on redox status, adenine nucleotide metabolism and on lymphocyte counts than LIST, which should be taken into account when using LIST to simulate a match to study these type of physiological and biochemical-related endpoints.",M2
19756702,"Difference in the metabolic cost of postural actions during iso- and antidirectional coupled oscillations of the upper limbs in the horizontal plane.When oscillating the upper limbs in the horizontal plane, the effort required to maintain posture is higher when the limbs move isodirectionally (ISO coupling) than when they move mirror symmetrical, i.e., antidirectionally (ANTI). Movements stability and accuracy are much lower in ISO than in ANTI and the higher postural requests may be one factor contributing to the coordination deficiency of ISO movements. On this background, we measured the metabolic cost of ISO and ANTI movements in order to (1) quantitatively evaluate the supplemental effort required by ISO coupling, (2) establish whether it can be entirely ascribed to postural activities, and (3) compare it with the effort paid for the primary movement. Breath-by-breath metabolic (VO2, VCO2) and cardio-respiratory (HR, VE) parameters were measured in six participants, who performed intermittent <e>exercises</e> (5 min long, 12 s movement, 12 s rest) of cyclic arm adduction-abduction in the horizontal plane with either one arm or both arms in ISO or ANTI coupling, at 1.4 and 2.0 Hz. A force platform recorded the reaction forces to ground and the torque about the trunk vertical axis (Tz). At both frequencies and at metabolic steady-state, the mean values of both VO2 and Tz were found to be larger during ISO than ANTI coupling. Moreover, a linear relation was found between metabolic cost and Tz. Lastly, during ANTI coupling virtually all the energy was spent for the primary movement whilst the large increase in energy expenditure when passing from ANTI to ISO was almost entirely ascribable to postural activities.",M2

This regimen consists of meditation, yogic breath control practices, physical <e>exercises</e> (of both a postural- and movement-based, including aerobic nature), and dietary practices. While each of these component categories exhibit variations in different schools, lineages, traditions, and cultures, the focus of this chapter is primarily on basic forms of relaxation meditation and breath control, as well as postural and aerobic physical exercises (e.g., yogic prostration regimens, see below), and a standard form of yogic or ascetic diet, all of which constitute a basic form of regimen found in many if not most cultures, though with variations.",M2
19711738,"[Physical activity in basic and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease]On account of the frequency of appearing and character of atherosclerosis cardiac vascular disease, one of the most crucial elements of effective fight against it is preparation of complex preventive programs including as vast number of population as possible. Consequently, Benjamin and Smitch suggested attaching the notion of basic prevention to the standard division into primary and secondary one. The basic prevention, carrying out in the general population, should concern genetic predisposition, psychosocial factors, keeping up proper body weight, healthy eating and physical activity. Especially high hopes are connected with high efficiency, simplicity and low money-consumption of preventive activities associated with physical activity modification, which has a crucial influence on reducing negative impact of atherosclerosis hazard. The results of numerous scientific research, carried out in many countries and on various, large groups, proved undoubtedly that at the healthy adult people of both sex the systematic physical activity of moderate intensification plays an essential part in preventing CVD and decreasing the death risk because of that reason as well. Moreover, systematic physical <e>exercises</e> show many other health-oriented actions, thanks to which they have an influence on decreasing premature and total death rate. The risk of incidence of civilization-related diseases such as diabetes type II, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, tumors (of large intestine, breast, prostatic gland) and depression has decreased significantly. Unequivocally positive influence has been proved at many observations dedicated to health recreational physical activity and physical activity connected with professional work based on aerobe effort. The positive effects have been also observed at children population and senior population which is more and more numerous and the most at risk. The beneficial action of physical activity is connected with direct effect on organism, which leads to adaptive changes increasing the efficiency of its functioning and, in intermediate way, modifying and reducing the influence of other risk factors of cardiac vascular disease, mainly obesity dyslipidemy and hypertension. The subsequent scientific observations had an influence on the alterations of scientific associations recommendations concerning the preferred kind, intensity and effective dose of health-oriented physical activity. The current recommendations on preventive usefulness of physical activity, implemented by Polish Cardiological Association, have been based on a document containing the guidelines of European Cardiologic Association coming from 2003. All described evidences present in unambiguous way the undeniable benefits of active lifestyle. Its promoting as well as supporting in this area vast number of population, especially in case of disturbing epidemiological data, is becoming a duty of not only health service workers but also state administration employees responsible for planning public health expenditure.",M2
19701647,"Effects of digoxin on muscle reflexes in normal humans.Blockade of the skeletal muscle Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump by digoxin could result in a more marked hyperkaliema during a forearm exercise, which in turn could stimulate the mechano- and metaboreceptors. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and cross-over-design study, we measured mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), ventilation (V(E)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), venous plasma potassium and lactic acid during dynamic handgrip <e>exercises</e>, and local circulatory arrest in 11 healthy subjects. Digoxin enhanced MBP during exercise but not during the post-handgrip ischemia and had no effect on HR, V(E), SpO(2), and MSNA. Venous plasma potassium and lactic acid were also not affected by digoxin-induced skeletal muscle Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase blockade. We conclude that digoxin increased MBP during dynamic exercise in healthy humans, independently of changes in potassium and lactic acid. A modest direct sensitization of the muscle mechanoreceptors is unlikely and other mechanisms, independent of muscle reflexes and related to the inotropic effects of digoxin, might be implicated.",M2
19695525,"The effect of prehabilitation exercise on strength and functioning after total knee arthroplasty.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a preoperative exercise intervention on knee pain, functional ability, and quadriceps strength among patients with knee osteoarthritis before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to compare 2 groups over 4 data collection points. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Community-dwelling subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee who were scheduled for a unilateral TKA were recruited from a single orthopedic surgeon's office and were randomized into control (n = 28) or prehab groups (n = 26). INTERVENTIONS: The control patients maintained usual care before their TKA. The exercisers performed prehabilitation <e>exercises</e>, which included resistance training, flexibility, and step training, 3 times per week before their TKA. OUTCOME MEASURES: Knee pain, functional ability, quadriceps strength, and strength asymmetry were assessed at baseline (T1), at 1 week before the patients' TKA (T2), and again at 1 (T3) and 3 (T4) months after TKA. RESULTS: The exercisers improved their sit-to-stand performance at T2, whereas the control group did not change their performance of functional tasks and had increased pain at T2. At T3 the exercisers demonstrated improved sit-to-stand performance. The control patients at T3 exhibited decreases in pain, their 6-minute walk, surgical leg strength and an increase in their nonsurgical leg strength and leg strength asymmetry. At T4 the exercisers improved in their performance of 3 of the 4 functional tasks, decreased all of their pain measures, and increased their surgical and nonsurgical quadriceps strength. At T4 the control group improved their performance on 2 of the 4 functional tasks, decreased all of their pain measures, increased their nonsurgical leg strength, and exhibited greater leg strength asymmetry. CONCLUSION: These findings appear to indicate the efficacy of prehabilitation among TKA patients and support the theory of prehabilitation.",M2
19688236,"Effect of combined resistance and aerobic training on reactive hyperemia in men.Reduced response to reactive hyperemia (RH) in the extremities reflects impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the microvasculature. The aims of the present study were to determine whether resistance training and a combination of aerobic and resistance training increase the endothelial vasodilation of the forearm assessed by RH. A total of 39 young men were assigned to either high-intensity resistance training (HIR; six types of <e>exercises</e>, 80% 1RM x 10 repetitions x 3 sets, n = 14) or moderate-intensity resistance training (MIR; six types of exercises, 50% 1RM x 16 repetitions x 3 sets, n = 14) or a combination of high-intensity resistance training and moderate-intensity endurance training (COMBO; HIR and 60% maximal heart rate x 30 min, n = 11) groups. We measured forearm blood flow response to RH before and after 4 months of exercise intervention. All training groups increased maximal strength in all muscle groups tested (all P &lt; 0.05). After 4 months of training, the forearm blood flow during RH increased significantly in the MIR and COMBO groups, from 57 +/- 4 to 66 +/- 7 ml/min per 100 ml tissue and from 59 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 8 ml/min per 100 ml tissue, respectively (both P &lt; 0.05). There was no change in the response to RH in the HIR groups. In conclusion, the findings in this study demonstrate that combined resistance and aerobic training may affect the vasoreactivity response to RH in the forearm, but not resistance training alone.",M2
19687339,"Effect of exercise on postmenopausal sex hormone levels and role of body fat: a randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: To examine the effects of a 1-year exercise intervention on sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women and whether any effects are mediated by changes in body fat composition. METHODS: We randomly assigned 189 sedentary postmenopausal women (age 50 to 69 years, body mass index of 22 to 40 kg/m(2)) to an exercise intervention (n = 96) or a control group (n = 93). The intervention combined aerobic and strength training and comprised supervised group sessions and home-based <e>exercises</e> (a total of 2.5 h/wk). Between-group differences in sex hormone levels (at baseline and 4 and 12 months) were examined with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: In total, 183 women (97%) completed the study. Overall, the exercise intervention did not result in favorable effects on sex hormone levels. Among women who lost more than 2% body fat, declines in all estrogens were not significantly different between exercisers and controls. Androgen levels decreased significantly in the exercise group who lost body fat compared with their peers in the control group. Furthermore, this study confirmed that fat loss was significantly associated with declines in postmenopausal estrogen levels. Although not significant, a similar trend was observed for the androgens. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that fat loss is associated with changes in postmenopausal sex hormone levels and suggests that exercise may be effective in inducing favorable changes in these hormones.",M2
19682788,"Real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the assessment of perfusion dynamics in skeletal muscle.We developed a real-time low-MI contrast-enhanced ultrasound method (CEUS), compared it with venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) and evaluated its robustness in the quantification of skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise. Contrast pulse sequencing (7 MHz) during continuous intravenous infusion of SonoVue (4.8 mL/300 s) was used repeatedly in eight healthy volunteers to monitor changes of the muscle perfusion before, during and after isometric <e>exercises</e> (10 to 50% of individual maximum strength for 20 to 30 s) of the gastrocnemius muscle in real time. CEUS was correlated with VOP at different time points, and the exactness of several CEUS parameters obtained from ultrasound-signal-intensity-time curves was evaluated. Real-time CEUS depicted a large variability of the skeletal muscle blood volume at rest (mean, 3.48; range, 0.60 to 9.92 [approximately mL]), with a significant reproducibility (r=0.72, p&lt;0.05) and correlation with VOP (r=0.59, p&lt;0.001). Mean blood volume during exercise was 1.58(approximately mL), increased to a mean maximum after exercise of 8.88 (approximately mL), the mean change of the local blood volume during and directly after the exercise was -0.10 and +1.57(approximately mL/s). The average CEUS signal during exercise decreased (mean area under the curve, -50.4 [approximately mL.s]) and subsequently increased post exercise (mean 118.6 [approximately mL.s]). CEUS parameters could be calculated with mean relative errors between 6 and 36%. Continuous assessment of local muscle microcirculation during exercise is possible with real-time CEUS with an acceptable robustness. Its application may be of particular interest in a better understanding of the role of perfusion during muscle training, and the monitoring of pathological vascular response, such as in diabetic microvessel diseases.",M2
19680049,"Effects of exercise on intraocular pressure and ocular blood flow: a review.Glaucoma is a disease characterized by progressive optic neuropathy resulting in retinal ganglion cell death, which affects approximately 68 million people worldwide. Risk factors include intraocular pressure (IOP), genetics, race, age, and vascular factors. Exercise is known to affect IOP and systemic cardiovascular factors and, therefore, may affect glaucoma pathophysiology. This review discusses the results of articles relevant to glaucoma, IOP, ocular blood flow (OBF), and exercise. Isometric and dynamic <e>exercises</e> have been studied with respect to effects on IOP and OBF. Isometric exercise results in an acute decrease in IOP, which correlates with hypocapnia. Dynamic exercise results in a more pronounced but also short duration decrease in IOP. Physical fitness is associated with lower baseline IOP but diminished acute IOP-lowering response to exercise. Upon cessation of exercise, values return to pretrained levels within 1 month. In glaucoma patients, these IOP-lowering effects are greater than in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, OBF is unchanged during exercise due to vascular autoregulation. This autoregulation fails at ocular perfusion pressures greater than 70% above baseline. In conclusion exercise in glaucoma patients results in acutely lowered IOP and lower baseline IOP. The effects of exercise on the prevention of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression remain unknown. The role of exercise in glaucoma management should be investigated.",M2
19679117,"Oxidative stress and DNA damage in older adults that do <e>exercises</e> regularly.OBJECTIVES: Free radicals may damage lipids, proteins and DNA, which may lead to critical diseases in the aging. This work evaluated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and DNA damage by comet assay (SCGE) in older adults that do exercises regularly. DESIGN AND METHODS: 110 females, aged 66.3+/-8 years were divided into sedentary (n=54), walking (n=36) and muscle building (n=20) groups. Levels of MDA, GPx and SCGE were measured in venous blood before and after exercise. RESULTS: MDA levels were higher (P&lt;0.005) and GPx levels were lower (P&lt;0.005) in active groups than in sedentary group. SCGE index after physical activity was greater than at baseline (muscle building: P=0.004; walking: P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise reduces the diseases risk, but may promote the production of free radicals. It remains unclear whether cell adaptations responsible for health benefits are associated with such events. However we may suggest the existence of a different biochemical pattern for older adults that do exercise regularly.",M2

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of whole-body vibration (WBV) massage and stretching <e>exercises</e> at reducing perceived pain among untrained men. Sixteen adult men (age, 36.6 +/- 2.1 yr) volunteered to perform a strenuous exercise session consisting of resistance training and repeated sprints. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 recovery groups: a group performing WBV stretching sessions or a stretching group performing static stretching without vibration. Both groups performed similar stretches, twice per day for 3 days after the workout. The vibration group performed their stretches on the iTonic platform (frequency, 35 Hz; amplitude, 2 mm). Perceived pain was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postworkout. Statistical analyses identified a significantly lower level of reported perceived pain at all postworkout measurement times among the WBV group (p &lt; 0.05). No difference existed at the preworkout measurement time. The degree of attenuation of pain ranged from 22-61%. These data suggest that incorporating WBV as a recovery/regeneration tool may be effective for reducing the pain of muscle soreness and tightness after strenuous training.",M2
19675492,"Effects of lower-limb plyometric training on body composition, explosive strength, and kicking speed in female soccer players.The aim of the present study was to examine how explosive strength, kicking speed, and body composition are affected by a 12-week plyometric training program in elite female soccer players. The hypothesis was that this program would increase the jumping ability and kicking speed and that these gains could be maintained by means of regular soccer training only. Twenty adult female players were divided into 2 groups: control group (CG, n = 10, age 23.0 +/- 3.2 yr) and plyometric group (PG, n = 10; age 22.8 +/- 2.1 yr). The intervention was carried out during the second part of the competitive season. Both groups performed technical and tactical training <e>exercises</e> and matches together. However, the CG followed the regular soccer physical conditioning program, which was replaced by a plyometric program for PG. Neither CG nor PG performed weight training. Plyometric training took place 3 days a week for 12 weeks including jumps over hurdles, drop jumps (DJ) in stands, or horizontal jumps. Body mass, body composition, countermovement jump height, DJ height, and kicking speed were measured on 4 separate occasions. The PG demonstrated significant increases (p &lt; 0.05) in jumping ability after 6 weeks of training and in kicking speed after 12 weeks. There were no significant time x group interaction effects for body composition. It could be concluded that a 12-week plyometric program can improve explosive strength in female soccer players and that these improvements can be transferred to soccer kick performance in terms of ball speed. However, players need time to transfer these improvements in strength to the specific task. Regular soccer training can maintain the improvements from a plyometric training program for several weeks.",M2

The effects of physical activity in the form of resistance training or aerobic <e>exercises</e> on type 2 diabetes have not been studied in Indian population. The objective of this study was to analyse the effects of eight weeks of progressive resistance training (PRT) compared with aerobic exercise (AE) on glycaemic control, metabolic profile, cardiovascular fitness parameters and general well being in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Thirty adults (14 females and 16 males mean; age 53.8 +/- 8.8 yr) with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to 8 wk supervised PRT (n=10) or AE (n=10) or control group (n=10). Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index (BMI) and general well being were measured before training (i.e. 0 wk) and after 8 wk of training period. RESULTS: Plasma glycosylated haemoglobin levels decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) both in the PRT group (7.57 +/- 2.4% to 6.23 +/- 0.8%) and in AE group (8.11+/-0.9% to 6.66 +/- 0.9%).Total cholesterol levels decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) by 13.3 per cent in PRT group and by 6.1 per cent in AE group. Both exercise groups showed significantly reduction in systolic blood pressure (P&lt;0.05). General well being improvement was much more in PRT (8.6%) as compared to AE group (2.7%). INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that both PRT and AE were effective in improving metabolic profile of adults with type 2 diabetes but the percentage improvement in triglycerides, total cholesterol levels and general well being with PRT was more compared to AE. Further studies on a larger sample need to be done to confirm these findings.",M2
19657290,"Concentric and impact forces of single-leg jumps in an aquatic environment versus on land.PURPOSE: This study investigated the kinetic and the kinematic differences in female athletes in single-leg static jumps in an aquatic environment compared with those performed on dry land. METHODS: Twelve healthy, junior national team handball players participated. Subjects completed a familiarization and a testing session. The subjects performed a series of single-leg jumps, dry land and aquatic with and without devices, which were randomized to avoid fatigue effects. Peak concentric force, rate of force development, impact force, and time of the jumps were determined using a force plate. RESULTS: Peak concentric force and rate of force development were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the aquatic jumps, whereas impact force was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower. There was a shorter total jump time (P &lt; 0.05) for the aquatic jump without devices, whereas the time required to reach peak force was not significantly different between the two environments, despite the greater resistance to movement in the aquatic medium. DISCUSSION: Aquatic jump <e>exercises</e> result in greater force production and rate of force development in the same amount of time with less impact and can thus offer a viable alternative to traditional dry-land jump exercises, which may also be beneficial for rehabilitating or aging populations. The benefits of this type of exercise include an exercise mode that can be performed without compromising speed while reducing the potential for joint injury.",M2
19650424,"[Total antioxidant status concentration in blood plasma of professional sportsmen after dosed physical exercise]The mechanism of functioning of the well-balanced protection system against free radicals is based on the mutual and synergistic activity of its all elements. One of the first organism reactions to physical effort is an elevated oxygen requirement due to an increased rate of metabolism, particularly in the skeletal muscles involved in performing physical work. In case of insufficient antioxidative system of blood plasma, free radicals attack the erythrocytic membrane externally and internally, leading to formation of considerable amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of dosed submaximal and maximal physical exercise on the plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) concentration in professional sportsmen and in subjects of normal physical activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 41 rugby players (junior and senior group) and 20 men of normal physical activity (control group) were the subject of the study. The plasma TAS concentration was determined: before an effort in the control group, and after 30-minute restitution period in sportsmen. RESULTS: The concentration of TAS values in subjects of normal physical activity before <e>exercises</e> were on average 0.65 +/- 0.15 mmol/l. In the junior group after the dosed submaximal physical exercise, the mean TAS concentration was 0.69 +/- 0.29 mmol/l, but the dosed maximal exercise lead to an increase in TAS values - 0.73 +/- 0.34 mmol/l. The higher plasma TAS concentration after the dosed submaximal physical exercise was observed in the senior group as compared to the junior group, and was on average 0.93 +/- 0.22 mmol/l. However, after the maximal exercise, the TAS concentration decreased and its average value was 0.66 +/- 0.26 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that the intensity of performed exercises affects the plasma TAS concentration during a single physical activity. The plasma TAS concentration was higher in sportsmen regardless of the type of effort as compared to the control group. Supplementation of micromolecular antioxidants present in nutrients ingested by the sportsmen might have influenced the study outcomes.",M2

Blood lactate concentration increased until the 6th and 5th work periods for CT1:1 and CT1:3, respectively, whereas the peak value was lower and achieved earlier for CT1:5. Conversely, the number of repetitions was greater during CT1:5. These results suggest that circuit training composed of judo exercises substantially affects aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms, with relative contributions depending on the rest duration.",M2

This randomized, double-blind, crossover study was composed of two 8-week periods of supplementation with either 100 mg.d(-1) CoQ10 or placebo. Fifteen healthy and sedentary men participated in the study. Five Wingate tests (WTs) with 75 g.kg(-1) body weight load with 2-minute intervals between tests were performed 3 times at baseline, after CoQ10, or placebo supplementation during the study period. Peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and fatigue index were calculated. During the 5 WTs, PP and MP tended to decrease and fatigue index tended to increase in all groups (p &lt; 0.05). Peak power decreased with CoQ10 and placebo supplementation during the WT1, WT2, and WT2 (p &lt; 0.05). Mean power increased only with CoQ10 supplementation during the WT5. Fatigue indexes decreased with CoQ10 supplementation, but these decreases did not differ from that seen with placebo supplementation. According to these results, CoQ10 may show performance-enhancing effects during the repeated bouts of supramaximal <e>exercises</e> and CoQ10 might be used as ergogenic aid.",M2
19644031,"Systemic hypoxia enhances exercise-mediated bactericidal and subsequent apoptotic responses in human neutrophils.Phagocytosis and oxidative burst are critical host defense mechanisms in which neutrophils clear invading pathogens. Clearing phagocytic neutrophils by triggering apoptosis is an essential process for controlling inflammation. This study elucidates how various exercise bouts with/without hypoxia affected neutrophil bactericidal activity and subsequent apoptosis in humans. Fifteen sedentary males performed six distinct experimental tests in an air-conditioned normobaric hypoxia chamber: two normoxic <e>exercises</e> [strenuous exercise (SE; up to maximal O2 consumption) and moderate exercise (ME; 50% maximal O2 consumption for 30 min) while exposed to 21% O2], two hypoxic exercises (ME for 30 min while exposed to 12% and 15% O2), and two hypoxic exposures (resting for 30 min while exposed to 12% and 15% O2). The results showed that 1) plasma complement-C3a desArg/C4a desArg/C5a concentrations were increased, 2) expressions of L-selectin/lymphocyte functin-associated antigen-1/Mac-1/C5aR on neutrophils were enhanced, 3) phagocytosis of neutrophils to Esherichia coli and release of neutrophil oxidant products by E. coli were elevated, and 4) E. coli-induced phosphotidylserine exposure or caspase-3 activation of neutrophils were promoted immediately and 2 h after both 12% O2 exposure at rest and with ME as well as normoxic SE. Although neither normoxic ME nor breathing 15% O2 at rest influenced these complement- and neutrophil-related immune responses, ME at both 12% and 15% O2 resulted in enhanced complement activation in the blood, expressions of opsonic/complement receptors on neutrophils, or the bactericidal activity and apoptosis of neutrophils. Moreover, the increased neutrophil oxidant production and apoptosis by normoxic SE and hypoxic ME were ameliorated by treating neutrophils with diphenylene iodonium (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor). Therefore, we conclude that ME at 12-15% O2 enhances bactericidal capacity and facilitates the subsequent apoptosis of neutrophils.",M2
19638826,"Effects of exercise on the isoelectric patterns of erythropoietin.OBJECTIVES: Recombinant erythropoietin has a strong impact on aerobic power and is therefore one of the most potent doping agents in endurance sports. The anti-doping control of this synthetic hormone relies on the detection, in the urine, of its isoelectric pattern, which differs from that of the corresponding natural hormone, the latter being typically more acidic than the former. However, a small number of natural urinary patterns, referred to as  atypical patterns,  are less acidic than the dominant form. Based on anecdotal evidence, the occurrence of such patterns seems to be related to particular strenuous <e>exercises</e>. This study aimed to demonstrate this relation using a strenuous exercise protocol. DESIGN: Seven athletes took part in a training protocol including a series of supramaximal short-duration exercises. Urine and blood samples were collected throughout the protocols. SETTINGS: World Cycling Center, Aigle, Switzerland, and research laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Seven top-level athletes (cyclists) were involved in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erythropoietin (EPO) isoelectric patterns were obtained by submitting blood and urine samples to isoelectric focusing. Additional protein dosages were performed. RESULTS: Supramaximal short-duration exercises induced the transformation of typical urinary natural EPO patterns into atypical ones. None of the obtained atypical patterns fulfilled the 3 criteria mandatory for reporting an adverse analytical finding. Serum EPO patterns were not affected by the exercises that caused the transformation of urinary patterns. CONCLUSION: An exercise-induced transient renal dysfunction is proposed as a hypothetic explanation for these observations that rely on parallel investigations of proteinuria in the same samples.",M2
19632969,"Effectiveness of a novel integrative online treatment for depression (Deprexis): randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with immense suffering and costs, and many patients receive inadequate care, often because of the limited availability of treatment. Web-based treatments may play an increasingly important role in closing this gap between demand and supply. We developed the integrative, Web-based program Deprexis, which covers therapeutic approaches such as behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness/acceptance <e>exercises</e>, and social skills training. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based intervention in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: There were 396 adults recruited via Internet depression forums in Germany, and they were randomly assigned in an 80:20 weighted randomization sequence to either 9 weeks of immediate-program-access as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (N = 320), or to a 9-week delayed-access plus treatment-as-usual condition (N = 76). At pre- and post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, we measured depression (Beck Depression Inventory) as the primary outcome measure and social functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale) as the secondary outcome measure. Complete analyses and intention-to-treat analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 396 participants, 216 (55%) completed the post-measurement 9 weeks later. Available case analyses revealed a significant reduction in depression severity (BDI), Cohen's d = .64 (CI 95% = 0.33 - 0.94), and significant improvement in social functioning (WSA), Cohen's d = .64, 95% (CI 95% = 0.33 - 0.95). These improvements were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses confirmed significant effects on depression and social functioning improvements (BDI: Cohen's d = .30, CI 95% = 0.05 - 0.55; WSA: Cohen's d = .36, CI 95% = 0.10 - 0.61). Moreover, a much higher percentage of patients in the intervention group experienced a significant reduction of depression symptoms (BDI: odds ratio [OR] = 6.8, CI 95% = 2.90 - 18.19) and recovered more often (OR = 17.3, 95% CI 2.3 - 130). More than 80% of the users felt subjectively that the program had been helpful. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative, Web-based intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression and in improving social functioning. Findings suggest that the program could serve as an adjunctive or stand-alone treatment tool for patients suffering from symptoms of depression.",M2
19629516,"Effect of hypobaric hypoxia on heart rate variability during exercise: a pilot field study.The influence of hypoxia on heart rate variability (HRV) has been studied under resting conditions with mixed results. Differences have been found in physiological responses to normobaric versus hypobaric hypoxia. Our aim was to study the influence of hypobaric hypoxia on HRV during physical exercise to determine whether HRV changes due to the exercise-induced heart rate (HR) increase or whether hypoxia itself exerts an influence. We tested nine healthy non-acclimatised white males (age = 43 +/- 7 years) at 400 and 4,200 m during <e>exercises</e>. At 400 m HRV was measured at 50% and 75% maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2) max). At 4,200 m HR was kept equal as during exercise at 400 m by adjusting the intensity of step testing. The Poincaré plot as a non-linear method of HRV analysis was used, where the shape of the ellipse depending on HRV is expressed by two parameters, SD1 and SD2 (correlating to parasympathetic activity and both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively). We established a decrease in SD2 and an insignificant decrease in SD1 at medium HR at 4,200 m compared to 400 m. Both parameters showed similar tendencies during high-intensity exercise. Our results indicate that hypobaric hypoxia itself exerts an influence on HRV at a moderate HR.",M2
19629292,"Dose-response curve to exercise in hypertensive individuals: analysis of the number of sessions to the hypotensive effect.BACKGROUND: The effect of exercise on blood pressure (BP) is already known; however, the dose-response curve of the hypotensive effect of exercise in hypertensive individuals is yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dose-response curve of the number of sessions that are necessary to cause a hypotensive effect in hypertensive individuals. METHODS: 88 individuals, aged 58 +/- 11 years, divided in Experimental group (EG), with 48 that participated in a physical exercise program (PEP), which consisted of 40 minutes of aerobic <e>exercises</e> performed 3x/week, for 3 months, at 70% of the VO2max, and muscular exercises at 40% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and Control Group (CG) with 40 individuals that did not participate in the PEP. The systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressures were measured before each of the 36 sessions in the EG and assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the CG. Differences in BP, the variation rate (D%) and the maximum hypotensive effect (MHE%) were observed between sessions. The data were expressed as means +/- SD; the t test and correlation were used, with p&lt;0.05 being considered significant. RESULTS: There was no difference regarding BP values in the CG. The EG showed an important decrease of 15 mmHg in SAP and 7 mmHg in DAP, with a large part of this effect occurring as early as the first session and the majority up to the 5th session. There was a strong inverse correlation (R:-0.66) with the number of sessions. CONCLUSION: An important hypotensive effect was observed from the 1st session on and it was observed that the dose-response curve can be abrupt and decrescent, instead of flat.",M2
19641154,"Effects of intense chewing <e>exercises</e> on the masticatory sensory-motor system.Nociceptive substances, injected into the masseter muscle, induce pain and facilitate the jaw-stretch reflex. It is hypothesized that intense chewing would provoke similar effects. Fourteen men performed 20 bouts of 5-minute chewing. After each bout, 20 min and 24 hrs after the exercise, muscle fatigue and pain scores and the normalized reflex amplitude from the left masseter muscle were recorded. Before, 20 min, and 24 hrs after the exercise, signs of temporomandibular disorders and pressure-pain thresholds of the masticatory muscles were also recorded. Fatigue and pain scores had increased during the exercise (P &lt; 0.001), but the reflex amplitude did not (P = 0.123). Twenty minutes after the exercises, 12 participants showed signs of myofascial pain or arthralgia. Pressure-pain thresholds were decreased after 20 min (P = 0.009) and 24 hrs (P = 0.049). Intense chewing can induce fatigue, pain, and decreased pressure-pain thresholds in the masticatory muscles, without concomitant changes in the jaw-stretch reflex amplitude.",M2
19641080,"Effects of directional exercise on lingual strength.PURPOSE: To examine the application of known muscle training principles to tongue strengthening <e>exercises</e> and to answer the following research questions: (a) Did lingual strength increase following 9 weeks of training? (b) Did training conducted using an exercise moving the tongue in one direction result in strength changes for tongue movements in other directions? (c) Were differential training effects observed for participants completing exercises sequentially (in isolation) versus concurrently (several exercises in combination)? (d) Were strength gains maintained after exercise was discontinued? Methods Participants were 39 healthy adults assigned to sequential or concurrent lingual strength training. Lingual exercise (elevation, protrusion, and/or lateralization) was conducted for 9 weeks, with lingual strength and cheek strength (control variable) assessed weekly. RESULTS: All lingual strength measures increased with training, but cheek strength remained unchanged. Training effects were not related to training condition (sequential vs. concurrent), nor were specificity effects observed for direction of exercise. Significant decreases in lingual strength were noted 2-4 weeks after exercise was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The findings replicate those of earlier studies demonstrating that lingual strength may be increased with a variety of exercise protocols and confirm that detraining effects may be observed when training is discontinued. The findings further suggest that the lingual musculature may demonstrate less dramatic training specificity than what has been reported for skeletal muscles.",M2
