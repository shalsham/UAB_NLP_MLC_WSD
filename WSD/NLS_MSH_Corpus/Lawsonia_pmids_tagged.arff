19281720,"Allergic contact dermatitis to pure henna.Henna is a naturally occurring brown dye made from the leaves of the tree <e>Lawsonia</e> inermis. The active ingredient of henna is lawsone (2-hydroxy-1, 4-naphthoquinone). It is traditionally used in Islamic and Hindu cultures as a hair coloring and as a dye for decorating the nails or making temporary skin tattoos. Actually, henna has a very low allergic potential. In most cases, allergic reactions not caused by henna, but by the chemical coloring additives that are added to henna mixtures. These additives include agents such as daiminotoluenes and diaminobenzenes. In this article, we report a case of allergic contact dermatitis from pure henna that is also used for the relief of rheumatic pain.",M1
18825553,"Protein glycation inhibitory activities of <e>Lawsonia</e> inermis and its active principles.The protein glycation inhibitory activity of ethanolic extract of Lawsonia inermis (henna) plant tissues was evaluated in vitro using the model system of bovine serum albumin and glucose. Protein oxidation and glycation are posttranslational modifications that are implicated in the pathological development of many age-related disease processes. This study investigated the effects of Lawsonia inermis ethanolic extract and its components, on protein damage induced by a free radical generator in in vitro assay system. We found that alcoholic extract of Lawsonia inermis can effectively protect against protein damage and showed that its action is mainly due to Lawsone. In addition, the presence of gallic acid also plays an important role in the protective activity against protein oxidation and glycation. Two known compounds, namely, Lawsone and gallic acid previously isolated from this plant were subjected to glycation bioassay for the first time. It was found that the alcoholic extract, lawsone (1) and gallic acid (2) showed significant inhibition of Advanced Glycated End Products (AGEs) formation and exhibit 77.95%, 79.10% and 66.98% inhibition at a concentration of 1500 microg/mL, 1000 microg/mL and 1000 microM respectively. Lawsonia inermis, compounds 1 and 2 were found to be glycation inhibitors with IC(50) 82.06 +/- 0.13 microg/mL, 67.42 +/- 1.46 microM and 401.7 +/- 6. 23 microM respectively. This is the first report on the glycation activity of these compounds and alcoholic extract of Lawsonia inermis.",M1
18618473,"Chemical fingerprinting of <e>Lawsonia</e> inermis L. using HPLC, HPTLC and densitometry.INTRODUCTION: Lawsonia inermis L. is a natural red colouring agent, commonly named  Henna , which is used to dye skin and hair. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of L. inermis that is commercially available as a raw plant material or preparation in order to guarantee good quality products. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple protocol for the qualification of different samples labelled as L. inermis by using the HPTLC densitometry method and to identify possible adulterations with other plants. METHODOLOGY: Samples of leaves of L. inermis were extracted with methanol. Two chromatographic methods were developed to determine the chemical fingerprinting of L. inermis. The first was based on HPTLC identification followed by densitometric measurements at 337 nm. The second was based on RP-HPLC separation with gradient elution and photodiode array detection at 337 nm. Samples of Cassia obovata Collad., and Indigofera tinctoria L., were treated in the same way. RESULTS: The simplicity of the sample preparation, and the possibility of analysing several samples of herbal products simultaneously in a short time, make HPTLC the method of choice. The HPTLC method was feasible for the comprehensive quality evaluation of herbal products. From the comparison of their  fingerprint , it was possible to detect substitution of plants that are different from those declared on the label. CONCLUSION: The HPTLC may be used as a rapid method by which to control the quality of raw plant materials and formulations based on the title plant.",M1

The lead levels found in henna were low with concentrations ranging from 2.29 ppm to 65.98 ppm. Henna is used as a traditional cosmetic and remedy in the Middle East, Far East, and North Africa. The very low concentrations of lead measured in these henna samples were reassuring; however, the cumulative effects of prolonged lead exposure may be of concern. Thus, the use of henna especially among children may constitute a public health risk.",M1

17533628,"The evidence based wound healing activity of <e>Lawsonia</e> inermis Linn.The ethanol extract of Lawsonia inermis (200 mg/kg/day) was used to evaluate the wound healing activity on rats using excision, incision and dead space wound models. The animals were divided into three groups of six each in the excision model and two groups of six each in the incision model and dead space models. The topical application was made in the case of excision wound model, whereas, oral treatment was done with incision and dead space wound models. The following differences were noted in the group of experimental animals which were treated with an extract of L. inermis when compared with the control and reference standard animals: a high rate of wound contraction (p &lt; 0.001), a decrease in the period of epithelialization (p &lt; 0.001), high skin breaking strength (p &lt; 0.001), a significant increase in the granulation tissue weight (p &lt; 0.001) and hydroxyproline content (p &lt; 0.05). The extract-treated animals showed 71% reduction in the wound area when compared with controls which was 58%. Histological studies of the tissue obtained on day 10 from the extract-treated group showed increased well organized bands of collagen, more fibroblasts and few inflammatory cells when compared with the controls which showed inflammatory cells, scanty collagen fibres and fibroblasts. Enhanced wound contraction, increased skin breaking strength, hydroxyproline and histological findings suggest the use of L. inermis in the management of wound healing.",M1
17442476,"Cytotoxicity of lawsone and cytoprotective activity of antioxidants in catalase mutant Escherichia coli.Lawsone is an active naphthoquinone derivative isolated from henna (<e>Lawsonia</e> inermis L.), a widely used hair dye. Previous study on the toxicity of lawsone remains unclear since the involvement of oxidative stress and the kind of ROS (reactive oxygen species) involved have not been fully resolved yet. This present study reports the cytotoxic effects of lawsone and henna. We carried out CAT assay (a zone of inhibition test of bacterial growth and colony-forming efficiency test of transformant Escherichia coli strains that express mammalian catalase gene derived from normal catalase mice (Cs(a)) and catalase-deficient mutant mice (Cs(b))), Ames mutagenicity assay and H(2)O(2) generation assay. Lawsone generated H(2)O(2) slightly in phosphate buffer system and was not mutagenic in Ames assay using TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102, both in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Lawsone exposure inhibited the growth of both Cs(a) and Cs(b) strains in a dose-dependent manner. Mean zone diameter for Cs(a) was 9.75+/-0.96 mm and 12.75+/-1.5 mm for Cs(b). Natural henna leaves did not show toxic effects, whereas two out of four samples of marketed henna products were shown toxicity effects. Catalase abolished zone of inhibition (ZOI) of marketed henna products, eliminated ZOI of lawsone in a dose-dependent manner and low concentration of exogenous MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD eliminated the toxicity. Histidine and DTPA, the metal chelator; BHA and low concentration of capsaicin, the inducer of NADH-quinone reductase, effectively protected Cs(a) and Cs(b) against lawsone in this study. We suggest that lawsone cytotoxicity is probably mediated, at least in part, by the release of O(2)(-), H(2)O(2) and OH(-).",M1

A pilot study on the Omani henna.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of henna's fresh and dry leaves and seeds obtained from Oman. METHODS: This study was carried out at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman during the period January-June, 2004. Crude extracts of fresh and dry leaves and seeds were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against 3 standard bacterial strains namely: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven different bacterial strains were obtained from patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. In addition, one Candida albicans (C. albicans) species was used for testing the antifungal activity of the Omani henna sample. RESULTS: All fresh and dry leaves and seeds of the Omani henna demonstrated antibacterial activity against all 3 standard strains and the 11 patients' isolated strains. Henna dry leaves demonstrated the best in-vitro antimicrobial activity and in particular against Shigella sonnei. However, henna fresh and dry seeds failed to show any activity against C. albicans.

12708740,"Modulatory effect of henna leaf (<e>Lawsonia</e> inermis) on drug metabolising phase I and phase II enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation and chemically induced skin and forestomach papillomagenesis in mice.Henna leaf (Lawsonia inermis), commonly known as Mehndi is cultivated throughout India and is a very popular natural dye to color hand and hair. It is an integral part of indigenous culture, and is also known for its medicinal value. The effect of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight of 80% ethanolic extract of the fresh leaves of Lawsonia inermis were examined on drug metabolizing phase-I and phase-II enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, glutathione content, lactate dehydrogenase and lipid peroxidation in the liver of 7 weeks old Swiss albino mice. Also anticarcinogenic potential of Henna leaf extract was studied adopting the protocol of benzo(a)pyrene induced forestomach and 7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and croton oil-promoted skin papillomagenesis. Our primary findings reveal the 'duel-acting' nature of henna leaf as deduced from its potential to induce only the phase-II enzyme activity, associated mainly with carcinogen detoxification in liver of mice and inhibit the phase I enzyme activities. The hepatic glutathione S-transferase and DT-diaphorase specific activities were elevated above basal (p &lt; 0.005) level by Lawsonia inermis extract treatment. With reference to antioxidant enzymes the investigated doses were effective in increasing the hepatic glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities significantly (from p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.005) at both the dose levels. Reduced glutathione (GSH) measured as non-protein sulphydryl was found to be significantly elevated in liver (p &lt; 0.005) and in all the extrahepatic organs studied (from p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.005). Among the extrahepatic organs examined (forestomach, kidney and lung) glutathione S-transferase and DT-diaphorase level were increased in a dose independent manner (from p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.005). Chemopreventive response was measured by the average number of papillomas per mouse (tumor burden) as well as percentage of tumor bearing animals and tumor multiplicity. There was a significant inhibition of tumor burden in both the tumor model systems studied (from p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 0.001).

12512805,"A preliminary pilot survey on head lice, pediculosis in Sharkia Governorate and treatment of lice with natural plant extracts.Twelve different representative areas in Sharkia Governorate were surveyed for head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis. The pre-valence was investigated among 120 houses containing 2,448 individual, with different age, sex and socioeconomic status. Examination was done by naked eye aided with hand-lens. A total of 137 individuals were infested. Infestation rates were higher in the rural areas with low socioeconomic levels, concrete houses with over-crowded family members. Children had significantly higher infestation rates than adults. Males had lower infestation rates than females. However, the hair length and permanent hair washing were the factors accounted for both age and sex difference in prevalence of pediculosis. Head lice infestations were found all over the year, but increased in summer and spring. One hundred infested patients (90 females and 10 males) with different aged and hair length were treated with tour mixed cream from plants <e>Lawsonia</e> alba L. (Henna). Trigonella faemum-gracanum (Fenugreek), Hibiscus cannabinus (Hibiscus) and Artemisia cina (Wormseed).

20224090,"A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for detection and quantification of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.Lawsonia intracellularis, a causative agent of porcine proliferative enteropathy, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is difficult to culture, propagate, and quantify. The intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-18, derived from rat small intestine crypt cells) has been used to isolate and propagate this pathogen. However, the lack of rapid and simple quantification methods has led to mixed results when using the rat cell line, complicating Lawsonia studies. To overcome these limitations, a SYBR green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay targeting a unique hypothetical protein was developed for detecting and quantifying L. intracellularis in IEC-18 rat epithelial cells, porcine fecal samples collected from different farms, and experimentally infected pigs. The method was optimized to detect as few as 3 copies per qPCR reaction of the bacterium growing in IEC-18 cells, providing a new and necessary approach to assess the growth of L. intracellularis in these cell lines. Furthermore, the qPCR assay was successful in detecting L. intracellularis in fecal samples collected from pigs with and without a history of Lawsonia infections, as well as in experimentally infected pigs, which further confirmed the suitability of the qPCR assay for studying the epidemiology of this pathogen.",M2
20181246,"Application of a pig ligated intestinal loop model for early <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection.BACKGROUND: Porcine proliferative enteropathy in pigs is caused by the obligate, intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis. In vitro studies have shown close bacterium-cell interaction followed by cellular uptake of the bacterium within 3 h post inoculation (PI). However, knowledge of the initial in vivo interaction between porcine intestinal epithelium and the bacterium is limited. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the usefulness of a ligated small intestinal loop model to study L. intracellularis infections and to obtain information on the very early L. intracellularis-enterocyte interactions. METHODS: A ligated small intestinal loop model using three different L. intracellularis inocula was applied to 10-11-week-old pigs. The inocula were 1) wild type bacteria derived from overnight incubation of L. intracellularis bacteria from spontaneous disease, 2) crude vaccine bacteria (Enterisol Ileitis Vet), and 3) vaccine bacteria propagated in cell culture. The bacteria-enterocyte interaction was visualised using immunohistochemistry on specimens derived 1, 3 and 6 h PI respectively. RESULTS: Although at a low level, close contact between bacteria and the enterocyte brush border including intracellular uptake of bacteria in mature enterocytes was seen at 3 and 6 h PI for the vaccine and the propagated vaccine inocula. Interaction between the wild-type bacteria and villus enterocytes was scarce and only seen at 6 h PI, where a few bacteria were found in close contact with the brush border. CONCLUSIONS: The ligated intestinal loop model was useful with respect to maintaining an intact intestinal morphology for up to 6 h. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that L. intracellularis interacts with villus enterocytes within 3 to 6 h after inoculation into intestinal loops and that the bacterium, as shown for the vaccine bacteria, propagated as well as non-propagated, was able to invade mature enterocytes. Thus, the study demonstrates the early intestinal invasion of L. intracellularis in vivo.",M2
20093686,"A TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in fecal and tissue samples from pigs.In the present study, a TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for detecting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of Lawsonia intracellularis in porcine native ileal mucosal scrapings, fecal samples, and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ileal samples is described. Samples from 62 pigs were examined. The results of the qPCR were compared with results obtained with conventional detection methods (PCR, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and silver staining) from a previous study and correlated well. The qPCR assay proved to be very sensitive and specific. In particular, the sensitivity of TaqMan PCR was significantly higher than conventional PCR on FFPE tissues because of a much shorter amplicon. A higher number of copies per gram of sample material was detected in native mucosa and FFPE tissue compared with feces, especially in highly positive animals. The detection limit for the qPCR was at 4 copies per well in native mucosal scrapings and 18 copies per well in feces and FFPE tissue, respectively. Inhibition of the qPCR reaction was checked by simultaneous detection of a recombinant beta-actin plasmid using a second fluorescent probe. A decreased signal from this internal control plasmid revealed inhibition of the PCR reaction in 21% of native mucosal samples and 1.6% of fecal samples. With a 10-fold dilution of template, the inhibition could be overcome.",M2
19909968,"Detection of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in formalin-fixed porcine intestinal tissue samples: comparison of immunofluorescence and in-situ hybridization, and evaluation of the effects of controlled autolysis.Two methods, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA; with a Lawsonia intracellularis-specific monoclonal antibody) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH; with a specific oligonucleotide probe targeting 16S ribosomal RNA of the bacterium), were compared for their ability to detect L. intracellularis (the cause of porcine proliferative enteritis [PE]) in formalin-fixed samples of intestinal tissue. Of 69 intestinal samples with gross lesions of PE, 63 were positive by both FISH and IFA, but six were positive only by IFA. This indicated that the sensitivity of FISH was 91% that of IFA. However, both methods had a specificity of 100%. Fifty normal porcine intestines were negative by both tests. IFA was much less susceptible than FISH to the effects of autolysis. Thus, three of nine samples from pigs with PE were FISH-negative after being kept at 20 degrees C for 4 days, and seven were FISH negative after 2 weeks; after 4 weeks at this temperature, however, six of the nine samples were still IFA positive. After being kept at 4 degrees C for 12 weeks, the majority of samples (&gt; or = 66%) were positive by both methods.",M2
19803056,"Faecal shedding and serological cross-sectional study of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in horses in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.REASON FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Proliferative enteropathy, caused by the intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis, has been described in horses in Australia, the USA, Canada and European countries but has not been reported in Latin America. The prevalence of the disease in horses worldwide is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of subclinical L. intracellularis infection in horses in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: A longitudinal study using serology and PCR for detecting antibodies (IgG) and shedding of L. intracellularis in faecal samples, respectively, was conducted using a total of 223 horses from 14 different horse farms in Minas Gerais, and from the Veterinary School of UFMG equine herds in Minas Gerais. The immunoperoxidase technique in glass slides was used as the serological test. RESULTS: Twenty-one horse sera had immunoglobulin G titres of 1:60 and were considered positive. The PCR technique in faeces for L. intracellularis DNA identified 7 horses as faecal shedders. Horses shedding the organism appeared healthy, indicating that subclinical infection of L. intracellularis occurred in the horses. CONCLUSION: Seropositivity and detection of faecal shedding of L. intracellularis indicates the presence of the agent in the equine population in Minas Gerais. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study should alert clinicians in countries where proliferative enteropthy in horses has not been reported to consider this disease as a possible cause of enteric disease.",M2
19589649,"Expression by <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis of type III secretion system components during infection.Contact-dependent secretion systems, such as the type III secretion system (T3SS), have been shown to play significant roles in the pathogenicity of many gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Lawsonia intracellularis is a novel, obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium, which has been identified as the etiological agent of proliferative enteropathies in numerous animal species. Analysis of the genome sequence of the L. intracellularis strain PHE/MN1-00 has revealed the presence of a T3SS secretion system in this bacterium. In this study we aimed to determine whether this important virulence mechanism is also present in L. intracellularis strain LR189/5/83. Using a PCR-based approach, we verified the presence of a genomic region encoding a T3SS. Specifically, a gene highly homologous to the yscN energiser component of the prototypic T3SS of Yersinia spp. was identified and termed lscN. Two further open reading frames (ORFs) contiguous with lscN were also identified: lscO and lscQ, which are also homologues of ORFs within the T3SS of Yersinia spp. To establish whether this T3SS may be functional, expression was monitored directly by RT-PCR and indirectly by detection of serological responses in vaccinated and infected animals. Transcripts for lscN and lscQ were detected and purified rLscQ was recognized by antiserum from infected pigs, indicating expression in vivo during infection. By analogy to other bacteria, this T3SS may be crucial for intracellular development and is likely to play a significant role in the virulence of this unusual pathogen.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: A real-time PCR including a calibrator based on plasmid DNA for quantification by means of DeltaDeltaCt method was evaluated. The parameters specificity, detection limit, quantification limit, linearity, range, repeatability, precision and recovery were validated. The detection limit of the agent was 1 copy per reaction, and quantification was reliable between 10(1) and 10(7) copies per microl reaction volume. The linearity calculated by logistic regression revealed a slope of -3.329 reflecting an efficiency of 99.7% for the assay. Moreover, it was shown that storage of samples and repetition of tests including DNA isolation by same or other investigators did not influence the outcome. CONCLUSION: The quantification method described herein revealed consistent results for the quantitation of L. intracellularis in porcine faeces samples.

The infection has a considerable impact on pig production and herd economics and, with the development of new diagnostic techniques, L. intracellularis is being identified in an increasing number of pig herds and a wider range of species. This paper reviews current knowledge of the disease, with a focus on the epidemiology in pigs. The prevalence of infection, transmission, predisposing factors, microbial features, pathogenesis, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and control are discussed.

19362500,"Microarray analysis of differential expression of cell cycle and cell differentiation genes in cells infected with <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.Infection of intestinal crypt epithelial cells by the obligate intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis is directly linked to marked proliferation of the infected enterocytes within 3-5days post-infection. The virulence factor for this unique host cell-proliferative response is not known, but is considered to involve altered crypt cell cycle or differentiation events. McCoy mouse fibroblast cells were infected with L. intracellularis, and then harvested for expressed mRNA at daily time points, with matching non-infected control cell cultures. Mouse DNA microarray (&gt;44,000 transcript targets) analysis of cDNA derived from matching mRNA samples showed over 40 identifiable genes with at least 4-fold changes between days 0 and 3 after infection with L. intracellularis. These included altered transcription of typical host cell 'alarm' response genes, such as interferon-related response genes Isgf3g and Igtp, known to be associated with invading microbial agents. Altered transcription of several genes in these cells known to be active in regulation of the cell cycle or cell differentiation genes, including usp18, Hr, Elavl2 and Slfn2, were also detected. The altered transcription of several of these genes via RT-PCR analysis was confirmed. The microarray-detected altered transcription of cell cycle and cell differentiation genes is of possible interest for links to Lawsonia-related disturbances in epithelial cell differentiation within the intestinal crypt, but this would need to be confirmed in intestinal epithelial cell studies.",M2
19221094,"Codon usages of genes on chromosome, and surprisingly, genes in plasmid are primarily affected by strand-specific mutational biases in <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.In this study, the factors driving genome-wide patterns of codon usages in Lawsonia intracellularis genome are determined. For genes on the chromosome of the bacterium, it is found that the most important source of variation results from strand-specific mutational biases. A lesser trend of variation is attributable to genes that are presumed as horizontally transferred. These putative alien genes are unusually GC richer than the other genes, whereas horizontally transferred genes have been observed to be AT rich in bacteria with medium and relatively low G + C contents. Hydropathy of encoded protein and expression level are also found to influence codon usage. Therefore, codon usage in L. intracellularis chromosome is the result of a complex balance among the different mutational and selectional factors. When analyzing genes in the largest plasmid, for the first time it is found that the strand-specific mutational biases are responsible for the primary variation of codon usages in plasmid. Genes, particularly highly expressed genes of this plasmid, are mainly located on the leading strands and this supposed to be the effects exerted by replicational-transcriptional selection. These facts suggest that this plasmid adopts the similar mechanism of replication as the chromosome in L. intracellularis. Common characters among the 10 bacteria in whose genomes the strand-specific mutational biases are the primary source of variation of codon usage are also investigated. For example, it is found that genes dnaT and fis that are involved in DNA replication initiation and re-initiation pathways are absent in all of the 10 bacteria.",M2

For testing as a powder, 1g, 0.5g, or 0.25g of Stalosan F was applied to bacterial solutions spread into sterile dishes. For use as an aqueous suspension, Stalosan F was prepared to final concentrations of 1%, 4%, 8%, 16%, and 32%. In both applications, L. intracellularis was exposed to Stalosan F for 0.5h, 1h, 2h, and 4h. The results showed that both strains were similar in their susceptibilities to Stalosan F. The modified tissue culture assay showed no detectable L. intracellularis in cell culture after exposure to all levels of Stalosan F powder for 0.5h. Furthermore, the number of viable bacteria was markedly reduced in the aqueous concentration of 4% and no L. intracellularis was detected at concentrations of &gt; or =8% for 0.5h. Using the direct count method, detection of live bacteria was less than 1% after exposure to the powder for 0.5h. After exposure to the aqueous form, the number of viable bacteria killed was over 99% in concentrations of &gt; or =16% compared to controls. Our results indicate that Stalosan F in both powder and suspension forms is able to inactivate over 99% of L. intracellularis after 30min of exposure. Furthermore, both laboratory methods can be used to determine the effect of disinfectants on L. intracellularis viability.",M2

In the vaccinated batches, the consumption of oxytetracykline to treat PE was reduced by 79%, with a significantly lower number of pigs being treated (P &lt; 0.0001). Vaccination also resulted in a highly significant improvement of average daily weight gain (+ 46 g/day; P = 9.55 x 10(-31)) and carcase weight (+ 1.25 kg; P = 4.54 x 10(-05)) as well as a shortened fattening period (-8 days; P = 2.01 x 10(-45)).",M2
19108850,"Comparative evaluation of diagnostic methods for <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection in pigs, with emphasis on cases lacking characteristic lesions.In this study the following methods for the diagnosis of Lawsonia intracellularis infection in pigs were compared in relation to a reference method (examination of ileal mucosal scrapings by the polymerase chain reaction [PCR]): Warthin-Starry (WS) staining of tissue sections, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in-situ hybridization (ISH), and PCR examination of faeces and of paraffin wax-embedded samples of ileum. Of 204 pigs examined, 32 were considered on the basis of the PCR to be infected. Gross and histopathological examination, including the use of WS staining, were of limited value. PCR examination of faeces proved to be the most sensitive (sensitivity 70%) of the methods used but, due to the occurrence of false positives, its specificity (95%) was the lowest. IHC (sensitivity 66%, specificity 99%) and ISH (sensitivity 54%, specificity 100%) were clearly superior to examination of WS-stained sections (sensitivity 34%, specificity 100%) for routine diagnosis; although less sensitive than the PCR, they indicated only cases of clinical relevance and, moreover, were capable of distinguishing different stages and levels of infection. Because examination of paraffin wax-embedded tissue by the PCR was shown to be associated with low sensitivity (41%), IHC was regarded as the method of choice for retrospective studies.",M2
19024547,"Diagnosis of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection in pigs after vaccination or antimicrobial treatment.Diagnosis of infection with Lawsonia (L.) intracellularis, the causative agent of porcine proliferative enteropathy, is routinely based on the detection of L. intracellularis in faeces and/or tissue samples by PCR. Furthermore, infection can be determined by the detection of antibodies in serum samples. The aim of this comparative study was to examine whether results from molecular biology and serological testing are influenced by applying live bacteria vaccine Enterisol Ileitis or antimicrobial treatment to pigs naturally exposed to L. intracellularis. Decreased shedding was detected in tylosin treated pigs only. Thus, the distribution of 345 pigs into groups of 0-, 1- or &gt; or = 2-times positive by PCR was significantly influenced by the treatment (P &lt; 0.0001). A global effect of positive PCR results on average daily weight gain was also highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001). The serological reaction was detected by a blocking ELISA after infection but not after vaccination independent of treatment. The results indicate no influence of vaccination on applied diagnostic tests.",M2
19019573,"Temporal detection of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis using serology and real-time PCR in Thoroughbred horses residing on a farm endemic for equine proliferative enteropathy.The goals of this study were to evaluate titers of antibodies against Lawsonia intracellularis in 68 resident broodmares from a farm known to be endemic for equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) and to evaluate maternal antibodies, occurrence of seroconversion and fecal shedding in their foals. Serum samples collected from mares at delivery and from foals pre- and post-colostrum ingestion and monthly thereafter were tested for the presence of L. intracellularis antibodies by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Further, feces collected from mares at delivery and foals post-partum and monthly thereafter were assayed for L. intracellularis using real-time PCR. Thirty-seven mares (54.4%) had detectable antibody titers (&gt; or =60) against L. intracellularis by IPMA at the time of foaling. Passive transfer of colostral antibodies against L. intracellularis was documented in 37 foals (54.4%) and the colostral antibodies remained detectable in the serum of foals for 1-3 months. Overall, 22 foals (33.3%) showed evidence of natural exposure to L. intracellularis throughout the study period, however, none of the study foals developed signs compatible with EPE. The serological results showed that mares residing on a farm known to be endemic for EPE are routinely exposed to L. intracellularis and that antibodies against L. intracellularis are passively transferred to foals.",M2
18957657,"Detection of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis by real-time PCR in the feces of free-living animals from equine farms with documented occurrence of equine proliferative enteropathy.The objective of this study was to determine whether Lawsonia intracellularis was present in the feces of free-living animals collected on two equine premises with documented occurrence of equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE). Fresh feces from black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus, n=100), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis, n=22), feral cats (Felis catus, n=14), Brewer's Blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus, n=10), Virginian opossums (Didelphis virginiana, n=9), raccoons (Procyon lotor, n=4), California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi, n=3), and coyotes (Canis latrans, n=2) were collected from August 2006 to January 2007 either from the ground while walking the premises or after trapping the animals using live traps. Nucleic acid purified from feces was directly processed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using a real-time PCR assay targeting the aspartate ammonia lyase gene of L. intracellularis. Purified DNA samples were also precipitated, preamplified for L. intracellularis, and analyzed using the same real-time PCR assay, to increase the detection limit to one L. intracellularis organism per extracted sample. Feces from jackrabbits, striped skunks, Virginian opossums, and coyotes tested PCR positive for L. intracellularis, whereas all feces from feral cats, Brewer's Blackbirds, raccoons, and ground squirrels tested PCR negative for L. intracellularis. PCR testing on DNA extracted directly from feces was positive for L. intracellularis in six of 164 fecal samples. When DNA purification from feces was followed by a precipitation and preamplification step, five additional fecal samples tested PCR positive for L. intracellularis (11/164). The largest number of PCR positive L. intracellularis fecal samples was observed in striped skunks, followed by Virginian opossums, jackrabbits, and coyotes. This is the first description of L. intracellularis in these four species. Because the fecal samples were collected at equine farms with confirmed cases of EPE, striped skunks, Virginian opossums, jackrabbits, and coyotes may act as potential sources of infection to susceptible weanlings.",M2
18835201,"Evaluation of the humoral immune response and fecal shedding in weanling foals following oral and intra-rectal administration of an avirulent live vaccine of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis has recently been recognized as an emerging disease in foals. Whilst the clinical entity, diagnostic evaluation and treatment of affected foals have been well established and described, preventive measures for EPE have remained largely unaddressed. The objectives of this study were to investigate the humoral immune response and onset and duration of fecal shedding in foals after oral and intra-rectal administration of a modified-live vaccine of L. intracellularis. Foals were vaccinated twice, 3 weeks apart, via oral drenching after pre-medication with a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole; group 1), intra-rectally (group 2) or orally without any pre-medication (group 3). The health status of the foals was monitored daily, with feces and serum collected at regular intervals for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and serology. All foals remained healthy and no adverse vaccine reactions were observed. Fecal shedding lasted from 1 to 12 days and was mainly detected in foals receiving the intra-rectal vaccine 11-15 days following the first vaccine administration. Serological responses were measured in the majority of the vaccinated foals. All foals vaccinated intra-rectally seroconverted after the first vaccine, compared to 50% and 0% of foals in groups 1 and 3, respectively. Pre-medication with omeprazole prior to oral vaccination in group 1 foals led to an earlier and stronger detectable humoral response compared to non pre-medicated foals.",M2
18823723,"In vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 North American and European <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis isolates.The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobials against 10 isolates of Lawsonia intracellularis, the etiological agent of proliferative enteropathy (PE). Antimicrobials tested included carbadox, chlortetracycline, lincomycin, tiamulin, tylosin and valnemulin. The MIC of each antimicrobial against L. intracellularis was determined using a tissue culture system and was identified as the lowest concentration that inhibited 99% of L. intracellularis growth, as compared to the antimicrobial-free control. Each antimicrobial concentration was evaluated for both intracellular and extracellular activity against L. intracellularis, an obligately intracellular bacterium. When tested for intracellular activity, carbadox, tiamulin, and valnemulin were the most active antimicrobials with MICs of &lt; or =0.5microg/ml. Tylosin (MICs ranging from 0.25 to 32microg/ml) and chlortetracycline (MICs ranging from 0.125 to 64microg/ml) showed intermediate activities and lincomycin (MICs ranging from 8 to &gt;128mIcog/ml) showed the least activity. When tested for extracellular activity, valnemulin (MICs ranging from 0.125 to 4microg/ml) was the most active against most L. intracellularis isolates. Chlortetracycline (MICs ranging from 16 to 64microg/ml), tylosin (MICs ranging from 1 to &gt;128microg/ml), and tiamulin (MICs ranging from 1 to 32microg/ml) showed intermediate activities. Lincomycin (MICs ranging from 32 to &gt;128microg/ml) showed the least activity. Our in vitro results showed that each L. intracellularis isolate had a different antimicrobial sensitivity pattern and these data can be utilized as an in vitro guideline for the further antimicrobial evaluation of field L. intracellularis isolates.",M2

The aim of this study was to investigate whether feral pigs in Western Australia were colonized by the pathogenic enteric bacteria Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and/or Brachyspira pilosicoli. A total of 222 feral pigs from three study-populations were sampled. DNA was extracted from faeces or colonic contents and subjected to a previously described multiplex PCR for the three pathogenic bacterial species. A subset of 61 samples was cultured for Brachyspira species. A total of 42 (18.9%) of the 222 samples were PCR positive for L. intracellularis, 18 (8.1%) for B. hyodysenteriae and 1 (0.45%) for B. pilosicoli. Four samples were positive for both L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae. Samples positive for the latter two pathogens were found in pigs from all three study-sites. A strongly haemolytic B. hyodysenteriae isolate was recovered from one of the 61 cultured samples. Comparison of a 1250-base pair region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from the isolate and five of the B. hyodysenteriae PCR positive faecal samples helped confirm these as being from B. hyodysenteriae. This is the first time that B. hyodysenteriae has been detected in feral pigs. As these animals range over considerable distances, they present a potential source of B. hyodysenteriae for any domesticated pigs with which they may come into contact.",M2

In this study, we improved the in vitro cultivation method of L. intracellularis to increase the passage efficiency and showed that L. intracellularis isolated from a rabbit and a pig have different antigenic properties. Bacteria should be recovered from infected cells before cell death due to infection to obtain higher bacterial passage efficiency, and measurement of LDH activity in the cell culture medium was useful for determining the timing of bacterial passage. L. intracellularis isolated from the rabbit and pig showed different band patterns in immunoblotting.

18681919,"<e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection in horses: 2005-2007.BACKGROUND: Lawsonia intracellularis is an emerging equine pathogen that is a cause of equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE). OBJECTIVE: To describe the signalment, month of presentation, common clinical signs, clinicopathologic values, diagnostic tests used, antimicrobial use, and survival status in horses affected with EPE; to evaluate how affected horses sold at public auction as yearlings; and to determine results of fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) results in age matched, clinically normal herdmates. ANIMALS: The study group was 57 horses treated for disease associated with L. intracellularis infection between August 2005 and January 2007. METHODS: Retrospective study examined horses exhibiting evidence of infection with L. intracellularis and testing positive for fecal PCR or serum IPMA. RESULTS: Horses ranged in age from 2 to 8 months with a median age of 6 months, and all were examined between August and January. Ventral edema was present in 81% of horses and hypoalbuminemia occurred in all horses. Only 50% of horses tested positive on both PCR and IPMA. Ninety-three percent of horses survived, and survival was unrelated to antimicrobial administered. Affected horses sold as yearlings an average of 68% less than other yearlings by the same sire. Age matched, clinically normal herdmates also tested positive for L. intracellularis on fecal PCR (6%) and IPMA (33%). CONCLUSION: L. intracellularis infection should be considered in young horses with ventral edema and hypoalbuminemia that are examined between August and January. Both fecal PCR and serum IPMA are needed to help determine disease status. Treated animals usually survive, although they do not sell for as high a price at public auction as other yearlings by the same sire. Age matched, clinically normal herdmates also test positive for L. intracellularis on fecal PCR and serum IPMA.",M2

The aim of our study was to detect L. intracellularis in free-living rodents from pig farms in the Czech Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lawsonia intracellularis was demonstrated, using nested polymerase chain reaction, in the intestinal mucous membranes of 107 (36%) out of 296 small terrestrial mammals collected. In rodents, the bacterium was detected in 91 of 213 house mice, one of six brown rats, eight of 51 striped field mice, three of 12 yellow-necked mice and three of nine common voles. Moreover, one of one tested lesser white-toothed shrew (Insectivora) was positive. In 17 out of 69 (25%) rodents tested, serum IgG antibodies against L. intracellularis were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test. All seropositive animals were house mice. CONCLUSIONS: Free-living rodents may be serving as host or reservoir species and may be playing a role in the spread of L. intracellularis both within pig farms and in its transmission between farms and into the natural environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first detection of L. intracellularis in free-living small mammalian terrestrial species.",M2
18606736,"<e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis contains a gene encoding a functional rickettsia-like ATP/ADP translocase for host exploitation.ATP/ADP translocases are a hallmark of obligate intracellular pathogens related to chlamydiae and rickettsiae. These proteins catalyze the highly specific exchange of bacterial ADP against host ATP and thus allow bacteria to exploit their hosts' energy pool, a process also referred to as energy parasitism. The genome sequence of the obligate intracellular pathogen Lawsonia intracellularis (Deltaproteobacteria), responsible for one of the most economically important diseases in the swine industry worldwide, revealed the presence of a putative ATP/ADP translocase most similar to known ATP/ADP translocases of chlamydiae and rickettsiae (around 47% amino acid sequence identity). The gene coding for the putative ATP/ADP translocase of L. intracellularis (L. intracellularis nucleotide transporter 1 [NTT1(Li)]) was cloned and expressed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. The transport properties of NTT1(Li) were determined by measuring the uptake of radioactively labeled substrates by E. coli. NTT1(Li) transported ATP in a counterexchange mode with ADP in a highly specific manner; the substrate affinities determined were 236.3 (+/- 36.5) microM for ATP and 275.2 (+/- 28.1) microM for ADP, identifying this protein as a functional ATP/ADP translocase. NTT1(Li) is the first ATP/ADP translocase from a bacterium not related to Chlamydiae or Rickettsiales, showing that energy parasitism by ATP/ADP translocases is more widespread than previously recognized. The occurrence of an ATP/ADP translocase in L. intracellularis is explained by a relatively recent horizontal gene transfer event with rickettsiae as donors.",M2
18479698,"Infection of different strains of mice with <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis derived from rabbit or porcine proliferative enteropathy.This report describes intestinal lesions in five strains of mice infected orally with Lawsonia intracellularis-infected tissue homogenates from rabbits or pigs (RLI and PLI). BALB/cA, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J and ICR mice were susceptible to infection with RLI, whereas only C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J and ICR strains were susceptible to PLI. In susceptible mice, crypt epithelial hyperplasia occurred in association with an inflammatory reaction, as in proliferative enteropathy (PE) in other species. The intestinal changes in the infected mice varied from mild to severe. Unlike rabbit or porcine PE, in which the changes are confined to the ileum, the lesions in mice were located in the caecum. Immunolabelling of L. intracellularis antigen was abundant in early infection when the epithelial hyperplasia was mild or absent. When the hyperplasia had become severe, however, immunolabelling was weak. For this reason, it is suggested that transitory infection of the epithelium induces epithelial hyperplasia. Genetic differences between mouse strains appeared to play an important role in the response to L. intracellularis infection. Moreover, the susceptibility of BALB/cA mice to RLI but not to PLI suggests that there are significant biological differences between L. intracellularis isolates from rabbit PE and porcine PE.",M2

In the affected epithelial cytoplasm, numerous curved bacillus-like organisms were observed in the Warthin-Starry silver stain and electron microscopy observation. In polymerase chain reactions, Lawsonia intracellularis-specific DNA fragment were amplified from affected ileal tissue extracted DNA in each case and present 5 cases were confirmed to be L. intracellularis infection. Serum collected from the affected rabbit was immunohistochemically reactive with L. intracellularis in tissue sections from pigs with porcine proliferative enteropathy, as well as with tissue sections from the five affected rabbits.

A total of 332 serum samples, consisting of 232 experimentally infected animals and 100 animals naturally infected with L. intracellularis, were used to assess the diagnostic sensitivity. Three hundred and fifty-five sera from uninfected animals were used to determine the diagnostic specificity. The receiver operating characteristic and mean +3 standard deviation of optical density (OD) values from uninfected animals were used for selecting cut-off points. The diagnostic accuracy of So-ELISA was considered to be high as the area under the curve index was 0.991 with 0.0029 standard error. The optimal cut-off for So-ELISA was set at 0.45 OD with 89.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity based on a combination of good sensitivity and high specificity. No cross-reactivity was found in sera from pigs exposed to Brachyspira pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, Campylobacter mucosalis, C. jejuni, or C. coli. Inter- and intracoefficient of variation of all control sera tested with So-ELISA was less than 10%. The observed agreements between So-ELISA and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay tested with experimental challenge animals and field samples were 95.08% with 0.88 kappa and 90.65% with 0.74 kappa value, respectively.

Furthermore, an IFT and PCR on faecal and/or tissue samples are well established for the direct detection. The suitability of PCR on faecal samples is frequently discussed. Problems are related to various inhibitors that are component of faeces. When interpreting laboratory results, the past medical history of pigs, i.e. antimicrobial treatment, has to be considered.

17996403,"The microbiota of pigs influenced by diet texture and severity of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection.Pigs with and without naturally occurring Lawsonia intracellularis infection were fed diets with different texture. In a previous study from 79 pig herds using a similar feeding on pelleted or non-pelleted form showed that the non-pelleted diet was associated with a reduced prevalence of L. intracellularis. In this study a mechanistic approach was taken for explaining and testing this observation by studying the microbiota and the occurrence of L. intracellularis in the distal ileum of 54 pigs by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, Real-Time PCR and in situ hybridization. The texture of the diet influenced the microbiota, and from a quantitative discriminative analysis of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of ileum samples it was deduced that Clostridium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were associated with the non-pelleted diet and Streptococcus spp. with the pelleted diet. In experimentally infected pigs it was verified that 89bp and 90bp sized T-RFs (HhaI) from ileum represented L. intracellularis. The non-pelleted diet seemed to reduce the relative amount of L. intracellularis in the total microbiota of the ileum, but the number of pigs detected positive with L. intracellularis by Real-Time PCR was not influenced. The five pigs with highest L. intracellularis content showed T-RFs that were not present in profiles from less or non-infected pigs, which may indicate that some bacterial species were associated with L. intracellularis infection.",M2

Detection limits for B. hyodysenteriae, B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis were 10(4), 10(2) and 10(3) copies respectively. Agreement between multiplex-PCR and nested-PCR or cultivation was considered substantial to almost perfect.

Pigs from Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta were tested by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay for antibodies to L. intracellularis. Pig seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of pigs positive from total pigs tested in the targeted population. Seroprevalence (+/- standard error [s(x)]) in market hogs in Ontario from farrow-finish (FF) farms and finishing (FIN) farms were significantly different at 77% (s(x) = 7%) and 29% (s(x) = 15%), respectively.

17070535,"Distinction between porcine circovirus type 2 enteritis and porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.The presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was studied immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded samples of intestinal tissue from 80 pigs with a clinical history suggestive of Lawsonia intracellularis-associated diarrhoea. Histopathologically, enteritis of varying intensity was diagnosed in 64 of the pigs. Of these 64 animals, 34 (18%) were infected with both PCV2 and L. intracellularis. Of the remaining 30 cases of enteritis, 23 (77%) were attributed to PCV2 infection alone. The PCV2-associated enteritis cases showed necrotizing ileitis and colitis, indistinguishable macroscopically from proliferative enteritis (PE) due to L. intracellularis. Histopathologically, L. intracellularis-positive intestines showed adenomatous proliferation of crypt enterocytes, whereas PCV2 enteritis was characterized by histiocytosis of varying intensity, with PCV2-positive cells in the submucosa, lamina propria and crypt epithelium, as well as in the lymphoid tissue of the ileum and colon. Multinucleated giant cells, however, were seen in both infections. PCV2 was about three times more likely to be detected in L. intracellularis-negative than in L. intracellularis-positive samples (P&lt;0.001). There was no association between PCV2 and other intestinal bacterial pathogens. The study demonstrated that PCV2 enteritis should be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of L. intracellularis infection in pigs aged 2-4 months with a clinical history of diarrhoea.",M2
16984651,"Human inflammatory bowel disease does not associate with <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection.BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that bacterial infection of the intestinal mucosa may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In pigs, an obligate intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis (LI), was shown to cause proliferative enteropathy (PE) of which some forms display histological and clinical similarities to human IBD. Since LI-similar Desulfovibrio spp. may infect human cells, we hypothesized that LI might be associated with the development of human IBD. RESULTS: In human intestinal tissue samples, PCR using LLG, 50SL27, LSA and strictly LI-specific 16SII primers, yielded either no amplicons or products with weak homology to human genomic sequences. Sequencing of these amplicons revealed no specificity for LI. However, amplification of DNA with less specific 16SI primers resulted in products bearing homology to certain Streptococcus species. These 16SI-amplified products were present in healthy and diseased specimens, without obvious prevalence. CONCLUSION: LI is not associated with the pathogenesis of UC or CD. Whether an immunologic response to commensal bacteria such as streptococci may contribute to the chronic inflammatory condition in IBD, remained to be determined.",M2

In a large Hungarian growing-finishing pig production unit, pigs with positive LI status were randomly divided into 2 groups and treated as follows: Group one: growing pigs (n = 4112) were LI vaccinated with an avirulent oral live vaccine (Enterisol Ileitis Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St. Joseph, USA). Group two: growing pigs (n = 4188 pigs) have not received LI vaccination. Culling and mortality rates, reasons for culling or mortality, and average daily weight gain were evaluated. Porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) caused culling and mortality rates were lower (0.2 % vs. 14.9 %, P &lt; 0.001), and vaccinated pigs had lower none-PPE caused culling and mortality rates compared with the non-vaccinated ones (1.4 vs. 2.6 %, P &gt; 0.05). While systemic infections and social stress or cannibalism related culling or mortality were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated pigs, reasons for culling or mortality due to non-LI caused diseases were non-significantly different between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs. Average daily weight gain was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the LI vaccinated group of animals compared with the non-vaccinated ones (780 +/- 45 g vs. 660 +/- 71 g). The present results indicate that that LI vaccination does not only prevent PPE, but might result in more resistance and tolerance against other infectious and management caused losses.",M2

One hundred 17-d-old weaned pigs were blocked by sex, ancestry, and BW, and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 treatment groups: negative control, unchallenged, corn-soy diet; positive control, challenged, corn-soy diet; 20% DDGS diet (D), challenged; 5% soybean hulls diet (SH), challenged; and SH sprayed with a polyclonal antibody product diet, challenged. Challenged pigs were orally inoculated with 6.4 x 10(8) L. intracellularis organisms after a 4-wk prechallenge feeding period. On d 21 postchallenge, pigs were euthanized, lesions of intestinal mucosa were evaluated, and ileal tissue samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to determine the presence and proliferation rate of L. intracellularis. Challenging pigs with L. intracellularis reduced growth rate, feed intake, and efficiency of gain (P &lt; 0.02) and increased the proportion of internal organ weights relative to BW (P &lt; 0.01).

For antimicrobial-supplemented treatments, diets contained 33 ppm bacitracin methylene disalicylate throughout the experiment, with chlortetracycline (Aureomycin) pulsed at 550 ppm from d 3 prechallenge to d 11 postchallenge. Challenged pigs were orally inoculated with 8.0 x 10(8) L. intracellularis organisms after a 4-wk prechallenge period. On d 21 postchallenge, pigs were euthanized, lesions of intestinal mucosa were evaluated, and ileal tissue samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to determine the presence and proliferation rate of L. intracellularis. Compared with other dietary treatments, feeding a diet containing 10% DDGS reduced ileum and colon lesion length and prevalence (P &lt; 0.05) and reduced severity of lesions in the ileum (P &lt; 0.05) and colon (P &lt; 0.10) in challenged pigs. Compared with other challenged pigs, those fed the diet containing the antimicrobial regimen had a lower prevalence and severity of lesions in the jejunum (P &lt; 0.05) and tended to have reduced total tract lesion length (P = 0.11). Compared with other challenged pigs, pigs on the 10% DDGS diet with antimicrobial regimen exhibited no differences in length, severity, or prevalence of lesions (P &gt; 0.15), but fecal shedding of L. intracellularis was reduced on d 14 postchallenge (P &lt; 0.05). No dietary effects on fecal shedding were observed by d 20 postchallenge (P &gt; 0.10). The proportion of cells infected with L. intracellularis was reduced when DDGS (P = 0.05) or antimicrobial (P = 0.10) diets were fed.

When 396 pigs submitted for routine laboratory examination were investigated, large intestinal gross lesions were seen in 93, including 74 cases of L. intracellularis colitis (proliferative enteropathy). Fifty-one pigs without recorded colonic gross lesions revealed L. intracellularis colitis microscopically. In four cases, L. intracellularis was only revealed in colon. Fifty-seven pigs were positive for L. intracellularis in the small intestines only. Thus, the overall prevalence of colonic infection in L. intracellularis-positive animals was as high as 69% (125 out of 182). In comparison, the large intestinal pathogens Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Salmonella enterica were only isolated from 5 and 4 of the 93 cases, respectively. Morphologically, an unforeseen severe involvement of the subepithelial mucosa with multiple L. intracellularis found free and within large macrophages was observed in areas with acute infection. The distribution of whole L. intracellularis organisms was confirmed by in situ hybridisation and scanning confocal laser microscopy. The significance and possible role of subepithelial infection in the proliferative enteropathy is discussed. In conclusion, the study shows that L. intracellularis is a prevalent cause of naturally acquired colitis in pigs.",M2

Two conventional swine were anesthetized, and ligated ileum loops were prepared during abdominal surgery. The loops were inoculated with 108 L. intracellularis or saline. After 60 min, samples of each loop were processed for routine histologic and electron microscopic study. Histologic and ultrathin sections of all the loops appeared normal, with no apposition of bacteria and host cells or bacterial entry events in any loop. Portions of ileum from a single gnotobiotic piglet were introduced as xenografts into the subcutis of each flank of 5 weaned mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. After 4 wk, 108 L. intracellularis were inoculated into each of 4 viable xenografts with a sterile needle; the other 3 viable xenografts received saline. Histologic and ultrathin sections of all the xenografts 3 wk after inoculation showed relatively normal porcine intestinal architecture, with normal crypts, crypt cell differentiation, and low villous structures; the xenografts treated with the bacteria also showed intracytoplasmic L. intracellularis within crypt and villous epithelial cells. Thus, entry of L. intracellularis into target epithelial cells and multiplication may not be sufficient alone to directly cause cell proliferation. A proliferative response may require active division of crypt cells and differentiation in conjunction with L. intracellularis growth.",M2

Major developments in the understanding of PE and its causative agent, Lawsonia intracellularis, have occurred that have led to advances in the detection of this disease and methods to control and prevent it. Diagnostic tools that have improved overall detection and early onset of PE in pigs include various serological and molecular-based assays. Histological tests such as immunohistochemistry continue to be the gold standard in confirming Lawsonia-specific lesions in pigs post mortem. Despite extreme difficulties in isolating L. intracellularis, innovations in the cultivation and the development of pure culture challenge models, have opened doors to better characterization of the pathogenesis of PE through in vivo and in vitro L. intracellularis-host interactions. Advancements in molecular research such as the genetic sequencing of the entire Lawsonia genome have provided ways to identify various immunogens, metabolic pathways and methods for understanding the epidemiology of this organism. The determinations of immunological responsiveness in pigs to virulent and attenuated isolates of L. intracellularis and identification of various immunogens have led to progress in vaccine development.",M2

Investigation regarding the efficacy of this substance in growing pigs has never been carried out before in a field trial. The trial farm had a previous history of PE outbreaks. On day 1 of the trial (age of 62 +/- 1.5 days), 240 pigs were divided into two groups of 120 pigs/group which were allocated into five pens of 24 pigs each. Therefore, a randomized block design was used with two experimental groups (T1-T2) and five replicates (pens) per group. T1 group served as negative control (NC) animals which were receiving no medication and conversely T2 group received in-feed lincomycin at the dose of 110 mg/kg of feed. The treatment period lasted for 3 weeks, followed by an observation period of 4 weeks up to the age of 111 +/- 1.5 days which was the end of the grower stage. Administration of lincomycin at a dose of 110 mg/kg of feed had beneficial effects compared with the NC group. The pigs of T2 group showed significant improvement of their production parameters in terms of average daily body gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) not only during the treatment period (ADG: 0.515 +/- 0.050 versus 0.481 +/- 0.071 and FCR: 2.38 +/- 0.05 versus 2.56 +/- 0.08, for T2 and T1 groups respectively), but also during the remaining period until the end of the grower stage (observation period: ADG: 0.687 +/- 0.019 versus 0.646 +/- 0.044 and FCR: 2.58 +/- 0.02 versus 2.74 +/- 0.02 respectively). Other effects in the T2 group refer to the reduction of diarrhoea prevalence (mean pen diarrhoea score during the whole grower stage: 0.200 +/- 0.060 versus 0.632 +/- 0.041 respectively), morbidity rates (morbidity rates during the whole grower stage: 15.83% versus 45.00% respectively) and the reduction of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis prevalence as shown by polymerase chain reaction diagnostic method (at the end of the treatment period: 10.0% versus 60.0% respectively).

Live LI were passaged in cell culture and harvested from infected McCoy cells. Dead LI were prepared by exposing live LI to 70% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min. Seven samples with dead:live ratios of 0:100 (live control), 10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 70:30, 90:10, and 100:0 (dead control) were prepared for testing by both the FCM and the DCM. For the FCM, TO-PRO-3 iodine was applied to the samples, and viable LI were counted. For the DCM, the samples were stained with LIVE/DEAD BacLight, which contains SYTO 9 and propidium iodine, then filtered through 0.2-microm Nuclepore black polycarbonate filters, viewed, and counted with the use of an epifluorescence microscope. Data were evaluated by estimating 95% limits of agreement and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The limits of agreement between the FCM and the DCM versus the standard ratio of added LI showed mean differences not equal to zero, suggesting that systematic bias was introduced. The CCC showed almost perfect agreement (r = 0.9898). With a specific fluorescent probe, the FCM is useful and as good as the DCM for determining LI viability.",M2

The study included 105 randomly selected herds, constituting approximately one third of Swedish herds with a herd size of &gt;100 sows. The herds were located all over the country. In these herds, growth promoters were not used and pigs sampled were not subjected to any medication. From each herd, samples were taken from 10 growing pigs aged 8-12 weeks, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all growing pigs present in the herd at the sampling occasion. If possible, the samples were taken from pigs with diarrhoea. Forty-eight faecal samples and 71 rectal swabs were also taken from free-living wild boars (31 piglets, 19 growers and 21 adult animals) at shooting. The samples were analysed by culture and biochemical tests for the presence of Brachyspira spp. and by nested PCR for the presence of L. intracellularis.

Single and multiplex PCR amplification of DNA from Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella typhimurium and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae with each primer set produced fragments of the predicted size without any nonspecific amplification, 210-bp, 298-bp and 403-bp bands, respectively. The single PCR assay could detect as little as 100 pg of purified DNA of S. typhimurium and L. intracellularis, and 50 pg of B. hyodysenteriae, respectively.

Serological results from a controlled L. intracellularis challenge exposure study confirmed the high specificity and sensitivity of this assay (100% and 99.5%, respectively). Comparisons between the LPS ELISA and the IFAT in detecting anti-Lawsonia antibodies in this controlled study revealed significantly more LPS ELISA-positive pigs than IFAT-positive pigs on days 21, 28, 35, and 42 (P = 0.003, 0.030, 0.002, and 0.006, respectively). This indirect ELISA (LPS ELISA) test is an improved method of detecting antibodies in pigs soon after exposure to L. intracellularis, regardless of isolate type (vaccine or wild type) in experimental studies. The LPS ELISA may be used as a tool to support future research trials on vaccine efficacy and to further understand the immune response induced by L. intracellularis.",M2
15885725,"Naturally acquired <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection in pigs studied from weaning to slaughter by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test and polymerase chain reaction on faeces.The course of naturally acquired Lawsonia intracellularis infection was studied in 41 pigs by testing blood and faeces samples collected four to seven times from before weaning to slaughter 5 months old. At slaughter, a sample of ileum was taken for histopathology. In the first sampling when the pigs were 2-4 weeks old maternally derived IgG against L. intracellularis was demonstrated by immunofluorescence antibody test in nine pigs whereas the bacterium was detected by PCR in faeces from six pigs. The maternally derived antibodies did not prevent pigs from becoming infected as seven pigs later on shed and/or were seropositive for L. intracellularis. The lowest prevalence of L. intracellularis was observed in 6-13 weeks old pigs and it seemed as though L. intracellularis in early infected pigs only activates a minor antibody response. At slaughter 66% of the pigs were found positive by immunofluorescence antibody test compared to 24% by immunohistochemistry on ileal samples. Thus, applied at the time of slaughter the antibody test appeared to be a highly sensitive ante-mortem diagnostic tool for identifying L. intracellularis exposed pigs with or without current proliferative enteropathy.",M2

The detection of L. intracellularis in clinical and environmental samples is necessary for the diagnosis of infection and epidemiological investigations. For the detection of L. intracellularis in fecal samples, we have developed an immunological method using immunomagnetic separation and ATP bioluminescence. Magnetic beads were coated with an anti-Lawsonia surface antigen (LsaA) antibody in order to capture the L. intracellularis in fecal samples from infected rabbits and the bacteria captured by the immunomagnetic beads were assayed by means of ATP bioluminescence. Our results showed that L. intracelluraris was detected by immunomagnetic separation of bacteria-holding magnetic beads and ATP-based bioluminescence, suggesting that our methods could be useful for the diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy.",M2

Lawsonia intracellularis-associated proliferative enteritis was diagnosed using histopathology (Warthin-Starry stain), immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of the ileal biopsy. The animal developed transient diarrhea and severe hypoproteinemia 16 days after surgery but recovered with intensive treatment using azithromycin.

15732020,"Cytologic diagnosis of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis proliferative ileitis in a Japanese snow macaque (Macaca fuscata).Diffuse ileal thickening and ileocecocolic lymphadenomegaly were observed during exploratory laparotomy in a 2-year-old male Japanese snow macaque (Macaca fuscata) that had flu-like signs and diarrhea. Cytologic examination of ileal biopsy imprints revealed many mature, mildly karyolytic neutrophils and fewer well-differentiated lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and plasma cells in a background containing amorphous, necrotic material. Tightly cohesive sheets of moderately pleomorphic epithelial cells also were seen. The cytologic diagnosis was chronic, active, mixed inflammation with atypical epithelial cells and necrosis. Histologically, the mucosal and crypt epithelium was moderately hyperplastic with a loss of goblet cells, increased mitoses, and frequent crypt abscesses. Within the lamina propria and extending into the submucosa was a marked neutrophilic infiltrate, with low numbers of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. The histologic diagnosis was chronic, diffuse, marked suppurative and lymphocytic ileitis. Warthin-Starry silver staining of the ileal biopsy and imprint specimens demonstrated numerous pleomorphic, curved bacilli consistent with Lawsonia intracellularis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry confirmed the identity of the infectious agent. L intracellularis infection may be underdiagnosed because silver stain is required to visualize the organism with light microscopy and because the pathognomonic crypt hyperplasia may be complicated by secondary pathologic changes. Application of silver stain to cytologic specimens should be considered when distal intestinal lesions associated with hyperplastic epithelium, with or without inflammation, hemorrhage, or necrosis, are identified in animals with clinical signs of enteritis, especially in frequently affected species or in stressed or young animals.",M2

The primary variables of interest were pig removal rate, diarrhea scores, demeanor scores, and abdominal appearance scores. Ancillary performance variables examined included average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed per gain. After a 3-day acclimation period, pigs were challenged on 2 consecutive days with a mucosal homogenate containing a total dose of 1.4 x 10(9) cells of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis. Five days later, when porcine proliferative enteropathy was well established, drinking water medicated with 125 mg (L125) or 250 mg (L250) lincomycin/gallon was provided to two groups of pigs for 10 days. Pigs were observed for 13 days following the treatment period. A third group of pigs served as controls and received unmedicated drinking water throughout the study. The L250 group experienced a significantly lower (P &lt; .05) pig removal rate than the control group over the 23-day observation period. Additionally, for every primary variable, the L250 group experienced a significantly decreased (P &lt; .01) number of abnormal days compared with the control group. The L125 group showed a significant reduction (P &lt; .05) in abnormal demeanor and abnormal abdominal appearance scores compared with controls.",M2
15708816,"Development, characterization and diagnostic application of a monoclonal antibody specific for a proteinase K resistant <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis antigen.Proliferative enteropathy (PE) is one of the most important infections in pigs caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, an obligate intracellular bacterium. The purpose of the present investigation was to develop monoclonal antibodies with specificity to L. intracellularis useful both for diagnostic purposes (by immunohistochemistry) and for bacterial characterization. Several antibody producing hybridomas were established by fusion of mouse myeloma with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with mucosa scrapings of the intestinal mucosa from a L. intracellularis infected pig. A monoclonal antibody (mAb), Law1-DK, isotyped as IgG2b was selected by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Histological sections of the intestines from pigs affected by proliferative enteropathy and in vitro grown bacteria in cell culture were tested positive for the presence of L. intracellularis with the mAb. A molecule at 21 kDa was recognized by the mAb in a Western blotting analysis when a whole-cell preparation of L. intracellularis was run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This antigen was released from L. intracellularis by mild heat treatment and was resistant to proteinase K digestion, suggesting it to be non-protein, e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This suggestion was supported by its presence in the aqueous phase of a phenol-water extract. The inhibitory effect of periodate oxidation on the antigen-antibody binding confirmed the participation of a carbohydrate epitope. The new mAb was tested highly specific for L. intracellularis by applying in situ hybridization with a L. intracellularis specific probe targeting 16S ribosomal RNA simultaneously with the IFAT.",M2

DESIGN: Serologic survey. ANIMALS: 93 pigs born to seropositive gilts and raised in indoor (n = 49) or outdoor (44) growing-finishing facilities. PROCEDURE: Blood samples were collected from the pigs 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 weeks after birth and tested for antibodies against L intracellularis with an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: None of the pigs were seropositive 2 or 6 weeks after birth. Ten weeks after birth, 74% and 76% of pigs in indoor and outdoor growing-finishing facilities were seropositive, respectively, whereas 14 weeks after birth, the percentage of pigs in indoor growing-finishing facilities that were seropositive was substantially higher than the percentage of pigs in outdoor facilities that were. From 18 weeks after birth to the end of the study, none of the pigs in outdoor growing-finishing facilities were seropositive, whereas low percentages of pigs in indoor facilities were seropositive 18, 22, and 26 weeks after birth.

15584431,"[Distribution of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in healthy and diarrhoeic pigs]Although Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae and Lawsonia (L.) intracellularis are widely distributed in pigs in Germany, there exists limited information on their clinical relevance. To get more insight into their potential role in swine diarrhoeal disease, in 2002 and 2003 faecal specimens from healthy pigs (n=1445) as well as from diarrhoeic pigs (n=2002) were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of both agents. Of the specimens from healthy pigs L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae were detected in 7.3% and 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, of the diarrhoeic pigs the ratios of positive samples amounted to 19.4% for L. intracellularis and 17.9% for B. hyodysenteriae. Concerning the age of the diseased animals, in growing pigs the detection rates of L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae were nearly identical (16.4% and 14.2%, respectively). In fattening pigs a significant higher number of animals were affected with B. hyodysenteriae (35.8%) than with L. intracellularis (28.2%). On the other hand, in sows L. intracellularis (35.6% positive samples) was dominant compared to B. hyodysenteriae (21.2% positive samples). Considering the nearly threefold higher percentage rates of L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae in diarrhoeic pigs in comparison to healthy pigs, it is concluded that both agents play an important role in swine diarrhoeal disease. The results further indicated that in fattening pigs B. hyodysenteriae and in sows L. intracellularis have a dominant role, respectively.",M2
15564028,"Infection dynamics of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in pig herds.Little information is known about the natural course and within-herd prevalence of porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. The objective of the study was to investigate the within-herd dynamics of naturally acquired L. intracellularis infection in pigs from weaning to slaughter. The study was designed as a longitudinal survey where 100 pigs from five herds were randomly selected at weaning (approximately 4 weeks of age). Every second week until slaughter (10-12 times, i.e. 20-24 weeks) the pigs were weighed and faecal as well as blood samples were collected. Faecal shedding of L. intracellularis was assessed by real time-PCR and sero-conversion by an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Clinical disease was not reported but infection was present in all herds and the PCR assay indicated infection in 75% of pigs examined. Most L. intracellularis infected pigs were shedding at 10-12 weeks of age (22-29 kg) and shed for 2-6 successive weeks. After 18 weeks of age all shedding had ceased and re-infection at PCR detectable level was not seen. Variable L. intracellularis associated impact on growth rate was observed. Immediately before bacterial shedding and during early infection the average growth rate declined whereas a compensatory impact was observed during later infection and after bacterial shedding had ceased. The performance of the IFAT resembled the bacteriological test almost perfectly. Sero-conversion was first detected at 12-14 weeks of age. Relative to the bacterial shedding, the onset of sero-conversion was a little delayed, in general, most pigs had sero-converted 2 weeks after the first shedding. Once sero-converted, 92% of the pigs remained sero-positive over the entire survey period.",M2

The study was conducted using conventional pigs divided into three groups as follows: principles inoculated with L. intracellularis, sentinels, and controls. The pigs were inoculated and paired on 13 and 9 days post-inoculation with a sentinel pig for 7 days. Fecal samples and serum samples were collected throughout the study for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing by indirect fluorescent antibody techniques. After co-mingling, the inoculated group was necropsied; sentinel and control pigs were necropsied 7-14 days later. The intestinal tracts were evaluated grossly and microscopically for lesions. PCR was performed on intestinal mucosal scrapings and feces. Warthin-Starry and fluorescent antibody staining procedures were conducted to confirm colonization with L. intracellularis. Gross and microscopic lesions typical of porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) were observed in both the inoculated and sentinel groups. Transmission was demonstrated from inoculated principle pigs to sentinel pigs. PCR results detected cyclical shedding of L. intracellularis in the feces. Seroconversion occurred in pigs that were exposed to L. intracellularis. From this study, it was demonstrated that transmission of L. intracellularis can occur easily in an environment with experimentally infected pigs and that PCR can be a useful tool to monitor fecal shedding of the organism.",M2

Eight immune response-related and 14 microsatellite loci covering 12 out of 31 equine autosomes were used for the association analysis. Markers located on horse Chromosomes Eca10 and 15 were significantly associated with the presence of high numbers of R. equi in transtracheal aspirates. Significant associations of markers located on Eca9, 15, and 21 with fecal shedding of Lawsonia intracellularis were found.

In three sequential trials, a total of 144 weaned pigs were fed five different diets all made from a standard diet based on wheat and barley as carbohydrate source and soybean as protein source. The five diets were: a standard diet (fine ground and pelleted), the standard diet fed as fermented liquid feed, the standard diet added 1.8% formic acid, the standard diet added 2.4% lactic acid and a diet similar to the standard diet (made from the same ingredients), but fed coarse ground. Twenty-four pigs on each diet were orally inoculated with L. intracellularis and growth performance and faecal excretion of bacteria were monitored. Twenty-four pigs fed the standard diet were included as not experimentally infected controls. Pigs in the first two trials were sacrificed 4 weeks post-inoculation, whereas animals in the third trial were sacrificed after 5 weeks. Pigs in all experimentally infected groups excreted L. intracellularis. The fermented liquid diet delayed the excretion of L. intracellularis and furthermore, pigs fed the standard diet supplemented with lactic acid had limited pathological lesions when the intestines were examined 4 weeks after inoculation. The growth performance was reduced in pigs experimentally challenged with L. intracellularis, however the prevalence and severity of diarrhea was limited.",M2

Firstly, a method to prepare tissue samples before a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated in pigs submitted for necropsy. Secondly, seven different faecal preparation methods and four different DNA polymerases were tested in single or nested PCR, with co-amplification of a mimic molecule. Thirdly, in selected pigs submitted for necropsy, tissue and faecal samples were examined histopathologically and by PCR, and blood samples were analysed serologically. Detection of L. intracellularis in tissue preparations by PCR showed good specificity and correlated to lesions found at necropsy. The sensitivity in spiked tissue samples was 10(1)-10(2) mimic molecules per tube. In faecal samples, nested PCR on boiled lysate gave the best result with a sensitivity of 10(2)-10(3) mimic molecules per reaction tube. However, because of the time-consuming procedure and the increased risk for contamination, a commercially available kit was preferred for routine diagnoses, despite a somewhat lower detection rate in subclinically infected pigs. In a few cases, the serological results differed from those obtained by PCR and by necropsy but the reason for this is not clear. This study indicates that the best method for diagnosis of acute enteritis in growers is PCR on faecal or tissue samples. To determine the presence of the bacteria in a herd, serology or repeated faecal sampling for PCR from target animals, or both, should be used.",M2
15276770,"Prevalence of exposure and infection of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis among slaughter-age pigs.The extent of clinical or subclinical infection associated with Lawsonia intracellularis within Dutch pig herds was uncertain. A case-control study of slaughter age pigs was used to study natural infection within Dutch herds and to compare diagnostic methods. From six case herds where clinical disease had been identified recently, and six disease-free herds, 40 pigs of slaughter-age were examined postmortem. The diagnostic methods used were: serology, gross examination, Haematoxylin and Eosin stain (HE), Warthin-Starry silver stain, Lawsonia-specific indirect immunoperoxidase of the ileum, and PCR of ileum mucosa and colon contents. There were 59% seropositive pigs in case herds and 26% seropositive pigs in control herds. Using immunohistochemistry, 57% of case herds and 46% of control herds were bacteria positive in the ileum mucosa. It was concluded that a majority of Dutch herds contain L. intracellularis infected finisher pigs. In some herds this is associated with clinical outbreaks of acute haemorrhagic enteropathy but in other herds no clinical disease is apparent. Many seropositive pigs in herds without clinical disease had evidence of Lawsonia antigen in sites other than the apical cytoplasm of proliferating epithelial cells, particularly the supranuclear region. It was uncertain whether to classify these pigs as having  recovered  from an infection or whether they have a sub-clinical or chronic form of the disease. We concluded that PCR examination of faeces and serology probably provide more specific results than gross examinations at slaughter, and that a monoclonal antibody-based examination of ileum mucosa should be the accepted screening method for this infection.",M2

ANIMALS: 108 weaned 3-week-old pigs (35 in experiment 1 and 73 in experiment 2). PROCEDURE: 2 experiments were conducted. On day 0, vaccinates were orally administered vaccine via drench or in drinking water, whereas challenge-control pigs were administered cultured medium. On day 21, pigs were challenge exposed with a virulent heterologous isolate of L. intracellularis. Clinical observations, weights, seroconversion, and fecal excretion of L. intracellularis were measured until day 42. At study termination, pigs were euthanatized and examined for L. intracellularis-specific lesion development of the ileum and colon. RESULTS: Pigs receiving a single dose of vaccine were protected when challenge exposed with virulent L. intracellularis (at least 10(77) TCID50/dose). In experiment 1, vaccinates had significantly less fecal excretion (47% and 40% for days 35 and 42, respectively), compared with challenge-control pigs. In experiment 2, vaccinates had significantly less fecal excretion (50% and 58% for days 35 and 42, respectively), compared with challenge-control pigs. Significant reductions in lesion development were evident in the ileum of vaccinated pigs (70% and 56% at day 42 for experiments 1 and 2, respectively), compared with challenge-control pigs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oral administration by drench or via drinking water of an avirulent live vaccine against L. intracellularis resulted in substantial protection against proliferative enteropathy among vaccinates and offers a better way to reduce stress of pigs during vaccine administration.",M2

Primers were designed based on the p78 DNA clone of L. intracellularis. The one step PCR resulted in the formation of a specific 210-bp DNA product derived from L. intracellularis. The nonspecific amplification product was not detected with swine genomic DNA or other bacterial strains causing similar symptoms to L. intracellularis infection. The one step PCR was as sensitive as 100 pg of L. intracellularis genomic DNA. We applied this method to field specimens diagnosed as PPE by macroscopic observation. Of 17 mucosal scraping specimens, 16 (94%) were identified as positive to PPE and 15 (88%) of 17 feces specimens.

To determine the spread of the agent among German pig herds pooled fecal samples of five animals each of clinically normal Hessian pig herds collected between november 1998 and february 1999 as well as feces (n = 1684) from individual animals representing 648 herds, sent to our laboratory by veterinarians from all parts of Germany, were tested for L. intracellularis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, fecal samples from diarrhoic foals (n = 46), dogs (n = 57), cats (n = 50), calves (n = 37), hedge hogs (n = 9), seals (n = 8) and one giraffe were also studied. DNA was extracted from feces using high concentrations of chaotropic salt and diatomaceous earth. For PCR, primers flanking a 279 bp fragment of L. intracellularis DNA were used (JONES, G. F., WARD, G. E., MURTAUGH, M. P., LINN, G. (1993), J. Clin. Microbiol. 31, 2611-2615). Amplificates were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV-light. L. intracellularis was found in 26 (12.8%) samples from 21 (30.0%) of the Hessian pig herds without symptoms of diarrhoea. In feces of pigs with diarrhoea (n = 1684) the agent was present in 431 (25.6%) samples originating from 224 (34.6%) herds.

Immunohistochemistry staining has superior sensitivity over hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining for detecting L. intracellularis in histological sections. A L. intracellularis-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) produced in the UK (IG4 MAb) has been described in the literature. However, no monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are commercially available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to produce and characterize new polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against L. intracellularis that are suitable for diagnostic use. The new monoclonal (2001 MAb) and polyclonal antibodies (1999 PAb) were compared with the IG4 MAb using Western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of 6 L. intracellularis isolates, Bilophila wadsworthia and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and using immunohistochemistry of known positive and negative histologic samples and pure cultures of L. intracellularis, B. wadsworthia, B. hyodysenteriae, Salmonella choleraesuis, S. typhimurium, and Escherichia coli K88. Immunogold staining using 2001 MAb was performed to show the specificity of the antibody against an L. intracellularis surface protein. Western blot analysis showed that the 2001 MAb targeted an OMP of 77 kD, which made it different from the IG4 MAb that targeted an 18-kD OMP. The immunogold stain demonstrated the specificity of the 2001 MAb to a surface protein of L. intracellularis. The polyclonal antibody (1999 PAb) targeted 5 OMPs (77, 69, 54, 42, and 36 kD).

Both the 2001 MAb and 1999 PAb reacted with a pure culture of L. intracellularis but not with any other common enteric pathogens. These two new antibodies will be useful for immunodiagnosis of L. intracellularis.",M2
14516718,"Effect of gilt seropositivity to <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis (LI) on their offspring's seropositivity to LI and on diarrhoea after a pure-culture challenge.This study was done in a large Croatian pig-production unit. Blood samples from late-pregnancy gilts were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence-antibody (IFA) serum assay for Lawsonia intracellularis (LI). Ten IFA-positive and 10 IFA-negative gilts were selected. The 2-week-old piglets (97 from positive gilts, and 98 from negative gilts) were inoculated intragastrically with pure culture of LI. All pigs were tested until slaughter for seroprevalence of LI. Blood samples were collected at 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26 weeks of age. Seropositivity in offspring of IFA-negative gilts was highest at age 5 weeks (84%) and declined gradually from week 11 to only 10% at week 26. At the same time, the offspring of IFA-positive gilts showed lower and faster-decaying seroprevalence: only 32% at week 5 and 0% starting at week 17. There was no difference in the pen-days of diarrhoea between the offspring of LI-seropositive and -seronegative gilts.",M2
12921724,"Comparison of diagnostic techniques for porcine proliferative enteropathy (<e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection).In studying the post-mortem diagnosis of porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) a  double-blind  study was performed on 77 apparently healthy  finisher  pigs at the time of slaughter, to compare the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with those of (1) an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), (2) examination for gross proliferative lesions at slaughter, (3) histopathological study of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), and (4) Warthin-Starry (WS) silver staining for intracellular bacteria. The IFA, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 97% (positive  likelihood ratio =30) and an agreement of 82% with PCR, is suggested as an alternative to the PCR in the post-mortem diagnosis of PPE. Histopathological examination was shown to be of little use as a principal diagnostic method, although it appeared to be effective in diagnosing infection by Lawsonia intracellularis in cases with proliferative-type lesions (positive likelihood ratio=29.6). Finally, the values obtained from an examination of gross lesions (k=0.075; positive likelihood ratio of 1.3) and WS staining (k=0.42; positive likelihood ratio of 5.3) demonstrated the lack of validity of these tests for the diagnosis of L. intracellularis infection.",M2
12910769,"<e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in wild mammals in the Slovak Carpathians.Feces of wild mammals were collected in the Bukovské Vrchy Hills (north-eastern Slovakia) in January and February 2002. The feces were examined for Lawsonia intracellularis by means of nested polymerase chain reaction. A total of 194 samples of feces from red deer (Cervus elaphus), 46 samples from roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 31 samples from red fox (Vulpes vulpes), 23 samples from gray wolf (Canis lupus), and 12 samples from brown hare (Lepus europaeus) were examined. Lawsonia intracellularis was found in two samples from wolves, in two samples from foxes, and one sample from red deer. This is the first description of L. intracellularis in these three species.",M2
12889732,"Search for <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis and Bilophila wadsworthia in malabsorption-diseased chickens.Proliferative enteropathy is an important enteric disease caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. A wide range of host species can be infected by the same bacterium, yet the clinico-pathologic features among these hosts remains almost identical. The disease has been recognized regularly among ratites, but not in other avian families, such as galliforms, even though these suffer uncharacterized enteric conditions. Fresh ileum-colon contents were obtained from 228, 3- to 8-week-old chickens with enteric disease, kept at 14 large commercial farms in the southern USA. DNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with primers specific to eubacterial DNA, L. intracellularis, and Bilophila wadsworthia. All chicken samples were positive for eubacterial DNA, 29 chickens (13%) were positive for B. wadsworthia DNA, and none were positive for L. intracellularis DNA. Given the ubiquitous nature of L. intracellularis, we consider it likely that some avian families do not carry the necessary mechanism for L. intracellularis viability. Bilophila wadsworthia appears to be a consistent member of the colonic flora of some host animals. Neither bacterium appears to be associated with malabsorption syndromes in chickens.",M2
12824514,"Immunopathogenesis of experimentally induced proliferative enteropathy in pigs.To characterize the immune response associated with <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis infection, twenty-eight, 7-week-old pigs were dosed orally with a pure culture of L. intracellularis. Animals were killed 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days postinfection. Light microscopic studies were undertaken to immunophenotype the immunologic response using specific antibodies to T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4, and CD8), B cells, major histocompatibility complex class II, cadherin, and macrophages over the course of time. The results indicate that there is a direct association between the presence of L. intracellularis and reduced T-cell and B-cell numbers. For the first time, this provides evidence of the presence of an immunosuppressive mechanism operating in this disease. Furthermore, macrophage marker studies indicated that macrophages may play a more complex and significant role in the disease process than has been previously reported, with activated macrophages accumulating in infected hyperplastic crypts.",M2
12737043,"Seroprevalence of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis in large pig production units.In 11 'farrow-to-finish' outdoor or indoor production units, blood samples from late pregnant gilts were tested by indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) serum assay for Lawsonia intracellularis. The offspring of positively tested gilts were tested at 2, 7, 12, 17, 22 and 27 weeks of age for seroprevalence of Lawsonia intracellularis. All offspring of IFA positive gilts were seronegative at 2 and 7 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age 81.0% of indoor and 51.0% of outdoor pigs were tested positive. While at 17 weeks of age 82.5% of indoor-raised pigs showed seropositivity, in outdoor units the seropositivity declined to 31.3%. At weeks 22 and 27 indoor-raised pigs still showed marked seropositivity (17.7% and 11.5%) but their outdoor-raised counterparts revealed declining values (7.4% and 0%).",M2
12735349,"The use of a mimic to detect polymerase chain reaction-inhibitory factors in feces examined for the presence of <e>Lawsonia</e> intracellularis.Lawsonia intracellularis is an intracellular organism that causes proliferative enteritis in pigs. This bacterium is difficult to culture, and antemortem demonstration of the microbe is therefore often performed on fecal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction is sensitive and specific, but inhibitory factors in feces might cause false-negative results. This article describes the construction and use of an internal standard, a mimic. The mimic is amplified by the same primers as those used for L. intracellularis DNA and thus could indicate false-negative results in clinical samples. The amplicon was clearly visible when as few as 10 mimic molecules were added per amplification reaction and when no inhibitors werepresent. When fecal samples were spiked with the mimic, the detection limit was 10(2) molecules per PCR. Sixty clinical samples, 20 from wild boars, 20 from growing pigs with diarrhea, and 20 from pigs without diarrhea, were prepared by a boiling procedure and subjected to PCR together with 10(3) mimic molecules. Nine samples were positive, of which 7 originated from pigs with diarrhea and 2 from pigs without diarrhea. In 14 samples from wild boars, in 8 samples from pigs without diarrhea, and in 3 samples from pigs with diarrhea, neither the mimic nor the target DNA was visible. This indicated the presence of inhibitors in these samples. It is concluded that the mimic can be used as an internal control in the diagnosis of L. intracellularis to indicate inhibition of PCR.",M2
