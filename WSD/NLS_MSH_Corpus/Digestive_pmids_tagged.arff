20385249,"Metallothioneins and trace elements in <e>digestive</e> gland, gills, kidney and gonads of Octopus vulgaris.Metallothionein-like proteins (MT) and V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, As and Cd were determined in digestive gland, gills, kidney and gonads of Octopus vulgaris, from the Portuguese coast. To our knowledge these are the first data on MT in octopus. High concentrations (microgg(-1), dry mass) of Zn (48050) and Cd (555) were found in digestive gland, and MT reached levels one order of magnitude above the ones registered in wild bivalves. Significantly higher levels of MT in digestive gland and gills of specimens from A and B were in line with elevated Cd concentrations. Principal component analyses (PCA) point to MT-Cd and MT-Cr associations in digestive gland and gills. Despite the high levels of Zn in specimens from B, association with Zn was not obtained. Due to the affinity of MT to various elements, it should not be excluded the possibility of Cd replacing Zn in Zn-MT. Kidney presented higher levels of Cd, Co, Ni and As than gills and gonads, and in the case of As surpassing the levels in digestive gland, but PCA showed no relation with MT. Likewise the MT levels in gonads had no correspondence to the metal concentration variation.",M1
20385075,"Effectiveness of a  cold dessert , with or without the addition of a mixture of <e>digestive</e> herbs, in subjects with  functional dyspepsia . Functional dyspepsia  represents a clinical condition of pain and/or persistent or recurrent discomfort that concerns a large portion of the healthy population. It has already been shown that some herbs (Melissa Officinalis, Cynara scolymus) can have favorable effects on digestion. The principal aim of this study is to determine whether the ingestion of  Gran Soleil  dessert, with or without herbs, after meals can be beneficial to health in subjects suffering from functional dyspepsia. For this purpose, thirty subjects with functional dyspepsia were enrolled and were asked to consume  Gran Soleil  with or without herbs; these subjects reported the course of their symptoms on VAS scale, during the basal period and after the ingestion  Gran Soleil  with and without herbs. It has been shown that the ingestion of  Gran Soleil  without herbs can induce a reduction both in the number of events connected to a dyspeptic syndrome and in their intensity; moreover the assumption of  Gran Soleil  with the addition of herbs helped to intensify this effect.",M1
20380005,"Expression of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 in rodent <e>digestive</e> system.AIM: To observe the regional distributions and morphological features of nesfatin-1/nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) immunoreactive (IR) cells in the rodent digestive system. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of seven organs (pancreas, stomach, duodenum, esophagus, liver, small intestine and colon) dissected from sprague-dawley (SD) rats and imprinting-control-region (ICR) mice were prepared. The regional distributions of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were observed by immunohistochemical staining. The morphological features of the nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Fresh tissues of the seven organs were prepared for Western blotting to analyze the relative protein levels of NUCB2 in each organ. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining showed that the nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were localized in the central part of the pancreatic islets, the lower third and middle portion of the gastric mucosal gland, and the submucous layer of the duodenum in SD rats and ICR mice. HE staining revealed that the morphological features of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were mainly islet cells in the pancreas, endocrine cells in the stomach, and Brunner's glands in the duodenum. Western blotting revealed that NUCB2 protein expression was higher in the pancreas, stomach and duodenum than in the esophagus, liver, small intestine and colon (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells are expressed in the pancreas, stomach and duodenum in rodents. These cells may play an important role in the physiological regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, gastrointestinal function and nutrient absorption.",M1
20308398,"Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, in situ apoptosis, and ultrastructure characterization of the <e>digestive</e> and lymphoid organs of new type gosling viral enteritis virus experimentally infected gosling.Here, for the first time, to colocalize new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) with histological lesions and in situ apoptosis in the digestive organs (esophagus, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, cecum, rectum, liver, and pancreas) and the lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland, and spleen) of experimentally infected goslings, portions of tissues were collected at sequential infection time points and examined by histopathology for histological lesions, immunohistochemical staining for viral antigens, ultrastructural observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) for virus particles and apoptotic cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay for in situ apoptosis. The hyperemia, hemorrhage, infiltration of lymphocytes, progressive lymphoid depletion, apoptosis, and necrosis were readily observed in the lymphoid organs and intestine tract by histopathological examination. The NGVEV particles and viral antigens widely appeared in the small intestine and bursa of Fabricius as early as 2 d postinfection (PI) by TEM and immunohistochemical staining, and the presence and quantity of it reached a maximum during 6 to 12 d PI. The principal sites for NGVEV were endothelial cells, epithelia, mucosal cells, glandular cells, fibrocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. A series of apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic body were observed by TEM, and the number of apoptotic cells was largely increased from 4 d PI and peaked at 9 d PI by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling analysis. The histological organ lesions and apoptosis in vivo were generally associated with sites of NGVEV localization, which can be regarded as the cause of death. This work may shed light on the pathogenesis of new type gosling viral enteritis and put new insight into the pathogenesis of goose adenovirus.",M1
20201646,"Impact of UV-B radiation on the <e>digestive</e> enzymes and immune system of larvae of Indian major carp Catla catla.PURPOSE: Ultraviolet radiation is a potent threat to the aquatic animals. Exposure to such stressor affects metabolic and immunological processes. The present investigation aims to study the effect of UV-B radiation on digestive enzymes and immunity of larvae of Catla catla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Larvae were exposed to ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation (145 microW/cm(2)) for three different exposure times of 5, 10 and 15 min on every other day. After 55 days, important digestive enzymes were assayed. For immunological study, lysozyme, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels were measured. Then the fish were kept for one month without radiation and lysozyme level was measured. RESULTS: Protein concentration varied directly with the duration of exposure and was highest among fish that had received the 15 min UV-B irradiation. Significantly higher amylase, protease, trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were found in 5 min exposed fish compared to others. Lysozyme level was significantly higher in control group compared to the UV-B treated fish. The lysozyme level decreased with the increasing duration of UV-B radiation. When fish were kept without UV-B radiation for one month, lysozyme level was brought to the normal level in all treatments, except 15 min exposed fish. The GOT and GPT levels were significantly higher in the 15 min exposed group than others. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of UV-B radiation on the digestive physiology and immune system of catla have been clearly observed in the present study. The decreased enzyme activities in UV-B radiated fish results into improper digestion and poor growth.",M1
20162372,"Seasonal variation of pollution biomarkers to assess the impact on the health status of juvenile Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas exposed in situ.BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: In this study, a suite of sublethal stress biomarkers were analyzed in juveniles of the sentinel species, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, with a view to using them as pollution monitoring tools. The aim of this work was (1) to study baseline seasonal variations of biomarkers in different body compartments of C. gigas in the reference site and, after selecting biomarkers presenting no seasonal variations, (2) to compare responses of these biomarkers between contaminated and reference sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Juvenile oysters were transplanted from Bouin (France), a reference site, to three different sites in Marennes-Oleron Bay (France), located in another water body and next to different contamination sources. Animals were exposed in situ for 3 months in summer, autumn, and winter. The following biomarkers were measured: superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in gills and <e>digestive</e> gland and lysozyme and phenoloxidase (PO) in plasma. RESULTS: No significant seasonal variations for SOD in gills and digestive gland, GPx in gills, and PO in plasma were observed in the reference site. Significant differences in enzyme activity were observed between contaminated and reference sites for SOD in gills and digestive gland and PO in plasma, depending on the body compartment, the season, and/or the site. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these data suggest the potential application of these biomarkers in C. gigas to provide ecologically relevant information and, therefore, to be used as biomarkers in coastal pollution monitoring.",M1

20116440,"<e>Digestive</e> physiology and hindgut bacterial community of the young rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus): effects of age and short-term intake limitation.The digestive response of the young rabbit to a short-term (28-53 days) limitation of its voluntary intake (25%) was analysed according to age and in relation to the incidence of digestive troubles. Several physico-chemical parameters of the caecal biotope were studied in relation to the caecal bacterial community structure and diversity, and with other physiological criteria (stomach pH, ileum morphometry and maltase activity). The morphometry of the ileum was significantly affected by age (36 vs. 52 days) but not by the intake level, while the relative maltase activity remained unchanged. In the stomach, the pH of antrum and fundus increased by approximately 1/3 between 36 and 52 days, and was 31% (P=0.003) and 79% (P&lt;0.001) higher for restricted compared to ad libitum rabbits respectively. However the caecal pH remained unchanged (mean: 5.83). The caecal redox potential increased slightly, by 8 units (P=0.02), when intake was limited, but did not change between 36 and 52 days. The caecal bacterial diversity increased with age (4.8 vs. 5.2, P=0.014) while bacterial structure was modified. Limiting the intake for 16 days did not modify the structure or the diversity of the bacterial community.",M1
20045204,"Effects of Alexandrium minutum exposure upon physiological and hematological variables of diploid and triploid oysters, Crassostrea gigas.The effects of an artificial bloom of the toxin-producing dinoflagellate, Alexandrium minutum, upon physiological parameters of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were assessed. Diploid and triploid oysters were exposed to cultured A. minutum and compared to control diploid and triploid oysters fed T. Isochrysis. Experiments were repeated twice, in April and mid-May 2007, to investigate effects of maturation stage on oyster responses to A. minutum exposure. Oyster maturation stage, Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) accumulation, as well as several <e>digestive</e> gland and hematological variables, were assessed at the ends of the exposures. In both experiments, triploid oysters accumulated more PSTs (approximately twice) than diploid oysters. Significant differences, in terms of phenoloxidase activity (PO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hemocytes, were observed between A. minutum-exposed and non-exposed oysters. PO in hemocytes was lower in oysters exposed to A. minutum than in control oysters in an early maturation stage (diploids and triploids in April experiment and triploids in May experiment), but this contrast was reversed in ripe oysters (diploids in May experiment). In the April experiment, granulocytes of oysters exposed to A. minutum produced more ROS than those of control oysters; however, in the May experiment, ROS production of granulocytes was lower in A. minutum-exposed oysters. Moreover, significant decreases in free fatty acid, monoacylglycerol, and diacylglycerol contents in digestive glands of oysters exposed to A. minutum were observed. Concurrently, the ratio of reserve lipids (triacylglycerol, ether glycerides and sterol esters) to structural lipids (sterols) decreased upon A. minutum exposure in both experiments. Also, several physiological responses to A. minutum exposure appeared to be modulated by maturation stage as well as ploidy of the oysters.",M1
20038716,"A Drosophila model of Menkes disease reveals a role for DmATP7 in copper absorption and neurodevelopment.Human Menkes disease is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder of copper metabolism that is caused by mutations in the ATP7A copper-transporting gene. In the present study, we attempted to construct a Drosophila model of Menkes disease by RNA interference (RNAi)-induced silencing of DmATP7, the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian ATP7A, in the <e>digestive</e> tract. Here, we show that a lowered level of DmATP7 mRNA in the digestive tract results in a reduced copper content in the head and the rest of the body of surviving adults, presumably owing to copper entrapment in the gut. Similar to Menkes patients, a majority of flies exhibit an impaired neurological development during metamorphosis and die before eclosion. In addition, we show that survival to the adult stage is highly dependent on the copper content of the food and that overexpression of the copper homeostasis gene, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1), enhances survival to the adulthood stage. Taken together, these results highlight the role of DmATP7-mediated copper uptake in the neurodevelopment of Drosophila melanogaster and provide a framework for the analysis of potential gene interactions influencing Menkes disease.",M1
19995575,"Identification and characterization of multiple beta-glucan binding proteins in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.The present study reports on the characterization of two cDNAs coding beta-glucan binding proteins (betaGBPs), designated as Cg-betaGBP-1 and Cg-betaGBP-2, from the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Cg-betaGBP-1 consists of 555 amino acid residues and possesses two possible integrin recognition sites. The other protein, Cg-betaGBP-2, is composed of 447 amino acid residues without integrin recognition sites. Domain structures of both Cg-betaGBPs are similar to other invertebrate betaGBPs, but phylogenetic positions and major expression tissues for these proteins are different. Cg-betaGBP-1 is expressed in circulatory hemocytes and Cg-betaGBP-2 in <e>digestive</e> glands. Functional assays using recombinant proteins revealed that Cg-betaGBP-2 enhanced the phenoloxidase (PO) activity of hemocyte suspensions under the presence of laminarin, but Cg-betaGBP-1 did not show this enhancement. It is suggested that Cg-betaGBPs in the Pacific oyster have evolved to obtain different immunological functions. Cg-betaGBP-1 possibly evolved for hemocyte-related functions through integrin, and Cg-betaGBP-2 for the PO activation system.",M1
19948865,"Fates of acid-resistant and non-acid-resistant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains in ruminant <e>digestive</e> contents in the absence and presence of probiotics.Healthy ruminants are the main reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). During their transit through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract, STEC encounters a number of acidic environments. As all STEC strains are not equally resistant to acidic conditions, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether acid resistance confers an ecological advantage to STEC strains in ruminant digestive contents and whether acid resistance mechanisms are induced in the rumen compartment. We found that acid-resistant STEC survived at higher rates during prolonged incubation in rumen fluid than acid-sensitive STEC and that they resisted the highly acidic conditions of the abomasum fluid, whereas acid-sensitive strains were killed. However, transit through the rumen contents allowed acid-sensitive strains to survive in the abomasum fluid at levels similar to those of acid-resistant STEC. The acid resistance status of the strains had little influence on STEC growth in jejunal and cecal contents. Supplementation with the probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 or Lactobacillus acidophilus BT-1386 led to killing of all of the strains tested during prolonged incubation in the rumen contents, but it did not have any influence in the other digestive compartments. In addition, S. cerevisiae did not limit the induction of acid resistance in the rumen fluid. Our results indicate that the rumen compartment could be a relevant target for intervention strategies that could both limit STEC survival and eliminate induction of acid resistance mechanisms in order to decrease the number of viable STEC cells reaching the hindgut and thus STEC shedding and food contamination.",M1
19929171,"Histopathology and ultrastructure features of the midgut of adult females of the tick Amblyomma cajennense Fabricius, 1787 (Acari: Ixodidae) in various feeding stages and submitted to three infestations.The <e>digestive</e> tube of the tick Amblyomma cajennense is responsible for the digestion during feeding on the host. This study analyzed the midgut of unfed, partially engorged, and fully engorged fed females as well as three infestations in rabbits. In A. cajennense, the digestive tube is long and from the midgut, two pairs of diverticula ramify and lead to a blind end. In some midgut regions were observed for the first time in ticks, structures termed here  nodules.  The midgut of unfed females possesses a pseudostratified epithelium composed of digestive and generative cells. In partially engorged and engorged females at 1st infestation and partially engorged at 2nd infestation, the epithelium becomes stratified. In partially engorged females at 2nd infestation, the epithelium exhibits a third cell type: secretory cell. So the intestinal epithelium undergoes several changes during the feeding process in ticks at subsequent infestations. As infestations progress in the same host, the latter becomes more resistant and female ticks require more days to complete their feeding cycle, which in A. cajennense is 25 days.",M1
19924482,"Microbiomic comparison of the intestine of the earthworm Eisenia fetida fed ergovaline.Tall fescue toxicosis and ergot alkaloids cost U.S. livestock producers approximately one billion dollars in annual livestock production loss annually. Ergovaline (EV) is the tall fescue alkaloid primarily responsible for clinical disease in livestock. Since native ruminal microorganisms have not been attributed to the detoxification of EV, finding detoxifying microbes from other environments is desirable. One possible source for potential microorganisms that can degrade EV is the anaerobic gut of the earthworm, Eisenia fetida. This study describes a comparative microbial analysis of earthworm <e>digestive</e> tracts receiving 10,000 ppb EV (E+ treatment) when compared with a control treatment with no detectable amounts of EV (E- treatment). An HPLC assay determined a 25% loss of EV from the E+ treatment was microbial in nature. A community microbiomic approach of constructing 16S-rRNA gene clone libraries was used to compare the microbes affected by the two treatments. RDPII tools such as Classifier and Libcompare were used in the analysis of 16S sequences. DOTUR analysis was used to examine the richness and diversity of the two microbial populations in these experiments. The results indicate there are few significant differences in the microbial community structure between the two microbiomes.",M1
19921366,"Interactions between morphine and nitric oxide in various organs.Nitric oxide (NO) plays obligatory roles as an important intercellular messenger in the control of physiological functions and it also participates in pathophysiological interventions. This labile, gaseous molecule is also involved in mechanisms underlying the beneficial and untoward actions of therapeutic agents. Endogenous NO is formed by endothelial and neurogenic NO synthases that are constitutively present mainly in the endothelium and nervous system, respectively, and is induced by lipopolysaccharides or cytokines mainly in mitochondria, glial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. NO modulates the effects of morphine on processes involving the central nervous system, such as learning, memory, convulsion, thermoregulation, and penile erection. This molecule is also involved in the modification of morphine actions on the cardiovascular, <e>digestive</e>, and respiratory systems. Morphine regulates NO bioavailability in various organs. NO formed by inducible NO synthase participates in some morphine actions in the immune system. Information concerning interactions between NO and morphine and other opioids in a variety of organs and tissues is quite useful in establishing new strategies for minimizing the noxious and unintended reactions that are frequently encountered during analgesic therapy.",M1
19916942,"Stress-induced changes in accumulation of sorbitol and in activities of concomitant enzymes in <e>digestive</e> gland of freshwater snail.Sorbitol content was determined in the digestive gland of freshwater snail (Viviparus viviparus L.) in different seasons and in a short-term experiment on the water temperature decrease and on intoxication with cadmium chloride. In the model experiments, changes in activities of enzymes involved in sorbitol metabolism (acid phosphatases, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and aldose reductase) were also studied. Sorbitol was accumulated by the snail in response to the temperature decrease (as a cryoprotectant) and under conditions of acute intoxication (as a probable metabolic regulator or a nonspecific protective factor). However, the mechanisms of this accumulation are different: on cold adaptation sorbitol is produced as a result of reduction of glucose under the influence of aldose reductase, and on intoxication sorbitol is mainly produced from fructose under the influence of sorbitol dehydrogenase. Pathways of the sorbitol accumulation and its re-involvement into metabolism are not always the same, and this might be a mechanism for regulation of carbohydrate metabolism (at the initial stage of glycolysis) on adaptation to unfavorable factors of the environment.",M1
19913913,"Biomarkers and heavy metal bioaccumulation in mussels transplanted to coastal waters of the Beagle Channel.Mussels coming from a mussel farm at Brown Bay (Beagle Channel) were transplanted to four sites inside Ushuaia Bay for 2 and 4 weeks.

19912454,"A comparative molecular study of the presence of  Candidatus arthromitus  in the <e>digestive</e> system of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), healthy and affected with rainbow trout gastroenteritis.Observations were made using histopathological techniques in conjunction with a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for the specific detection of  Candidatus arthromitus  on DNA extracted from wax-embedded tissues and fresh digestive contents of rainbow trout. Samples positive for  Candidatus arthromitus  DNA included fish with rainbow trout gastroenteritis (RTGE), clinically normal cohabiting fish, and apparently healthy controls from RTGE positive and RTGE negative sites. The results obtained from the PCR were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.  Candidatus arthromitus  DNA was found in distal intestine as well as in sections of pyloric caeca, suggesting that both these locations are appropriate for molecular detection of  Candidatus arthromitus  DNA in trout. Furthermore, rainbow trout fry distal intestinal samples from two different hatcheries where RTGE had not been reported were also positive. Differences in  Candidatus arthromitus  DNA detection between paraffin wax-embedded and fresh digestive content samples from the same fish suggested that it may be predominantly epithelium-associated in healthy trout. Parallel histopathological observations indicated that pyloric caeca are the preferred site for visualizing segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) in trout with RTGE. The results of this study showed that the presence of SFB was not invariably associated with clinical disease and that more information is required to understand the role of these organisms.",M1
19895899,"Prospecting for cellulolytic activity in insect <e>digestive</e> fluids.Efficient cellulolytic enzymes are needed to degrade recalcitrant plant biomass during ethanol purification and make lignocellulosic biofuels a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. Despite the large number of insect species that feed on lignocellulosic material, limited availability of quantitative studies comparing cellulase activity among insect taxa constrains identification of candidate species for more targeted identification of effective cellulolytic systems. We describe quantitative determinations of the cellulolytic activity in gut or head-derived fluids from 68 phytophagous or xylophagous insect species belonging to eight different taxonomic orders. Enzymatic activity was determined for two different substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), approximating endo-beta-1,4-glucanase and complete cellulolytic activity, respectively. Highest CMC gut fluid activities were found in Dictyoptera, Coleoptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera, while highest MCC gut fluid activities were found in Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera. In most cases, gut fluid activities were greater with CMC compared to MCC substrate, except in Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. In contrast, cellulolytic activity levels in most head fluids were greater on the MCC substrate. Our data suggests that a phylogenetic relationship may exist for the origin of cellulolytic enzymes in insects, and that cellulase activity levels correlate with taxonomic classification, probably reflecting differences in plant host or feeding strategies.",M1

Specifically, we follow the expression of oligopeptide transporter protein PepT1 in the intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were fed exogenously one of four diets: three formulated (lysyl-glycine dipeptide supplemented diet - PP, free lysine and glycine supplemented diet - AA, control diet with no lysine - CON) or commercial starter (Aller Futura - AF). Fish increased mean body weight 8 fold with PP- and AA-supplemented diets resulting in significantly higher weight gain than fish fed CON. Statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in relative PepT1 expression of fish fed experimental diets. Immunohistochemical staining with PepT1 antibody showed the presence of the transporter protein in the brush border membrane of the proximal intestinal enterocytes of fish from all experimental groups. Leptin immunoreactivity occurred not only in the gastric glands but also in proximal intestine and pyloric caeca of fish fed PP, AA and AF diets. Leptin immunoreactivity was also observed in hepatocyte cytoplasm and pancreatic acinar cells. Gastrin/CCK immunoreactive cells were present in the proximal intestine and pyloric caeca.",M1
19852975,"Distribution and linkage of domoic acid (amnesic shellfish poisoning toxins) in subcellular fractions of the <e>digestive</e> gland of the scallop Pecten maximus.The king scallop Pecten maximus accumulates domoic acid, the main amnesic shellfish poisoning toxin, in the digestive gland for a long time. To try to find if the cause of this characteristic is the binding of the toxin to some cellular component, the subcellular distribution of domoic acid in the cells of the digestive gland was studied, by means of serial centrifugation, ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Domoic acid was found to be present mostly in soluble form in the cytosol, as more than 90% was found in the supernatant after a centrifugation of 1h at 45,000 x g, and passed a 10 kDa ultrafilter. The retention time of the peak with an absorption maximum of 242 nm--the one characteristic of domoic acid--observed in the SEC chromatograms of the scallop samples was found identical to be one of a reference solution of the toxin, indicating therefore, that domoic acid is free in the cytosol of the digestive gland of Pecten maximus. This finding turns the focus from binding to the lack of membrane transporters in this species of the scallop as the cause of the long retention time of domoic acid in this species.",M1
19850046,"Parasites of three commercially exploited bivalve mollusc species of the estuarine region of the Cachoeira river (Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil).This paper reports the parasites found in three commercially exploited bivalve molluscs (Mytella guyanensis, Anomalocardia brasiliana and Iphigenia brasiliana) of an estuarine region of Ilhéus, south of Bahia, Brazil (14 degrees 48'23''S; 39 degrees 02'47''W). Samples of 20 individuals of each species were collected fortnightly from August 2005 to August 2006. A total of 1480 individuals was collected and processed by standard histologic techniques; the histologic sections were stained with Harris haematoxylin and eosin and examined with light microscope. The water temperature in the study area varied from 24 to 30.5 degrees C and the salinity from 0 to 23ppt. Remarkable differences were found in the parasitic community between the three mollusc species involved in the study, which occupied different habitats in the estuarine region of the Cachoeira river. The following parasites were found: intracellular rickettsia-like colonies in <e>digestive</e> epithelia; intracellular gregarine Nematopsis sp. in gills, mantle, gonad, digestive gland and foot muscle; sporocysts of a Bucephalidae trematode in gonads, mantle, gills, digestive gland and foot; unidentified digenetic metacercariae in digestive gland and gonad; metacestodes of Tylocephalum sp. in connective tissue in the digestive gland and in gonad; and an unidentified metazoan in mantle and intestinal lumen. No significant temporal variation in the prevalence of any parasite was detected, which could be due to the narrow temperature range of the region and the absence of patterns of salinity and rainfall variation through the year. The infestation by sporocyst was the only pathological threat detected for the studied populations because of its potential for host castration. The low infection intensity and/or prevalence of the other parasites and the lack of obvious lesions suggest that there is no other serious pathological risk for the studied mollusc populations.",M1
19840868,"Exposure of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, to gold nanoparticles and the pro-oxidant menadione.Relatively little is known about how gold nanoparticles (GNP) might interact in vivo with marine organisms. Mytilus edulis was exposed (24h) to approximately 15 nm GNP, menadione and both compounds simultaneously (GNP/menadione). GNP was detected by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy mainly in <e>digestive</e> gland of samples exposed to GNP though not GNP/menadione, perhaps due to impaired feeding. Thioredoxin reductase activity and malondialdehyde levels were determined in all tissues. Thioredoxin reductase inhibition was detected only in digestive gland exposed to menadione whilst malondialdehyde levels did not vary in response to treatment in all tissues. GNP caused a decrease in the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio in digestive gland, but no difference was found in other tissues or for other treatments. One dimensional electrophoresis of proteins containing thiol groups was performed in all tissues and revealed a reduction in protein thiols for all treatments in digestive gland. Two dimensional electrophoresis of digestive gland extracts, from GNP and control groups, showed decreased levels of thiol proteins in response to GNP which we attribute to oxidation. Our results suggest that GNP causes a modest level of oxidative stress sufficient to oxidize thiols in glutathione and proteins but without causing lipid peroxidation or induction of thioredoxin reductase activity.",M1
19815068,"Sequence and function of lysosomal and <e>digestive</e> cathepsin D-like proteinases of Musca domestica midgut.Musca domestica larvae display in anterior and middle midgut contents, a proteolytic activity with pH optimum of 3.0-3.5 and kinetic properties like cathepsin D. Three cDNAs coding for preprocathepsin D-like proteinases (ppCAD 1, ppCAD 2, ppCAD 3) were cloned from a M. domestica midgut cDNA library. The coded protein sequences included the signal peptide, propeptide and mature enzyme that has all conserved catalytic and substrate binding residues found in bovine lysosomal cathepsin D. Nevertheless, ppCAD 2 and ppCAD 3 lack the characteristic proline loop and glycosylation sites. A comparison among the sequences of cathepsin D-like enzymes from some vertebrates and those found in M. domestica and in the genomes of Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum, and Bombyx mori showed that only flies have enzymes lacking the proline loop (as defined by the motif: DxPxPx(G/A)P), thus resembling vertebrate pepsin. ppCAD 3 should correspond to the digestive cathepsin D-like proteinase (CAD) found in enzyme assays because: (1) it seems to be the most expressed CAD, based on the frequency of ESTs found. (2) The mRNA for CAD 3 is expressed only in the anterior and proximal middle midgut. (3) Recombinant procathepsin D-like proteinase (pCAD 3), after auto-activation has a pH optimum of 2.5-3.0 that is close to the luminal pH of M. domestica midgut. (4) Immunoblots of proteins from different tissues revealed with anti-pCAD 3 serum were positive only in samples of anterior and middle midgut tissue and contents. (5) CAD 3 is localized with immunogold inside secretory vesicles and around microvilli in anterior and middle midgut cells. The data support the view that on adapting to deal with a bacteria-rich food in an acid midgut region, M. domestica digestive CAD resulted from the same archetypical gene as the intracellular cathepsin D, paralleling what happened with vertebrates. The lack of the proline loop may be somehow associated with the extracellular role of both pepsin and digestive CAD 3.",M1

We identified an aspartic proteinase (AP) digesting rice glutelin in the alimentary tract of S. zeamais. The mRNA encoding the AP (SAP1) was expressed in the larvae foregut and in the adult midgut. These results indicate that SAP1 is probably digestive enzyme of S. zeamais.",M1
19788926,"Activity of antioxidant enzymes and physiological responses in ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii, exposed to thermal and osmotic stress: effects on hemolymph and biochemical parameters.Changes in water temperature and salinity are responsible for a variety of physiological stress responses in aquatic organisms. Stress induced by these factors was recently associated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which caused oxidative damage. In the present study, we investigated the time-related effects of changes in water temperature and salinity on mRNA expression and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the gills and <e>digestive</e> glands of the ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii. To investigate physiological responses, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), lysozyme activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), and alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) were measured in the hemolymph. Water temperature and salinity changes significantly increased antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression and activity in the digestive glands and gills in a time-dependent manner. H(2)O(2) concentrations increased significantly in the high-temperature and hyposalinity treatments. LPO, AspAT and AlaAT levels also increased significantly in a time-dependent manner, while lysozyme activity decreased. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes play important roles in reducing oxidative stress in ark shells exposed to changes in water temperature and salinity.",M1

The carbohydrate content was significantly altered in the <e>digestive</e> gland tissue of snails, decreasing after 20 days postinfection. At the end of the prepatent period, the carbohydrate content was reduced by 60% when compared to uninfected snails. The total protein was reduced by 80.01% and 76.42% in the hemolymph and digestive gland, respectively. The end products resulting from nitrogen degradation were also analyzed. The urea was significantly increased in both the hemolymph and digestive gland. In the former, the highest concentration was detected at day 10 postinfection and then decreased until the end of the prepatent period. In digestive glands from infected snails, urea was significantly higher than in uninfected ones after 20 days. The uric acid content was reduced by 94.72% in the hemolymph and 43.75% in digestive glands after 10 days postinfection. The ammonia was undetectable under the experimental conditions employed.",M1
19771560,"Control of the release of <e>digestive</e> enzymes in the larvae of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.There is a basal level of enzyme activity for trypsin, aminopeptidase, amylase, and lipase in the gut of unfed larval (L6) Spodoptera frugiperda. Trypsin activity does not decrease with non-feeding, possibly because of the low protein levels in plants along with high amino acid requirements for growth and storage (for later reproduction in adults). Therefore, trypsin must always be present so that only a minimal protein loss via egestion occurs. Larvae, however, adjust amylase activity to carbohydrate ingestion, and indeed amylase activity is five-fold higher in fed larvae compared to unfed larvae. Gut lipase activity is low, typical of insects with a high carbohydrate diet. A flat-sheet preparation of the ventriculus was used to measure the release of enzymes in response to specific nutrients and known brain/gut hormones in S. frugiperda. Sugars greatly increase (&gt;300%) amylase release, but starch has no effect. Proteins and amino acids have little or no effect on trypsin or aminopeptidase release. The control of enzyme release in response to food is likely mediated through neurohormones. Indeed, an allatostatin (Spofr-AS A5) inhibits amylase and trypsin, and allatotropin (Manse- AT) stimulates amylase and trypsin release. Spofr-AS A5 also inhibits ileum myoactivity and Manse-AT stimulates myoactivity. The epithelial secretion rate of amylase and trypsin was about 20% of the amount of enzyme present in the ventricular lumen, which, considering the efficient counter-current recycling of enzymes, suggests that the secretion rate is adequate to replace egested enzymes.",M1

The 3 patients presented with acute digestive disorders. Ultrasonography and CT scans showed digestive wall calcifications in addition to the classic appearance of primary oxalosis such as nephrocalcinosis or bone involvement. Primary hyperoxaluria is characterized by a calcium deposit in different tissues, mainly in kidneys. Digestive wall involvement has never been reported in the literature.

It really revolutionised endoscopy in allowing seeing behind the <e>digestive</e> lumen, in accessing the mediastinum and the pancreas, and in performing the first  NOTES  procedures. Endoscopists have usually mixed feelings towards endosonography: most of them consider EUS as the  Holy Grail  since it is one of the most complex diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures, but many users are still uncomfortable with some anatomical landmarks and with the choice of equipment. Echoendoscopes are indeed known to be costly and fragile, and quite versatile with the choice between different manufacturers, and between radial or linear (convex array) oriented instruments. This review aims at providing up-to-date information on the different types of echoendoscopes and processors and on normal endosonographic anatomy of the digestive tract, the mediastinum, the pancreas and the biliary tree.",M1
19741271,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase tissue distribution and cellular localization in mice: implications for its biological functions.Earlier studies have suggested that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has a wide tissue distribution in mammals. However, detailed information on its cellular localization and also the levels of expression in various tissues is still scarce. In the present study, we sought to determine the cellular localization of IDO and also to quantify the level of its expression in various mouse tissues by using the branched DNA signal amplification assay, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining. The highest levels of constitutive IDO expression were found to be selectively present in the caput of epididymis, except for its initial segment. IDO expression was also detected inside the luminal compartment and even in the stereocilia within this region. In the prostate, high levels of IDO were selectively expressed in the capsular cells. In addition, high levels of IDO expression were also selectively detected in certain types of cells in the placenta, spleen, thymus, lung, and <e>digestive</e> tract. Notably, the morphological features of most of the positively stained cells in these organs closely resembled those of antigen-presenting cells. Based on the tissue distribution and cellular localization characteristics of IDO, it is hypothesized that its expression may serve two main functions: one is to deplete tryptophan in an enclosed microenvironment (such as in the epididymal duct lumen) to prevent bacterial or viral infection, and the other is to produce bioactive tryptophan catabolites that would serve to suppress T-cell-mediated immune responses against self-antigens, fetal antigens, or allogeneic antigens, in different situations.",M1
19735012,"Influence of in ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates on <e>digestive</e> organs and pectoralis muscle mass in the duck.1. We hypothesise that administration of available glutamine and carbohydrates by in ovo injection may provide energy for small intestine and duck embryo activity, in turn alleviating energy lack, sparing the pectoralis muscle protein and increasing breast muscle mass. To test this hypothesis, 220 duck eggs at 21 d of incubation were chosen and assigned to two treatments. At 23 d of incubation, glutamine, digestible sucrose and maltose were injected into the amniotic fluid in the treatment group. 2. In ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates improved small intestine development, as reflected in the increase in weight and sucrase activity, though gizzard, proventriculus and liver weight were not affected by the in ovo injection. 3. Compared with control, pectoralis weight in treatment ducks was increased by 24% at 25 d of incubation and 15% at hatch and this advantage was sustained until 7 d posthatch. In ovo injection improved duck weight gain in the early days posthatch. 4. The results of the present study suggest that in ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates improves small intestine development and pectoralis mass, which is probably due to sparing of breast muscle protein.",M1
19731838,"Cadmium availability to freshwater mussel (Unio tumidus) in the presence of organic matter and UV radiation.The influence of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on cadmium availability to freshwater mussel (Unio tumidus) in the presence of organic matter was investigated. Water solutions containing 1000, 500, and 250 microg x L(-1) of cadmium and 28.8 mg x L(-1) of total organic carbon (TOC) were exposed to ecologically relevant biologically effective UV-A and UV-B irradiances of 1.73 x 10(-6) W x cm(-2) and 1.50 x 10(-5) W x cm(-2) respectively for 12 h. The availability of cadmium was measured directly as Cd concentration in gills, mantle, <e>digestive</e> gland and foot, and indirectly as its impact on the content of essential cations. The concentration of cadmium ions, soluble forms of cadmium, pH and conductivity in UV irradiated solutions were also measured. UV exposures resulted in a decrease of the TOC to 25.9 mg x L(-1), followed by a decrease in the total concentration of Cd soluble forms, increase in the concentration of cadmium bound to particulate matter, and increase in the concentration of free cadmium ions in comparison to non-irradiated mixtures. Mussels from mixtures exposed to UV accumulated more cadmium than specimens from non-irradiated mixtures. This was confirmed by the fluctuations of essential cations, i.e. decreases in the contents of Zn, Ca, Fe and increase of the Cu content. Na/K molar ratios in gills were negatively correlated with cadmium content, while a positive trend occurred in other organs. We suggest that in UV-exposed water more ionic forms of cadmium occur. On the other hand more cadmium is also bound to particulate matter. Our research indicate that the increase of cadmium accumulation in mussels grown in humic acid solutions exposed to UV were most probably related to the increase in the concentration of cadmium bound to particulate matter.",M1
19729065,"Midgut cysteine protease-inhibiting activity in Trichoplusia ni protects the peritrophic membrane from degradation by plant cysteine proteases.The action of plant cysteine proteases on the midgut peritrophic membrane (PM) of a polyphagous herbivorous lepidopteran, Trichoplusia ni, was studied. Proteins in PMs isolated from T. ni larvae were confirmed to be highly resistant to the serine proteinases trypsin and chymotrypsin, but were susceptible to degradation by plant cysteine proteases, which is consistent with the known molecular and biochemical characteristics of the T. ni PM proteins. However, the PM proteins were not degraded by plant cysteine proteases in larvae or in the presence of larval midgut fluid in vitro. With further biochemical analysis, cysteine protease-inhibiting activity was identified in the midgut fluid of T. ni larvae. The cysteine protease-inhibiting activity was heat resistant and active in the tested pH range from 6.0 to 10.0, but could be suppressed by thiol reducing reagents or reduced by treatment with catalase. In addition to T. ni, cysteine protease-inhibiting activity was also identified from two other polyphagous Lepidoptera species, Helicoverpa zea and Heliothis virescens. In conclusion, results from this study uncovered that herbivorous insects may counteract the attack of plant cysteine proteases on the PM by inhibiting the potentially insecticidal cysteine proteases from plants in the <e>digestive</e> tract. However, the biochemical identity of the cysteine protease-inhibiting activity in midgut fluid has yet to be identified.",M1
19716188,"Effect of cadmium in the clam Ruditapes decussatus assessed by proteomic analysis.Cadmium, an environmental stressor due to its toxicity, persistence and accumulation in biota, is widespread in the aquatic environment. Cadmium accumulation kinetics have revealed that Ruditapes decussatus has a high affinity to this metal. Proteomics is an effective tool to evaluate the toxic effects of contaminants. The aim of this study was to investigate the Cd effects in the gill and <e>digestive</e> gland of the sentinel species R. decussatus. Protein expression profiles (PEPs) in the clam tissues exposed to Cd (40 microg l(-1), 21 days) were compared to unexposed ones. Cd induces major changes in tissue-specific protein expression profiles in gill and digestive gland. This tissue dependent response results mainly from differences in Cd accumulation, protein inhibition and/or autophagy. An overall decrease of protein spots was detected in both treated tissues, being higher in gill. Some of the spots more drastically altered after pollutants exposure were excised and nine were identified by micro liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteins identified by homology search in databases included: three proteins (8-fold) up-regulated, one down-regulated, four suppressed and one induced. Cd induces major changes in proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance (muscle-type actin, adductor muscle actin and beta-tubulin), cell maintenance (Rab GDP) and metabolism (ALDH and MCAD, both identified by de novo sequencing) suggesting potential energetic change. They provide a valuable knowledge of Cd effects at biochemical and molecular levels in the gill and digestive gland of R. decussatus.",M1
19715697,"<e>Digestive</e> morphophysiology of Gryllodes sigillatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae).The evolution of the digestive system in the Order Orthoptera is disclosed from the study of the morphophysiology of the digestive process in its major taxa. This paper deals with a cricket representing the less known suborder Ensifera. Most amylase and trypsin activities occur in crop and caeca, respectively. Maltase and aminopeptidase are found in soluble and membrane-bound forms in caeca, with aminopeptidase also occurring in ventriculus. Amaranth was orally fed to Gryllodes sigillatus adults or injected into their haemolymph. The experiments were performed with starving and feeding insects with identical results. Following feeding of the dye the luminal side of the most anterior ventriculus (and in lesser amounts the midgut caeca) became heavily stained. In injected insects, the haemal side of the most posterior ventriculus was stained. This suggested that the anterior ventriculus is the main site of water absorption (the caeca is a secondary one), whereas the posterior ventriculus secretes water into the gut. Thus, a putative counter-current flux of fluid from posterior to anterior ventriculus may propel digestive enzyme recycling. This was confirmed by the finding that digestive enzymes are excreted at a low rate. The fine structure of midgut caeca and ventriculus cells revealed that they have morphological features that may be related to their involvement in secretion (movement from cell to lumen) and absorption (movement from lumen to cell) of fluids. Furthermore, morphological data showed that both merocrine and apocrine secretory mechanisms occur in midgut cells. The results showed that cricket digestion differs from that in grasshopper in having: (1) more membrane-bound digestive enzymes; (2) protein digestion slightly displaced toward the ventriculus; (3) midgut fluxes, and hence digestive enzyme recycling, in both starved and fed insects.",M1
19714664,"Postembryonic development of rectal pads in bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae).The morphology and development of the <e>digestive</e> tract of insects has been extensively studied, but little attention has been given to the development of the rectal pads. These organs are responsible for absorption of water and salts. In insects where they occur, there are usually six ovoid rectal pads located in the medial-anterior portion of the rectum. The rectal pad has three types of cells: principal, basal, and junctional. The arrangement of these three cell types delimits an intrapapillary lumen. The aim of the current study is to describe the development of the rectal pads during postembryonic development of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides and Melipona scutellaris. Specimens were analyzed at the following developmental stages: white-, pink-, brown-, and black-eyed pupae, and adult workers. The development of the rectal pad begins as a thickening of the epithelium in white-eyed pupae at 54 hr. At this stage, there is neither a basal cell layer nor intrapapillary lumen. The basal layers begin to form in the pink-eyed pupa and are completely formed at the end of the development of the brown-eyed pupa. In the brown-eyed pupal stage, the intrapapillary lumen is formed and the junctional cells are positioned and completely differentiated. Necrotic and apoptotic cell death were detected along with cell proliferation in the whole rectum during pupal development, suggesting that the development of the rectal pads involves cell proliferation, death, and differentiation. The rectal pads originate only from the ectoderm.",M1

Oxidative individual perturbations were assessed by measuring nonenzymatic (glutathione; GSH) and enzymatic (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; and glutathione-S-transferase, GST) antioxidants in digestive gland of the snails. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was also evaluated as a marker of cell damage. The results indicated that the copper ion was the most potent metal against this snail, followed by zinc and lead, for which the corresponding LD(50) values were 37.88, 261.72, and 652.55 microg/snail, respectively. The no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) values for Cu, Zn, and Pb were 10, 50, and 500 microg/snail, respectively, and the corresponding lowest-observed effect concentration (LOEC) values were 50, 100, and 1000 microg/snail. All trace metals resulted in a significant increase in the level of LPO, whereas a significant decline in the content of GSH was observed when compared with untreated controls. Treatment with both sublethal doses of the metals caused significant increase in CAT activity, except in the case of 40% LD(50) Zn and 80% LD(50) Cu, which exhibited no alteration in CAT when compared to control animals. GPx was significantly increased in snails exposed to 40% LD(50) Cu and Pb as well as 80% LD(50) Cu. However, an opposite effect was observed in snails exposed to 80% LD(50) Pb and in either 40 or 80% LD(50) of Zn-intoxicated animals. Treatment with Pb at two sublethal doses significantly increased GST activity, whereas treatment the animal with Cu caused significant inhibition in this enzyme. Snails exposed to 40% LD(50) Zn showed significant enhancement of GST, whereas snails exposed to 80% LD(50) showed significantly reduced GST activity. Biphasic responses were observed for CAT, GPx, and GST activities in snails exposed to Cu, Pb, and Zn, respectively. This study suggests that upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme activities, elevation of LPO, and the reduction in GSH content is related to oxidative stress in this species that could be useful as biomarkers for the evaluation of contaminated terrestrial ecosystems.",M1
19686865,"Profiles of fatty acids and 7-O-acyl okadaic acid esters in bivalves: can bacteria be involved in acyl esterification of okadaic acid?The presence of 7-O-acyl okadaic acid (OA) esters was studied by LC-MS in the <e>digestive</e> glands of blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) from Albufeira lagoon, located 20km south of Lisbon. The profile of free and total fatty acids (FA) was analysed using a similar LC separation with a reversed phase C8 column and mass spectrometry detection. In mussel the free FA profile was reflected in the FA esterified to OA, being palmitic acid for instance the most abundant in both cases. In cockle, 7-O-acyl esters with palmitic acid were almost absent and esters with a C16:0 isomer were dominant, followed by esters with C15:1 and C15:0. The cockle free FA profile was similar to mussel, and in accordance with literature findings in bivalves. After hydrolysis, a major difference in the FA profile occurred in both species, presenting a high percentage of a C16:0 isomer. The isomer found in general lipids and bound to OA seemed to be related, presenting similar relative retention times (RRT) to C16:0, differing from expected RRT of monomethyl-branched isomers (iso- or anteiso-). A tentative identification was made with the multimethyl-branched isoprenoid, 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic acid (TMTD). TMTD is a product of phytol degradation. This was also suspected when the proportion of this compound in relation to palmitic acid was reduced in vivo in mussels fed a chlorophyll-free diet. Extensive esterification of OA by, among others, phytol-degrading bacteria is discussed as a plausible hypothesis in cockle, but not in mussel, due to the relatively high specific proportion of odd-numbered and branched FA.",M1

The larval stages of all three trematodes damaged the snail digestive gland. Most notable histopathology included disrupted digestive gland tubules, lysed cells, compressed tubules, and edematous spaces between tubules. Considerable damage was done by rediae ingesting digestive cells. There was a detectable hemocytic response by H. trivolvis in response to the rediae and cercariae of Z. lunata. Histochemical studies on sectioned material stained with the Ayoub-Shklar method for keratin detected the presence of this protein in the rediae and cercariae of Z. lunata and R. ondatrae. The presence of keratin is probably related to its role in cercarial encystment.",M1
19651242,"Glutathione S-transferase as a biomarker in the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica after exposure to the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254.Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes involved in cellular detoxification that catalyze the attachment of electrophilic substrates to glutathione. Two classes of GSTs related to the rho and sigma classes of enzymes in Antarctic bivalves have been cloned from Laternula elliptica. The full-length cDNA of rho class GST (leGSTr) is 1530bp in length and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 672bp encoding 223 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of this gene have 41% and 40% identity to rho class GSTs from Ctenopharyngodon idella and Pleuronectes platessa, respectively. The sigma class GST (leGSTs) cDNA, however, is 1127bp in length and contains an ORF of 696bp encoding 231 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences share only 22% identity with sigma class GST from Xenopus laevis. The transcriptional expression of leGSTr, leGSTs, and leGSTp cloned in our previous study were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction in response to exposure to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture. The expressions of these three GST transcripts were rapidly upregulated, although they showed different expression levels and patterns within each isoform. Moreover, leGSTs was the most upregulated in the gill and <e>digestive</e> gland in response to PCB exposure. The recombinant GSTs were highly expressed in transformed Escherichia coli, and their kinetic properties were studied with various substrates. As a result, the three classes of GSTs were found to have diverse biological functions and were responsible for different enzymatic features.",M1

By means of differential centrifugation, ultrafiltration and extraction with methanol, it was found that most okadaic acid was stored in the cytosol. Notwithstanding only a small proportion of the total toxin was found to be in free form, being most of it bound to a soluble cellular compound with a molecular mass which ranged from 30 to 300 kDa. A series of fractionations of samples digested with a protease, a lipase, and amylase suggested that the component to which okadaic acid is bound is a high density lipoprotein.

19632237,"Reverse transcriptase activity in tissues of the soft shell clam Mya arenaria affected with haemic neoplasia.Since all retroviruses possess reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, reverse transcriptase activity has been the main supportive evidence of retroviral etiology of haemic neoplasia (HN) in soft shell clams, Mya arenaria. The objective of the present study was to search for a putative retrovirus in various tissues of diseased clams following quantification of RT activity (biochemical indicator of retroviral infection). The clams were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) for diagnosis of HN. RT activity was quantified by TaqMan-product enhanced reverse transcriptase (TM-PERT) assay in four different organs, gonad, gills, <e>digestive</e> gland, and mantle, at various stages of HN. The digestive gland, the organ with the highest RT activity, and haemocytes, the target cell of HN, were assessed by EM for presence of retroviruses. All organs were assessed by histology. The results of this study demonstrated that although all organs of healthy clams have some background RT activity, the activity observed in most of organs of diseased clams was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05). An association was observed between the degree of neoplastic cell infiltration and the level of RT activity. Digestive gland showed the highest and most consistent RT activity in both healthy and diseased clams. No evidence for the existence of a retrovirus like particle was found by positive staining EM. The presence of RT activity without indications of retroviral particles in digestive gland and haemocytes suggests a probable endogenous source of RT.",M1
19615449,"A comparative study on the influence of manganese on the bactericidal response of marine invertebrates.Manganese, Mn, is a naturally abundant metal in marine sediments. During hypoxic conditions the metal converts into a bioavailable state and can reach levels that have been shown immunotoxic to the crustacean Nephrops norvegicus. For this species it has previously been shown that exposure to 15 mg L(-1) of Mn decreased the number of circulating haemocytes while it for the echinoderm Asterias rubens increased the number of coelomocytes. Here, we compared if five days of exposure to the same concentration of Mn affects the bactericidal capacity of these two species and the mollusc Mytilus edulis when inoculated with the bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Viable counts of the bacteria were investigated at a time-course post-injection in the blood and the <e>digestive</e> glands of Mn-exposed and un-exposed (controls) animals. Accumulation of Mn was also analyzed in these tissues. When exposed to Mn the haemocyte numbers were significantly reduced in M. edulis and it was shown that the bactericidal capacity was impaired in the mussels as well as in N. norvegicus. This was most obvious in the digestive glands. These two species also showed the highest accumulation of the metal. In A. rubens the bactericidal capacity was not affected and the metal concentration was similar to the exposure concentration. After a recovery period of three days the concentration of Mn was significantly reduced in all three species. However, in M. edulis and N. norvegicus it was still double that of A. rubens which could explain the remaining bactericidal suppression observed in N. norvegicus. This study pointed out that exposure to such Mn-levels that are realistic to find in nature could have effects on the whole organism level, in terms of susceptibility to infections. The effect seemed associated to the accumulated concentration of Mn which differed on species level.",M1
19556594,"Larval development with transitory epidermis in Paranemertes peregrina and other hoplonemerteans.We describe development of the hoplonemertean Paranemertes peregrina from fertilization to juvenile, using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. We discovered that the uniformly ciliated lecithotrophic larva of this species has a transitory epidermis, which is gradually replaced by the definitive epidermis during the course of planktonic development. The approximately 90 large multiciliated cleavage-arrested cells of the transitory larval epidermis become separated from each other by intercalating cells of the definitive epidermis, then gradually diminish in size and disappear more or less simultaneously. Rudiments of all major adult structures-the gut, proboscis, cerebral ganglia, lateral nerve cords, and cerebral organs-are already present in 4-day-old larvae. Replacement of the epidermis is the only overt metamorphic transformation of larval tissue; larval structures otherwise prefigure the juvenile body, which is complete in about 10 days at 7-10 degrees C. Our findings on development of <e>digestive</e> system, nervous system, and proboscis differ in several ways from previous descriptions of hoplonemertean development. We report development with transitory epidermis in two other species, review evidence from the literature, and suggest that this developmental type is the rule for hoplonemerteans. The hoplonemertean planuliform larva is fundamentally different both from the pilidium larva of the sister group to the Hoplonemertea, the Pilidiophora, and from the hidden trochophore of palaeonemerteans. We discuss the possible function and homology of the larval epidermis in development of other nemerteans and spiralians in general.",M1

Laboratory reared 4th instar larvae were randomly selected; midgut and salivary gland were removed by dissection under a stereo microscope and glucosidase activities were assayed by Ferreira and Terra's procedures. The activities of alpha- and beta-glucosidase in the midgut and salivary gland were 0.009, 0.0063, 0.005 and 0.003 micromol/min/mg protein, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were determined to be 9 and 45 degrees C for the glucosidases measured, values which are in agreement with other reports, especially in lepidopteran insects, which give values between 8-12 and 20-50 degrees C. The enzyme activity increased with the addition of NaCl, MgCl(2) and CaCl(2) and decreased due to the use of different concentrations of KCl, Urea, EDTA, SDS and Urea both in midgut and the salivary glands. Control of pests by using resistant varieties is one of the most important practices that are dependent on inhibitors in plants. Hence, characterization of digestive enzymes, especially the effect of inhibitors on enzyme activity, could be useful, on the one hand for a better understanding of enzyme roles in the nutrition physiology of insects, and on the other hand to reach safe and useful controls of insect pests.",M1
19499886,"Development beyond the gastrula stage and <e>digestive</e> organogenesis in the apple-snail Pomacea canaliculata (Architaenioglossa, Ampullariidae).Development of Pomacea canaliculata from the gastrula stage until the first day after hatching is described. Trochophore embryos are developed after gastrulation, showing the prototroch as a crown of ciliated orange-brownish cells. However, no true veliger embryos are formed, since the prototroch does not fully develop into a velum. Afterward, the connection between the fore- and midgut is permeated and the midgut becomes full of the pink-reddish albumen, which is stored into a central archenteron's lake, from where it is accumulated into the large cells forming the midgut wall ( giant cells ). Electron microscopy of giant cells in late embryos showed that albumen is engulfed by large endocytic vesicles formed between the irregular microvilli at the top of these cells. By the end of intracapsular development, giant cells become gradually replaced by two new epithelial cell types which are similar to those found in the adult midgut gland: the pre-columnar and the pre-pyramidal cells. Pre-columnar cells have inconspicuous basal nuclei and are crowned by stereocilia, between which small endocytic vesicles are formed. Pre-pyramidal cells have large nuclei with 2-3 nucleoli and show a striking development of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The genesis of the three cell lineages (giant, pre-columnar and pre-pyramidal cells) is hypothetically attributed to epithelial streaks that occur at both sides of the midgut since early stages of development.",M1
19480343,"Increase in <e>digestive</e> organs of rats due to the ingestion of dietary fiber with similar solubility to that of common bean.The aim of the present work is to study the effect of dietary dietary fiber of similar solubility to that of the cooked common bean in the increase of the small intestine, liver, and pancreas of rats. Recently weaned male Wistar rats were fed ad libitum balanced diets containing cooked common bean (12.9% of dietary fiber plus resistant starch) or casein with 5.0% (control group), 10.0%, 12.5% or 15.0% of dietary fiber plus resistant starch added, with the same proportions of insoluble and soluble fibers and resistant starch found in bean (8:3:1) for 14 days. Weight gain and diet intake were smaller in the group fed the cooked bean diet. However, this group showed the highest increase in the studied organs. Rats that ingested the diet containing casein with 15.0% of dietary fiber added showed a growth of 21.4% in the pancreas. Rats fed other casein diets did not show significant differences (p &gt; 0.05). The diet containing the cooked common bean led to weight gain of all studied organs (50.0% in the pancreas, 25.0% in the liver and 33.4% in the small intestine) and an increase of 47.1% in the small intestine length. Therefore, dietary fiber plus resistant starch had a trophic effect on digestive organs, although they were not the only stimulation factor, because the cooked bean has other chemical components, like phytates and tannins, that probably contribute to that effect.",M1
19476481,"<e>Digestive</e> alpha-amylases of the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella--adaptation to alkaline environment and plant inhibitors.The digestive tract of lepidopteran insects is extremely alkaline. In the present work, molecular adaptation of amylolytic enzymes to this environment was investigated in the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella, an important stored-product pest. Three digestive alpha-amylases [Ephestia kuehniella alpha-amylase isoenzymes 1-3 (EkAmy1-3)] with an alkaline pH optimum were purified from larvae and biochemically characterized. These isoenzymes differ significantly in their sensitivity to alpha-amylase inhibitors of plant origin that are directed against herbivores as antifeedants. Such functional variability renders the amylolytic system less vulnerable to suppression by plant defensive molecules. Moreover, we found that expression of alpha-amylases is upregulated in larvae feeding on a diet enriched with an alpha-amylase inhibitor. The alpha-amylases are secreted into the larval midgut by an exocytotic mechanism, as revealed by immunogold microscopy. The cDNA sequence of EkAmy3 was determined, and a homology model of EkAmy3 was built in order to analyze the structural features responsible for adaptation to alkaline pH. First, the overall fold was found to be stabilized by remodeling of ion pairs. Second, molecular simulations supported by activity measurements showed that EkAmy3 does not bind a Cl(-), owing to an Arg-to-Gln mutation in a conserved binding site. The Cl(-)-binding residues are in contact with the catalytic residues, and this change might help to fine-tune the catalytic pK(a) values to an alkaline pH optimum. We conclude that lepidopteran alpha-amylases are evolutionarily adapted in terms of structure and expression dynamics for effective functioning in the digestive system.",M1
19464367,"Chromatographic and electrophoretic resolution of proteins and protein complexes from the larval midgut microvilli of Manduca sexta.The microvillar proteome of Manduca sexta larval midguts was analyzed by subjecting brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) to two different two-dimensional approaches: (i) Anion exchange chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE and (ii) Blue Native-PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE. The first technique was superior to conventional 2-D gel electrophoresis in resolving the most abundant proteins associated with the midgut microvilli. Twenty of them were successfully identified as <e>digestive</e> enzymes, binding targets of the insecticidal Cry1A toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and signal transduction proteins. A homolog of the chlorophyllide A binding protein from the silkworm and several aminopeptidases N represent the most abundant proteins associated with the BBMV. The second technique revealed protein oligomeric complexes associated with midgut microvilli in vivo. Two such complexes contained subunits of the vacuolar ATP synthase complex, and one was an oligomer of the chlorophyllide A binding protein. An additional complex consisted of homo- or hetero-tetramers of three different aminopeptidases N (APNs). As APNs are well-known binding partners of Cry1A toxins, their quaternary structure has implications for Bt toxin mode of action. Both techniques provide a useful complement to conventional 2-D gel electrophoresis in analyzing the complex proteome of the microvillar membrane fraction.",M1

The experimental conditions were found to raise secretory activities of the stomach, pancreas and liver, and to increase spectral indices of the GI electrical activity on the background of a higher than usual insular secretion and lowered gastrin secretion. The elevated GI electrical activities and changes in their ratios were a fallout of the increased gastric secretion and elevated intestines tone in fasting test-subjects and displayed a close similarity to the changes induced by caffeine stimulation, long-term bed rest or space flight.",M1
19454320,"Putative endogenous xylanase from brackish-water clam Corbicula japonica.Xylan digestion by Corbicula japonica was investigated according to the hypothesis that C. japonica can breakdown xylan as well as cellulose. C. japonica showed relatively high xylanase activity compared to other bivalve species. Molecular cloning of a xylanase gene was performed in order to determine whether C. japonica possesses an endogenous xylanase, and resulted in the isolation of cDNA with an ORF of 2523 bp corresponding to 840 amino acids (CjXyn10A). CjXyn10A has a Glycoside Hydrolase Family 10 (GHF10) catalytic domain, N-terminal family 4 carbohydrate binding domain and novel C-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Phylogenetic analysis implies that this gene has common evolutional origin with other GHF10 genes of animal origin. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization revealed that CjXyn10A is likely to be expressed in the secretory cells in the <e>digestive</e> gland, suggesting that this enzyme is produced in the same site as previously reported endogenous cellulases of C. japonica. These findings suggest that CjXyn10A is an endogenous xylanase gene of this species. The occurrence of an endogenous xylanase gene in addition to cellulase genes in C. japonica strongly supports our hypothesis that this species can decompose plant-derived structural polysaccharides.",M1
19450602,"Responses of midgut amylases of Helicoverpa armigera to feeding on various host plants.Midgut <e>digestive</e> amylases and proteinases of Helicoverpa armigera, a polyphagous and devastating insect pest of economic importance have been studied. We also identified the potential of a sorghum amylase inhibitor against H. armigera midgut amylase. Amylase activities were detected in all the larval instars, pupae, moths and eggs; early instars had lower amylase levels which steadily increased up to the sixth larval instar. Qualitative and quantitative differences in midgut amylases of H. armigera upon feeding on natural and artificial diets were evident. Natural diets were categorized as one or more members of legumes, vegetables, flowers and cereals belonging to different plant families. Amylase activity and isoform patterns varied depending on host plant and/or artificial diet. Artificial diet-fed H. armigera larvae had comparatively high amylase activity and several unique amylase isoforms. Correlation of amylase and proteinase activities of H. armigera with the protein and carbohydrate content of various diets suggested that H. armigera regulates the levels of these digestive enzymes in response to macromolecular composition of the diet. These adjustments in the digestive enzymes of H. armigera may be to obtain better nourishment from the diet and avoid toxicity due to nutritional imbalance. H. armigera, a generalist feeder experiences a great degree of nutritional heterogeneity in its diet. An investigation of the differences in enzyme levels in response to macronutrient balance and imbalance highlight their importance in insect nutrition.",M1
19446649,"Enzymatic properties and the primary structure of a beta-1,3-glucanase from the <e>digestive</e> fluid of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai.A beta-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) with a molecular mass of 33 kDa was isolated from the digestive fluid of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatography. This enzyme, named HdLam33 in the present study, degraded laminarin and laminarioligosaccharides to laminaribiose and glucose with the optimal temperature and pH at 50 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. HdLam33 possessed transglycosylation activity, a characteristic property of glucan hydrolases that split glycoside linkage with a retaining manner. By the transglycosylation reaction of HdLam33, the laminaribiose unit in the non-reducing terminus of laminaritriose (donor substrate) was transferred to a free laminaribiose (acceptor substrate) resulting to laminaritetraose and glucose. The resulting laminaritetraose was subsequently hydrolyzed by HdLam33 into 2 mol of glucose and 1 mol of laminaribiose. The primary structure of HdLam33 was analyzed by the cDNA method. The deduced amino-acid sequence of 329 residues corresponding to the catalytic domain of HdLam33 showed 56-61% amino-acid identity with those of other molluscan beta-1,3-glucanases which have been identified as glycoside hydrolase family 16 enzymes.",M1
19446566,"CmCatD, a cathepsin D-like protease has a potential role in insect defense against a phytocystatin.When fed on a diet containing a proteinaceous cysteine protease inhibitor from soybean (scN), cowpea bruchid larvae enhance their overall <e>digestive</e> capacity to counter the inhibitory effect. Elevated proteolytic activity is attributed not only to the major digestive cysteine proteases (CmCPs), but also to aspartic proteases, a minor midgut protease component. In this study, we isolated a CmCatD cDNA from cowpea bruchid midgut that shares substantial sequence similarity with cathepsin D-like aspartic proteases of other organisms. Its transcript profile was developmentally regulated and subject to alteration by dietary scN. CmCatD transcripts were more abundant in scN-fed 3rd and 4th instar midguts than in control. The bacterially expressed recombinant CmCatD proprotein was capable of autoprocessing under acidic conditions, and mature CmCatD also exhibited pH-dependent proteolytic activity which was inhibited specifically by pepstatin A, indicative of its aspartic protease nature. CmCatD trans-activated CmCPs and vice versa, suggesting a cooperation between the minor midgut CmCatD and major digestive CmCPs. Further, CmCatD was able to degrade scN after extensive incubation. This activity partially restored CmCP proteolytic activity otherwise inhibited by scN. Thus CmCatD could facilitate insects' coping with the challenge of dietary scN by exerting its scN-insensitive and scN-degrading activity, freeing cysteine proteases for food degradation. Taken together, cowpea bruchids coordinate the functionality of the two classes of digestive proteases to fend off the negative effect of scN, and fulfill their nutrient requirements.",M1
19427919,"Effects of cadmium telluride quantum dots on cadmium bioaccumulation and metallothionein production to the freshwater mussel, Elliptio complanata.Nanotechnology has gained increasing commercial attention over recent years and its use has raised concerns about its potential release in the environment. The purpose of this study was to determine the size distribution of CdTe in freshwater, bioavailability and potential toxic effects of cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QD) to the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations (0 to 8 mg Cd L(-1)) of CdTe and 0.5 mg/L CdSO4 for 24 h at 15 degrees C to examine the initial uptake and toxic effects of Cd from CdTe QDs and dissolved CdSO4. After the exposure period, Cd bioaccumulation in the gills, <e>digestive</e> gland and gonad tissues and metallothionein (MT) levels were determined. The results revealed that about 80% of Cd was retained by a 450 nm pore filter (aggregates) and that 14% of the Cd was in the dissolved phase (i.e., eluted through a 1 kDa ultrafiltration membrane) which suggested that uncoated CdTe QDs were not stable in freshwater. In mussels, Cd was accumulated principally by the gills and digestive gland and the bioaccumulation factors of Cd from CdTe were similar to that of dissolved Cd. Indeed, tissue-levels of Cd were below the proportion of dissolved Cd from CdTe which suggests that Cd rather comes from the dissociation of Cd from the ingested QDs than from the internalization of the QDs in mussel tissues. The levels of MT were induced in both the digestive gland and gonad but were readily decreased in the gills by both CdTe and CdSO4. The observed decrease in the metallic form of MT might result from the oxidative stress by CdTe and dissolved Cd. In conclusion, uncoated CdTe QD in freshwater leads to aggregates and a dissolved component of Cd where the latter explained the contribution of the observed accumulation pattern in mussel tissues and effects on MT levels in mussels.",M1

Bivalves from an area devoid of anthropogenic influences but characterized by background metal contamination (Franquelin) were actively transplanted within this location and in a site contaminated by urban, industrial and endogenous pollutants, Baie-Comeau (Baie-des-Anglais). Spatial differences in metal concentrations were shown between sites. Cu and Zn concentrations were higher in mussels from Baie-des-Anglais at the beginning of the transfer and after 1 and 2 months. In clams, Zn concentrations were significantly higher in gills and <e>digestive</e> gland tissues for organisms transplanted in Baie-des-Anglais thus showing that spatio-temporal variations of metal concentrations were different between the two species studied. Mussels and clams partitioning of metals were shown to be different depending of the species, metal and/or tissue studied. In mussels, Cd and Cu concentrations decreased in both organs and both groups after the 3-month transfer in the polluted site. In mussels, total metal and metallothionein (MT) concentrations were positively correlated in digestive gland while in clams a positive correlation was only observed in gills.",M1
19401239,"The larval alimentary canal of the Antarctic insect, Belgica antarctica.On the Antarctica continent the wingless midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera, Chironomidae) occurs further south than any other insect. The <e>digestive</e> tract of the larval stage of Belgica that inhabits this extreme environment and feeds in detritus of penguin rookeries has been described for the first time. Ingested food passes through a foregut lumen and into a stomodeal valve representing an intussusception of the foregut into the midgut. A sharp discontinuity in microvillar length occurs at an interface separating relatively long microvilli of the stomodeal midgut region, the site where peritrophic membrane originates, from the midgut epithelium lying posterior to this stomodeal region. Although shapes of cells along the length of this non-stomodeal midgut epithelium are similar, the lengths of their microvilli increase over two orders of magnitude from anterior midgut to posterior midgut. Infoldings of the basal membranes also account for a greatly expanded interface between midgut cells and the hemocoel. The epithelial cells of the hindgut seem to be specialized for exchange of water with their environment, with the anterior two-thirds of the hindgut showing highly convoluted luminal membranes and the posterior third having a highly convoluted basal surface. The lumen of the middle third of the hindgut has a dense population of resident bacteria. Regenerative cells are scattered throughout the larval midgut epithelium. These presumably represent stem cells for the adult midgut, while a ring of cells, marked by a discontinuity in nuclear size at the midgut-hindgut interface, presumably represents stem cells for the adult hindgut.",M1

However, methodologies have been successfully developed to address these problems and comprehensive morphologic analysis of the developing digestive system has now been achieved using a combination of light and fluorescence microscope approaches-including confocal analysis-to visualize wholemount and histological preparations of zebrafish embryos.

NO-ergic cells and fibers were revealed in all parts of the mollusc digestive tract beginning from pharynx. An intensive NADPHd activity was found in many intraepithelial cells of the open type and in their processes in intra- and subepithelial nerve plexuses, single subepithelial neurons, granular connective tissue cells, and numerous nerve fibers among muscle elements of he digestive tract wall as well as in nerves innervating the tract. NADPHd was also present in receptor cells of he oral area and in the central A. fulica ganglia participating in innervation of the digestive tract. The digestive tract NO-ergic system ofA. fulica has a more complex organization that that of L. littorea. In the A. fulica pharynx, stomach, and midgut, directly beneath epithelium, there is revealed a complex system of glomerular structures formed by thin NADPHd-positive nerve fibers coming from the side of epithelium. More superficially under the main groups of muscle elements, small agglomerations of NADPHd-positive neurons are seen, which could be considered as primitive, non-formed microganglia.

Specimens were collected from the Limpopo Drainage System in South Africa, and the specimens were killed and dissected in Todd's fixative. The anterior midgut is composed mostly of absorptive cells or R cells, while the diverticula are composed of R cells and of F cells, which are moderately abundant in rough endoplasmic reticulum. They are probably responsible for producing digestive enzymes. The posterior midgut is composed of papilliform B cells with large apically located vesicles and R' cells devoid of cell inclusions.

Both scallops readily concentrated dissolved Pb with whole-body 7-d concentration factors of 250+/-40 and 170+/-70, respectively. In both species, more than 70% of Pb taken up from seawater was strongly retained within tissues (biological half-life&gt;1.5 month) whereas Pb ingested with phytoplankton was poorly assimilated (&lt;20%). As P. maximus lives buried in the sediment, this exposure pathway was assessed and showed low bioaccumulation efficiency for sediment-bound Pb (transfer factor &lt;0.015).

19245499,"Influence of salinity on the localization and expression of the CFTR chloride channel in the ionocytes of Dicentrarchus labrax during ontogeny.The expression and localization of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) were determined in four osmoregulatory tissues during the ontogeny of the sea-bass Dicentrarchus labrax acclimated to fresh water and sea water. At hatch in sea water, immunolocalization showed an apical CFTR in the <e>digestive</e> tract and integumental ionocytes. During the ontogeny, although CFTR was consistently detected in the digestive tract, it shifted from the integument to the gills. In fresh water, CFTR was not present in the integument and the gills, suggesting the absence of chloride secretion. In the kidney, the CFTR expression was brief from D4 to D35, prior to the larva-juvenile transition. CFTR was apical in the renal tubules, suggesting a chloride secretion at both salinities, and it was basolateral only in sea water in the collecting ducts, suggesting chloride absorption. In the posterior intestine, CFTR was located differently from D4 depending on salinity. In sea water, the basolateral CFTR may facilitate ionic absorption, perhaps in relation to water uptake. In fresh water, CFTR was apical in the gut, suggesting chloride secretion. Increased osmoregulatory ability was acquired just before metamorphosis, which is followed by the sea-lagoon migration.",M1
19233231,"Natriuretic peptides as regulatory mediators of secretory activity in the <e>digestive</e> system.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) are members of the natriuretic peptide family best known for their role in blood pressure regulation. However, in recent years all the natriuretic peptides and their receptors have been described in the gastrointestinal tract, digestive glands and central nervous system, as well as implicated in the regulation of digestive gland functions. The current review highlights the regulatory role of ANP and CNP in pancreatic and other digestive secretions. ANP and CNP stimulate basal as well as induced pancreatic secretion and modify bicarbonate and chloride secretions. Whereas ANP and CNP exert effects directly on pancreatic cells, CNP also acts through a vago-vagal reflex. At high doses both peptides attenuate pancreatic secretion induced by high doses of secretin through the PLC/PKC pathway. With regards to other digestive secretions, ANP and CNP decrease bile secretion in the rat. ANP does not induce salivation by itself but enhances stimulated salivary secretion and modifies salivary composition in rat parotid as well as submandibular glands. In rat pancreatic, hepatic, parotid and submandibular tissues, the NPR-C receptor mediates mostly peripheral responses whereas NPR-A and NPR-B receptors, which are coupled to guanylate cyclase, likely mediate the central response. In addition, ANP modulates gastric acid secretion via a vagal-dependent mechanism. In the intestine, ANP and CNP decrease water and sodium chloride absorption through an increase in cGMP levels. Overall, these findings indicate that ANP and CNP are members of the large group of regulatory peptides affecting digestive secretions.",M1

The <e>digestive</e> gland epithelium of a terrestrial crustacean was prepared in a parallel for FIB/SEM and transmission electron microscope (TEM). All samples were aldehyde-fixed but followed by different further preparation steps. The results demonstrate that the FIB/SEM samples prepared for conventional scanning electron microscopy (dried) is suited for characterization of those intracellular morphological features, which have membranous/lamellar appearance and structures with composition of different density as the rest of the cell. The FIB/SEM of dried samples did not allow unambiguous recognition of cellular organelles. However, cellular organelles can be recognized by FIB/SEM when samples are embedded in plastic as for TEM and imaged by backscattered electrons. The best results in terms of topographical contrast on FIB milled dried samples were obtained when samples were aldehyde-fixed and conductively stained with the OTOTO method (osmium tetroxide/thiocarbohydrazide/osmium tetroxide/thiocarbohydrazide/osmium tetroxide).

19198530,"Morphology and three-dimensional reconstruction of the <e>digestive</e> system of Periplaneta americana.A three-dimensional (3-D) model of the digestive system of Periplaneta americana was built for the first time based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, the study of multiple cross-sections of the larval cockroach, and 3-D reconstruction technology. The digestive system of P. americana includes the foregut, midgut, and hindgut and takes up most of the celom. The foregut comprises almost one half of the digestive system (43.57%). The midgut, the critical region for digestion and absorption, has the second highest volume ratio (35.21%). The hindgut, with the lowest volume ratio (21.22%), includes the ileum, colon, and rectum. After the ileal valve is the colon. The 3-D model presented in this paper provides a stereoscopic view for studying the adjacent relationship and arrangement of different gut sections of P. americana.",M1
19196350,"Cowpea bruchid midgut transcriptome response to a soybean cystatin--costs and benefits of counter-defence.The insect <e>digestive</e> system is the first line of defence protecting cells and tissues of the body from a broad spectrum of toxins and antinutritional factors in its food. To gain insight into the nature and breadth of genes involved in adaptation to dietary challenge, a collection of 20 352 cDNAs was prepared from the midgut tissue of cowpea bruchid larvae (Callosobruchus maculatus) fed on regular diet and diets containing antinutritional compounds. Transcript responses of the larvae to dietary soybean cystatin (scN) were analysed using cDNA microarrays, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) confirmation with selected genes. The midgut transcript profile of insects fed a sustained sublethal scN dose over the larval life was compared with that of insects treated with an acute high dose of scN for 24 h. A total of 1756 scN-responsive cDNAs was sequenced; these clustered into 967 contigs, of which 653 were singletons. Many contigs (451) did not show homology with known genes, or had homology only with genes of unknown function in a Blast search. The identified differentially regulated sequences encoded proteins presumptively involved in metabolism, structure, development, signalling, defence and stress response. Expression patterns of some scN-responsive genes were consistent in each larval stage, whereas others exhibited developmental stage-specificity. Acute (24 h), high level exposure to dietary scN caused altered expression of a set of genes partially overlapping with the transcript profile seen under chronic lower level exposure. Protein and carbohydrate hydrolases were generally up-regulated by scN whereas structural, defence and stress-related genes were largely down-regulated. These results show that insects actively mobilize genomic resources in the alimentary tract to mitigate the impact of a digestive protease inhibitor. The enhanced or restored digestibility that may result is possibly crucial for insect survival, yet may be bought at the cost of weakened response to other stresses.",M1
19196346,"Transcriptional signatures in response to wheat germ agglutinin and starvation in Drosophila melanogaster larval midgut.One function of plant lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin is to serve as defences against herbivorous insects. The midgut is one critical site affected by dietary lectins. We observed marked cellular, structural and gene expression changes in the midguts of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae that were fed wheat germ agglutinin. Some of these changes were similar to those observed in the midguts of starved D. melanogaster. Dietary wheat germ agglutinin caused shortening, branching, swelling, distortion and in some cases disintegration of the midgut microvilli. Starvation was accompanied primarily by shortening of the microvilli. Microarray analyses revealed that dietary wheat germ agglutinin evoked differential expression of 61 transcripts; seven of these were also differentially expressed in starved D. melanogaster. The differentially transcribed gene clusters in wheat germ agglutinin-fed larvae were associated with (1) cytoskeleton organization; (2) <e>digestive</e> enzymes; (3) detoxification reactions; and (4) energy metabolism. Four possible transcription factor binding motifs were associated with the differentially expressed genes. One of these exhibited substantial similarity to MyoD, a transcription factor binding motif associated with cellular structures in mammals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wheat germ agglutinin caused a starvation-like effect and structural changes of midgut cells of D. melanogaster third-instar larvae.",M1
19174192,"Time-course study of the early lysosomal responses to pollutants in mussel <e>digestive</e> cells using acid phosphatase as lysosomal marker enzyme.Lysosomal biomarkers are early warning signals of the biological effects caused by environmental pollutants but the promptness of lysosomal responses to pollutants has not been investigated yet. This work is aimed to determine the response-time of digestive cell lysosomes in mussels exposed to metals and hydrocarbons. Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were exposed, under laboratory conditions to Cd and to the water-accommodated fraction of a lubricant oil. One mussel per experimental group was sacrificed and processed every hour from 0 h to 30 h. Changes in AcP activity, immunoreactivity and LMS test based on AcP histochemistry, discriminates significantly control and exposed mussels within 5 h exposure. The present results suggested that after 15-20 h exposure digestive cell loss might be accompanied by increased AcP activity (extralysosomal) without a parallel increase in the levels of immunoreactive AcP protein, especially after Cd-exposure. The reduced labilisation period of lysosomal membrane constitute a cost effective early warning signal that, however, is not necessarily correlated with the exposure time. The routine application of immunochemical techniques deserves more research efforts before its implementation although, these techniques are very valuable to understand and interpret correctly lysosomal responses to pollutants.",M1
19144720,"Two ParaHox genes, SpLox and SpCdx, interact to partition the posterior endoderm in the formation of a functional gut.We report the characterization of the ortholog of the Xenopus XlHbox8 ParaHox gene from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, SpLox. It is expressed during embryogenesis, first appearing at late gastrulation in the posterior-most region of the endodermal tube, becoming progressively restricted to the constriction between the mid- and hindgut. The physiological effects of the absence of the activity of this gene have been analyzed through knockdown experiments using gene-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. We show that blocking the translation of the SpLox mRNA reduces the capacity of the <e>digestive</e> tract to process food, as well as eliminating the morphological constriction normally present between the mid- and hindgut. Genetic interactions of the SpLox gene are revealed by the analysis of the expression of a set of genes involved in endoderm specification. Two such interactions have been analyzed in more detail: one involving the midgut marker gene Endo16, and another involving the other endodermally expressed ParaHox gene, SpCdx. We find that SpLox is able to bind Endo16 cis-regulatory DNA, suggesting direct repression of Endo16 expression in presumptive hindgut territories. More significantly, we provide the first evidence of interaction between ParaHox genes in establishing hindgut identity, and present a model of gene regulation involving a negative-feedback loop.",M1
19140337,"[Lipids composition and speed of energy metabolism in gastropods]Lipid composition of <e>digestive</e> gland and pedal muscle of two northern freshwater pulmonate snails Lymnaea stagnalis and Lymnaea ovata and three marine prosobranch gastropods Littorina obtusata, Littorina littorea, Buccinum undatum from the White Sea was studied. The species differ in ecology, particularly in trophic nabits and motor activity. The content of triacilglycerides both in digestive gland and pedal was higher in littoral dwellers Littorina the activity of which depends on the tide level. The phospholipids content in digestive gland does not differ in quantity in all cases and does not relate to type of feeding or resource quality. In a pedal muscle of marine species the quantity of common phospholipids is higher in comparison with the freshwater ones. The amount of total phospholipids in pedal muscle correlates with mass of metabolic inert formation which constitutes a part of whole mass of snails. The presence of massive shell enhances demands in energy needed for supporting movement and activity. Because the intensity of energy metabolism is related to quantity of total phospholipids, mitochondria and activity of their oxidizing ferments, the presence of thick shell in marine snails together with motor activity costs more in terms of energy than in freshwater snails with thin shell. This hypothesis is supported by the higher specific rate of oxygen consumption in marine snails than in freshwaters.",M1

Compared to control bees, longevity was significantly reduced by SBTI and GNA at both concentrations and by rOC-1 at 0.1%, but not by Cry1Ab or rOC-1 at 0.01%. Longevity on the OC-1 oilseed rape was not significantly different from the control plants. The effects of SBTI and rOC-1 on longevity were investigated through characterization of the digestive proteinases of O. bicornis and analysis of the response in proteinase profiles to ingestion of these proteinase inhibitors. A relatively complex profile of at least four types of soluble proteolytic enzymes was identified. Serine proteinases were found to be predominant, with metallo and especially cysteine proteinases making a smaller albeit significant contribution. The compensatory response to in vivo enzyme inhibition was similar for SBTI and rOC-1 although less pronounced for rOC-1. It consisted of a non-specific overproduction of native proteinases, both sensitive and insensitive, and the induction of a novel aspartic proteinase.",M1
19099150,"Cloning, purification and comparative characterization of two <e>digestive</e> lysozymes from Musca domestica larvae.cDNA coding for two digestive lysozymes (MdL1 and MdL2) of the Musca domestica housefly was cloned and sequenced. MdL2 is a novel minor lysozyme, whereas MdL1 is the major lysozyme thus far purified from M. domestica midgut. MdL1 and MdL2 were expressed as recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. The lytic activities of MdL1 and MdL2 upon Micrococcus lysodeikticus have an acidic pH optimum (4.8) at low ionic strength (mu = 0.02), which shifts towards an even more acidic value, pH 3.8, at a high ionic strength (mu = 0.2). However, the pH optimum of their activities upon 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylchitotriozide (4.9) is not affected by ionic strength. These results suggest that the acidic pH optimum is an intrinsic property of MdL1 and MdL2, whereas pH optimum shifts are an effect of the ionic strength on the negatively charged bacterial wall. MdL2 affinity for bacterial cell wall is lower than that of MdL1. Differences in isoelectric point (pI) indicate that MdL2 (pI = 6.7) is less positively charged than MdL1 (pI = 7.7) at their pH optima, which suggests that electrostatic interactions might be involved in substrate binding. In agreement with that finding, MdL1 and MdL2 affinities for bacterial cell wall decrease as ionic strength increases.",M1

In both molluscs, all the parts of the digestive tract contained the significant amount of intraepithelial AchE-positive cells of the open type, single subepithelial neurons and the nervous fibers localized among the muscle cells of the wall of the organs. The basal processes of the AchE-positive intraepithelial cells were shown to form the intraepithelial nerve plexus and to pass under the epithelium.

19030914,"Toxicokinetics of waterborne trivalent arsenic in the freshwater bivalve Corbicula fluminea.Arsenite (As(III)) uptake and elimination kinetics were studied in a freshwater bivalve, Corbicula fluminea, exposed to several nominal concentrations of As(III) (0, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 microg L(-1)) in a static 28-day assay, followed by a depuration stage of 14 days. At the end of each sampling time (days 0, 7, 28, and 42) whole-body portions were surveyed for total As concentrations and, complimentarily, surveyed for whole-body metallothionein (MT) induction to assess its role as a defense mechanism against exposure to As(III). Histochemical evaluation of the <e>digestive</e> gland was performed to verify As deposition and elimination in the tissue. Results show a significant increase in whole-body total As after 28 days of exposure for all treatments, followed by a decrease at the end of the depuration phase. Biodynamic kinetic models for As uptake and elimination were obtained from bioaccumulation data during the exposure phase, for all As treatments, by estimating uptake and elimination rate constants. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were estimated by the ratio of these constants. Results revealed that exposure to higher concentrations of As(III) causes a decrease in BCFs, suggesting that C. fluminea triggers effective regulatory mechanisms when exposed to higher concentrations of the metalloid. Significant induction of MT was detected during the exposure phase, followed by a decrease in MT concentration to control levels after depuration for all treatments. No significant differences in MT concentrations were observed between treatments. This finding may confirm the role of MT as part of the As regulation process, but its independence relative to concentrations of As(III) in water suggests that MT induction is not dose dependent. The histochemical evaluation provided clear evidence that As was effectively accumulated in the digestive gland during exposure and eliminated during depuration. The present work demonstrated that C. fluminea is capable of regulating As, even at exposures as high as 1000 microg L(-1) of waterborne As(III).",M1
19015888,"Beta-glucuronidase and hexosaminidase are marker enzymes for different compartments of the endo-lysosomal system in mussel <e>digestive</e> cells.In environmental toxicology, the most commonly used techniques used to visualise lysosomes in order to determine their responses to pollutants (LSC test: lysosomal structural changes test; LMS test: lysosomal membrane stability test) are based on the histochemical application of lysosomal marker enzymes. In mussel digestive cells, the marker enzymes used are beta-glucuronidase (beta-Gus) and hexosaminidase (Hex). The present work has been aimed at determining the distribution of these lysosomal marker enzymes in the various compartments of the endo-lysosomal system (ELS) of mussel digestive cells and at exploring whether intercellular transfer of lysosomal enzymes occurs between digestive and basophilic cells. Immunogold cytochemistry has allowed us to conclude that beta-Gus is present in every compartment of the digestive cell ELS, whereas Hex is not so widely distributed. Moreover, Hex is intimately linked to the lysosomal membrane, whereas beta-Gus appears to be not necessarily membrane-bound. Therefore, two populations of heterolysosomes with different enzyme load and membrane stability have been distinguished in the digestive cell. In addition, heterolysosomes of different electron density have been commonly observed merging together by contact; we suggest that some might act as storage granules for lysosomal enzymes. On the other hand, beta-Gus seems to be released to the digestive alveolar lumen in secretory lysosomes produced by basophilic cells and endocytosed by digestive cells. Regarding the implications of the present study on the interpretation of lysosomal biomarkers, we conclude that beta-Gus, but not Hex, histochemistry provides an appropriate marker for the LSC test and that, although both lysosomal marker enzymes can be employed in the LMS test, different values would be obtained depending on the marker enzyme employed.",M1

We provide evidence for the following: (1) the digestive gland is the main target organ for both essential and non essential metals, frequently containing concentrations few orders of magnitude higher as compared to mantle; the sole exception from this was the Hg that is equally distributed in the two tissues; (2) unexpectedly, the higher levels of metals were found in animals captured in the less polluted lagoon, except for Cd whose bioavailability in Aveiro lagoon might be related to industrial sources, while the influence of Cd speciation in local pray composition should not be ruled out (3) size influenced metal concentration in different way: smaller individuals accumulated significantly more Cu, while Hg concentrations showed the opposite trend; (4) Cd is positively correlated to Zn and Cu in digestive gland of specimens collected in spring in Aveiro Lagoon, and no relationship was found in Formosa Lagoon; (5) the molar ratios Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu in digestive gland increased with body weight in specimens from Aveiro area, both ratios becoming particularly higher in older individuals. Metal-specific accumulation patterns in both mantle and digestive gland at the two sites are discussed in the light of their toxicological implications.",M1

The diets contained the following: control--no tsao-ko, 0.05% total lipid of tsao-ko (TL), 0.0109% chloroform fraction (CF), 0.0245% acetone fraction (AF), or 0.00365% methanol fraction (MeF). Although CF and AF slightly inhibited the activities of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and lipase, intakes of these fractions had little influence on plasma and liver lipid concentrations when compared with the control diet. MeF did not inhibit alpha-glucosidase but had DPPH radical scavenging activity and the mice fed this fraction had the most marked reduction in plasma glucose and TBARS concentrations compared with the other diet groups. These results suggest that the fat-soluble polar components of tsao-ko contain an active component that might be associated with decreased plasma glucose and TBARS concentrations in mice.",M1

We demonstrate that levels of heat shock proteins (HSP) and other stress proteins (metallothioneins, MTs) quantified by ELISA, remained similar in gills, mantle and <e>digestive</e> gland between oysters inhabiting low and high tidal heights. In contrast, endogenous HSPs and MTs levels in gonad changed significantly during gametogenesis. In female gonads, the constitutive form of HSP70 and the MTs increased from immature (or resting) to mature stages (about more than 3-fold) and decreased after spawning. In male gonads, the same expression patterns were observed, whereas proteins levels decreased once fully mature. Females presented higher concentration of HSP70 and MTs than males during the spawning period. No significant difference in HSPs and MTs patterns was found among oysters sampled at low and high tidal heights. We hypothesize that the high level of stress proteins in eggs may increase survival of oyster progeny.",M1

In this study, CagApo-14 was cloned from gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) and its expression pattern was investigated during embryogenesis and early larval development. The CagApo-14 transcript and its protein product were firstly localized in the yolk syncytial layer at a high level during embryogenesis, and then found to be restricted to the digestive system including liver and intestine in later embryos and early larvae. Immunofluorescence staining in larvae and adults indicated that Cag Apo-14 protein was predominantly synthesized in and excreted from sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver tissue. Morpholino knockdown of Cag Apo-14 resulted in severe disruption of digestive organs including liver, intestine, pancreas and swim bladder. Moreover, yolk lipid transportation and utilization were severely affected in the Cag Apo-14 morphants. Overall, this data indicates that Cag Apo-14 is required for digestive system organogenesis during fish embryogenesis and larval development.",M1

We used degenerated primers designed based on highly conserved regions of known mollusk GSTs to amplify the corresponding L. elliptica mRNA. Full-length cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full sequence of the GST cDNA was 1189 bp in length, with a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 74 bp, a 3' UTR of 485 bp, and an open reading frame of 630 bp encoding 209 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 23.9 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 8.3.

This has been demonstrated to involve the disruption of intestinal peritrophic membrane (PM), composed of chitin matrix, glycosaminoglycans, and proteins. To identify essential and nonessential regions for this enhancement activity, AncuEPV fusolin and its deletion mutants were expressed in Sf21 cells using a baculovirus system, and their enhancement abilities were analyzed. The recombinant fusolin enhanced the peroral infectivity of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus up to 320-fold and facilitated the infection of host insect with AncuEPV. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1 to 253), a possible chitin-binding domain, is essential for the enhancement of infection, whereas the C-terminal region is entirely dispensable. The glycosylation-defective mutants N191Q, whose Asn(191) is replaced with Gln, and DeltaSIG, whose signal peptide is deleted, showed considerably reduced and abolished enhancing activities, respectively, indicating that the carbohydrate chain is important in the enhancing activity. Interestingly, the C-terminal dispensable region was digested by a serine protease(s) in insect digestive juice. Moreover, both the N-terminal conserved region and the carbohydrate chain were necessary not only for chitin binding but also for stability in digestive juice. A triple amino acid replacement mutant, IHE (Ile-His-Glu(161) to Ala-Ala-Ala), was stable in digestive juice and had chitin-binding ability but did not retain its enhancing activity. These results suggest that the enhancement of infectivity involves more than the tolerance to digestive juice and chitin-binding ability.",M1

Moreover, Pb accumulated in sampled tissues in the following order: intestine &gt; stomach &gt; liver. By observation of liver histological sections in optical microscope, lesions could be detected in the Pb-contaminated groups. It was also demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of dietary Pb on digestive enzyme activities was dietary Pb concentration dependent.

Bivalve mollusks such as the blue mussel Mytilus edulis accumulate high levels of heavy metals effecting cellular homeostasis and functions. Lead (Pb) exposure (2.5 mg/L of lead (II) nitrate for 10 d) and depuration (10 d in clean seawater) experiments were conducted to study its intracellular fate in the gills and digestive gland of M. edulis. For this purpose, an antibody-based detection method for ultrastructural localization and a subcellular fractionation approach for chemical analysis of Pb were used. In addition, effects of Pb on enzyme activities involved in oxyradical scavenging, such as the conjugative enzyme glutathione-S-transferase and the antioxidative enzyme catalase, were determined. The ultrastructural studies showed that Pb was mainly detected in lysosomes of gill epithelial cells and digestive cells. Lead was also detected in cell nuclei and granular hemocytes. Higher metal concentrations were measured by chemical analysis in subcellular fractions of the gills compared to those of the digestive gland. Increased activities of glutathione-S-transferase were found in gills after exposure and remained elevated during the depuration period, whereas glutathione-S-transferase activity remained unaffected in the digestive gland. Catalase activities showed no changes after Pb exposure, neither in the gills nor in the digestive gland. We conclude that gill cells are major sites of uptake and accumulation for dissolved Pb and are involved in sequestration and detoxification of this metal in M. edulis.",M1

With this in mind, a full-length cDNA encoding the Atlantic salmon PepT1 (asPepT1) was cloned and functionally characterized. When overexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, asPepT1 operated as a low-affinity/high-capacity transport system, and its maximal transport activity slightly increased as external proton concentration decreased (varying extracellular pH from 6.5 to 8.5). A total of 19 tested di- and tripeptides, some with acknowledged bioactive properties, some containing lysine, which is conditionally growth limiting in fish, were identified as well transported substrates, with affinities ranging between approximately 0.5 and approximately 1.5 mmol/L. Analysis of body tissue distribution showed the highest levels of asPepT1 mRNA in the <e>digestive</e> tract. In particular, asPepT1 mRNA was present in all segments after the stomach, with higher levels in the pyloric caeca and midgut region and lower levels in the hindgut. Depriving salmon of food for 6 d resulted in a approximately 70% reduction of intestinal PepT1 mRNA levels. asPepT1 will allow systematic in vitro analysis of transport of selected di- and tripeptides that may be generated in Atlantic salmon intestine during gastrointestinal transit. Also, asPepT1 will be useful as a marker to estimate protein absorption function along the intestine under various physiological and pathological conditions.",M2

Evidence is reviewed regarding the effects of supplementation with viscoactive agents on the flow and mixing of digesta in particular segments of the human gut that, by changing the rheology and liquid permeability of digesta in that segment, influence specific aspects of digestion and absorption.",M2
20108210,"Fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in Crohn's and pancreatic cancer patients compared to control subjects.Carotenoids are colored molecules that are widespread in the plant kingdom, but animals cannot synthesize them. Carotenes are long, apolar molecules which require fully functioning <e>digestive</e> processes to be absorbed properly. Hence they could be interesting markers of intestinal absorption and digestion. Indeed, only few tests are available to assess these processes and only the D-xylose tolerance test is routinely used. However D-xylose is a sugar that tests only the absorption of water-soluble compounds and it only tests duodenal absorption. In this study, we have evaluated carotenoids as markers of digestion and absorption. We compared fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in 21 control subjects, 20 patients with Crohn's disease, and 18 patients with pancreatic cancer. Crohn's disease alters intestinal absorption while pancreatic cancer decreases pancreatic enzyme secretion thus impairing digestion. Results show that all carotenoids are significantly lower in Crohn's and cancer patients as compared to control subjects and the multifactorial analysis shows that this decrease is mostly independent of dietary intake. Interestingly, maldigestion as seen in pancreatic cancer more strongly influences plasma lutein and lycopene concentrations while malabsorption in Crohn's disease acts on other carotenoids. Thus carotenoids could be interesting alternatives for testing and following patients that are suspected of having malabsorption or maldigestion syndromes.",M2
20107147,"Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics: impact of probiotics on <e>digestive</e> system metabolism.Probiotic bacteria have been studied for their potential impact on the metabolism of dietary components in the small intestine lumen including lactose digestion, metabolism of lipids such as cholesterol, and oxalate metabolism. In the large intestine, they contribute to the metabolism of otherwise indigestible dietary carbohydrates (e.g., prebiotics) and have a favorable effect on colonic protein and ammonia metabolism, although their effect on the digestive fate of phytochemicals and xenobiotics is still uncertain. Probiotics also influence metabolism in the host tissues, in particular the gastrointestinal mucosa and the liver. Underlying mechanisms include supply of additional enzymatic activities in the gut lumen and alterations of the composition or metabolic pattern of the gut resident microbiota. For future studies, selection of probiotic strains should include assessment of their metabolic activities, and the outcome of the intervention studies should also take into account the composition of the probiotic matrix and the background diet of the target population. New technologies such as metabolomics hold great promise for assessment of probiotics functionality.",M2
20102672,"Digestion rate of dietary starch affects systemic circulation of amino acids in weaned pigs.The present study was conducted to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo digestibility of dietary starch and its <e>digestive</e> behaviour on the systemic circulating amino acids (AA) in weaned pigs. Eighteen weanling pigs surgically fitted with a catheter in the jugular vein were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups. Sticky rice starch (SRS) was hydrolysed more quickly in vitro (P &lt; 0.05) than maize starch (MS) and resistant starch (RS), and was almost completely hydrolysed within 4 h. The in vivo digestibility of dietary starch in different segments of the small intestine was significantly different. SRS was digested (81.9 %; P &lt; 0.05) in the anterior jejunum, but not more than half of the MS and RS was digested in the same segment of the small intestine. The digestibilities of isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, aspartate and serine in the SRS group were higher than in the MS group (P &lt; 0.05), and all nutritionally indispensable and dispensable AA in the SRS group were higher when compared with those in the RS group (P &lt; 0.05). The serum concentrations of nutritionally indispensable AA, proline and serine in the three groups were increased to a peak point within 1.5 h postprandially then decreased gradually; however, the time that serum concentrations of alanine, aspartate, glutamate and glycine in each group increased to a peak point was different. The concentrations of nutritionally indispensable AA, including arginine, cystine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine at 09.30 hours and arginine, cystine, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine at 13.30 hours in the SRS group were higher than in the MS group (P &lt; 0.05); all nutritionally indispensable AA in the SRS group were higher than in the RS group at 09.30 and 13.30 hours (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. We conclude that dietary starches digested rapidly in vitro have higher digestibility in the anterior small intestine of pigs. Diets containing rapidly digestible starch ameliorate the digestive and absorptive function and regulate AA metabolism to beneficially increase the entry of dietary AA into the systemic circulation in pigs.",M2
20075276,"Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat on the <e>digestive</e> and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum.Effects of F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation and 1.5% supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) on the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers at 58 wk of age were investigated. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk of age, and dietary treatments (basal control diets and basal control diets with PF) were initiated at 20 wk of age. Supplemental PF increased BW and decreased isthmal length relative to total oviduct length in hens. Various oviduct segments were also affected by the type and age of inoculation, and these effects were further influenced by the use of PF. In comparison to their time-specific sham-inoculated controls, infundibulum weight relative to BW was increased when birds were inoculated with FMG at 22 wk, whereas isthmus weight relative to total oviduct weight was increased by FMG inoculation at 12 wk of age. However, PF affected infundibulum length relative to total oviduct length only in sham-inoculated birds, and PF increased magnum weight relative to total oviduct weight only in birds inoculated at 22 wk of age (sham or FMG). Furthermore, PF decreased isthmus weight relative to total oviduct weight only in birds that were sham-inoculated (12 or 22 wk). In conclusion, the inoculation of FMG at 12 or 22 wk may increase the relative contributions of the isthmus and infundibulum, respectively, to the total mass of the oviduct. In addition, PF may decrease the relative length of the isthmus and increase the relative weight of the magnum in the oviducts of birds that have been inoculated at 22 wk of age (sham or FMG). Previous studies have shown 1.5% supplemental dietary PF to influence feed consumption throughout lay and performance early in lay in hens that were inoculated with FMG at 12 wk of age. However, the current results suggest that these influences are associated with gross changes in the oviduct but not the digestive tract of layers.",M2
20071653,"Predicted apparent digestion of energy-yielding nutrients differs between the upper and lower <e>digestive</e> tracts in rats and humans.The apparent digestibility of energy-yielding nutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) was predicted in the human upper digestive tract and large bowel separately for 4 diverse diets containing either a single dietary fiber source [wheat bran and pectin (PE) diets] or mixed fiber sources [low-fiber (LF) and high-fiber (HF) diets). A human balance study was undertaken to determine fecal energy and nutrient excretion and a rat model was used to predict human ileal energy and nutrient excretion. Total tract energy digestibility ranged from 92 (HF diet) to 96% (PE diet and LF diet), while at the ileal level it ranged from 79 to 86% for the HF diet to the LF diet. The predicted upper-tract digestion of starch, sugars, and fat was high, with ileal digestibilities exceeding 90% for all diets. Nonstarch polysaccharides were poorly digested in the upper tract for all diets except in the PE diet. The daily quantity of protein excreted at the ileal level was between 2 (HF diet) and 5 (PE diet) times higher than that at the fecal level. The large differences between fecal and ileal nutrient loss highlight that fecal digestibility data alone provide incomplete information on nutrient loss. There is a need to be able to routinely determine the uptake of energy in the upper and lower digestive tracts separately.",M2
19996480,"Gastrointestinal tract and digestion in the young ruminant: ontogenesis, adaptations, consequences and manipulations.Young calves have to deal with at least three major situations that require profound physiological and <e>digestive</e> adaptations: adaptation to extra-uterine life (up to the first postnatal week), maintenance at a pre-ruminant stage over a long period (3 to 5 months or more), and weaning. This paper reports results obtained on the development (growth and differentiation) of the gastrointestinal tract, and on digestive enzyme activities as well as some aspects of the regulation by gut regulatory peptides. In the newborn calf, the maturation of the small intestine depends on pregnancy duration (preterm vs. full term) and ingestion of colostrum from first milking. The function of gut enterocytes evolves along with the changes from fetal to adult enterocytes. The origin of dietary protein in pre-ruminant and weaning calves modifies SI morphology. Chymosin, elastase II and lactase are typical postnatal enzymes, whereas pepsin, ribonuclease and amylase become important especially following weaning. Nitrogen digestibility increases during the first month of life and is modified by replacement of skim milk powder with non-milk proteins. Milk formula supplementation with Nabutyrate increases pancreatic secretions and digestibility. The gastrointestinal tract development depends on gut regulatory peptides plasma and luminal concentrations. The response to exogenous peptides is in relation with their number and type of functional receptors and with the animal age. Experimental work with young ruminants is important not only for the species involved, but also for its implications to other mammalians.",M2
20053125,"<e>Digestive</e> proteolytic activity in the Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps.The Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), is one of the most important pests of wheat and causes considerable damage to this valuable crop annually. Digestive proteinase activity of adult insects was investigated using general and specific substrates and inhibitors. Proteolytic activity was low when the common conventional substrates, azoalbumin, azocasein and hemoglobin were used to assay salivary glands and midguts. Using the fluorescent casein substrate (BODIPY FL casein), total proteolytic activity was measured at different pH. Maximum proteolytic activity was detected at pH 7 (100%) and 8(65%) which suggested the presence of serine proteinases in the salivary glands. There was no detectable proteolytic activity in midgut extracts. The inhibitors; PMSF (inhibitor of serine proteinases) and TPCK (a specific chymotrypsin inhibitor) showed greater than 50% inhibitory effect on total proteolytic activity, however, TLCK (specific trypsin inhibitor) and E-64(specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor) did not inhibit total proteolytic activity. Using fluorescent specific substrates for serine and cysteine proteinases (Z-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Phe-AMC and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMZ) revealed the presence of tryptic and chymotryptic activity in the salivary gland extract. Zymogram analysis under non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions and using the substrate APNE showed at least 8 tryptic and chymotryptic activity bands in salivary gland extracts. A single high molecular weight band with tryptic activity (165 kDa) was detected using the substrate BApNA in a zymogram analysis using native-PAGE. Kinetic studies showed a k(m) value of 0.6 mM for this enzyme against the substrate BApNA .The inhibitor TLCK decreased activity of the trypsin-like enzyme up to 73% and almost completely eliminated the only band related to this proteinase in the zymogram. Soybean Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor showed no effect on proteolytic activity of the trypsin-like serine proteinase. In general, the results revealed the presence of chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like serine proteinases in the salivary gland of E. integriceps, and it seems that the major total proteolytic activity is due to chymotrypsin proteinases.",M2
20033122,"Microbial degradation of usnic acid in the reindeer rumen.Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) eat and utilize lichens as an important source of energy and nutrients in winter. Lichens synthesize and accumulate a wide variety of phenolic secondary compounds, such as usnic acid, as a defense against herbivores and to protect against damage by UV-light in solar radiation. We have examined where and to what extent these phenolic compounds are degraded in the <e>digestive</e> tract of the reindeer, with particular focus on usnic acid. Three male reindeer were given ad libitum access to a control diet containing no usnic acid for three weeks and then fed lichens ad libitum (primarily Cladonia stellaris) containing 9.1 mg/g DM usnic acid for 4 weeks. Usnic acid intake in reindeer on the lichen diet was 91-117 mg/kg BM/day. In spite of this, no trace of usnic acid or conjugates of usnic acid was found either in fresh rumen fluid, urine, or feces. This suggests that usnic acid is rapidly degraded by rumen microbes, and that it consequently is not absorbed by the animal. This apparent ability to detoxify lichen phenolic compounds may gain increased importance with future enhanced UV-B radiation expected to cause increased protective usnic acid/phenol production in lichens.",M2
20023140,"Protein digestibility evaluations of meat and fish substrates using laboratory, avian, and ileally cannulated dog assays.Meat and fish serve as important protein sources in the companion animal diet; however, limited protein digestibility data are available for assessing protein digestibility differences among good-quality protein sources. Beef loin, pork loin, chicken breast, pollock fillet, and salmon fillet were evaluated for composition, protein digestibility, and AA bioavailability using the immobilized <e>digestive</e> enzyme assay, cecectomized rooster assay, and ileally cannulated dog assay. Pollock contained the greatest amount of CP, total essential AA (TEAA), and total nonessential AA (TNEAA; DM basis; 96.9, 38.6, and 50.3%, respectively). Salmon contained the next greatest amounts (92.8, 36.4, and 44.6%), followed by chicken (90.3, 36.1, 43.2%). Beef had the least CP content (82.7%), but had slightly greater TEAA and TNEAA concentrations (33.9, 42.0%) compared with pork (86.2, 33.6, 41.3%). Immobilized digestive enzyme assay values were greatest for pollock fillet (0.71) and least for chicken breast (0.52). Beef loin, pork loin, and salmon fillet were similar (0.63, 0.62, and 0.64, respectively). Standardized TEAA and TNEAA digestibility coefficients, evaluated using the cecectomized rooster assay, were greatest (P &lt; 0.05) for pollock fillet (90.4 and 89.8%, respectively) and least (P &lt; 0.05) for chicken breast (86.6 and 85.9%, respectively) and salmon fillet (87.8 and 86.4%, respectively). Dogs assigned to a 5 x 5 Latin square design were fed 5 diets, with each test substrate as the major protein source. No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were found in ileal digestibility of protein. Values ranged from 88.9% for chicken to 90.5% for pork loin and pollock fillet. Ileal TEAA and TNEAA coefficients were not different among test substrates, with values between 91.7 and 92.7%, and 88.8 and 90.4%, respectively. Total tract CP apparent digestibility values ranged from 94.4 to 94.8%, with no differences noted among treatments. Despite marked differences in composition and predicted and standardized digestibility values, when the protein sources were added to diets at a concentration of approximately 30% (25% of total energy intake), no differences in test protein substrates were noted in either ileal or total tract nutrient digestibility.",M2
19951709,"Changes in <e>digestive</e> rate of a predatory beetle over its larval stage: implications for dietary breadth.Prey and non-prey foods differ substantially in their suitability for zoophytophagous omnivores, but the relative quality of these foods depends on the stage-specific digestive capabilities of the organism in question. Quantitative (or real-time) PCR was used to amplify food-specific DNA and measure consumption rates and digestion efficiencies of four foods - two prey (Aphis glycines and Leptinotarsa decemlineata eggs) and two non-prey (Zea mays pollen and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) species - over different larval stages of Coleomegilla maculata. The amount of Z. mays pollen consumed increased as larvae aged, but not proportionately with larval size, such that consumption rates decreased uniformly with insect age. While aging larvae fed A. glycines had a similar pattern in their diminishing consumption rates, they consumed similar amounts of A. glycines regardless of age, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism for consumption of this species of aphids. Older larvae digested three of the four foods significantly more efficiently than younger larvae, the exception being larvae fed A. glycines which was digested at a similar rate throughout the larval stage. There was a significant effect of time on food quantity detected for all four species of food. We conclude that C. maculata expands its physiological capacity for digesting prey and non-prey foods as they age in order to better accommodate the increased nutritional needs of the older larvae. This strategy has important implications for the life history strategies of zoophytophagous insects and how they function within foods webs.",M2
19946825,"Broiler performance and in vivo viscosity as influenced by a range of xylanases, varying in ability to effect wheat in vitro viscosity.1. Exogenous enzymes such as xylanase are used in diets for broilers to eliminate anti-nutritive effects caused by the presence of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). It has been proposed that the mechanism by which xylanases exert their effect is through reducing in vivo viscosity within the broiler <e>digestive</e> tract. Previous research has reported that in vitro viscosity was a reasonable predictor of in vivo viscosity and that this method could be used to assess the efficacy of xylanases. 2. The objective of this study was to examine the response of broilers offered a wheat-based diet supplemented with a range of xylanases, varying in ability to reduce in vitro viscosity. 3. A total of 18 xylanases (Syngenta Animal Nutrition) were used to investigate the effect of xylanase on wheat in vitro viscosity. For the in vitro viscosity assay, pepsin was dissolved in either 005 or 01 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). 4. A wheat-based diet was formulated, produced and split into 7 batches; xylanase (500 U/kg) was sprayed onto 6 of the batches and the 7th was the control. This was repeated three times to produce a total of 21 diets, 18 of which contained xylanase. 5. The experiment was conducted in three consecutive trials. Each trial utilised 63 male, Ross broilers from 7 to 28 d of age. Dry matter intake (DMI), liveweight gain (LWG) and gain:feed were determined weekly. Excreta were collected from d 14 to 21 for determination of apparent metabolisable energy (AME). Oil and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility and ileal digestibility of dry matter (DM) and starch were determined. 6. Regression analyses were applied to the mean intestinal viscosity against DMI, LWG, gain:feed and the ratio of metabolisable energy to gross energy (ME:GE). To compare xylanases across the three trials, the data were subjected to REML analysis (Genstat 5). 7. When 01 M HCl was used for dissolution of pepsin, considerable reductions in in vitro viscosity were achieved for the majority of the xylanases-to values less than 12% of the control treatment. When 005 M HCl was used for the dissolution of pepsin, initial viscosity values were lower and the reduction in in vitro viscosity less dramatic than that observed with 01 M HCl. 8. With the exception of diets containing xylanases 9003 and 7162, significant reductions in in vivo viscosity were observed for diets containing xylanase in comparison to the control diet. 9. In terms of gain:feed, ME:GE and AME the xylanases ranked best were 2230 and 9003. Xylanase 2230 also resulted in the highest values for ileal DM and starch digestibility. 10. There were weak but significant relationships between in vitro viscosity and in vivo jenjunal digesta viscosity when in vitro viscosity was determined using either 01 or 005 M HCl (r(2)= 0287 and 0240, respectively). 11. The relationship between jejunal viscosity and DMI was significant (P &lt; 005) but relatively poor (r(2)= 023). There were also significant (P &lt; 005) relationships between jejunal digestal viscosity and gain:feed and ME:GE (r(2)= 034 and 028, respectively). 12. In conclusion, in vitro viscosity may be of some use in predicating xylanase response in vivo.",M2
19933429,"Fiber-related <e>digestive</e> processes in three different breeds of pigs.The hypothesis examined in this experiment was that, because of intensive selection for greater daily BW gains and efficient utilization of concentrated low-fiber diets, modern pig breeds differ from old local breeds in their physiological ability to respond to soluble dietary fiber. Thus, the old local breeds, Schwaebisch Haellisches Schwein (SH) and Bunte Bentheimer (BB), and a modern crossbred pig (CB) were used in metabolism trials to study fiber-related digestion, including microbial hindgut fermentation, by applying a colon simulation technique (Cositec) and measuring intestinal glucose transport in Ussing chambers. A basal diet or basal plus 20% dried sugar beet pulp (SBP) as a soluble fiber source was fed to 6 pigs/breed in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Four pigs of each breed per treatment were used for intestinal anatomical measurements at the end of the metabolism trials. The pigs had an initial average BW of 33.9 +/- 3.7 kg. The basal diet was formulated to meet 80% of energy and 100% of nutrient requirements for pigs with 700 g of ADG. Feeding the SBP diet reduced total intestinal tract, but it increased colon length, water-holding capacity of the digesta, and fecal bulk (P &lt; 0.01). The digestibility of OM, CP, and ether extract decreased, whereas that of NDF and ADF increased, by SBP (P = 0.001). Pigs receiving SBP excreted less urinary N and retained more N (P = 0.001). The fecal proportions of undigested dietary and water soluble N increased and those of bacterial and endogenous debris N decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in SBP-fed pigs. The SH pigs had lighter empty cecum weight, shorter colons, and less NDF digestibility than BB and CB pigs (P &lt; 0.05). Fecal N excretion did not differ (P = 0.659) among breeds, but SH pigs excreted more urinary N (P = 0.001) than the other breeds. In Cositec, OM, NDF, and ADF disappearance rates from cecal chyme of SBP-fed pigs increased (P &lt; 0.05) irrespective of pig breed. Cecal chyme of SBP-fed BB pigs produced more VFA with a smaller proportion of propionate and a larger acetate to propionate ratio than chyme of SBP-fed SH and CB pigs. The intestinal epithelial glucose transport was greater for ileal than for jejunal tissues (P &lt; 0.001) but was not influenced by diet and pig breed. In conclusion, the modern and intensely selected pig breed can utilize SBP fiber as efficiently as the old pig breeds under the present experimental conditions.",M2
19932080,"A novel hepatopancreatic phospholipase A2 from Hexaplex trunculus with <e>digestive</e> and toxic activities.A marine snail digestive phospholipase A2 (mSDPL) was purified from delipidated hepatopancreas. Unlike known digestive phospholipases A2, which are 14 kDa proteins, the purified mSDPL has a molecular mass of about 30 kDa. It has a specific activity of about 180 U/mg measured at 50 degrees C and pH 8.5 using phosphatidylcholine liposomes as a substrate in the presence of 4 mM NaTDC and 6mM CaCl2. The N-terminal amino-acid of the purified mSDPL does not share any homology with known phospholipases. Moreover, the mSDPL exhibits hemolytic activity in intact erythrocytes and can penetrate phospholipid monolayers at high surface pressure, comparable to snake venom PLA2. These observations suggest that mSDPL could be toxic to mammal cells. However, mSDPL can be classified as a member of a new family of enzymes. It should be situated between the class of toxic phospholipase A2 from venoms and another class of non toxic pancreatic phospholipase A2 from mammals.",M2
19926934,"Dietary tea catechins increase fecal energy in rats.Much attention has been paid to the beneficial health effect of tea catechins as one of the effective strategies to prevent obesity. The current study was carried out to investigate the role of tea catechins on the utilization of dietary energy sources in rats. The addition of 1% (w/w) tea catechins, mostly in gallate forms, to the diet brought about significant reductions in body weight gains and abdominal adipose tissue weights after 4-wk feeding periods compared to the control. A 2-d output of feces collected at the third week of feeding was significantly increased by a tea catechin diet (average dry weight+/-SD of 7.2+/-1.5 g) over that with a control diet (3.8+/-0.4 g). Only 0.1% of ingested starch appeared in the feces of rats fed the control diet, whereas 4.8% was excreted in the feces of the tea catechin group. Moreover, both apparent digestibility values for lipid and protein in the rats fed tea catechins were also lower than those of the control, suggesting that tea catechins increased the fecal excretion of these energy nutrients. Of the gross energy that the rats consumed from their respective diets during the fecal collection period, 1.6% (for control diet) and 5.8% (for tea catechin diet) were estimated to be excreted in feces. The energy loss originating from carbohydrate should contribute to the overall amount of energy in the feces, followed by protein. Intake of tea catechins suppressed the intestinal absorption of energy nutrients via the inhibition of <e>digestive</e> enzymes, which may at least partially influence the body fat reduction by tea catechins.",M2
19924733,"Characterisation of adult green lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea) <e>digestive</e> physiology: impact of a cysteine protease inhibitor and a synthetic pyrethroid.BACKGROUND: In spite of concern regarding potential non-target effects of GM crops, few studies have compared GM pest control with conventional methods. The impacts of cypermethrin and oilseed rape expressing oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) were compared in this study on the predator Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens).RESULTS: Adults fed purified rOC-1 showed a subtle shift in digestive protease profile, with an increasing reliance on serine proteases (chymotrypsin), increase in aspartic proteases and a slight reduction in elastase activity. Although there were no effects on mortality, onset of oviposition was delayed; however, once egg production commenced, egg laying and hatching success rates were comparable with those of controls. Oryzacystatin-1 expressed in pollen showed no detrimental effects. Cypermethrin had no effect on mortality owing to high levels of non-specific esterase activity resulting in partial breakdown of the insecticide. In spite of this, there was a significant delay in onset of oviposition and a significant reduction in egg production and viability.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential for pest management to impact on predators, but importantly it highlights the ability of the predator to detoxify/respond to treatments with different modes of action. In this case, exposure to an insecticide carried a greater fitness cost than exposure to a protease inhibitor expressed in transgenic crops.",M2
19923610,"Whole-body glucose metabolism and mammary energetic nutrient metabolism in lactating dairy cows receiving <e>digestive</e> infusions of casein and propionic acid.This study analyzed the effect of propionate (C3) and casein (CN) on whole-body and mammary metabolism of energetic nutrients. Three multiparous Holstein cows fitted with both duodenal and ruminal cannulas were used in 2 replicated Youden squares with 14-d periods. Effects of CN (743 g/d in the duodenum) and C3 (1,042 g/d in the rumen) infusions, either separately or in combination as supplements to a grass silage diet, were tested in a factorial arrangement. The control diet provided 97% of energy and protein requirements. Within each period, blood samples were taken (d 11) from the carotid artery and the right mammary vein to determine net uptake of energetic nutrients. Plasma blood flow was calculated using the Fick principle (based on Phe and Tyr). On d 13, [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose was infused in the jugular vein to determine whole-body glucose rate of appearance (Ra) based on enrichments in arterial plasma. Both C3 and CN treatments increased whole-body Ra (17% and 13%, respectively) but only CN increased milk (18%) and lactose (14%) yields, suggesting no direct link between whole-body Ra and milk yield. When CN was infused alone, the apparent ratio of conversion of CN carbon into glucose carbon was 0.31 but, when allowance was made for the CN required to support the extra milk protein output, the ratio increased to 0.40, closer to the theoretical ratio (0.48). This may relate to the observed increases in arterial glucagon concentrations for CN alone. Conversely, the apparent conversion of infused C3 carbon alone to glucose was low (0.31). With C3, mammary plasma flow increased as did uptakes of lactate, Ala, and Glu whereas the uptake for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) decreased. Mammary net carbon balance suggested an increase with C3 treatment in glucose, lactate, Ala, and Glu oxidation within the mammary gland. Mammary glucose uptake did not increase with CN treatment, despite an increase in glucose arteriovenous difference and extraction rate, because plasma flow decreased (-17%). Whereas CN, alone or in combination with C3, increased both lactose and protein yields, only mammary AA (and BHBA in CN alone) uptake increased because plasma flow decreased (-17%). These data suggest that the observed variations of milk lactose yield (and other milk components) are linked to metabolic interchanges between several energetic nutrients at both the whole-body and mammary levels and are not explained by increases in whole-body glucose availability.",M2
19903955,"Effect of dietary fiber and fat on performance and <e>digestive</e> traits of broilers from one to twenty-one days of age.The influence of fiber source and dietary fat level on digestive traits and productive performance was studied in broilers from 1 to 21 d of age. There were 6 treatments arranged factorially with 3 sources of fiber (none; 3% oat hulls, OH; and 3% sugar beet pulp, SBP) and 2 fat sources (5% soybean oil, SO; and 5% yellow grease, YG). Each treatment was replicated 6 times and the experimental unit was a cage with 18 broilers. Fiber inclusion improved BW gain (P &lt; or = 0.05) and feed:gain ratio (P &lt; or = 0.001) and increased total tract apparent retention (TTAR) of all nutrients measured (P &lt; or = 0.001). The increases observed in TTAR of nitrogen and ether extract and on AME(n) of the diet were more pronounced with OH than with SBP. The increases in nutrient digestibility with OH inclusion were higher at excreta than at ileal level and in fact, SBP inclusion reduced the apparent ileal digestibility of most nutrients. The relative weight (%) of the gizzard was increased (P &lt; or = 0.001) and the pH of its contents was reduced (P &lt; or = 0.001) when additional fiber was included in the diet. The TTAR of nutrients was higher for the SO than for the YG diets (P &lt; or = 0.001). Also, the increases in ether extract digestibility (P &lt; or = 0.05) and AME(n) (P &lt; or = 0.05) of the diet with fiber inclusion were more pronounced with the YG than with the SO. Therefore, the inclusion of moderate amounts of fiber in the diet might improve performance and nutrient digestibility in young chicks, especially when saturated fats are used.",M2
19899761,"Combining the dynamic TNO-gastrointestinal tract system with a Caco-2 cell culture model: application to the assessment of lycopene and alpha-tocopherol bioavailability from a whole food.To exert their health effect, phytochemicals such as carotenoids and vitamin E have to be bioavailable. We investigated the <e>digestive</e> stability and intestinal absorption of lycopene and alpha-tocopherol from a whole food containing red tomatoes and sunflower oil using, for the first time, the dynamic gastrointestinal system TNO gastrointestinal tract model (TIM) coupled with Caco-2 cells. Digestive samples were added to Caco-2 cells after appropriate ultracentrifugation, filtration, and dilution. alpha-Tocopherol was stable during digestion in the TIM, whereas a 25% loss was observed for lycopene. The absorption of both compounds was curvilinear, bidirectional, and concentration-dependent. The percentages of alpha-tocopherol absorbed, but not that of lycopene, were lower with digestas compared to those with pure compounds, suggesting competition for absorption with other components of the test meal. According to in vivo data, a lower bioavailability was found for lycopene compared to that for alpha-tocopherol. These results support the usefulness of this in vitro approach for estimating the bioavailability of active compounds from food.",M2
19877458,"Understanding the role of probiotics in supporting <e>digestive</e> comfort.Many people experience digestive discomfort at some time in their lives. It affects those who are healthy and unhealthy, and in some cases can signal a more serious underlying condition. For most people the discomfort is minor and transitory, but for some it can cause regular unpleasant symptoms, such as bloating. More severe gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have a significant impact on health and wellbeing. There are relatively few options for people with digestive discomfort and/or IBS. In recent years the body of evidence to support the health benefits of consuming probiotics has grown significantly. This article investigates how certain strains of probiotics have been shown to reduce digestive discomfort and symptoms of IBS. It highlights some of the problems associated with poor digestive health and offers guidance on educating patients about digestive comfort.",M2
19854997,"Influence of dietary protein content and source on fecal quality, electrolyte concentrations, and osmolarity, and digestibility in dogs differing in body size.When fed the same diet, large-breed dogs tend to produce feces of poorer quality compared with small-breed dogs. Moreover, German shepherds, although having a BW similar to Giant Schnauzers, are particularly prone to <e>digestive</e> intolerance, producing feces of poor consistency and increased moisture. Digestive tolerance reflects the reaction of the animal to the diet, and it can be assessed by determining fecal quality (consistency, moisture, volume, odor, and color). This study was conducted to assess the effect of protein source and content on fecal quality, and to determine whether greater digestibility and lesser fecal osmolarity and electrolyte concentrations are associated with improved fecal quality in dogs differing in body size and digestive tolerance. Twenty-seven healthy female dogs were divided into 4 groups according to BW and digestive tolerance: small, medium, large tolerant, and large sensitive. Five diets, varying in protein source (wheat gluten, poultry meal, and a 50:50 mixture of both sources) and concentration (22, 29, and 39% CP on a DM basis for low, medium, and high, respectively) were tested. The present study was divided in 2 phases: 2 diets were studied in a crossover design in phase I, and 3 diets were studied in a Latin square design in phase II. Diets were fed for 14 d, followed by a 12-d transition period. Fecal score (1 = dry and hard feces, to 5 = liquid diarrhea), moisture, electrolytes (Na and K), and osmolarity, and digestibility of DM, energy, fat, CP, and ash were determined. Fecal score and moisture (P &lt; 0.001) were less and overall digestibility (P &lt; 0.001 for DM, CP, fat, ash, and energy) was greater for wheat gluten than for poultry meal diets. Large dogs had the greatest fecal score and moisture (P &lt; 0.001), together with the greatest overall digestibility (P &lt; 0.001 for DM, P = 0.054 for CP, P = 0.005 for ash, and P = 0.003 for energy). Osmolarity was less for wheat gluten-based diets (P &lt; 0.001), and was not affected by dog size. Fecal electrolyte concentration varied mainly with dog group (P = 0.005 for Na, and P &lt; 0.001 for K), being greater in large sensitive dogs compared with small dogs. Wheat gluten was proved to be a suitable protein source for modulating fecal quality in dogs, particularly in sensitive breeds. Poorer fecal quality in large sensitive dogs can be related to greater digestibility and greater fecal electrolyte concentrations, but not to fecal osmolarity.",M2
19853267,"Distribution and morphology of argyrophilic cells in the <e>digestive</e> tract of the African ostrich.We used light microscopy to elucidate the morphological features of argyrophilic cells in the digestive tract of the African ostrich (Struthio camelus). The results indicated that argyrophilic cells were found to be distributed among the epithelial cells of the mucosa or glands throughout the digestive tract, except for the esophagus; two types of argyrophilic cells were found; i.e., closed-type cells and cells with triangular or elongated shapes and with their apical cytoplasmic process in contact with the lumen (open-type cells); the greatest number of argyrophilic cells was found in the proventriculus, and the argyrophilic cell density gradually decreased from the proventriculus to the rectum; Furthermore, the number of argyrophilic cells in the duodenum and ileum was higher than that in the jejunum. This text still combined the characteristics that the argyrophilic cells in digestive tract of ostrich maybe related to different digestive function of different region and the basis of their morphology to carry on a discussion. It was speculated that argyrophilic cells in the digestive tract may have both endocrine and exocrine functions.",M2
19808655,"Carbohydrate maldigestion induces necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the most severe gastrointestinal disorder in preterm infants. It is associated with the initiation of enteral nutrition and may be related to immature carbohydrate <e>digestive</e> capacity. We tested the hypothesis that a formula containing maltodextrin vs. a formula containing lactose as the principal source of carbohydrate would predispose preterm pigs to a higher NEC incidence. Cesarean-derived preterm pigs were given total parenteral nutrition for 48 h followed by total enteral nutrition with a lactose-based (n = 11) or maltodextrin-based (n = 11) formula for 36 h. A higher incidence (91% vs. 27%) and severity (score of 3.3 vs. 1.8) of NEC were observed in the maltodextrin than in the lactose group. This higher incidence of NEC in the maltodextrin group was associated with significantly lower activities of lactase, maltase, and aminopeptidase; reduced villus height; transiently reduced in vivo aldohexose uptake; and reduced ex vivo aldohexose uptake capacity in the middle region of the small intestine. Bacterial diversity was low for both diets, but alterations in bacterial composition and luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were observed in the maltodextrin group. In a second study, we quantified net portal absorption of aldohexoses (glucose and galactose) during acute jejunal infusion of a maltodextrin- or a lactose-based formula (n = 8) into preterm pigs. We found lower net portal aldohexose absorption (4% vs. 42%) and greater intestinal recovery of undigested carbohydrate (68% vs. 27%) in pigs acutely perfused with the maltodextrin-based formula than those perfused with the lactose-based formula. The higher digestibility of the lactose than the maltodextrin in the formulas can be attributed to a 5- to 20-fold higher hydrolytic activity of tissue-specific lactase than maltases. We conclude that carbohydrate maldigestion is sufficient to increase the incidence and severity of NEC in preterm pigs.",M2
19777964,"Differences between sexes in <e>digestive</e> efficiency of the white stork Ciconia ciconia under experimental conditions.Sex differences in digestive performance may be related to food contents, to body size as well as many other physiological traits. However, evidence for sex differences in the digestion of birds, especially in the case of predators, is scarce. Therefore we studied digestive efficiency, and also body size, intestine length and food selection of the wild white stork (Ciconia ciconia), under experimental conditions in the Poznań Zoo. Altogether 29 individuals of this species were investigated (9 males, 20 females). During 5-day- long experimental cycles, the diet of the birds consisted of mammals, birds, fishes and insects. The mean daily wet food intake (weight of the food eaten) during the experiment was 272.8g +/- 89.3 g for males and 342.7g +/- 157.4 g for females, but the difference between sexes was not significant (P = 0.226). The mean digestive efficiency showed a significant difference, i.e. in male white storks it amounted to 70.87% +/- 14.43%, whereas in females this value was 77.53% +/- 3.99% (P = 0.049). Digestive efficiency was slightly influenced by changes in body weight of storks during the experiment. Correlation coefficients between sexes also differed significantly (P = 0.037). The study showed that the digestive efficiency is positively correlated with the quantity of food intake and body weight.",M2
19758577,"The absorption efficiency and respiration rate of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae.The present study investigates some aspects of the <e>digestive</e> biology and physiological energetics of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae. Florida lancelets are able to remove 47.2-56.9% of the energy from a diet of mixed algae. The respiration rate is 0.100mL O(2) (STPD) h(-1) g(-1) (wet), which estimates a metabolic rate of 0.248 J h(-1), at an average body mass of 0.125 g (wet). Published values of the chlorophyll a concentration in its natural habitat indicate that a 125 mg lancelet would need to filter 0.018-0.031 L h(-1) to remove sufficient food to support its resting metabolism. The filtration rate of lancelets has been reported as 0.138 L h(-1), indicating that the actual filtration rate is 4-7 times greater than the filtration rate needed to meet resting metabolic demands. It appears that lancelets have the potential to be raised in aquaculture, because their absorption efficiency and respiration rate are comparable to suspension-feeding invertebrates that have been successfully aquacultured.",M2
19753604,"Intake of Maillard reaction products reduces iron bioavailability in male adolescents.The effects of diets with different Maillard reaction products (MRPs) content on biological iron utilization were compared using in vitro/in vivo assays. Diets were rich (brown diet, BD) or poor (white diet) in MRP. In vitro studies included iron solubility after in vitro digestion of diets and iron transport across Caco-2 cells. In the human assay 18 healthy adolescent males (11-14 years) participated in a 2-wk randomized two-period crossover trial. Subjects collected urine and faeces on the last 3 days of each dietary period, and fasting blood samples were obtained after periods. In vitro dietary iron availability was significantly lower with the BD than the white diet (9.52 and 12.92%, respectively), as a consequence of the lower iron solubility after the in vitro digestion, but not as a result of decreased transport of the remaining soluble iron. The BD consumption increased iron fecal excretion ( approximately 1.4-fold) and significantly decreased its bioavailability ( approximately 2.7-fold), mainly due to the effects found at <e>digestive</e> level. Serum biochemical parameters related to iron metabolism remained unaltered. It is concluded the presence of MRP in the diet negatively affects iron bioavailability. As iron deficiency may be related to learning impairment and to reductions of cognitive and physical functions, possible long-term effects of excessive MRP intake during adolescence warrant attention.",M2

19749020,"Comparative effects of virginiamycin supplementation on characteristics of growth-performance, dietary energetics, and digestion of calf-fed Holstein steers.Two trials were conducted to evaluate the influence of virginiamycin supplementation on growth performance and <e>digestive</e> function. In trial 1, 144 Holstein steer calves (119 kg of initial BW) were used in a 340-d trial. Treatments were (DM basis) 1) control (no antibiotic); 2) 16 mg/kg of virginiamycin; 3) 22.5 mg/kg of virginiamycin; and 4) 28 mg/kg of monensin. Calves received a steam-flaked corn-based growing diet for the first 112 d and thereafter were fed a finishing diet from d 112 until slaughter. Steers were divided into 2 BW groups (lighter-half and heavier-half), and assigned within groups to 24 pens (6 steers/pen). Virginiamycin did not affect (P &gt; 0.20) ADG, but increased 340-d G:F (linear; P = 0.02) and dietary NE (linear; P = 0.04). Improvements in dietary NE were most pronounced during the final 116 d of the feeding period (linear; P = 0.04) that comprised the hot summer months (June through September). Monensin did not affect (P &gt; 0.20) growth performance or dietary NE. Although average initial BW of the lighter-half and heavier-half BW groups differed by only 4 kg, the heavier BW group had greater HCW (13 kg, P = 0.02), LM area (5.4%, P = 0.01), ADG (4.3%, P = 0.02), G:F (2.3%, P = 0.08), and dietary NE (3.2%. P = 0.01) than the lighter BW group. In trial 2, 4 Holstein steers (269 +/- 3.5 kg) with cannulas in the rumen and proximal duodenum were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to evaluate treatment effects on digestion. Virginiamycin did not affect (P &gt; 0.20) ruminal digestion of OM, NDF, starch, and N, and microbial efficiency, but tended to linearly increase (P = 0.09) ruminal N efficiency (nonammonia N flow to the small intestine/N intake). Likewise, virginiamycin did not affect (P &gt; 0.20) postruminal or total tract digestion of OM, starch, NDF, and N. Compared with the control diet, monensin depressed total tract digestion of OM (4.2%, P = 0.03) and NDF (29.5%, P = 0.02). There were no treatment effects (P &gt; 0.20) on ruminal pH, or ruminal lactate and total VFA molar concentration. Virginiamycin increased ruminal molar proportion of acetate (quadratic; P = 0.04) and estimated methane production (quadratic; P = 0.07), and decreased propionate molar proportion (quadratic; P = 0.09). Monensin did not affect (P &gt; 0.20) ruminal VFA molar proportions or estimated methane production. We concluded that virginiamycin supplementation can enhance feedlot growth-performance and dietary energetic efficiency of calf-fed Holstein steers.",M2
19725117,"Digestion in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a gummivore-frugivore.Wild common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) feed on fruits, insects, and gums, all of which provide different <e>digestive</e> challenges. Much of the ingested mass of fruits consists of seeds. In general, seeds represent indigestible bulk to marmosets and could inhibit feeding if they are not eliminated rapidly. In contrast, gums are beta-linked polysaccharides that require microbial fermentation. Their digestion would benefit from an extended residence time within the gut. Earlier research found that mean retention time (MRT) for a liquid digestive marker (cobalt EDTA) was significantly longer than MRT for a particulate marker (chromium-mordanted fiber), suggesting that common marmosets preferentially retain liquid digesta. We conducted two four-day-long digestion trials on 13 individually housed adult common marmosets fed a single-item, purified diet in order to examine the relations among MRT of cobalt EDTA and chromium-mordanted fiber, food dry matter intake (DMI), and apparent digestibility of dry matter (ADDM). We compared the MRT values with the data from the previous study mentioned above and a study using polystyrene beads. There were no significant correlations among MRT, ADDM, or DMI, although increases in DMI between trials were associated with decreases in MRT. ADDM was consistent within individuals between trials; but the mean values ranged from 75.0 to 83.4% among individuals. We found no difference in MRT between the liquid (17.5 + or - 1.6 hr) and particulate (17.9 + or - 1.4 hr) markers. Although these values were not significantly different than found previously, the MRT for chromium-mordanted fiber tended to be longer. This probably reflects the relatively small size of the chromium-mordanted fiber particles used in this study. An inverse relationship between particle size and MRT was evident; the mean MRT of polysterene beads, the largest marker, was only 8.3 + or - 1.5 hr. Marmosets appear to retain liquids and small particles within the gut longer than large particles.",M2
19673857,"The integration of digestion and osmoregulation in the avian gut.We review digestion and osmoregulation in the avian gut, with an emphasis on the ways these different functions might interact to support or constrain each other and the ways they support the functioning of the whole animal in its natural environment. Differences between birds and other vertebrates are highlighted because these differences may make birds excellent models for study and may suggest interesting directions for future research. At a given body size birds, compared with mammals, tend to eat more food but have less small intestine and retain food in their gastrointestinal tract (GIT) for shorter periods of time, despite generally higher mass-specific energy demands. On most foods, however, they are not less efficient at digestion, which begs the question how they compensate. Intestinal tissue-specific rates of enzymatic breakdown of substrates and rates of active transport do not appear higher in birds than in mammals, nor is there a demonstrated difference in the extent to which those rates can be modulated during acclimation to different feeding regimes (e.g. diet, relative intake level). One compensation appears to be more extensive reliance on passive nutrient absorption by the paracellular pathway, because the avian species studied so far exceed the mammalian species by a factor of at least two- to threefold in this regard. Undigested residues reach the hindgut, but there is little evidence that most wild birds recover microbial metabolites of nutritional significance (essential amino acids and vitamins) by re-ingestion of faeces, in contrast to many hindgut fermenting mammals and possibly poultry. In birds, there is some evidence for hindgut capacity to breakdown either microbial protein or protein that escapes the small intestine intact, freeing up essential amino acids, and there is considerable evidence for an amino acid absorptive capacity in the hindgut of both avian and mammalian hindgut fermenters. Birds, unlike mammals, do not excrete hyperosmotic urine (i.e. more than five times plasma osmotic concentration). Urine is mixed with digesta rather than directly eliminated, and so the avian gut plays a relatively more important role in water and salt regulation than in mammals. Responses to dehydration and high- and low-salt loads are reviewed. Intestinal absorption of ingested water is modulated to help achieve water balance in one species studied (a nectar-feeding sunbird), the first demonstration of this in any terrestrial vertebrate. In many wild avian species the size and <e>digestive</e> capacity of the GIT is increased or decreased by as much as 50% in response to nutritional challenges such as hyperphagia, food restriction or fasting. The coincident impacts of these changes on osmoregulatory or immune function of the gut are poorly understood.",M2
19651229,"Evidence for a tradeoff between retention time and chewing efficiency in large mammalian herbivores.Large body size is thought to produce a <e>digestive</e> advantage through different scaling effects of gut capacity and food intake, with supposedly longer digesta retention times in larger animals. However, empirical tests of this framework have remained equivocal, which we hypothesize is because previous comparative studies have not included digesta particle size. Larger particles require more time for digestion, and if digesta particle size increases with body mass, it could explain the lack of digestive advantage in larger herbivores. We combine data on body mass, food intake, digesta retention and digestibility with data on faecal particle size (as a proxy for digesta particle size) in 21 mammalian herbivore species. Multiple regression shows that fibre digestibility is independent of body mass but dependent on digesta retention and particle size; the resulting equation indicates that retention time and particle size can compensate for each other. Similarly, digestible food intake is independent of body mass, but dependent on food intake, digesta retention, and particle size. For mammalian herbivores, increasing digesta retention and decreasing digesta particle size are viable strategies to enhance digestive performance and energy intake. Because the strategy of increased digesta retention is usually linked to reduced food intake, the high selective pressure to evolve a more efficient dentition or a physiological particle separation mechanism that facilitates repeated mastication of digesta (rumination) becomes understandable.",M2
19651182,"Safety evaluation of highly-branched cyclic dextrin and a 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus.Highly-branched cyclic dextrin (HBCD), a dextrin food ingredient presently only used in Japan, was investigated for digestibility and potential toxicity. HBCD was readily hydrolyzed in vitro to maltose and maltotriose by human salivary and porcine pancreatic alpha-amylases. Incubation of HBCD with a rat intestinal homogenate, containing <e>digestive</e> enzymes, resulted in the formation of maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose, and with longer incubation times, resulted in the formation of glucose. In an acute toxicity study, Wistar rats orally administered a single-dose of 2000mg/kg body weight of HBCD did not display mortality or any signs or symptoms of toxicity or abnormalities upon necropsy. Transient loose stools were observed, but were resolved within 24h of HBCD administration, and therefore, were not considered as compound-specific adverse effects. In the Ames assay, HBCD was non-mutagenic with or without metabolic activation. Toxicity testing of the branching enzyme (BE) involved in the synthesis of HBCD showed that the BE also was not acutely toxic when orally administered to rats and was non-mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay. The results of this study demonstrate that HBCD is digested to normal and safe products of carbohydrate digestion, and therefore, support the safety of HBCD for human consumption.",M2
19648494,"Effect of dietary level of protein and fiber on the productive performance and health status of piglets.To study the interaction between the levels of protein and fiber on the productive performance and health status of piglets, ninety-six 35-d-old piglets (9.11 +/- 0.60 kg of BW) were placed in 32 pens of 3 animals each and allotted to 4 dietary treatments for 21 d. The 4 diets were based on rice, dairy products, and soybean meal in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments, with 2 levels of CP (15.4 vs. 19.4%, as-fed basis) and 2 levels of dietary fiber [DF; low fiber (LF) 5.3% NDF and high fiber (HF) 7.15% NDF, as-fed basis]. The HF diet was developed by supplementing the basal diet with 40 g/kg of wheat bran and 20 g/kg of sugar beet pulp. Animal performance was obtained weekly with samples of feces collected for microbiology on the first and the last experimental day and scored from 1 (liquid) to 4 (hard). On the last day, 1 pig from each pen was sampled for blood analyses of the acute-phase protein, major acute-phase protein of pigs (PigMap) and subsequently killed to register the <e>digestive</e> tract weight (including contents) and colon histology. Pigs fed the HF diets had greater ADG (390 vs. 457 g; P &lt; or = 0.001) and large intestine weight (4.4 vs. 5.4% of BW; P &lt; or = 0.05). This coincided with a greater (P &lt; or = 0.05) short-chain fatty acid concentration (especially of acetic and butyric acids), a decrease in Escherichia coli counts (7.77 vs. 6.86 log of cfu/g of feces, P &lt; or = 0.05), and an increase in the ratio of lactobacilli:enterobacteria (0.76 vs. 1.37, P &lt; or = 0.05). However, CP level did not modify the productive performance, but 20% CP increased P &lt; or = 0.05) the relative weight (% of BW) of the small (6.5 vs. 7.7) and large intestine (3.8 vs. 4.3). In the large bowel, the 20% CP diet increased the numbers of goblet cells (4.6 vs. 5.4/100 microm; P &lt; or = 0.05) and reduced the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (1.8 vs. 1.3/100 microm; P &lt; or = 0.05). In relation to health status, increasing DF was dependent of the dietary CP content. Supplementing the 16% CP diet with DF reduced the fecal score and increased the antibiotics interventions, whereas the opposite was the case in the 20% CP diet. Pigs fed the 20% CP diet showed decreased (P &lt; or = 0.05) PigMap concentrations than pigs fed 16% CP diets. As a whole, CP showed major effects on the gastrointestinal weight and gut barrier integrity, whereas DF increased the productive performance and promoted major changes in the microbial colonization and fermentation variables.",M2

Additional data are required to support the use of specific probiotics to improve gastrointestinal (GI) well-being. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of consuming fermented milk (FM) on GI well-being, digestive symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst women without diagnosed GI disorders. In this double-blind, controlled, parallel-design study, subjects were randomised to ingest daily either 2 x 125 g FM containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 and yoghurt strains or a control non-fermented dairy product for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week wash-out period. GI well-being and digestive symptoms were assessed weekly. HRQoL was measured every 4 weeks. Data were analysed using analysis of covariance and logistic regression, correcting for baseline values on the full analysis set population of 197 women (aged 18-60 years). The percentage of women reporting an improvement in their GI well-being was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the FM group v. the control group (OR 1.69; 95 % CI 1.17, 2.45). A significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more pronounced decrease in the composite score of digestive symptoms was observed in the FM group when comparing with the control group (least squares mean - 0.57; 95 % CI - 1.12, - 0.02). Among HRQoL dimensions, the digestive comfort score was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved in the FM group compared with the control group. The present study showed that the daily consumption of a specific FM is able to improve GI well-being and digestive symptoms in adult women without GI disorders.",M2
19620677,"In vitro digestibility of individual amino acids in rumen-undegraded protein: the modified three-step procedure and the immobilized <e>digestive</e> enzyme assay.Three soybean meal, 3 SoyPlus (West Central Cooperative, Ralston, IA), 5 distillers dried grains with solubles, and 5 fish meal samples were used to evaluate the modified 3-step in vitro procedure (TSP) and the in vitro immobilized digestive enzyme assay (IDEA; Novus International Inc., St. Louis, MO) for estimating digestibility of AA in rumen-undegraded protein (RUP-AA). In a previous experiment, each sample was ruminally incubated in situ for 16 h, and in vivo digestibility of AA in the intact samples and in the rumen-undegraded residues (RUR) was obtained for all samples using the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay. For the modified TSP, 5 g of RUR was weighed into polyester bags, which were then heat-sealed and placed into Daisy(II) incubator bottles. Samples were incubated in a pepsin/HCl solution followed by incubation in a pancreatin solution. After this incubation, residues remaining in the bags were analyzed for AA, and digestibility of RUP-AA was calculated based on disappearance from the bags. In vitro RUP-AA digestibility estimates obtained with this procedure were highly correlated to in vivo estimates. Corresponding intact feeds were also analyzed via the pepsin/pancreatin steps of the modified TSP. In vitro estimates of AA digestibility of the feeds were highly correlated to in vivo RUP-AA digestibility, which suggests that the feeds may not need to be ruminally incubated before determining RUP-AA digestibility in vitro. The RUR were also analyzed via the IDEA kits. The IDEA values of the RUR were good predictors of RUP-AA digestibility in soybean meal, SoyPlus, and distillers dried grains with solubles, but the IDEA values were not as good predictors of RUP-AA digestibility in fish meal. However, the IDEA values of intact feed samples were also determined and were highly correlated to in vivo RUP-AA digestibility for all feed types, suggesting that the IDEA value of intact feeds may be a better predictor of RUP-AA digestibility than the IDEA value of the RUR.

Most of the research for molecular mechanisms of the association between HGD and the above diseases focus on the metabolism of glucose and lipid. However, there are few studies on molecular mechanism of the effect of HGD on digestion and absorption. We used HGD (containing 20% glucose) to feed C57BL/6J mice for 4 weeks, detected the expressions of 13,098 genes in jejunums of C57BL/6J mice with DNA microarray. Microarray analysis showed the expression of genes related to <e>digestive</e> enzyme, gastrointestinal peptide and nutrient transporters were significantly changed, which indicated that HGD induced the suppression of digestive enzyme gene expression, attenuation of alimentary tract movement and nutrient transportation. In one word, the microarray analysis suggested that HGD impaired the function of digestion and absorption in jejunum of C57BL/6J mice. We validated our microarray findings by conducting real-time RT-PCR assays on selected genes and detecting the activities of disaccharidases such as lactase, maltase and sucrase in jejunum of C57BL/6J mice.",M2
19603399,"In vitro digestion methods for assessing the effect of food structure on allergen breakdown.This article reviews the in vitro digestion models developed to assess the stability of food allergens during digestion. It is hypothesised that food allergens must exhibit sufficient gastro-intestinal stability to reach the intestinal mucosa where absorption and sensitisation (development of atopy) can occur. The investigation of stability of proteins within the gastrointestinal tract may provide prospective testing for allergenicity and could be a significant and valid parameter that distinguishes food allergens from nonallergens. Systematic evaluation of the stability of food allergens that are active via the gastrointestinal tract is currently tested in traditional pepsin digestibility models. The human gastrointestinal tract however is very complex and this article points out the importance of using physiologically relevant in vitro digestion systems for evaluating digestibility of allergens. This would involve the simulation of the stomach/small intestine environment (multi-phase models) with sequential addition of <e>digestive</e> enzymes, surfactants such as phospholipids and bile salts under physiological conditions, as well as the consideration of the effect of the food matrices on the allergen digestion.",M2
19591889,"Stability to gastrointestinal enzymes and structure-activity relationship of beta-casein-peptides with antihypertensive properties.Physiological digestion plays a key role in the formation and degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with antihypertensive activity. Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to <e>digestive</e> enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.",M2
19569554,"[<e>Digestive</e> enzyme activities in rats kept on standard or surplus breast-feeding and on low-protein diet directly after weaning]Activities of digestive enzymes (maltase, alkaline phosphatase, amino peptidase M, and glycyl-L-leucine dipeptidase) in small and large intestine, liver, and kidney were studied in rats of different ages kept in normal (8) and low (3) amounts of pups per litter. The low-protein diet for 10 days at once after weaning was found to change the mass of the organs and their digestive enzyme activities in all studied rat groups. The revealed changes were more prominent in rats kept under conditions of breast-overfeeding. In adult animals of this group, distribution of the alkaline phosphatase activity along the small intestine differed from that in control rats. The obtained results seem to confirm the fact that any disturbance of the nutrition quality in early ontogenesis leads to disturbance of the  metabolic programming of enzyme systems  of digestive and non-digestive organs.",M2
19568757,"<e>Digestive</e> enzyme activities and gastrointestinal fermentation in wood-eating catfishes.To determine what capabilities wood-eating and detritivorous catfishes have for the digestion of refractory polysaccharides with the aid of an endosymbiotic microbial community, the pH, redox potentials, concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the activity levels of 14 digestive enzymes were measured along the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of three wood-eating taxa (Panaque cf. nigrolineatus  Marañon , Panaque nocturnus, and Hypostomus pyrineusi) and one detritivorous species (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) from the family Loricariidae. Negative redox potentials (-600 mV) were observed in the intestinal fluids of the fish, suggesting that fermentative digestion was possible. However, SCFA concentrations were low (&lt;3 mM in any intestinal region), indicating that little GI fermentation occurs in the fishes' GI tracts. Cellulase and xylanase activities were low (&lt;0.03 U g(-1)), and generally decreased distally in the intestine, whereas amylolytic and laminarinase activities were five and two orders of magnitude greater, respectively, than cellulase and xylanase activities, suggesting that the fish more readily digest soluble polysaccharides. Furthermore, the Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m)) of the fishes' beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase enzymes were significantly lower than the K(m) values of microbial enzymes ingested with their food, further suggesting that the fish efficiently digest soluble components of their detrital diet rather than refractory polysaccharides. Coupled with rapid gut transit and poor cellulose digestibility, the wood-eating catfishes appear to be detritivores reliant on endogenous digestive mechanisms, as are other loricariid catfishes. This stands in contrast to truly  xylivorous  taxa (e.g., beavers, termites), which are reliant on an endosymbiotic community of microorganisms to digest refractory polysaccharides.",M2
19566817,"Rhythm of digestion: keeping time in the gastrointestinal tract.1. The best characterized mammalian circadian rhythms follow a light-entrained central master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are associated with fluctuations in the activities of clock genes, including Clock, Bmal1, Per and Cry, the products of which bind to sequences in the promoters of effector genes. This is the central clock. 2. In the present review, we discuss evidence for an independent, but interacting, gut-associated circadian clock, the peripheral clock, which is entrained by food. 3. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with a wide range of pathologies, most prominently metabolism linked, but the effects of disruption of circadian rhythms on the <e>digestive</e> system are less well studied, although also likely to lead to functional consequences. There are clues suggestive of links between gastrointestinal disorders related to inflammation, cancer and motility and disruption of peripheral rhythms. Research aimed at understanding these links is still in its infancy. 4. We also discuss practical aspects of the presence of circadian rhythms in gastrointestinal tissues for researchers related to experimental design, data interpretation and the choice of animal models. 5. There is currently sufficient evidence to suggest that circadian rhythms are important to gut function, metabolism and mucosal defence and that further investigation will uncover connections between disordered rhythms and gastrointestinal malfunction.",M2
19562350,"Inside the guts of wood-eating catfishes: can they digest wood?To better understand the structure and function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of wood-eating catfishes, the gross morphology, length, and microvilli surface area (MVSA) of the intestines of wild-caught Panaque nocturnus, P. cf. nigrolineatus  Marañon , and Hypostomus pyrineusi were measured, and contrasted against these same metrics of a closely related detritivore, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus. All four species had anatomically unspecialized intestines with no kinks, valves, or ceca of any kind. The wood-eating catfishes had body size-corrected intestinal lengths that were 35% shorter than the detritivore. The MVSA of all four species decreased distally in the intestine, indicating that nutrient absorption preferentially takes place in the proximal and mid-intestine, consistent with <e>digestive</e> enzyme activity and luminal carbohydrate profiles for these same species. Wild-caught Pt. disjunctivus, and P. nigrolineatus obtained via the aquarium trade, poorly digested wood cellulose (&lt;33% digestibility) in laboratory feeding trials, lost weight when consuming wood, and passed stained wood through their digestive tracts in less than 4 h. Furthermore, no selective retention of small particles was observed in either species in any region of the gut. Collectively, these results corroborate digestive enzyme activity profiles and gastrointestinal fermentation levels in the fishes' GI tracts, suggesting that the wood-eating catfishes are not true xylivores such as beavers and termites, but rather, are detritivores like so many other fishes from the family Loricariidae.",M2
19561206,"The effect of short- and long-term fasting on <e>digestive</e> and metabolic flexibility in the Andean toad, Bufo spinulosus.Hibernation in ectothermic animals was historically considered as a simple cold-induced torpor state resulting from the inability to maintain a high body temperature at low ambient temperatures. During the last decades this vision changed and nowadays there is a myriad of studies showing that hibernation implies different adjustments at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels. However, studies oriented to evaluate changes of whole organism structure and physiology still are scarce, which is particularly true for amphibians that hibernate on land. Accordingly, in the Andean toad (Bufo spinulosus), we investigated the effect of short-term fasting and hibernation on the hydrolytic activity of digestive enzymes, histology of the small intestine, gross morphology of digestive and other internal organs and standard metabolic rate. Based on the pattern of size variation, internal organs may be grouped into those that were affected by both season and feeding condition (small intestine, stomach and liver), those that were only affected by season (fat bodies), those that were only affected by feeding condition (kidneys) and, finally, those that did not change between the three groups (large intestine, heart and lungs). Hydrolytic activity of maltase, trehalase and aminopeptidase-N followed the same pattern of variation (feeding &gt; fasting &gt; hibernating toads), although the change for the latter enzyme was less noticeable than for the disaccharidases. Enzymatic adjustments were correlated with changes in small intestine histology: villus and enterocyte height increased from hibernating to fasting and more markedly from fasting to feeding toads. Metabolic rate decreased during hibernation to 7.8% (at 5 degrees C) and 13.6% (at 15 degrees C) of summer values, which is one of the highest metabolic depressions reported for any ectothermic vertebrate. Our results suggest that amphibian persistence in highly seasonal environments is related to a large capacity of phenotypic flexibility at different organisational levels; an ability that may be related to the extensive ranges of temporal existence and geographic distribution of these vertebrates.",M2

19497381,"Effect of diet quality and soil hardness on metabolic rate in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum.The present work is aimed to establish, in Ctenomys talarum, the physiological and behavioral adjustments undergone by individuals when they are allowed to dig burrows in soils with different hardness and fed with diets of different quality. For each soil-diet combination, we estimated: resting metabolic rate (RMR), body temperature (T(b)), body mass, digestibility, food consumption rate, transit time, reingestion rate, feces production and time devoted to feeding, resting, locomotor activity and coprophagy. Soil type and diet quality affected RMR, but response to soil hardness was verified later. Animals fed with high quality (HQ) diet showed similar body temperature irrespective of soil condition, while animals fed with low quality (LQ) diet showed lower T(b) under soft soil (SS). Individuals fed with LQ diet showed lower RMR and both, lower digestibility and high transit time of food than those fed with HQ diet. Moreover, increments in feeding and defecation rates were observed in the former group. Number of reingested feces did not differ between animals fed with diets of different quality. However, when incidence of reingestion was considered, animals fed with HQ diet showed higher values of feces ingestion. Either feeding, resting and activity patterns were arrhythmic. However, for animals fed with LQ diet a tendency to rhythmic coprophagy was observed and it could be considered as a way to optimize feeding. This study shows that RMR is limited by <e>digestive</e> efficiency which is influenced by diet quality, but also thermal stress may limit the conversion of assimilated energy into work and heat.",M2
19453169,"An acidophilic beta-galactosidase from Bispora sp. MEY-1 with high lactose hydrolytic activity under simulated gastric conditions.BgalA, a full-length gene (3,009 bp) that encodes a beta-galactosidase, was cloned from the meso-acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of BgalA shares highest identity (55.5%) with the beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus phoenicis, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolyase family 35. Purified recombinant BgalA is acidophilic, exhibiting maximum activity at pH 1.5, which is lower than that reported for other beta-galactosidases. The enzyme has high pH and thermal stability and is resistant to proteases and cations found in milk. The K(m) and V(max) of BgalA for 2-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and lactose are 5.22 mM and 120.8 micromol/(min x mg), and 0.31 mM and 137.3 micromol/(min x mg), respectively. Under simulated gastric conditions, BgalA has greater stability ( approximately 100%) and hydrolysis ratio (&gt;80%) toward milk lactose than the commercially available beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (ATCC 20423). Thus, BgalA may be a better <e>digestive</e> supplement for alleviating symptoms associated with lactase deficiency.",M2
19439635,"Effect of aflatoxin culture on intestinal function and nutrient loss in laying hens.The negative effects of aflatoxins (AFLA) on hepatic necrosis and total tract digestibility of energy, N, and amino acids have been well documented. However, the question remains if this is an effect on nutrient metabolizability alone or an effect on the intestine, or both, resulting in increased endogenous nutrient loss or reduced nutrient retention, or both. Therefore, a 2-wk feeding study with a crude AFLA culture was conducted with laying hens to measure endogenous losses and <e>digestive</e> functionality of the intestine. Hy-Line W36 hens were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets containing a crude AFLA culture from 20 to 22 wk of age. Diets were analyzed to contain 0, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.5 mg/kg of AFLA B(1). Dietary AFLA concentration had no effect on BW, egg production, or feed intake. Intestinal crypt depth (but not villus length) increased linearly with increasing AFLA concentration. Similarly, specific activity of the intestinal disaccharidase, maltase, increased quadratically by feeding up to 1.2 mg/kg of AFLA and declined at 2.5 mg/kg of AFLA (P &lt;or= 0.022). Although there was no effect of AFLA on goblet cell number, density, or crude mucin excretion (P &gt; 0.05), sialic acid excretion increased quadradically such that it was increased 12% when 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg of AFLA was fed versus the control (P &lt;or= 0.025). Digestibility of DM and N per hen per day were unaffected by AFLA. Feeding of 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg reduced the apparent digestible and AME(n) of the hen by 10 and 4%, respectively (P &lt;or= 0.025). Because intestinal characteristics (intestinal morphology, sialic acid production, and apparent digestible energy) were altered by AFLA feeding, it can be surmised that AFLA can have a direct or indirect effect, or both, on functionality of the gastrointestinal tract.",M2
19439632,"Effects of diet particle size on <e>digestive</e> parameters in D+ and D- genetic chicken lines selected for divergent digestion efficiency.The aim of this experiment was to compare the D(+) and D(-) chicken lines genetically selected for divergent digestion efficiency by testing the effects of diet particle size on growth performances, digestion efficiencies, and digestive organ weights in both lines. A 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments was used to test the D(+) and D(-) lines (sixth generation) and 3 diets, namely a pelleted standard corn diet (S), a pelleted hull diet (H) made by diluting S diet with 7% coarse cereal hulls, and a coarse corn diet (C) identical to the S diet, distributed as 30% coarsely crushed corn mixed with the 70% pelleted remaining part. Experimental diets were fed from 7 to 26 d of age. Combining results from all diets obtained at 26 d of age, D(+) birds showed 9% heavier (P &lt; 0.0001) gizzard and 10% lighter (P &lt; 0.0001) small intestine than D(-) birds. The AME(n) and digestibilities of lipids, protein, and starch measured at 3 wk of age were, on average, 3.5, 5.6, 5.8, and 0.5% higher (P &lt; 0.0002) in D(+) than in D(-) birds, respectively. Significant (P &lt;/= 0.05) interactions between lines and diets were observed for AME(n) and digestibility values. Measured:calculated AME(n) ratio and digestibilities of protein and starch were improved (P &lt; 0.05) by dietary coarse particles in D(-) birds, not in D(+) birds. Measured:calculated AME(n) ratio differed between lines by 6.0% with S diet versus 2.3% with H and C diets. In D(-) birds, the digestion increases due to coarse particles were associated with increased weights of gizzard (P &lt; 0.0001) and pancreas (P &lt; 0.05). In D(+) birds, coarse particles resulted in increased weights of gizzard (P &lt; 0.0001) only. In conclusion, growth and functions of gizzard and pancreas needed to be stimulated by dietary coarse particles for optimum digestion efficiencies in D(-) chickens, whereas such stimulations were not needed in D(+) chickens. The D(+) chickens showed high digestion efficiencies in all cases, independently of diet particle size.",M2
19415666,"Bioaccessibility, biotransformation, and transport of alpha-mangostin from Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen) using simulated digestion and Caco-2 human intestinal cells.alpha- and gamma-Mangostin are the most abundant prenylated xanthones present in the fruit of the mangosteen tree. These compounds have been reported to possess numerous bioactivities that have provided the impetus for use of mangosteen products as nutraceuticals and in functional foods and dietary supplements. The health-promoting benefits of mangosteen are dependent on delivery of the xanthones to target tissues. Here, we used simulated digestion and Caco-2 cells to investigate the <e>digestive</e> stability, bioaccessibility, and intestinal cell transport of alpha- and gamma- mangostin. Recovery of alpha- and gamma-mangostin after simulated digestion of pericarp and fruit pulp exceeded 90%. Transfer of alpha- and gamma-mangostin to the aqueous fraction during simulated digestion was efficient (65-74%) and dependent on bile salts suggesting that micellarization is required for optimal bioaccessibility of xanthones. Cell uptake of xanthones from micelles was dose dependent and intracellular concentrations were maximum by 1 h. Both free and phase II metabolites of alpha-mangostin were transported in the basolateral compartment and metabolites also effluxed into the apical chamber. Transepithelial transport of alpha-mangostin was increased during prandial-like compared to fasted conditions suggesting that absorption is enhanced by dietary fat.",M2
19376949,"Developmental adjustments of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings to diet composition.House sparrow nestlings are fed primarily on insects during the first 3 days of their life, and seeds become gradually more important afterwards. We tested whether developmental changes in size and functional capacity of the <e>digestive</e> tract in young house sparrows are genetically hard-wired and independent of diet, or can be modified by food type. Under laboratory conditions, we hand-fed young house sparrows with either a starch-free insect-like diet, based mainly on protein and fat, or a starch-containing diet with a mix of substrates similar to that offered to older nestlings in natural nests when they are gradually weaned from an insect to a seed diet. Patterns of overall development in body size and thermoregulatory ability, and in alimentary organ size increase, were relatively similar in house sparrow nestlings developing on both diets. However, total intestinal maltase activity, important in carbohydrate breakdown, was at least twice as high in house sparrow nestlings fed the starch-containing diet (P&lt;0.001). The change in maltase activity of nestlings was specific, as no change occurred in aminopeptidase-N activity in the same tissues. There was no significant diet effect on digesta retention time, but assimilation efficiency for radiolabeled starch tended to be higher (P=0.054) in nestlings raised on starch-containing diet. Future studies must test whether the diet-dependent increase in maltase activity during development is irreversible or reversible, reflecting, respectively, a developmental plasticity or a phenotypic flexibility.",M2
19363616,"Do herbivorous minnows have  plug-flow reactor  guts? Evidence from <e>digestive</e> enzyme activities, gastrointestinal fermentation, and luminal nutrient concentrations.Few investigations have empirically analyzed fish gut function in the context of chemical reactor models. In this study, digestive enzyme activities, levels of gastrointestinal fermentation products [short chain fatty acids (SCFA)], luminal nutrient concentrations, and the mass of gut contents were measured along the digestive tract in herbivorous and carnivorous minnows to ascertain whether their guts function as  plug-flow reactors  (PFRs). Four of the species, Campostoma anomalum, C. ornatum, C. oligolepis, and C. pauciradii, are members of a monophyletic herbivorous clade, whereas the fifth species, Nocomis micropogon, is a carnivore from an adjacent carnivorous clade. In the context of a PFR model, the activities of amylase, trypsin and lipase, and the concentrations of glucose, protein, and lipid were predicted to decrease moving from the proximal to the distal intestine. I found support for this as these enzyme activities and nutrient concentrations generally decreased moving distally along the intestine of the four Campostoma species. Furthermore, gut content mass and the low SCFA concentrations did not change (increase or decrease) along the gut of any species. Combined with a previous investigation suggesting that species of Campostoma have rapid gut throughput rates, the data presented here generally support Campostoma as having guts that function as PFRs. The carnivorous N. micropogon showed some differences in the measured parameters, which were interpreted in the contexts of intake and retention time to suggest that PFR function breaks down in this carnivorous species.",M2
19343521,"<e>Digestive</e> efficiency, free amino acid pools and quality of growth performance in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) affected by light regimes and vaccine types.This study comprised the results of three different seawater trials using unique combination of techniques to study protease digestive efficiency and growth performance quality to illustrate the effects of light regimes and vaccine types in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Fish with higher growth had higher trypsin (T) and chymotrypsin (C) specific activities with higher T/C ratio or slope T/C ratio [calculated from the regression between trypsin (y) and chymotrypsin (x) specific activities] in the pyloric caeca. The T/C ratios indicated fish growth rates over a period of 1-2 months, while the slope T/C ratios indicated fish growth rates at sampling. Adaptation period for adjustment to the new environment of continuous light was 70 days, indicated by the differences in trypsin specific activities and the crossing of slope T/C ratio regressions following with the changes in growth rate directions between the control and the treated group. Vaccine types affected fish vertebral growth, and additional continuous light enhanced the impact of vaccines on fish growth during springtime, indicated by differences in slope T/C ratios. Continuous light stimulated fish growth during winter to spring, when the natural day length was short, without significantly changing white muscle and oocyte qualities in the fish of about 500 g, except for significantly increased white muscle RNA concentration. Continuous light also reduced fish growth rate later during summer, when the natural day length was long, by precedently decreasing the T/C ratio in late spring. Interestingly, plasma levels of free lysine related to tryptic digestion were correlated with trypsin specific activity levels. Continuous light caused higher levels of most free amino acids (FAA) involved in nitrogen metabolism, higher incorporation of essential FAA for protein synthesis, and higher protein turnover rate (free hydroxyproline levels) in both plasma and white muscle. However, continuous light did not affect higher protein content, intracellular buffering capacity and RNA levels in the white muscle of the fish of about 1 kg, probably due to limitation of FAA available for protein synthesis. It is therefore suggested that enhancing fish growth by continuous light stimulation should be accompanied by increasing availability or content of dietary protein (and probably minerals), which in turn would improve the quality of fish growth performance through increasing fillet protein concentration, strengthening vertebral growth, and delaying oocyte development.",M2
19320931,"Comparison of total tract digestibility, development of visceral organs and <e>digestive</e> tract of Mong cai and Yorkshire x Landrace piglets fed diets with different fibre sources.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of piglet age and dietary fibre source on the development of visceral organs and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and on growth performance and total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) in local [pure-breed Mong cai (MC)] and exotic [Landrace x Yorkshire (LY)] piglets. The experimental diets contained different fibre sources: C (basal diet), RB (basal diet + rice bran), SPVM (basal diet + sweet potato vine meal) and CReM (basal diet + cassava residue meal). The neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content in diet C and the fibrous diets was 8.8% and 17.1%-17.7% respectively (dry matter basis). Collection of faecal samples to determine TTAD was carried out for five consecutive days before the experiment was finished (63 days). The piglets were killed at the age of 10 days (before being given the same solid feed), 30 days (weaning, 20 days after solid feed introduced) and 63 days (33 days after being given the different fibrous diets) when the length of intestinal segments, weight of organs (liver, heart, kidneys) and empty weight of the GIT (stomach, small intestine, caecum and colon + rectum) were measured. As the age of animals increased, the relative weight of organs and the length of intestines (expressed on a mass-specific basis) decreased (p &lt; 0.05), and the weight of GIT increased (p &lt; 0.001). The piglets fed fibrous diets had heavier GIT than those fed diet C with the highest values in CReM (p &lt; 0.05). The colon + rectum length was not significantly different among C, RB and SPVM, but was shorter than in CReM (p &lt; 0.05). Coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients in the fibrous diets was lower than in C (p &lt; 0.01). Average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in C, RB and CReM were not different and were better than in SPVM (p &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in the weights of organs between the two breeds at day 10, 30 and 63 (p &gt; 0.05). The weight and length of GIT were not significantly different between the two breeds at day 10 and day 30, but were greater for MC at day 63. The caecum and colon + rectum at 10 and 30 days were longer in MC than in LY (p &lt; 0.001). The relative development of GIT post-weaning was higher than pre-weaning, the difference being most apparent in MC. As a result at 63 days, MC had heavier visceral organs and GIT, and longer intestines on fibrous diets than LY (p &lt; 0.05). The MC at 63 days had higher CTTAD of organic matter, gross energy, crude fibre and NDF (p &lt; 0.001) and ether extract and crude protein (p &lt; 0.05), but lower ADG and poorer FCR than LY (p &lt; 0.001). It can be concluded that the GIT of the MC piglets developed more rapidly than LY when they were introduced to solid feed, and that the difference was more marked on the fibrous diets and after weaning, which resulted in higher total tract digestibility of nutrients in MC compared with LY. Cassava residue meal was better digested than RB and SPVM, and supported higher live weight gains.",M2
19297426,"<e>Digestive</e> stability of xanthophylls exceeds that of carotenes as studied in a dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal system.Epidemiological studies have suggested that high consumption of tomato products is associated with a lower risk for chronic diseases. To exert their health effect, the phytochemicals of tomatoes have to be bioavailable and therefore it implies their stability through the digestion process. Here, we assessed the digestive stability of the red-pigmented lycopene and other carotenoids brought in nutritional quantity within different food matrixes, using the TNO gastrointestinal tract model (TIM). This multicompartmental dynamic system accurately reproduces the main parameters of gastric and small intestinal digestion in human. In vitro digestions of a standard meal containing red tomato (RT), yellow tomato (devoid of lycopene), or lycopene beadlets were performed. Zeaxanthin and lutein were stable throughout artificial digestions, whereas beta-carotene and all-trans lycopene were degraded (approximately 30 and 20% loss at the end of digestion, respectively) in the jejunal and ileal compartments. The recovery of beta-carotene in the digesta of the RT meal was significantly lower than that in the yellow one, showing a food matrix effect. In the same way, until 180 min of digestion, the recovery percentages of all-trans lycopene from RT were significantly lower than those issued from the supplement. Isomeric conformation also influenced the stability of carotenoids, 5-cis lycopene being the most stable isomer followed by all-trans and 9-cis. No trans-cis isomerization of lycopene occurred in the TIM. By using a relevant dynamic in vitro system, this study allowed us to gain further insight into the parameters influencing the digestive stability of carotenoids, and therefore their bioavailability, in humans.",M2
19294681,"<e>Digestive</e> proteolysis organization in two closely related Tenebrionid beetles: red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) and confused flour beetle (Tribolium confusum).The spectra of Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum larval digestive peptidases were characterized with respect to the spatial organization of protein digestion in the midgut. The pH of midgut contents in both species increased from 5.6-6.0 in the anterior to 7.0-7.5 in the posterior midgut. However, the pH optimum of the total proteolytic activity of the gut extract from either insect was pH 4.1. Approximately 80% of the total proteolytic activity was in the anterior and 20% in the posterior midgut of either insect when evaluated in buffers simulating the pH and reducing conditions characteristic for each midgut section. The general peptidase activity of gut extracts from either insect in pH 5.6 buffer was mostly due to cysteine peptidases. In the weakly alkaline conditions of the posterior midgut, the serine peptidase contribution was 31 and 41% in T. castaneum and T. confusum, respectively. A postelectrophoretic peptidase activity assay with gelatin also revealed the important contribution of cysteine peptidases in protein digestion in both Tribolium species. The use of a postelectrophoretic activity assay with p-nitroanilide substrates and specific inhibitors revealed a set of cysteine and serine endopeptidases, 8 and 10 for T. castaneum, and 7 and 9 for T. confusum, respectively. Serine peptidases included trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, and elastase-like enzymes, the latter being for the first time reported in Tenebrionid insects.

We show that the digesta of the brushtail possum and sheep form a contiguous matrix of particles from which a fluid phase can be expressed by the application of pressure. These findings are examined in respect of their possible contribution to phase separation and the sorting of particles within the gastrointestinal tracts of vertebrates. The morphological adaptations and motility of various <e>digestive</e> compartments are related to the processing of digesta with high solid phase content, in particular the formation and dispersion of the particle matrices. A brief description is given of techniques for evaluating the properties of digesta with high solid phase content.",M2
19256079,"Prey envenomation does not improve <e>digestive</e> performance in Taiwanese pit vipers (Trimeresurus gracilis and T. stejnegeri stejnegeri).It has been a common belief that snake venom may help in the digestion of its prey, although direct examples and supporting evidence have not been sufficient. To address this, the present study examined whether preinjecting natural amounts of pit viper venom into experimental mice may accelerate their digestion by the snakes or gain energy benefit as compared to the control without the envenomation. Live adults of two Asian pit viper species Trimeresurus gracilis and T. stejnegeri stejnegeri, which inhabit the cold and warm environment respectively, were the subjects studied herein. A natural dose of 1.2 mg of each of the pit viper venom in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the mouse (about 10% of the snake mass) before it was being fed to the same species of vipers, while the pit vipers in control group were given mouse injected with sterile PBS. The snakes were kept at 14 degrees C or 24 degrees C, and parameters of gut passage time, costs of digestion, and/or digestive efficiency were measured. The results did not support the hypotheses that envenomation facilitates prey digestion. The venom in fact caused longer first defecation time and lower assimilation energy at 14 degrees C. Besides, the time to reach the oxygen consumption peak, and the first defecation time of T. s. stejnegeri were longer than that of T. gracilis.",M2
19234944,"Gastrointestinal effects of low-digestible carbohydrates.Low-digestible carbohydrates (LDCs) are carbohydrates that are incompletely or not absorbed in the small intestine but are at least partly fermented by bacteria in the large intestine. Fiber, resistant starch, and sugar alcohols are types of LDCs. Given potential health benefits (including a reduced caloric content, reduced or no effect on blood glucose levels, non-cariogenic effect) the prevalence of LDCs in processed foods is increasing. Many of the benefits of LDCs are related to the inability of human <e>digestive</e> enzymes to break down completely the carbohydrates into absorbable saccharides and the subsequent fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon. As a result, LDCs may affect laxation and cause gastrointestinal effects, including abdominal discomfort, flatus, and diarrhea, especially at higher or excessive intakes. Such responses, though transient, affect the perception of the well-being of consumers and their acceptance of food products containing LDCs. Current recommendations for fiber intake do not consider total LDC consumption nor recommend an upper limit for LDC intake based on potential gastrointestinal effects. Therefore, a review of published studies reporting gastrointestinal effects of LDCs was conducted. We included only studies published in refereed journals in English. Additionally, we excluded studies of subjects with incomplete or abnormal functioning gastrointestinal tracts or where antibiotics, stimulant laxatives, or other drugs affecting motility were included. Only in studies with a control period, either placebo treatment or no LDC treatment, were included. Studies must have included an acceptable measure of gastrointestinal effect. Sixty-eight studies and six review articles were evaluated. This review describes definitions, classifications, and mechanisms of LDCs, evaluates published human feeding studies of fifteen LDCs for associations between gastrointestinal effects and levels of LDC intake, and presents recommendations for LDC consumption and further research.",M2
19218520,"Using omeprazole to link the components of the post-prandial alkaline tide in the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias.After a meal, dogfish exhibit a metabolic alkalosis in the bloodstream and a marked excretion of basic equivalents across the gills to the external seawater. We used the H(+), K(+)-ATPase pump inhibitor omeprazole to determine whether these post-prandial alkaline tide events were linked to secretion of H(+) (accompanied by Cl(-)) in the stomach. Sharks were fitted with indwelling stomach tubes for pretreatment with omeprazole (five doses of 5 mg omeprazole per kilogram over 48 h) or comparable volumes of vehicle (saline containing 2% DMSO) and for sampling of gastric chyme. Fish were then fed an involuntary meal by means of the stomach tube consisting of minced flatfish muscle (2% of body mass) suspended in saline (4% of body mass total volume). Omeprazole pre-treatment delayed the post-prandial acidification of the gastric chyme, slowed the rise in Cl(-) concentration of the chyme and altered the patterns of other ions, indicating inhibition of H(+) and accompanying Cl(-) secretion. Omeprazole also greatly attenuated the rise in arterial pH and bicarbonate concentrations and reduced the net excretion of basic equivalents to the water by 56% over 48 h. Arterial blood CO(2) pressure (Pa(CO(2))) and plasma ions were not substantially altered. These results indicate that elevated gastric H(+) secretion (as HCl) in the <e>digestive</e> process is the major cause of the systemic metabolic alkalosis and the accompanying rise in base excretion across the gills that constitute the alkaline tide in the dogfish.",M2
19213714,"Vinasse added to dried sugar beet pulp: preference rate, voluntary intake, and <e>digestive</e> utilization in sheep.Three experiments were performed to study the nutritional characteristics of sugar beet pulp (SBP) according to the concentration of vinasse (condensed molasses solubles) added. Eighteen Merino ewes were used to study preference in Exp. 1, and 18 Merino ewes were used in Exp. 2 to study voluntary intake of SBP with different amounts of vinasse inclusion (0, 7, and 13% on a DM basis; SBP0, SBP7, and SPB13, respectively). Sheep showed a marked preference for SBP with vinasse, regardless of the amount of addition, whereas voluntary feed intake was not affected (P &gt; 0.34). Eight ruminally cannulated Merino ewes were used in Exp. 3 to study rumen fermentation of SBP0 and SBP13. Regardless of the diet fed to the animals (SBP0 or SBP13), disappearance rates of DM, NDF, and CP were greater when SBP13, compared with SBP0, was incubated in sacco (P &lt; 0.05), and NDF and CP disappearance rates were increased when animals were fed the SBP13 diet. No significant differences were observed for pH, ammonia concentration, or total or individual VFA in the ruminal liquor of sheep at different sampling times after feeding (P &gt; 0.23) in response to vinasse addition. Experiment 4 was designed to study digestibility, solid passage rate, and excretion of purine derivatives from 12 Merino ewes fed SBP0 and SBP13. Digestibility of NDF tended to be greater (P &lt; 0.10) for the SBP13 group compared with the SBP0 group; digestibilities of DM, OM, CP, and ADF were not affected (P &gt; 0.11). Digesta flow kinetics and urinary excretion of purine derivatives were not significantly affected by the presence (SBP13) or absence (SBP0) of vinasse in the diet (P &gt; 0.21). In conclusion, sheep showed a clear preference for SBP with vinasse. However, the lack of significant differences in most of the in vivo variables measured indicates that ewes can be satisfactorily fed with any of the amounts of vinasse inclusion studied.",M2
19204893,"Effects of in vitro-digested ginsenosides on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, is frequently used in traditional oriental medicines. The major active components of ginseng are the saponins, which are also called ginsenosides and are known for their pharmacological and biological activities. In this study, the effects of ginsenosides on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated after the ginsenosides were in vitro-digested with artificial gastric and intestinal fluids. Ginseng extract was incubated with an artificial <e>digestive</e> fluid, and the changes were analyzed by HPLC, after which the effects of the digest on 3T3-L1 adipocytes were observed. Polar ginsenosides were transformed into less-polar ginsenosides at the low pH of the gastric acid, without any influence from the digestive enzymes. Additionally, the artificially digested ginsenosides showed inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with various ginseng samples that possessed different polarities, the less polar ginsenosides were more effective in reducing lipid accumulation. Furthermore, when the Rg3, Rk1, and Rg5 ginsenosides were used to treat the cells individually, Rg3 ginsenoside was the most effective at inhibiting lipid accumulation. These results suggest that the less polar ginsenosides, particularly ginsenoside Rg3, effectively reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Accordingly, our results suggest that ginsenoside Rg3 should be developed as an antiobesity treatment.",M2
19203402,"The effects of different prey regimes on the proteolytic digestion of nymphs of the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae).The effects of different prey regimes on the performance and <e>digestive</e> physiology of the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), were assessed. Specifically, P. maculiventris nymphs were fed on Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), larvae; Egyptian cotton leafworm (ECW); Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae); larvae; Calliphora spp. (CAL) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) pupae or a mixture of the three prey. No differences in development and weight gain were observed when P. maculiventris nymphs were fed different prey species (CPB, ECW or CAL). However, an increase in weight gain and a reduction in the duration of the stadia were observed for nymphs fed with a mixture of the three prey. To investigate the physiological background, biochemical analysis were carried out on insects dissected at the end of the feeding assay. We have found that the proteolytic activity in the salivary glands of P. maculiventris nymphs was not affected by prey species, whereas the relative activity of these proteases in the midgut depends on the prey. Moreover, gel assays proved that the proteolytic profiles of midguts from P. maculiventris nymphs feeding on CPB, ECW and CPB closely resembled those of their prey. All together, these results suggest that P. maculiventris may utilize enzymes from the prey they consume that may facilitate the process of digestion.",M2
19194813,"In-vitro digestibility and amino acid composition of soy protein isolate cross-linked with microbial transglutaminase followed by heating with ribose.Cross-linked soy protein isolate (SPI) gels were produced via single-treatment of SPI with microbial transglutaminase (MTG) for 5 h or 24 h, or with ribose for 2 h, or via combined-treatments of SPI with MTG followed by heating with ribose. Assessment of gel strength and solubility concluded that measures which increased protein cross-links resulted in improved gel strength; however, in most cases the digestibility and amino acid content of the gels were reduced. The combined treated gel of SPI/MTG for 24 h/ribose was more easily digested by <e>digestive</e> enzymes and retained higher amounts of amino acids compared with the control Maillard gels of SPI with ribose. MTG consumed lysine and glutamine and reduced the availability of amino acids for the Maillard reaction with ribose. MTG was able to preserve the nutritional value of SPI against the destructive effect of the Maillard reaction and cross-links.",M2
19178609,"No easy solution for the fractionation of faecal nitrogen in captive wild herbivores: results of a pilot study.Faecal nitrogen (FN) concentration is used as a marker for habitat quality and <e>digestive</e> efficiency in free-ranging herbivores. In herbivores, FN can be separated into undigested plant N (analysed as the N concentration of the neutral detergent residue) and metabolic faecal N (MFN). It has been suggested that by differential analysis of the faecal fibre-bound N, the MFN fraction can be further split into a bacterial N and an endogenous N fraction [Hesta et al., Br. J. Nutr. 90 (2003) 1007]. We applied these methods to 96 faecal samples of 48 mammalian herbivore species from zoos. Species were grouped into coprophageous and non-coprophageous hindgut fermenters and ruminating and non-ruminating foregut fermenters. Diet was not controlled. The FN decreased with body mass, possibly reflecting higher proportions of concentrates in diets of smaller animals. The proportion of MFN increased with FN, indicating that higher quality food might enhance the gastrointestinal bacterial flora. The only outlier to this pattern was the lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens), confirming the low relevance of fermentative digestion in this herbivorous 'carnivore'. No relevant differences between the four digestion types were noted. The proportion of endogenous faecal N (32-80% of FN) was always higher than that of bacterial faecal N (7-30%), which contradicts basal understanding of herbivore digestive physiology. Thus, the method of Hesta et al. (2003) does not appear applicable to herbivores. While the results do not exclude the possibility that detailed differences might occur between digestion types, they indicate a high degree of similarity between herbivores that rely on bacterial fermentation, regardless of their digestion type, with respect to metabolic faecal losses.",M2
19166959,"Sex differences in <e>digestive</e> traits in sexually size-dimorphic birds: Insights from an assimilation efficiency experiment on black-tailed godwit.Digestive assimilation efficiency is considered a trait with important implications for animal ecology. However, practically all studies have ignored the importance of sex differences in food assimilation efficiency (AE). Here, we investigated sex differences in dietary and physiological parameters in the Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa limosa feeding on rice seeds, a species with sexual dimorphism in body size and body mass. Gross daily food intake, gross energy intake, gross energy output and metabolizable energy intake did not vary significantly between sexes, but godwit females showed lower faeces energy density and higher AE than males. Mass-specific AE was similar in males and females, and the difference in AE could be attributed to the females' greater body mass. We suggest that a differential AE could play a role in explaining sex differences in habitat or micro-habitat selection during the non-breeding season in bird species with sexual dimorphism in size. Finally, we addressed the question about assimilation efficiency accuracy in models that estimate prey acquisitions by declining shorebirds as the Black-tailed Godwit.",M2
19127367,"Food utilisation and <e>digestive</e> ability of aquatic and semi-terrestrial crayfishes, Cherax destructor and Engaeus sericatus (Astacidae, Parastacidae).Both Engaeus sericatus and Cherax destructor are omnivorous crayfishes consuming a variety of food items. Materials identified in the faeces of both E. sericatus and C. destructor consisted of mainly plant material with minor amounts of arthropod animals, algae and fungi. The morphology of the gastric mill of C. destructor suggests that it is mainly involved in crushing of food material while the gastric mill of E. sericatus appears to be better suited to cutting of food material. Given this, the gastric mill of E. sericatus may be better able to cut the cellulose and hemicellulose fibres associated with fibrous plant material. In contrast, the gastric mill of C. destructor appears to be more efficient in grinding soft materials such as animal protein and algae. Both species accumulated high amounts of lipids in their midgut glands (about 60% of the dry mass) which were dominated by triacylglycerols (81-82% of total lipids). The dominating fatty acids were 16:0, 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-9), 18:2(n-6), and 18:3(n-3). The two latter fatty acids can only be synthesised by plants, and are thus indicative of the consumption of terrestrial plants by the crayfishes. The similarity analysis of the fatty acid patterns showed three distinct clusters of plants and each of the crayfish species. The complement of digestive enzymes, proteinases, total cellulase, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, beta-glucosidase, laminarinase and xylanase within midgut gland suggests that both C. destructor and E. sericatus are capable of hydrolysing a variety of substrates associated with an omnivorous diet. Higher activities of total cellulase, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase and beta-glucosidase indicate that E. sericatus is better able to hydrolyse cellulose within plant material than C. destructor. In contrast to E. sericatus, higher total protease and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in the midgut gland of C. destructor suggests that this species is better able to digest animal materials in the form of arthropods. Differences in total cellulase and gastric mill morphology suggest that E. sericatus is more efficient at digesting plant material than C. destructor. However, the contents of faecal pellets and the fatty acid compositions seem to indicate that both species opportunistically feed on the most abundant and easily accessible food items.",M2
19127366,"Effect of meal size on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption in fishes with different locomotive and <e>digestive</e> performance.Effects of feeding on pre-exercise VO(2) and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) after exhaustive exercise were investigated in sedentary southern catfish, active herbivorous grass carp, omnivorous crucian carp, and sluggish omnivorous darkbarbel catfish to test whether feeding had different effects on EPOC and to compare EPOC in fishes with different ecological habits. For fasting fish, the pre-exercise and peak post-exercise VO(2) were higher and recovery rates were faster in crucian carp and grass carp compared to those of darkbarbel catfish and southern catfish. EPOC magnitudes of grass carp and southern catfish were significantly larger than those of crucian carp and darkbarbel catfish. Feeding had no significant effect on peak post-exercise VO(2), recovery rate, and EPOC magnitude in grass carp. Both the pre-exercise and peak post-exercise VO(2) increased with meal size, while the EPOC magnitude and duration decreased significantly in the larger meal size groups of crucian carp and southern catfish. In darkbarbel catfish, both the pre-exercise and peak post-exercise VO(2) increased with meal size, but the VO(2) increment elicited by exercise was larger in feeding groups compared with the fasting group. These results suggest that (1) the characteristics of the post-exercise VO(2) profile, such as peak post-exercise VO(2) and recovery rate, were closely related to the activity of fishes, whereas the EPOC magnitude was not and (2) the effects of feeding on EPOC were more closely related to the postprandial increase in VO(2).",M2
19116160,"Structuring food emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract to modify lipid digestion.The importance of nutrient lipids in the human diet has led to major advances in understanding the mechanisms of lipid digestion and absorption. With these advances has come new recognition that the matrix in which lipids are presented (i.e. food structure) in the diet could influence the rate of lipid digestion and hence the bioavailability of fatty acids. As a consequence, there is growing interest in understanding how food material properties can be manipulated under physiological conditions to control the uptake of lipids and lipid-soluble components. The lipids in many, if not most, processed foods are normally present as emulsions, which can be end products in themselves or part of a more complex food system. In this review, we discuss the formation and properties of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, especially how these emulsions are modified as they traverse through the gastrointestinal tract. Among other factors, the changes in the nature of the droplet adsorbed layer and the droplet size play a major role in controlling the action of lipases and lipid digestion. Greater knowledge and understanding of how the <e>digestive</e> system treats, transports and utilizes lipids will allow the microstructural design of foods to achieve a specific, controlled physiological response.",M2
19096068,"Interaction of dietary high-oleic-acid sunflower hulls and different fat sources in broiler chickens.The effect of dietary fat sources (high-oleic-acid sunflower seeds, HOASS; palm oil, PO; and high-oleic-acid sunflower oil, HOASO) and high-oleic-acid sunflower hulls (HOAS hulls; 40 g/kg of diet) on performance, <e>digestive</e> organ size, fat digestibility, and fatty acid profile in abdominal fat and blood serum parameters was evaluated in chickens (from 1 to 21 d of age). Bird performance and digestive organ size were not affected by either dietary fat source or sunflower hull supplementation. Fat digestibility in birds fed diets enriched (HOASS and HOASO) in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was increased compared with those fed the PO diet. The addition of sunflower hulls did not modify fat digestibility. The fatty acids pattern of abdominal fat reflected the dietary fat profile. The greatest concentrations of C16:0 and C18:0 were found in birds fed PO diets. The C18:1n-9 content was increased in birds that received HOASS and HOASO diets compared with those fed PO diets. The greatest content of C18:2n-6 was observed in birds fed HOASS diets. The ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to MUFA was significantly increased in birds fed PO diets compared with those fed HOASS or HOASO diets. The addition of sunflower hulls to the diets resulted in a decrease of C18:2n-6 and PUFA concentrations and PUFA:MUFA ratio in abdominal fat. Dietary fat sources and sunflower hulls modify blood triglycerides and serum lipoproteins. A decrease in triglyceride concentrations was observed in birds fed HOASS diets compared with those fed PO and HOASO diets. The greatest concentrations of serum high density, very low density (VLDL), and low density lipoproteins were found in birds receiving HOASO, PO, and HOASS diets, respectively. The addition of sunflower hulls to the diets caused an increase of serum triglycerides and VLDL concentrations. The MUFA-enriched diets had lower triglyceride and VLDL concentrations than did diets rich in saturated fatty acids. However, the sunflower hull addition had the opposite effect.",M2
19093247,"Effect of in ovo threonine supplementation on early growth, immunological responses and <e>digestive</e> enzyme activities in broiler chickens.1. The effects of injecting threonine in ovo on early growth, some immunological responses and the activity of digestive enzymes of broiler chicks were investigated. Fertile eggs were distributed into 6 groups, each of 60. These were: untreated control, sham control, 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg threonine. Threonine was dissolved in 0.5 ml sterile saline and inoculated into the yolk sac of the 14-d-old embryo through the narrow end of the egg. 2. The ratio of chick to egg weight was 1.6% higher in the group given 30 mg threonine and at 28 d of age chicks receiving threonine were 29 to 79 g heavier than untreated controls. 3. Food conversion ratio until 7 d after hatching was improved in those chicks receiving 10, 20 or 40 mg threonine but there was no significant effect on the activities of amylase, pepsin or trypsin. 4. The humoral response to sheep red blood cells was significantly greater in those groups receiving 10, 20 or 30 mg threonine supplementation than in untreated controls. 5. The response to phytohaemagglutinin-P, a measure of the cell-mediated immune response, was not affected, however. 6. It is concluded that injections of 20 to 30 mg threonine into yolk sac can improve post-hatching growth and humoral responses of broiler chicks.",M2
19072543,"Factors affecting the bioaccessibility of polybrominated diphenylethers in an in vitro digestion model.The factors affecting the bioaccessibility of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in foodstuffs were investigated using a static in vitro model. The results showed that the gastrointestinal digestion increased the bioaccessibility of PBDEs in the intestinal solution. The incubation time significantly affected the bioaccessibility, which increased to about 25% in 4-6 h and reached equilibrium. The adsorption and release processes followed a Langmuir isotherm equation (R(2) &gt; 0.99). The concentrations of PBDEs in foodstuffs did not affect the bioaccessibility, while the ratios of liquid to the mass of foodstuffs had a significant effect when the ratios were less than 90. The bioaccessibility of PBDEs increased with increasing pH, reached a maximum at a pH of 7.3 +/- 0.1, and then decreased in the intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the <e>digestive</e> parameters playing such an important role for the bioaccessibility of PBDEs in foodstuffs. Even though in vitro tests are often conducted to study bioaccessibility, the extrapolation of such results to explain what is happening inside the highly dynamic environment of the human gastrointestinal tract is still sometimes uncertain and sometimes underestimated.",M2
19056761,"In vivo imaging of zebrafish <e>digestive</e> organ function using multiple quenched fluorescent reporters.Optical clarity of larvae makes the zebrafish ideal for real-time analyses of vertebrate organ function through the use of fluorescent reporters of enzymatic activities. A key function of digestive organs is to couple the generation of enzymes with mechanical processes that enable nutrient availability and absorption. However, it has been extremely difficult, and in many cases not possible, to directly observe digestive processes in a live vertebrate. Here we describe a new method to visualize intestinal protein and lipid processing simultaneously in live zebrafish larvae using a quenched fluorescent protein (EnzChek) and phospholipid (PED6). By employing these reagents, we found that wild-type larvae exhibit significant variation in intestinal phospholipase and protease activities within a group but display a strong correlation between the activities within individuals. Furthermore, we found that pancreas function is essential for larval digestive protease activity but not for larval intestinal phospholipase activity. Although fat-free (ffr) mutant larvae were previously described to exhibit impaired lipid processes, we found they also had significantly reduced protease activity. Finally, we selected and evaluated compounds that were previously suggested to have altered phospholipase activity and are known or suspected to have inflammatory effects in the intestinal tract including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and identified a compound that significantly increases intestinal phospholipid processing. Thus the multiple fluorescent reporter-based methodology facilitates the rapid analysis of digestive organ function in live zebrafish larvae.",M2
19043049,"<e>Digestive</e> physiology of the Burmese python: broad regulation of integrated performance.As an apparent adaptation to predictably long episodes of fasting, the sit-and-wait foraging Burmese python experiences unprecedented regulation of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular performance with feeding and fasting. The ingestion of a meal signals the quiescent gut tissues to start secreting digestive acid and enzymes, to upregulate intestinal brush-border enzymes and nutrient transporters, and to grow. An integrated phenomenon, digestion is also characterized by increases in the mass, and presumably the function, of the heart, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Once digestion is complete, the python's stomach and small intestine rapidly downregulate performance. Much of the modulation of intestinal function can be explained by the 5-fold increase in microvillus length and apical surface area with feeding, and the subsequent shortening of the microvilli after digestion has finished. Digestion for the Burmese python is a relatively expensive endeavor, evident by the as much as a 44-fold increase in metabolic rate and equivalent in cost to as much as 37% of the meal's energy. Their large metabolic response is supported by substantial increases in ventilation and cardiac output and the apparent catabolism of glucose and lipids. Unmatched in the magnitude of its numerous physiological responses to feeding, the Burmese python is a very attractive model for examining the capacities and regulatory mechanisms of physiological performance.",M2
19016237,"Many-lined sun skinks (Mabuya multifasciata) do not compensate for the costs of tail loss by increasing feeding rate or <e>digestive</e> efficiency.We used the many-lined sun skink (Mabuya multifasciata) as a model system to evaluate the energetic and locomotor costs of tail loss, and to examine whether tailless skinks compensate for the costs of tail loss by increasing feeding rate or digestive efficiency. We successively removed three tail segments from each of the 20 experimental skinks initially having intact tails. Energy content in each removed tail segment was measured, and swimming performance was measured for each experimental skink before and after each tail-removing treatment. Another independent sample of 19 skinks with intact tails were measured for swimming performance to serve as controls for successive measurements taken for the experimental skinks. Tailless experimental skinks and control skinks were then measured for food intake and digestive efficiency. Tail loss affected swimming speed, but the adverse influence was not significant until more than 55% of the tail (in length) was lost. Our data show that partial tail loss may not severely affect energy stores or locomotor performance in M. multifasciata. However, as tail breaks occurred more frequently in the proximal portion of the tail in skinks collected from the field, we conclude that caudal autotomy occurring in nature often incurs substantial energetic and locomotor costs. As tailless and tailed skinks did not differ in food intake, apparent digestive coefficient and assimilation efficiency, we conclude that tailless individuals do not compensate for the costs of tail loss by increasing feeding rate or digestive efficiency in M. multifasciata.",M2
19012607,"Effect of feed type and essential oil product on equine chewing activity.The ingestive and post-digestion effect of a blend of special essential oil compounds (EO) on eating, chewing and faecal parameters were measured in horses. Ingestive effects appear after no adaptation. Post-digestion effects appear after adaptation. Six Icelandic horses were assigned to two groups in a Latin Square subplot design with EO treatments to four different roughage types and four different concentrates. The horses were fed four different roughage meals and two different concentrate meals on each of the four sampling days. Eating time and saliva were observed during meals. Jaw movements (JM) were recorded using a special chewing halter. Eating time was derived from JM and related to DM intake. The size characteristics of faecal particles were measured by using image analysis. All chewing characteristics measured were significantly affected by roughage (p &lt; 0.001) and concentrate type (p &lt; 0.01). EO had a significant ingestive effect on the frequency of observed saliva during concentrate meals. No significant (p &lt; 0.05) post-<e>digestive</e> or ingestive effect of EO was found for any measured chewing characteristic, which was reflected in the absence of effect on faecal particle dimensions. In conclusion, effect of type of roughage and concentrate was more significant than potential effects of EO.",M2

18997071,"Influence of different levels of concentrate and ruminally undegraded protein on <e>digestive</e> variables in beef heifers.This experiment evaluated the effect of 2 levels of diet concentrate (20 and 40% of DM) and 2 levels of ruminally undegraded protein (RUP: 25 and 40% of CP) on nutrient intake, total and partial apparent nutrient digestibility, microbial protein synthesis, and ruminal and physiological variables. Eight Nellore heifers (233 +/- 14 kg of BW) fitted with ruminal, abomasal, and ileal cannulas were used. The animals were held in individual sheltered pens of approximately 15 m(2) and fed twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h for ad libitum intake. Heifers were allocated in two 4 x 4 Latin square designs, containing 8 heifers, 4 experimental periods, and 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. All statistical analyses were performed using PROC MIXED of SAS. Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and chromic oxide (Cr(2)O(3)) were used to estimate digesta fluxes and fecal excretion. Purine derivative (PD) excretion and abomasal purine bases were used to estimate the microbial N (MN) synthesis. No significant interaction (P &gt; 0.10) between dietary levels of RUP and concentrate was observed. There was no effect of treatment (P = 0.24) on DMI. Both markers led to the same estimates of fecal, abomasal, and ileal DM fluxes, and digestibilities of DM and individual nutrients. Ruminal pH was affected by sampling time (P &lt; 0.001), but no interaction between treatment and sampling time was observed (P = 0.71). There was an interaction between treatment and sampling time (P &lt; 0.001) for ruminal NH(3)-N concentration. A linear decrease (P = 0.04) over sampling time was observed for the higher level of RUP, whereas a quadratic effect (P &lt; 0.001) of sampling time was observed for the lower level of RUP. The higher level of dietary concentrate led to greater MN yield regardless of the level of RUP. The MN yield and the efficiency of microbial yield estimated from urinary PD excretion produced greater (P &lt; 0.01) values than those estimated by either TiO(2) or Cr(2)O(3), which did not differ (P = 0.63) from each other. However, all methods yielded values that were within the range reported in the literature. In conclusion, no interactions between dietary levels of RUP and concentrate were observed for ruminal and digestive parameters. Neither RUP nor concentrate level affected DMI. Titanium dioxide showed to be similar to Cr(2)O(3) as an external marker to measure digestibility and nutrient fluxes in cattle.",M2
18997064,"Effect of solid feed on energy and protein utilization in milk-fed veal calves.Little knowledge on the <e>digestive</e> and metabolic utilization of solid feed in veal calves is available. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of 2 solid feeds offered at 2 feeding levels (FL90 and FL105) in addition to a milk replacer on heat production (HP) and protein and fat deposition in veal calves. Sixteen calves (148.0 +/- 3.7 kg) received milk replacer (75% of a reference DE allowance) and solid feeds that consisted of corn grain and pelleted hydrolyzed wheat gluten without (CO) or with (CS) chopped wheat straw. The solid feed supply provided 15 or 30% of the reference DE allowance to achieve FL90 or FL105, resulting in 4 treatments: CO90, CS90, CO105, and CS105. A fifth treatment consisted of using the milk replacer alone at FL90 (treatment M90) and was measured in 4 other calves. All calves were kept individually for 7 d in a respiration chamber to estimate energy and N balances and fasting HP. The digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, GE, and major nutrients were at least 94% for M90 and decreased when solid feed was added (P &lt; 0.05). Methane production was negligible in M90 calves and increased when solid feed was given (ranging 8 to 23 L/d between CO90 and CS105, P &lt; 0.01), indicative of ruminal fermentation. The provision of increasing amounts of solid feed decreased urinary energy in connection with a tendency (P = 0.09) for a reduction of urinary glucose excretion. The metabolizability of DE was greater with the milk replacer (95.6%) and decreased when straw was added (P &lt; 0.01). Neither CO90 or CS90 affected HP and total energy retention (P &gt; 0.05). Dietary treatment had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on activity HP (53 kJ/kg of BW(0.85) daily) but did affect thermic effect of feeding; efficiency of utilizing ME for maintenance and growth was greatest for the M90 calves (84.5%, P = 0.02). Fasting HP tended (P = 0.09) to increase at the greatest FL (308 vs. 298 kJ/kg of BW(0.85) daily). Maintenance ME requirement increased (P = 0.04) from 364 to 382 kJ/kg of BW(0.85) daily when feeding level increased (P = 0.04) but was not affected by ingestion of solid feed. The provision of solid feed to veal calves was associated with a reduced efficiency of N retention (P = 0.04), and energy retained as protein tended to decrease (P = 0.08), probably as a result of an imbalanced AA supply of the solid feeds. The data were used to calculate the energy contents of solid feed. The utilization of energy from solid feed differed from that of milk replacer.",M2
18979220,"Development of <e>digestive</e> enzyme activity in larvae of spotted sand bass Paralabrax maculatofasciatus II: Electrophoretic analysis.The activities of several digestive enzymes during larval development of the spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) were evaluated using electrophoretic techniques. The results show the presence of three isoforms of alkaline protease from day 2 after hatching (ah) and the early appearance of one pepsin-like band from day 12 ah onwards. In addition, two lipase bands first appeared on day 2 ah, and there was a change in the molecular weight of one band from day 15 ah onwards. Several alpha-amylase isoforms were observed from hatching up to day 5 ah. These results indicate that the important digestive enzymes develop rapidly in these larvae, supporting the possibility of early weaning at day 12 ah using artificial diets.",M2
18959410,"In vitro digestion of betalainic foods. Stability and bioaccessibility of betaxanthins and betacyanins and antioxidative potential of food digesta.Betalains are considered to be bioactive dietary phytochemicals. The stability of betacyanins and betaxanthins from either fresh foods or manufactured products of cactus pear fruit ( Opuntia ficus indica L. Mill. cv. Gialla and Rossa) and red beet ( Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) was assessed in a simulated oral, gastric, and small intestinal digestion and compared with the <e>digestive</e> stability of purified pigments. A minor loss of indicaxanthin, at the gastric-like environment only, and a decrease of vulgaxanthin I through all digestion steps were observed, which was not affected by food matrix. In contrast, food matrix prevented decay of betanin and isobetanin at the gastric-like environment. Loss of betacyanins, either purified or food-derived, was observed during the small intestinal phase of digestion. Betalamic acid accumulated after digestive degradation of purified pigments, but not of food betalains. Betaxanthins were wholly soluble in the aqueous (bioaccessible) fraction after ultracentrifugation of the postintestinal (PI) digesta, whereas release of betacyanins from the matrix was incomplete. PI digesta inhibited dose-dependently the oxidation of methyl linoleate in methanol, an effect not correlated with the betalain content. The data suggest that digestive stability controls bioaccessibility of dietary betaxanthins, whereas additional factors, relevant to the food matrix and style of processing, affect betacyanin bioaccessibility.",M2
18959213,"[Effect of weaning terms and protein deficit in the rat pup nutrition on activities of <e>digestive</e> enzymes]Restriction of protein in nutrition of rat pups weaned at different terms has been found to produce changes in activities of digestive enzymes (maltase, alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase M, and glycyl-L-leucine dipeptidase) in the small and large intestine both at once after cessation of nutrition with low-protein diet for 10 days and 4 months later. In adult animals after the earlier or later weaning there are observed not only a decrease or increase of the enzyme activities, but also a different type of distribution of the alkaline phosphatase activity along the small intestine, which is more pronounced in the lately weaned rats. Thus, disturbance of metabolic programming of enzyme systems of the small and large intestine due to a change of quality of nutrition in early ontogenesis depends on terms of weaning of animals.",M2
18958595,"Development of <e>digestive</e> enzyme activity in larvae of spotted sand bass Paralabrax maculatofasciatus. 1. Biochemical analysis.Spotted sand bass Paralabrax maculatofasciatus is a potential aquaculture species in Northwest Mexico. In the last few years it has been possible to close its life cycle and to develop larviculture technology at on pilot scale using live food, however survival values are low (11%) and improvements in growth and survival requires the study of the morpho-physiological development during the initial ontogeny. In this research digestive activity of several enzymes were evaluated in larvae, from hatching to 30 days after hatching (dah), and in live prey (rotifers and Artemia), by use of biochemical and electrophoretic techniques. This paper, is the first of two parts, and covers only the biochemical analysis. All digestive enzyme activities were detected from mouth opening; however the, maximum activities varied among different digestive enzymes. For alkaline protease and trypsin the maximum activities were detected from 12 to 18 dah. Acid protease activity was observed from day 12 onwards. The other digestive enzymes appear between days 4 and 18 after hatching, with marked fluctuations. These activities indicate the beginning of the juvenile stage and the maturation of the digestive system, in agreement with changes that occur during morpho-physiological development and food changes from rotifers to Artemia. All enzymatic activities were detected in rotifers and Artemia, and their contribution to enhancement the digestion capacity of the larvae appears to be low, but cannot be minimised. We concluded that the enzymatic equipment of P. maculatofasciatus larvae is similar to that of other marine fish species, that it becomes complete between days 12 and 18 after hatching, and that it is totally efficient up to 25 dah.",M2
18931183,"Influence of feed particle size on the performance, energy utilization, <e>digestive</e> tract development, and digesta parameters of broiler starters fed wheat- and corn-based diets.The influence of particle size and grain type on the performance, AME(n), and on gross morphological and histological parameters of the various segments of the digestive tract of broilers fed wheat- or corn-based diets was investigated. The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments evaluating 2 particle sizes (fine and coarse) and 2 grain types (wheat and corn). The 2 particle sizes were achieved by grinding the whole grains in a hammer mill to pass through 1-mm and 7-mm screen sizes. Broiler starter diets, based on wheat- or corn-soybean meal, were formulated, pelleted, and each diet was offered to 6 cages of 8 male broilers each from d 1 to 21 posthatching. The results showed that the differences in particle size distribution still existed between diets after pelleting especially in the proportion of coarse particles (1 mm and over). In corn-based diets, coarse grinding improved (P = 0.06) weight gains compared with fine grinding, but this particle size effect was not observed in wheat-based diets. In both diets, coarse grinding lowered (P &lt; 0.001) feed per gain of broilers compared with fine grinding. In wheat-based diets, coarse grinding improved (P = 0.06) AME(n) compared with fine grinding. Heavier (P &lt; 0.05) gizzard weights were observed in birds fed the coarse corn-based diet, but particle size had no effect on the gizzard size in birds fed wheat-based diets. Villus height, crypt depth, and epithelial thickness in the duodenum were unaffected (P &gt; 0.05) by particle size and grain type. Overall, the present results showed that the effect of feed particle size varies depending on grain type.",M2
18931181,"Effect of enzyme addition on the nutritive value of high oleic acid sunflower seeds in chicken diets.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of enzyme addition in chicken diets containing high oleic acid sunflower seeds (HOASS). In the first experiment (4 to 21 d of age), enzyme addition (lipase, phospholipase, and a combination of these) was used at the inclusion level of 1 g/kg in diets containing HOASS (250 g/kg) compared with a control corn-soybean diet. Weight gain, feed consumption, relative liver weight, fat digestibility, and amylase, lipase, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activities were reduced, and feed conversion, relative duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca lengths, plasma uric acid, cholesterol, and glucose concentrations were increased in the unsupplemented HOASS diet compared with the control diet. The addition of enzymes to the HOASS diet increased weight gain, feed consumption, relative pancreas and liver weights, fat digestibility, amylase and lipase activities, plasma uric acid, calcium, serum LDH and CPK, and total protein concentration and reduced feed conversion, relative spleen weight, relative duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca lengths, plasma cholesterol, and glucose compared with the unsupplemented HOASS diet. In the second experiment (0 to 21 d of age), the same enzymes (0.5 g/kg each) were included in diets containing 150 g/kg of HOASS compared with a conventional sunflower meal diet (150 g/kg). The HOASS diet did not affect performance but reduced relative pancreas and abdominal fat weights and relative duodenum and ceca lengths, and increased crude fat, CP, and essential and nonessential amino acid digestibilities (except Ser, which was reduced) compared with the control diet. The addition of enzymes in the HOASS diet increased weight gain, feed consumption, and relative pancreas weight and reduced feed conversion, CP, and essential and nonessential amino acid digestibilities compared with the unsupplemented HOASS diet. In conclusion, the addition of 250 g of HOASS/kg in the diets caused a negative effect on performance, <e>digestive</e> organ sizes, fat and protein digestibilities, and pancreatic enzymes and modified blood parameters. However, the inclusion of HOASS at 150 g/kg improved some of these parameters and amino acid digestibilities. The enzyme addition counteracted some of these effects.",M2
18853232,"An explorative study of in vivo <e>digestive</e> starch characteristics and postprandial glucose kinetics of wholemeal wheat bread.BACKGROUND: Based on in vitro measurements, it is assumed that starch in wholemeal bread is rapidly digestible, which is considered to be less desirable for health. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the in vitro prediction, we characterized starch digestion of wholemeal wheat bread (WB) and postprandial glucose kinetics in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a crossover study 4 healthy men ingested either intrinsically (13)C-enriched WB (133 g) or glucose (55 g) in water. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored during 6 h postprandially. Using a primed continuous infusion of D-[6,6-(2)H(2)] glucose, the rate of systemic appearance of glucose was estimated (reflecting glucose influx) and the endogenous glucose production calculated. RESULTS: The glucose influx rate after WB was comparable with that after glucose in the early postprandial phase (0-2 h) (P = 0.396) and higher in the late postprandial phase (2-4 h) (P = 0.005). Despite the same initial glucose influx rate the 0-2 h incremental area under the curve (IAUC) of insulin after WB was 41% lower than after glucose (P = 0.037). Paradoxically endogenous glucose production after WB was significantly more suppressed than after glucose (0-2 h IAUC: P = 0.015, 2-4 h IAUC: P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Starch in WB seems to be partly rapidly and partly slowly digestible. Postprandial insulin response and endogenous glucose production after WB ingestion might not solely be determined by the digestive characteristics of starch; other components of WB seem to affect glucose homeostasis. In vitro measurements might not always predict in vivo starch digestion precisely.",M2

It is known that physiological <e>digestive</e> processes could be improved by the ingestion of some medicinal plants, while specific foods can facilitate the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, sensory properties of food seem to also influence digestion. We assessed the influence on physiological digestive processes of two Gran Soleil (GS) products containing a mixture of digestive plant extracts, citrus juices and liquors. We evaluated, in 10 healthy volunteers, the eventual occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms after their ingestion and measured their palatability. Ingestion of GS did not cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, the palatability median score shows a good appreciation of the products. In conclusion, it is possible to suppose that a product with a good palatability, able to support and maintain a good digestive condition, derives from the mixture of digestive herbs, citrus juices, liquor and other ingredients.",M2

Glycinin and beta-conglycinin, the main storage proteins in soybean, have been identified as major food/ feed allergens. The present study was conducted to investigate the disappearance of immunoreactive glycinin and beta-conglycinin in the digestive processes of piglets. Twelve crossbred piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were allocated to three dietary treatments in a complete block design, each treatment with four replicates (female/male = 1:1). From day 22-28, the control group was fed diets without leguminous products, while the two treatment groups received diets containing 2.2% purified glycinin or beta-conglycinin. All piglets were slaughtered at 29 days of age and digesta was sampled from stomach, middle jejunum, caecum and colon. Results indicated that immunoreactive glycinin and beta-conglycinin decreased as the digesta descended down the digestive tract to 0.12% and 0.47%, respectively. Little immunoreactive glycinin was found in the digesta of caecum and colon, while immunoreactive beta-conglycinin was detected in the colon. Along the whole digestive tract the disappearance of immunoreactive glycinin was significantly higher than beta-conglycinin (p &lt; 0.05).",M2

Fresh pea (FP), cooked fresh pea (CFP), frozen pea (FZP), cooked frozen pea (CFZP), and canned pea (CP) were subjected to simulated digestion. Although after digestion the pigment profile was modified for all samples, except CP, allomerization reactions and greater destruction of chlorophylls were observed in only FP, which should be due to enzymes in FP that were denaturalized in the rest of the test foods. A pigment extract of CFZP was also subjected to in vitro digestion, showing a positive effect of the food matrix on the pigment digestive stability. The transfer of the chlorophyll pigments from the digesta to the micellar fraction was significantly more efficient in CFZP (57%, p &lt; 0.0001), not significantly ( p &gt; 0.05) different between CFP, FZP, and CP (28-35%), and lowest in FP (20%). Pheophorbide a stood out as the most-micellarized chlorophyll derivative in all of the samples, reaching levels of up to 98%. Incubation of Caco-2 cells with micellar fractions at the same concentration prepared from each test food showed that pigment absorption was considerably lower ( p &lt; 0.006) in cells incubated with FP, whereas there were no differences among the rest of the preparations. Therefore, factors associated with the food matrix could inhibit or mediate the chlorophyll pigment absorption. These results demonstrated that the industrial preservation processes of peafreezing and canningas well as the cooking have a positive effect on the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of the chlorophyll pigments with respect to the FP sample, emphasizing CFZP with greater bioaccesibilty degree.",M2
18728695,"Hazardous chemicals in synthetic turf materials and their bioaccessibility in <e>digestive</e> fluids.Many synthetic turf fields consist of not only artificial grass but also rubber granules that are used as infill. The public concerns about toxic chemicals possibly contained in either artificial (polyethylene) grass fibers or rubber granules have been escalating but are based on very limited information available to date. The aim of this research was to obtain data that will help assess potential health risks associated with chemical exposure. In this small-scale study, we collected seven samples of rubber granules and one sample of artificial grass fiber from synthetic turf fields at different ages of the fields. We analyzed these samples to determine the contents (maximum concentrations) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and several metals (Zn, Cr, As, Cd, and Pb). We also analyzed these samples to determine their bioaccessible fractions of PAHs and metals in synthetic digestive fluids including saliva, gastric fluid, and intestinal fluid through a laboratory simulation technique. Our findings include: (1) rubber granules often, especially when the synthetic turf fields were newer, contained PAHs at levels above health-based soil standards. The levels of PAHs generally appear to decline as the field ages. However, the decay trend may be complicated by adding new rubber granules to compensate for the loss of the material. (2) PAHs contained in rubber granules had zero or near-zero bioaccessibility in the synthetic digestive fluids. (3) The zinc contents were found to far exceed the soil limit. (4) Except one sample with a moderate lead content of 53 p.p.m., the other samples had relatively low concentrations of lead (3.12-5.76 p.p.m.), according to soil standards. However, 24.7-44.2% of the lead in the rubber granules was bioaccessible in the synthetic gastric fluid.

Two-hundred and thirty-four juveniles (avg. wt 2.53 +/- 0.04 g) were randomly distributed in six treatment groups with each of three replicates. Six semipurified diets either containing NG and/or G corn starch viz., T(1) (100% NG, 0% G starch), T(2) (80% NG, 20% G starch), T(3) (60% NG, 40% G starch), T(4) (40% NG, 60% G starch), T(5) (20% NG, 80% G starch) and T(6) (0% NG, 100% G starch) were prepared. The dry matter digestibility and carbohydrate digestibility were highest (p &lt; 0.05) in T(6) group and lowest in T(3) and T(4) groups. The amylase activity in intestine increased as G:NG level increased in the diet. Protease activity in intestine was highest in T(6) group and lowest in T(1) group. Similar trend was recorded for specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio and apparent net protein utilization. Liver glycogen, hepatosomatic index and blood glucose level increased linearly with the increasing level of G starch in the experimental diet. The results indicate that higher nutrient digestibility and growth was recorded either at low (20% G starch, T(2)) or high (100% G starch, T(6)) G starch fed group. But high G starch fed group (T(6)) exhibits higher liver glycogen and blood glucose level, which may lead to stress due to long-term feeding. Hence, it is suggested that 20% G and 80% NG starch is optimum for better nutrient digestibility and growth in L. rohita juveniles.",M2

Thirty-two piglets (14-day weaned) were randomly allotted to supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg pEGF/kg diet. Each treatment consisted of four replicates with two pigs per pen for a 14 days experimental period. Piglets were sacrificed and gastrointestinal tract samples were collected to measure mucosa morphology, mRNA expression and activities of digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the end of the experiment. Diets supplemented with pEGF failed to influence growth performance but tended to increase jejunal mucosa weight (p &lt; 0.09) and protein content (p &lt; 0.07). Piglets supplemental pEGF induced incrementally the gastric pepsin activity (p &lt; 0.05) and stimulated jejunal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactase activities accompanied with the increase of jejunal ALP and maltase mRNA expression.

We previously reported indications that the underlying mechanism is located at the level of the intestinal mucosa. We have investigated the effects of EFA deficiency on small intestinal morphology and function. Mice were fed an EFA-deficient or control diet for 8 wk. A 72-h fat balance, the EFA status, and small intestinal histology were determined. Carbohydrate absorptive and <e>digestive</e> capacities were assessed by stable isotope methodology after administration of [U-(13)C]glucose and [1-(13)C]lactose. The mRNA expression and enzyme activity of lactase, and concentrations of the EFA linoleic acid (LA) were measured in small intestinal mucosa. Mice fed the EFA-deficient diet were markedly EFA-deficient with a profound fat malabsorption. EFA deficiency did not affect the histology or proliferative capacity of the small intestine. Blood [13C6]glucose appearance and disappearance were similar in both groups, indicating unaffected monosaccharide absorption. In contrast, blood appearance of [13C]glucose, originating from [1-(13)C]lactose, was delayed in EFA-deficient mice. EFA deficiency profoundly reduced lactase activity (-58%, P&lt;0.01) and mRNA expression (-55%, P&lt;0.01) in mid-small intestine. Both lactase activity and its mRNA expression strongly correlated with mucosal LA concentrations (r=0.77 and 0.79, respectively, P&lt;0.01). EFA deficiency in mice inhibits the capacity to digest lactose but does not affect small intestinal histology. These data underscore the observation that EFA deficiency functionally impairs the small intestine, which in part may be mediated by low LA levels in the enterocytes.",M2

The effect of (a) an intermittent heat load (a daily light cycle of 12 h at 22 degrees C and 12 h at 40 degrees C) compared to 22 degrees C throughout the day and (b) dehydration level of 15% weight loss, with and without the heat load, on the intake and digestibility of a poor quality hay was investigated in the Grant's gazelle, Oryx, the domestic Turkana goats, fat-tailed sheep, zebu cattle, Thomson's gazelle and wildebeest. The intermittent heat load with water available ad libitum depressed the food intake of zebu cattle and Turkana goats by more than 40%. It had no significant effect on the food intake of the other species. The Thomson's and Grants gazelle, oryx, wildebeest and fat-tailed sheep appear well adapted to withstanding a periodic heat load. Dehydration at 22 degrees C caused a marked depression on food intake of all the species investigated. Dehydration together with a heat load caused no further reduction in the food intake by the Grants's gazelle, oryx, and goats but it did cause a further reduction in the intake in the other species. The small non-domestic ruminants (i.e. Grant's and Thomson's gazelle) appear much more <e>digestive</e> efficient than any of their domestic counterpart.",M2
18717635,"Latitudinal trends in <e>digestive</e> flexibility: testing the climatic variability hypothesis with data on the intestinal length of rodents.Flexibility of digestive features can be understood considering the benefits of digestion, which links animal foraging to metabolizable energy and nutrient gain, and its costs, which are partly indexed by digestive tract tissue mass, one of the most expensive to maintain in terms of energy and protein metabolism. In this article, we applied a meta-analytical approach to current data on rodents' small intestine length flexibility to evaluate the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH). This hypothesis states the following: (1) as the range of climatic fluctuation experienced by terrestrial animals increases with latitude, individuals at higher latitudes should be more flexible to persist at a site; (2) the greater phenotypic flexibility allows species to occupy more habitats and to become more widely distributed. We compiled data from 25 articles, which provided a total of 86 estimations of flexibility involving 20 rodent species. Consistent with CVH predictions, we found a positive correlation between small intestine length flexibility and latitude and between small intestine length flexibility and the number of habitats occupied by different species. When seen from the perspective of digestive physiology, our analysis is an important piece of evidence on the adaptive value of digestive flexibility in small mammals.",M2
18692150,"Changes in <e>digestive</e> enzymes through developmental and molt stages in the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus.Changes in major digestive enzymes through developmental and molt stages were studied for the spiny lobster Panulirus argus. There were significant positive relationships between specific activity of trypsin and amylase enzymes and lobster size, whereas esterase and lipase specific activities decreased as lobsters aged. No relationship was found between amylase/trypsin ratio and lobster size. Positive trends were found, however, for trypsin/lipase and amylase/lipase ratios. Results suggest that changes in enzyme activity respond to the lobsters' physiological needs for particular dietary components although multivariate analysis suggested that enzyme activities could be not totally independent of diet. On the other hand, the pattern of changes of major enzyme activities through molt cycle was similar for most enzymes studied. Following molt, trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, and lipase activities gradually increased to maximal levels at late intermolt (C4) and premolt (D). There were no variations in the electrophoretic pattern of digestive enzymes through developmental and molt stages and thus, it is demonstrated that regulation is exerted quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Further studies on the effect of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors on digestive enzyme activities are needed to fully understand digestive abilities and regulation mechanisms in spiny lobsters.",M2
