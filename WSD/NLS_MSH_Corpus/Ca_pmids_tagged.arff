20592201,"A novel postsynaptic mechanism for heterosynaptic sharing of short-term plasticity.Postsynaptic release of <e>Ca</e>(2+) from intracellular stores is an important means of cellular signaling that mediates numerous forms of synaptic plasticity. Previous studies have identified a postsynaptic intracellular Ca(2+) requirement for a form of short-term plasticity, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) at sensory neuron (SN)-motor neuron synapses in Aplysia. Here, we show that postsynaptic IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release in response to a presynaptic tetanus in an SN that induces PTP can confer transient plasticity onto a neighboring SN synapse receiving subthreshold activation. This heterosynaptic sharing of plasticity represents a dynamic, short-term synaptic enhancement of synaptic inputs onto a common postsynaptic target. Heterosynaptic sharing is blocked by postsynaptic disruption of Ca(2+)- and IP(3)-mediated signaling, and, conversely, it is mimicked by postsynaptic injection of nonhydrolyzable IP(3), and by photolysis of caged IP(3) in the MN. The molecular mechanism for heterosynaptic sharing involves metabotropic glutamate receptors and Homer-dependent interactions, indicating that Homer can facilitate the integration of Ca(2+)-dependent plasticity at neighboring postsynaptic sites and provides a postsynaptic mechanism for the spread of plasticity induced by presynaptic activation. Our results support a model in which postsynaptic summation of IP(3) signals from suprathreshold and subthreshold inputs results in molecular coincidence detection that gives rise to a novel form of heterosynaptic plasticity.",M1
20578150,"Bid agonist regulates murine hepatocyte proliferation by controlling endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis.BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), a BH3-only B cell lymphoma 2 family molecule, is generally known for its importance in activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway after death receptor engagement, particularly in hepatocytes. However, Bid also promotes hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration and carcinogenesis. This study was designed to examine the hypothesis that Bid regulates endoplasmic reticulum calcium concentration ([<e>Ca</e>(2+)](ER)) homeostasis to affect hepatocyte proliferation. We found that serum-stimulated hepatocyte proliferation was dependent on calcium, and the depletion of calcium with thapsigargin or ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) inhibited the proliferation. Subcellular fractionation showed that a portion of Bid was inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-enriched membranes, and single-cell calcium imaging indicated that Bid was important for maintaining the [Ca(2+)](ER) level. Bid-deficient hepatocytes manifested delayed and reduced serum-stimulated proliferation, which was corrected by ionomycin or reconstitution of Bid, particularly an ER-targeted Bid. Finally, B cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax) could also be found in the ER-enriched membranes, and Bax deficiency caused the same proliferation defect. However, Bid/Bax double deletion in hepatocytes did not further augment the defect, which suggested that Bid and Bax worked by the same regulatory mechanism in [Ca(2+)](ER) control. CONCLUSION: Bid regulates hepatocyte proliferation by positively affecting [Ca(2+)](ER) homeostasis, and this could be important for liver regeneration and carcinogenesis.",M1
20578149,"Regulation of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 by calcium signaling in mouse liver.Multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (Mrp2) is a canalicular transporter responsible for organic anion secretion into bile. Mrp2 activity is regulated by insertion into the plasma membrane; however, the factors that control this are not understood. Calcium (<e>Ca</e>(2+)) signaling regulates exocytosis of vesicles in most cell types, and the type II inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R2) regulates Ca(2+) release in the canalicular region of hepatocytes. However, the role of InsP(3)R2 and of Ca(2+) signals in canalicular insertion and function of Mrp2 is not known. The aim of this study was to determine the role of InsP(3)R2-mediated Ca(2+) signals in targeting Mrp2 to the canalicular membrane. Livers, isolated hepatocytes, and hepatocytes in collagen sandwich culture from wild-type (WT) and InsP(3)R2 knockout (KO) mice were used for western blots, confocal immunofluorescence, and time-lapse imaging of Ca(2+) signals and of secretion of a fluorescent organic anion. Plasma membrane insertion of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Mrp2 expressed in HepG2 cells was monitored by total internal reflection microscopy. InsP(3)R2 was concentrated in the canalicular region of WT mice but absent in InsP(3)R2 KO livers, whereas expression and localization of InsP(3)R1 was preserved, and InsP(3)R3 was absent from both WT and KO livers. Ca(2+) signals induced by either adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or vasopressin were impaired in hepatocytes lacking InsP(3)R2. Canalicular secretion of the organic anion 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) was reduced in KO hepatocytes, as well as in WT hepatocytes treated with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Moreover, the choleretic effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) was impaired in InsP(3)R2 KO mice. Finally, ATP increased GFP-Mrp2 fluorescence in the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells, and this also was reduced by BAPTA. CONCLUSION: InsP(3)R2-mediated Ca(2+) signals enhance organic anion secretion into bile by targeting Mrp2 to the canalicular membrane.",M1
20574912,"Interactions between pH, potassium, calcium, bromide, and phenol and their effects on the bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri.Little attention has been paid to how the light produced by the bacterium Vibrio fischeri in the Microtox assay is dependent on the concentration of essential ions such as sodium and potassium, and whether the concentrations of these ions affect the sensitivity of the test system to toxic chemicals. Five selected factors, pH, potassium (K(+)), calcium (<e>Ca</e>(2+)), bromide (Br(-)), and phenol (Phe), were simultaneously varied over a set of systematically planned experiments according to a D-optimal design that supported the estimation of a model with linear, quadratic, and two-factor interatcions of the studied factors. The bacterial light production represented by the gamma values in the Microtox assay for the 24 selected combinations of factors was measured at 5 and 15 min. The gamma values varied from negative to positive values greater than 1, indicating stimulation and inhibition of bacterial light production, respectively. The relationship between the gamma values and the factor settings was investigated with multiple linear regression. After 5 min of exposure, the light production was significantly affected by linear and quadratic terms for K(+), pH, and Phe and an interaction between pH and Phe. The situation was more complex after 15 min of exposure, since in addition significant interactions were found for K x Phe and Ca x pH. The tolerance of V. fischeri to Phe was enhanced by increasing the K and Ca concentrations. Data indicate that the ion composition and pH of the sample, as well as the diluents, need to be considered when the toxicity of salts, water samples, and extracts of sediments and soils are tested using commercially certified toxicity test kits.",M1
20573885,"Functional anatomical evidence for respiratory rhythmogenic function of endogenous bursters in rat medulla.Endogenous burster neurons (EBs) have been found at the level of the facial nucleus (VIIn), and 500 mum caudally, within the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC). They have been proposed as either causal to or playing no role in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Little is known about their broader distribution in ventrolateral medulla. Here, a <e>Ca</e>(2+) indicator was used to record respiratory network activity in ventrolateral medulla, and, following synaptic blockade, to identify EBs active at perfusate K(+) concentrations ([K(+)](o)) of 3, 6, and 9 mm. Recordings were made along the respiratory column, extending 300 mum rostrally, and 1100 mum caudally from the caudal pole of VIIn (VIIc), in the in vitro tilted sagittal slab preparation, isolated from neonate male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Activity under matching [K(+)](o) in the intact respiratory network was subsequently investigated. Respiratory neurons (n = 401) formed statistically significant clusters at the VIIc, within the preBötC, and 100 mum caudal to the preBötC. EBs (n = 693) formed statistically significant clusters that overlapped with respiratory clusters at the VIIc and preBötC. EB activity increased significantly as [K(+)](o) was increased, as did neurons that remained coupled following synaptic blockade. The overlap between respiratory and EB clusters in regions of ventrolateral medulla identified as rhythmogenic supports the hypothesis that EBs are constituents of rhythmogenic networks. In addition, the observation of truncated inspiratory bursts and ectopic bursting in respiratory neurons when [K(+)](o) was elevated in the intact network is consistent with a causal role for EBs in respiratory rhythmogenesis.",M1
20567212,"Techniques for imaging Ca2+ signaling in human sperm.Fluorescence microscopy of cells loaded with fluorescent, <e>Ca</e>(2+)-sensitive dyes is used for measurement of spatial and temporal aspects of Ca(2+) signaling in live cells. Here we describe the method used in our laboratories for loading suspensions of human sperm with Ca(2+)-reporting dyes and measuring the fluorescence signal during physiological stimulation. Motile cells are isolated by direct swim-up and incubated under capacitating conditions for 0-24 h, depending upon the experiment. The cell-permeant AM (acetoxy methyl ester) ester form of the Ca(2+)-reporting dye is then added to a cell aliquot and a period of 1 h is allowed for loading of the dye into the cytoplasm. We use visible wavelength dyes to minimize photo-damage to the cells, but this means that ratiometric recording is not possible. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed. During the loading period cells are introduced into an imaging chamber and allowed to adhere to a poly-D-lysine coated coverslip. At the end of the loading period excess dye and loose cells are removed by connection of the chamber to the perfusion apparatus. The chamber is perfused continuously, stimuli and modified salines are then added to the perfusion header. Experiments are recorded by time-lapse acquisition of fluorescence images and analyzed in detail offline, by manually drawing regions of interest. Data are normalized to pre-stimulus levels such that, for each cell (or part of a cell), a graph showing the Ca(2+) response as % change in fluorescence is obtained.",M1
20558836,"Soluble uric acid increases intracellular calcium through an angiotensin II-dependent mechanism in immortalized human mesangial cells.Hyperuricemia is associated with increases in cardiovascular risk and renal disease. Mesangial cells regulate glomerular filtration rates through the release of hormones and vasoactive substances. This study evaluates the signaling pathway of uric acid (UA) in immortalized human mesangial cells (ihMCs). To evaluate cell proliferation, ihMCs were exposed to UA (6-10 mg/dL) for 24-144 h. In further experiments, ihMCs were treated with UA (6-10 mg/dL) for 12 and 24 h simultaneously with losartan (10(-7) mmol/L). Angiotensin II (AII) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Pre-pro-ET mRNA was evaluated by the real-time PCR technique. It was observed that soluble UA (8 and 10 mg/dL) stimulated cellular proliferation. UA (10 mg/dL) for 12 h significantly increased AII protein synthesis and ET-1 expression and protein production was increased after 24 h. Furthermore, UA increased [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i), and this effect was significantly blocked when ihMCs were preincubated with losartan. Our results suggested that UA triggers reactions including AII and ET-1 production in mesangial cells. In addition, UA can potentially affect glomerular function due to UA-induced proliferation and contraction of mesangial cells. The latter mechanism could be related to the long-term effects of UA on renal function and chronic kidney disease.",M1
20539176,"Mitochondrial peptides are potent immune activators that activate human neutrophils via FPR-1.BACKGROUND: Tissue injury from mechanical trauma modulates innate immunity. The resultant systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) closely mimics clinical sepsis, and bacterial n-formyl peptides are septic mediators. Similar formyl peptides exist in mitochondria but little is known about their actions on human neutrophils (PMN). METHODS: Mitochondria were isolated from rat heptocytes and disrupted. Soluble mitochondrial degradation products (MDP) were used to stimulate human PMN. Cytosolic calcium ([<e>Ca</e>]i) responses to MDP were assayed with and without antibody blockade of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR-1) or formyl peptide receptor like-1 (FPRL-1). Chemotaxis toward MDP was assessed in trans-wells. Oxidative burst to MDP was assessed using carboxycarboxy-2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. RESULTS: MDP caused [Ca]i responses similar to those caused by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. [Ca]i responses were completely blocked by anti-FPR-1 antibodies, showing activation occurred via the high-affinity, G-protein-coupled FPR-1 receptor. MDP acted on FPR-1 to give chemotactic responses similar to 10 nM formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. MDP also caused dose-dependent oxidative burst. CONCLUSION: Formylated mitochondrial proteins are potent immune activators. Acting through the FPR-1 receptor on professional phagocytes, MDP elicits [Ca]i release responses and Ca entry via G-protein-coupled pathways. MDP activates chemotaxis and respiratory burst. Our findings suggest a novel paradigm wherein one root cause of SIRS after trauma may be the release of mitochondrial fragments from mechanically damaged tissues. In this paradigm, mitochondrial debris  alarmins  alter host PMN phenotype, activating or suppressing immunity, predisposing to SIRS, sepsis or organ failure.",M1
20530430,"Inhibition of MAPK/ERK, PKC and CaMKII signaling blocks cytolysin-induced human glioma cell death.BACKGROUND: Cytolysins are pore-forming toxins that show anticancer activity by a mechanism hitherto poorly investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate how cytolysins are cytotoxic to resistant cancer cells, proliferation and cell death were evaluated on U87 glioblastoma cells treated with toxin Bc2 or equinatoxin-II (EqTx-II). RESULTS: Toxins Bc2 and EqTx-II decreased cell viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in a concentration-dependent manner. Swollen, dead or dying cells were negative for TUNEL staining. The pre-treatment with inhibitors of mitogen-activated/extracellular regulated kinase (MEK1), protein kinase C (PKC) or <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) blocked the toxic effects of toxin Bc2 and EqTx-II, suggesting that calcium entry, activation of MEK1, PKC and CaMKII pathways are involved in the cytotoxicity induced by these cytolysins. CONCLUSION: Cytolysins were shown to be toxic to glioblastoma cells by activating several intracellular signaling pathways and resulting in necrosis-like cell death.",M1
20529602,"[CIP and CAP fragments of parathormone and selected parameters of calcium-phosphate balance in patients with chronic kidney disease treated with repeated haemodialysis]INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to bone and mineral complications, which are manifested, among others, by hyperparathyroidism, calcium-phosphate and vitamin D balance disturbances. The results of investigation assessing the usefulness of CAP/CIP ratio, (cyclase activating PTH/cyclase inactive PTH) as a marker of bone turnover and bone disturbances in this group of patients are contradictory. AIM OF THE STUDY: was to estimate the concentration of CAP and CIP of parathormone, connection with selected calcium-phosphate balance parameters and usefulness of CAP/CIP ratio to differentiate bone mineral density in patients with CKD treated with repeated haemodialysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 31 children aged 5 to 18 years. Group I - 15 haemodialysed children. Group II - 16 healthy children. The patients underwent the following serum measurements: calcium concentration (<e>Ca</e>), inorganic phosphate (P), 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathormone (intact PTH), and CAP, CIP were evaluated with Scantibodies Laboratory Inc test. In group I the densitometric examination was done using the Lunar DPX-L system, performing the overall bone measurement. RESULTS: In children from group I the average values of iPTH concentration and both CIP and CAP components were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.05) as compared to group II. CAP/CIP ratio in group I was &lt;1; in healthy children &gt;1. Average concentrations of Ca and 1.25(OH)2D in serum of group I were lowered, although without statistical significance in comparison with group II. CAP/CIP ratio does not differentiate the children with bone disturbances. Densitometric examination revealed osteopenic changes in 3 children and osteoporosis in 2 children. There were no statistically significant correlations between the examined parameters. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The CIP/CAP ratio does not differentiate the bone mineral density status and it is not associated with biochemical parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism. 2. This indicates its poor diagnostic utility with reference to mineralization disturbances in children with chronic kidney disease.",M1
20528919,"Human delta opioid receptor biogenesis is regulated via interactions with SERCA2b and calnexin.Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA)2b maintains the cellular <e>Ca</e>(2+) homeostasis by transferring Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, SERCA2b has also been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of secreted and membrane proteins via direct protein-protein interactions, involving components of the ER folding and quality-control machinery, as well as newly synthesized G protein-coupled receptors. Here we demonstrate that the human delta opioid receptor (hdeltaOR) exists in a ternary complex with SERCA2b and the ER molecular chaperone calnexin. The interaction between SERCA2b and hdeltaOR in vivo did not require calnexin as it was independent of the C-terminal calnexin-interacting domain of SERCA2b. However, the receptor was able to mediate co-immunoprecipitation of calnexin with the C-terminally truncated SERCA2b. The association of SERCA2b with hdeltaOR was regulated in vitro by Ca(2+) and ATP in a manner that was opposite to the calnexin-hdeltaOR interaction. Importantly, co-expression of the catalytically inactive SERCA2b(D351A) or calnexin binding-compromised SERCA2bDeltaC mutants with the receptor decreased the expression of mature receptors in a manner that did not directly relate to changes in the ER Ca(2+) concentration. We conclude that dynamic interactions among SERCA2b, calnexin and the hdeltaOR precursor orchestrate receptor biogenesis and are regulated by Ca(2+) and ATP. We further hypothesize that the primary role of SERCA2b in this process is to act as a Ca(2+) sensor in the vicinity of active translocons, integrating protein folding with local fluctuations of ER Ca(2+) levels.",M1
20519530,"Grueneberg ganglion neurons are finely tuned cold sensors.The Grueneberg ganglion is a newly appreciated nasal subsystem with neural connections to the olfactory forebrain, but its functional role has not been well defined. Here, we assess whether Grueneberg ganglion neurons (GGNs) function as thermosensors. By investigating the effect of acute temperature changes on the cytosolic <e>Ca</e>(2+) concentration of genetically labeled mouse GGNs (either gender), we demonstrate that GGNs are thermosensory neurons specialized to detect a temperature decline within a given temperature window. Furthermore, GGNs comprise a relatively homogeneous cell population with respect to temperature sensitivity. GGNs do not respond to ligands of the temperature-sensitive TRP channels TRPM8 and TRPA1, suggesting a novel mechanism for temperature sensing. One possibility is a cGMP-mediated mechanism, as GGNs express the receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-G, the cGMP-sensitive phosphodiesterase PDE2 and the cGMP-sensitive channel CNGA3. Surprisingly, Cnga3-null mice show normal cooling-induced Ca(2+) responses although cGMP-dependent Ca(2+) increases are absent in these mice. Rather, the cooling-induced Ca(2+) response of GGNs depends critically on the activity of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel whereas the cGMP-dependent Ca(2+) signal does not. These findings establish the Grueneberg ganglion as a sensory organ mediating cold-evoked neural responses, possibly in conjunction with the sensing of other stress- or fear-related chemical social cues.",M1
20515698,"Clozapine activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in C2C12 myotube cells and stimulates glucose uptake.AIMS: Clozapine has previously been implicated in the dysregulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism in the central nervous system, but its effects in the periphery have yet to be thoroughly elucidated. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of clozapine on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the skeletal muscles. MAIN METHODS: Myotube C2C12 cells were incubated under control conditions, or with clozapine. Expression levels of phosphorylation status of AMPK and its direct downstream Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were analyzed by Western blot. Intracellular calcium concentration was measured with calcium indicator dye, fluo-3AM. 2-deoxyglucose uptake was assessed via the scintillation count. KEY FINDINGS: We reported that clozapine activated AMPK in mouse C2C12 myotubes and also stimulated glucose uptake. Clozapine also increased intracellular calcium concentrations of C2C12 cells, and pretreatment with either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), an extracellular calcium chelator, or 1.8-naphthoylene benzimidazole-3-carboxylic acid (STO-609), a <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibitor, blocked clozapine-induced AMPK activation. SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that clozapine increases glucose uptake through CaMKK-AMPK pathway in myotube C2C12 cells.",M1
20510928,"The structure of an Arf-ArfGAP complex reveals a Ca2+ regulatory mechanism.Arfs are small G proteins that have a key role in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling. ArfGAP proteins stimulate Arf intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by a mechanism that is still unresolved. Using a fusion construct we solved the structure of the ArfGAP ASAP3 in complex with Arf6 in the transition state. This structure clarifies the ArfGAP catalytic mechanism and shows a glutamine((Arf6)) and an arginine finger((ASAP3)) as the important catalytic residues. Unexpectedly the structure shows a calcium ion, liganded by both proteins in the complex interface, stabilizing the interaction and orienting the catalytic machinery. Calcium stimulates the GAP activity of ASAPs, but not other members of the ArfGAP family. This type of regulation is unique for GAPs and any other calcium-regulated processes and hints at a crosstalk between <e>Ca</e>(2+) and Arf signaling.",M1
20505107,"Pacemaking in dopaminergic ventral tegmental area neurons: depolarizing drive from background and voltage-dependent sodium conductances.Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) fire spontaneously in a pacemaker-like manner. We analyzed the ionic currents that drive pacemaking in dopaminergic VTA neurons, studied in mouse brain slices. Pacemaking was not inhibited by blocking hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) or blocking all calcium current by Mg(2+) replacement of <e>Ca</e>(2+). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) stopped spontaneous activity and usually resulted in stable resting potentials near -60 mV to -55 mV, 10-15 mV below the action potential threshold. When external sodium was replaced by N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) with TTX present, cells hyperpolarized by an average of -11 mV, suggesting a significant resting sodium conductance not sensitive to TTX. Voltage-clamp experiments using slow (10 mV/s) ramps showed a steady-state, steeply voltage-dependent current blocked by TTX that activates near -60 mV, as well as a sodium  background  current with little voltage sensitivity, revealed by NMDG replacement for sodium with TTX present. We quantified these two components of sodium current during the pacemaking trajectory using action potential clamp. The initial phase of depolarization, up to approximately -55 mV, is driven mainly by non-voltage-dependent sodium background current. Above -55 mV, TTX-sensitive voltage-dependent  persistent  Na current helps drive the final phase of depolarization to the spike threshold. Voltage-dependent calcium current is small at all subthreshold voltages. The pacemaking mechanism in VTA neurons differs from that in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons, where subthreshold calcium current plays a dominant role. In addition, we found that non-voltage-dependent background sodium current is much smaller in SNc neurons than VTA neurons.",M1
20505081,"Dendritic calcium signaling in ON and OFF mouse retinal ganglion cells.Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the output cells of the retina; they convert synaptic input into spike output that carries visual information to the brain. Synaptic inputs are received, integrated and communicated to the spike initiation zone of the axon by dendrites whose properties are poorly understood. Here simultaneous patch-clamp recording and 2-photon <e>Ca</e>(2+) imaging are used to study voltage- and light-evoked Ca(2+) signals in the dendrites of identified types of mouse RGCs from parallel ON and OFF pathways, which encode the onset and offset of light, respectively. The results show pathway-specific differences in voltage-dependent Ca(2+) signaling. While both ON and OFF cells express high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels, only OFF RGCs also express low-voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) channels. LVA Ca(2+) channels in OFF cells are deinactivated by hyperpolarization from the resting potential and give rise to rebound excited Ca(2+) spikes at the termination of a step of either hyperpolarizing current or light. This suggests that the differential expression of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in ON and OFF RGC dendrites contributes to differences in the way the two cell types process visual stimuli.",M1
20480053,"The erosive potential of 1% citric acid supplemented by different minerals: an in vitro study.PURPOSE: The objective of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of different minerals in combination with 1% citric acid on dental erosion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety enamel samples were randomly allocated to nine groups (G1: pure 1% citric acid solution [control]; G2: with 1 mM <e>Ca</e>; G3: with 0.047 mM F; G4: with 1 mM Fe; G5: with 1 mM P; G6: with 1 mM Ca and 0.047 mM F; G7: with 1 mM Ca and 1 mM P; G8: with 1 mM Fe and 0.047 mM F; G9: with 1 mM Ca, 1 mM P, 0.047 mM F and 1.0 mM Fe). The samples were subjected to six pH cycles, each consisting of immersion in pure or modified 1% citric acid (1 min) followed by storage in artificial saliva (59 min). Enamel wear was assessed using profilometry. RESULTS: Data were analysed using analysis of variance and Tukey test (P &lt; 0.05). Enamel loss (mean + or - SD) amounted to between 0.87 + or - 0.30 and 1.74 + or - 0.74 microm but did not significantly differ among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The modification of 1% citric acid with different minerals did not have a protective effect on enamel erosion.",M1
20471350,"Asymmetric clathrin-mediated endocytosis drives repulsive growth cone guidance.Asymmetric <e>Ca</e>(2+) elevations across the axonal growth cone mediate its turning responses to attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Here we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis acts downstream of Ca(2+) signals as driving machinery for growth cone turning. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, the formation of clathrin-coated pits is facilitated asymmetrically across the growth cone by a directionally applied chemorepellent, semaphorin 3A, or by Ca(2+) signals that mediate repulsive guidance. In contrast, coated pit formation remains symmetric in the presence of attractive Ca(2+) signals. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis abolishes growth cone repulsion, but not attraction, induced by Ca(2+) or extracellular physiological cues. Furthermore, asymmetric perturbation of the balance of endocytosis and exocytosis in the growth cone is sufficient to initiate its turning toward the side with less endocytosis or more exocytosis. With our previous finding that growth cone attraction involves asymmetric exocytosis, we propose that the balance between membrane addition and removal dictates bidirectional axon guidance.",M1
20463146,"A high calcium, skim milk powder diet results in a lower fat mass in male, energy-restricted, obese rats more than a low calcium, casein, or soy protein diet.The combination of dairy protein and dietary calcium (<e>Ca</e>) may enhance weight loss more effectively than either compound alone. Our purpose in this study was to determine the effect of various protein sources [skim milk powder (SMP), whey, casein, and soy protein isolate (SPI)] and 2 levels of Ca [low, 0.67% Ca (LC) or high, 2.4% Ca (HC)] on weight loss. Sixty-four 12-wk-old Sprague-Dawley, diet-induced obese rats were assigned to 1 of 8 energy-restricted (ER) diets for 4 wk with 1 of the 4 protein sources and either LC or HC concentrations. Rats were ER to 70% of the ad libitum food and energy intake of a reference group (n = 8) fed the AIN-93M diet. The interaction between dietary protein and Ca affected final body weight and fat mass (FM) (P &lt; 0.05). FM was less in rats fed SMP-HC than in those fed casein-LC or SPI-LC. Lean body mass was greater in rats fed SMP than in those fed whey. Rats fed HC diets had a lower plasma glucagon area under the curve (AUC) than those fed LC diets. The blood glucose AUC, homeostatic model of insulin resistance, and the expression of certain hepatic genes involved in energy metabolism were affected by protein and Ca. These data suggest that consuming a diet containing SMP and HC is associated with a lower FM in obese, male, ER rats than in diets containing casein or SPI and LC; however, the role of SMP and Ca in glucose homeostasis remains to be determined.",M1
20463058,"Multiple cross talk between angiotensin II, bradykinin, and insulin signaling in the cortical thick ascending limb of rat kidney.Cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) naturally expresses the angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1A (AT(1)-R), the bradykinin (BK) receptor type 2 (B(2)-R), and the insulin receptor. This segment is made of a single morphologically distinct cell type. AngII and BK are involved in same transduction pathways but differ markedly in their physiological actions on Na(+) transport. Besides, the insulin signaling intersects with those of AngII and BK at multiple levels and especially by stimulation on Na(+) reabsorption. Thus, the CTAL is a biologically suitable model to study the cross talk between G protein-coupled receptors or G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinase. In this work, the cross talks between AngII, BK, and insulin signaling are studied in rat CTAL by measuring changes in [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i). We show that BK exerts negative modulatory effects on AngII-induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses dependent on tyrosine kinase and MAPK pathways. Moreover, in the presence of BK, AngII-induced Na(+) transport is suppressed. These effects suggest an interaction between AT(1)-R and B(2)-R. We show a positive interaction between the insulin receptor and the AT(1)-R through a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism that involves MAPK cascade, leading to the stimulation of the Ca(2+) influx induced by AngII. The presence of such interactions brings additional arguments for a complex and fine regulation of CTAL functions and puts forward the potentially beneficial effect of BK across this segment, in case of hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance, by its negative feedback on AngII actions.",M1
20461055,"CaMKIIalpha interacts with M4 muscarinic receptors to control receptor and psychomotor function.Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are widely expressed in the mammalian brain and are essential for neuronal functions. These receptors are believed to be actively regulated by intracellular signals, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we show that <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) binds directly and selectively to one of five mAChR subtypes, M4 receptors (M4Rs), at their C-terminal regions of second intracellular loops. This binding relies on Ca(2+) activation of the kinase and leads to the phosphorylation of M4Rs at a specific threonine site (Thr145). Complementary in vivo studies in rat striatal neurons enriched with M4Rs confirm that rising Ca(2+) recruits CaMKIIalpha to M4Rs to potentiate receptor signalling, which controls behavioural sensitivity to dopamine stimulation in an activity-dependent manner. Our data identify a new model of protein-protein interactions.

20457837,"Functional NMDA receptors in rat erythrocytes.N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated nonselective cation channels mediating fast neuronal transmission and long-term potentiation in the central nervous system. These channels have a 10-fold higher permeability for <e>Ca</e>(2+) compared with Na(+) or K(+) and binding of the agonists (glutamate, homocysteine, homocysteic acid, NMDA) triggers Ca(2+) uptake. The present study demonstrates the presence of NMDA receptors in rat erythrocytes. The receptors are most abundant in both erythroid precursor cells and immature red blood cells, reticulocytes. Treatment of erythrocytes with NMDA receptor agonists leads to a rapid increase in intracellular Ca(2+) resulting in a transient shrinkage via Gardos channel activation. Additionally, the exposure of erythrocytes to NMDA receptor agonists causes activation of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase facilitating either NO production in l-arginine-containing medium or superoxide anion (O(2)(.-)) generation in the absence of l-arginine. Conversely, treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist MK-80, or the removal of Ca(2+) from the incubation medium causes suppression of Ca(2+) accumulation and prevents attendant changes in cell volume and NO/O(2)(.-) production. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor activity in circulating erythrocytes is regulated by the plasma concentrations of homocysteine and homocysteic acid. Moreover, receptor hyperactivation may contribute to an increased incidence of thrombosis during hyperhomocysteinemia.",M1
20457834,"Activation of BKCa channel is associated with increased apoptosis of cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in simulated microgravity rats.Cerebral arterial remodeling is one of the critical factors in the occurrence of postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance. We hypothesize that large-conductance calcium-activated K(+) (BK(<e>Ca</e>)) channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may play an important role in regulating cerebrovascular adaptation during microgravity exposure. The aim of this work was to investigate whether activation of BK(Ca) channels is involved in regulation of apoptotic remodeling of cerebral arteries in simulated microgravity rats. In animal studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 1-wk hindlimb unweighting to simulate microgravity. Alterations of BK(Ca) channels in cerebral VSMCs were investigated by patch clamp and Western blotting; apoptosis was assessed by electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL). To evaluate the correlation of BK(Ca) channel and apoptosis, channel protein and cell nucleus were double-stained. In cell studies, hSloalpha+beta1 channel was coexpressed into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to observe the effects of BK(Ca) channels on apoptosis. In rats, enhanced activities and expression of BK(Ca) channels were found to be correlated with increased apoptosis in cerebral VSMCs after simulated microgravity. In transfected HEK293 cells, activation of cloned BK(Ca) channel induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of cloned BK(Ca) channel decreased apoptosis. In conclusion, activation of BK(Ca) channels is associated with increased apoptosis in cerebral VSMCs of simulated microgravity rats.",M1
20457833,"Involvement of CaV3.1 T-type calcium channels in cell proliferation in mouse preadipocytes.Voltage-gated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels (Ca(V)) are ubiquitously expressed in various cell types and play vital roles in regulation of cellular functions including proliferation. However, the molecular identities and function of Ca(V) remained unexplored in preadipocytes. Therefore, whole cell voltage-clamp technique, conventional/quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, and immunohistochemical analysis were applied in mouse primary cultured preadipocytes as well as mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The effects of Ca(V) blockers on cell proliferation and cell cycle were also investigated. Whole cell recordings of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed low-threshold Ca(V), which could be inhibited by mibefradil, Ni(2+) (IC(50) of 200 muM), and NNC55-0396. Dominant expression of alpha(1G) mRNA was detected among Ca(V) transcripts (alpha(1A)-alpha(1I)), supported by expression of Ca(V)3.1 protein encoded by alpha(1G) gene, with immunohistochemical studies and Western blot analysis. siRNA targeted for alpha(1G) markedly inhibited Ca(V). Dominant expression of alpha(1G) mRNA and expression of Ca(V)3.1 protein were also observed in mouse primary cultured preadipocytes. Expression level of alpha(1G) mRNA and Ca(V)3.1 protein significantly decreased in differentiated adipocytes. Mibefradil, NNC55-0396, a selective T-type Ca(V) blocker, but not diltiazem, inhibited cell proliferation in response to serum. NNC55-0396 and siRNA targeted for alpha(1G) also prevented cell cycle entry/progression. The present study demonstrates that the Ca(V)3.1 T-type Ca(2+) channel encoded by alpha(1G) subtype is the dominant Ca(V) in mouse preadipocytes and may play a role in regulating preadipocyte proliferation, a key step in adipose tissue development.",M1
20457830,"A mechanosensitive ion channel regulating cell volume.Cells respond to a hyposmotic challenge by swelling and then returning toward the resting volume, a process known as the regulatory volume decrease or RVD. The sensors for this process have been proposed to include cationic mechanosensitive ion channels that are opened by membrane tension. We tested this hypothesis using a microfluidic device to measure cell volume and the peptide GsMTx4, a specific inhibitor of cationic mechanosensitive channels. GsMTx4 had no effect on RVD in primary rat astrocytes or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells but was able to completely inhibit RVD and the associated <e>Ca</e>(2+) uptake in normal rat kidney (NRK-49F) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Gadolinium (Gd(3+)), a nonspecific blocker of many mechanosensitive channels, inhibited RVD and Ca(2+) uptake in all three cell types, demonstrating the existence of at least two types of volume sensors. Single-channel stretch-activated currents are present in outside-out patches from NRK-49F, MDCK, and astrocytes, and they are reversibly inhibited by GsMTx4. While mechanosensitive channels are involved in volume regulation, their role for volume sensing is specialized. The NRK cells form a stable platform from which to screen drugs that affect volume regulation via mechanosensory channels and as a sensitive system to clone the channel.",M1
20457123,"Physiologic gating properties of unitary cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels.The contraction of adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes is triggered by the influx of <e>Ca</e>(2+) ions through sarcolemmal L-type Ca(2+) channels (LCCs). However, the gating properties of unitary LCCs under physiologic conditions have remained elusive. Towards this end, we investigated the voltage-dependence of the gating kinetics of unitary LCCs, with a physiologic concentration of Ca(2+) ions permeating the channel. Unitary LCC currents were recorded with 2mM external Ca(2+) ions (in the absence of LCC agonists), using cell-attached patches on K-depolarized adult rat ventricular myocytes. The voltage-dependence of the peak probability of channel opening (Po vs. Vm) displayed a maximum value of 0.3, a midpoint of -12 mV, and a slope factor of 8.5. The maximum value for Po of the unitary LCC was significantly higher than previously assumed, under physiologic conditions. We also found that the mean open dwell time of the unitary LCC increased twofold with depolarization, ranging from 0.53+/-0.02 ms at -30 mV to 1.08+/-0.03 ms at 0 mV. The increase in mean LCC open time with depolarization counterbalanced the decrease in the single LCC current amplitude; the latter due to the decrease in driving force for Ca(2+) ion entry. Thus, the average amount of Ca(2+) ions entering through an individual LCC opening ( approximately 300-400 ions) remained relatively constant over this range of potentials. These novel results establish the voltage-dependence of unitary LCC gating kinetics using a physiologic Ca(2+) ion concentration. Moreover, they provide insight into local Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release and a more accurate basis for mathematical modeling of excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes.",M1
20457122,"PGC-1 alpha accelerates cytosolic Ca2+ clearance without disturbing Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiac myocytes.Energy metabolism and <e>Ca</e>(2+) handling serve critical roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is a multi-functional coactivator that is involved in the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial functional capacity and cellular energy metabolism. However, the regulation of PGC-1 alpha in cardiac Ca(2+) signaling has not been fully elucidated. To address this issue, we combined confocal line-scan imaging with off-line imaging processing to characterize calcium signaling in cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes expressing PGC-1 alpha via adenoviral transduction. Our data shows that overexpressing PGC-1 alpha improved myocyte contractility without increasing the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients, suggesting that myofilament sensitivity to Ca(2+) increased. Interestingly, the decay kinetics of global Ca(2+) transients and Ca(2+) waves accelerated in PGC-1 alpha-expressing cells, but the decay rate of caffeine-elicited Ca(2+) transients showed no significant change. This suggests that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), but not Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (NCX) contribute to PGC-1 alpha-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance. Furthermore, PGC-1 alpha induced the expression of SERCA2a in cultured cardiac myocytes. Importantly, overexpressing PGC-1 alpha did not disturb cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis, because SR Ca(2+) load and the propensity for Ca(2+) waves remained unchanged. These data suggest that PGC-1 alpha can ameliorate cardiac Ca(2+) cycling and improve cardiac work output in response to physiological stress. Unraveling the PGC-1 alpha-calcium handling pathway sheds new light on the role of PGC-1 alpha in the therapy of cardiac diseases.",M1
20450306,"Characterization of Ca2+ signalling in postnatal mouse retinal ganglion cells: involvement of OPA1 in Ca2+ clearance.PURPOSE: The regulation of <e>Ca</e>(2+) entry and removal is a fine-tuned process which remains not well understood in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The latter are known to be sensitive to dysfunctions of mitochondria, organelles playing a pivotal role in Ca(2+) reuptake. METHODS: We first described the Ca(2+) signals of RGCs in response to varied drugs with Fura-2 imaging, and secondly tested the role of optic atrophy 1 or OPA1, the gene responsible for Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy, on mitochondrial ability to capture intracellular Ca(2+) in cells transfected with the OPA1 small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs). RESULTS: In control RGCs, K(+)-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) increase was blocked by the Ca(2+) channel antagonists (Ni(2+)+ Cd(2+)) and GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses were attenuated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists, picrotoxin and gabazine. We also prove the presence of NMDA and AMPA/Kainate (glutamate receptor agonists) responsive receptors in this model. Application of cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps of the intracellular Ca(2+) stores, induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) while ryanodine or caffeine had no effect on resting [Ca(2+)](i). Spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in contacting neurons highlighted the importance of cross-talks between RGCs during maturation. The mitochondrial respiration uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), induced robust raises of intracellular Ca(2+) after K(+) application, with a more pronounced effect in cells silenced for OPA1, which could lead to cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an important role of OPA1 in mitochondrial dependent Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival in RGCs, suggesting a possible patho-physiological mechanism involved in inherited optic neuropathies.",M1
20448200,"Vinpocetine inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation via an IKK-dependent but PDE-independent mechanism.Inflammation is a hallmark of many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, infectious diseases, and cancer. Although steroids and cyclooxygenase inhibitors are effective antiinflammatory therapeutical agents, they may cause serious side effects. Therefore, developing unique antiinflammatory agents without significant adverse effects is urgently needed. Vinpocetine, a derivative of the alkaloid vincamine, has long been used for cerebrovascular disorders and cognitive impairment. Its role in inhibiting inflammation, however, remains unexplored. Here, we show that vinpocetine acts as an antiinflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo. In particular, vinpocetine inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory mediators in multiple cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. We also show that vinpocetine inhibits monocyte adhesion and chemotaxis, which are critical processes during inflammation. Moreover, vinpocetine potently inhibits TNF-alpha- or LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and decreases interstitial infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in a mouse model of TNF-alpha- or LPS-induced lung inflammation. Interestingly, vinpocetine inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory responses by directly targeting IKK, independent of its well-known inhibitory effects on phosphodiesterase and <e>Ca</e>(2+) regulation. These studies thus identify vinpocetine as a unique antiinflammatory agent that may be repositioned for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.",M1
20445155,"Reactive oxygen species alters the electrophysiological properties and raises [Ca2+]i in intracardiac ganglion neurons.We have investigated the effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) donors hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) on the intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics: ganglionic transmission and resting [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i) in neonate and adult rat intracardiac ganglion (ICG) neurons. Intracellular recordings were made using sharp microelectrodes filled with either 0.5 M KCl or Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, allowing recording of electrical properties and measurement of [Ca(2+)](i). H(2)O(2) and t-BHP both hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and reduced membrane resistance. In adult ICG neurons, the hyperpolarizing action of H(2)O(2) was reversed fully by Ba(2+) and partially by tetraethylammonium, muscarine, and linopirdine. H(2)O(2) and t-BHP reduced the action potential afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude but had no impact on either overshoot or AHP duration. ROS donors evoked an increase in discharge adaptation to long depolarizing current pulses. H(2)O(2) blocked ganglionic transmission in most ICG neurons but did not alter nicotine-evoked depolarizations. By contrast, t-BHP had no significant action on ganglionic transmission. H(2)O(2) and t-BHP increased resting intracellular Ca(2+) levels to 1.6 ( +/- 0.6, n = 11, P &lt; 0.01) and 1.6 ( +/- 0.3, n = 8, P &lt; 0.001), respectively, of control value (1.0, approximately 60 nM). The ROS scavenger catalase prevented the actions of H(2)O(2), and this protection extended beyond the period of application. Superoxide dismutase partially shielded against the action of H(2)O(2), but this was limited to the period of application. These data demonstrate that ROS decreases the excitability and ganglionic transmission of ICG neurons, attenuating parasympathetic control of the heart.",M1
20445068,"Multiple kinase pathways regulate voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and migration in oligodendrocyte precursor cells.It is becoming increasingly clear that voltage-operated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels (VOCCs) play a fundamental role in the development of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Because direct phosphorylation by different kinases is one of the most important mechanisms involved in VOCC modulation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the participation of serine-threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases (TKs) on Ca(2+) influx mediated by VOCCs in OPCs. Calcium imaging revealed that OPCs exhibited Ca(2+) influx after plasma membrane depolarization via L-type VOCCs. Furthermore, VOCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx declined with OPC differentiation, indicating that VOCCs are developmentally regulated in OPCs. PKC activation significantly increased VOCC activity in OPCs, whereas PKA activation produced the opposite effect. The results also indicated that OPC morphological changes induced by PKC activation were partially mediated by VOCCs. Our data clearly suggest that TKs exert an activating influence on VOCC function in OPCs. Furthermore, using the PDGF response as a model to probe the role of TK receptors (TKr) on OPC Ca(2+) uptake, we found that TKr activation potentiated Ca(2+) influx after membrane depolarization. Interestingly, this TKr modulation of VOCCs appeared to be essential for the PDGF enhancement of OPC migration rate, because cell motility was completely blocked by TKr antagonists, as well as VOCC inhibitors, in migration assays. The present study strongly demonstrates that PKC and TKrs enhance Ca(2+) influx induced by depolarization in OPCs, whereas PKA has an inhibitory effect. These kinases modulate voltage-operated Ca(2+) uptake in OPCs and participate in the modulation of process extension and migration.",M1
20445058,"Calcium activates a chloride conductance likely involved in olfactory receptor neuron repolarization in the moth Spodoptera littoralis.The response of insect olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to odorants involves the opening of <e>Ca</e>(2+)-permeable channels, generating an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Here, we studied the downstream effect of this Ca(2+) rise in cultured ORNs of the moth Spodoptera littoralis. Intracellular dialysis of Ca(2+) from the patch pipette in whole-cell patch-clamp configuration activated a conductance with a K(1/2) of 2.8 microm. Intracellular and extracellular anionic and cationic substitutions demonstrated that Cl(-) carries this current. The anion permeability sequence I(-) &gt; NO(3)(-) &gt; Br(-) &gt; Cl(-) &gt; CH(3)SO(3)(-) &gt;&gt; gluconate(-) of the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel suggests a weak electrical field pore of the channel. The Ca(2+)-activated current partly inactivated over time and did not depend on protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMKII activity or on calmodulin. Application of Cl(-) channel blockers, flufenamic acid, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, or niflumic acid reversibly blocked the Ca(2+)-activated current. In addition, lowering Cl(-) concentration in the sensillar lymph bathing the ORN outer dendrites caused a significant delay in pheromone response termination in vivo. The present work identifies a new Cl(-) conductance activated by Ca(2+) in insect ORNs presumably required for ORN repolarization.",M1
20443692,"Position 552 in a FMRFamide-gated Na(+) channel affects the gating properties and the potency of FMRFamide.FMRFamide-gated Na(+) channel (FaNaC) is a peptide-gated sodium channel in the epithelial Na(+) channel/degenerin family. Although there are some data on the location of the putative peptide binding site, there is no structural information on the activation gating of FaNaC. Here, we addressed the function of a conserved aspartate residue in the second transmembrane domain of FaNaC. We used Aplysia kurodai FaNaC (AkFaNaC) and examined the function of the aspartate (D552) by site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological recording in Xenopus oocytes. We found that the macroscopic activation, desensitization, and potency of FMRFamide and its modification by external <e>Ca</e>(2+) and Mg(2+) are greatly affected by physicochemical properties of the amino acid at position 552. We conclude that D552 is situated in a key position that affects the gating properties of FaNaC.",M1
20442333,"Quantitative determination of ion distributions in bacterial lipopolysaccharide membranes by grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence.A model of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria was created by the deposition of a monolayer of purified rough mutant lipopolysaccharides at an air/water interface. The density profiles of monovalent (K(+)) and divalent (<e>Ca</e>(2+)) cations normal to the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) monolayers were investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence. In the absence of Ca(2+), a K(+) concentration peak was found in the negatively charged LPS headgroup region. With the addition of CaCl(2), Ca(2+) ions almost completely displaced K(+) ions from the headgroup region. By integrating the experimentally reconstructed excess ion density profiles, we obtained an accurate measurement of the effective charge density of LPS monolayers. The experimental findings were compared to the results of Monte Carlo simulations based on a coarse-grained minimal model of LPS molecules and showed excellent agreement.",M1
20439752,"Structure of the EF-hand domain of polycystin-2 suggests a mechanism for Ca2+-dependent regulation of polycystin-2 channel activity.The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of polycystin-2 (PC2/TRPP2), a <e>Ca</e>(2+)-permeable channel, is frequently mutated or truncated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. We have previously shown that this tail consists of three functional regions: an EF-hand domain (PC2-EF, 720-797), a flexible linker (798-827), and an oligomeric coiled coil domain (828-895). We found that PC2-EF binds Ca(2+) at a single site and undergoes Ca(2+)-dependent conformational changes, suggesting it is an essential element of Ca(2+)-sensitive regulation of PC2 activity. Here we describe the NMR structure and dynamics of Ca(2+)-bound PC2-EF. Human PC2-EF contains a divergent non-Ca(2+)-binding helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif packed against a canonical Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand motif. This HLH motif may have evolved from a canonical EF-hand found in invertebrate PC2 homologs. Temperature-dependent steady-state NOE experiments and NMR R(1) and R(2) relaxation rates correlate with increased molecular motion in the EF-hand, possibly due to exchange between apo and Ca(2+)-bound states, consistent with a role for PC2-EF as a Ca(2+)-sensitive regulator. Structure-based sequence conservation analysis reveals a conserved hydrophobic surface in the same region, which may mediate Ca(2+)-dependent protein interactions. We propose that Ca(2+)-sensing by PC2-EF is responsible for the cooperative nature of PC2 channel activation and inhibition. Based on our results, we present a mechanism of regulation of the Ca(2+) dependence of PC2 channel activity by PC2-EF.",M1
20439740,"Unique characteristics of Ca2+ homeostasis of the trans-Golgi compartment.Taking advantage of a fluorescent <e>Ca</e>(2+) indicator selectively targeted to the trans-Golgi lumen, we here demonstrate that its Ca(2+) homeostatic mechanisms are distinct from those of the other Golgi subcompartments: (i) Ca(2+) uptake depends exclusively on the activity of the secretory pathway Ca(2+) ATPase1 (SPCA1), whereas the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is excluded; (ii) IP(3) generated by receptor stimulation causes Ca(2+) uptake rather than release; (iii) Ca(2+) release can be triggered by activation of ryanodine receptors in cells endowed with robust expression of the latter channels (e.g., in neonatal cardiac myocyte). Finally, we show that, knocking down the SPCA1, and thus altering the trans-Golgi Ca(2+) content, specific functions associated with this subcompartment, such as sorting of proteins to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway, and the structure of the entire Golgi apparatus are dramatically altered.",M1
20439116,"Calcium is required for coelomocyte activation in earthworms.The role of calcium signaling in activation of both innate and adaptive immunity is basically important, however, the evolutionary aspects are not clarified yet. Currently limited data are available about calcium levels of coelomocytes, cellular mediators of earthworm immunity. We aimed to observe basal and induced <e>Ca</e>(2+) levels of coelomocyte subgroups after various stimulations in Eisenia fetida and Allolobophora caliginosa using a Ca(2+)-sensitive dye. E. fetida chloragocytes had the highest basal Ca(2+) levels among subpopulations; however there was no detectable Ca(2+) influx after any stimuli, while coelomocytes showed strong Ca(2+) increase after ionomycin treatment, which could be attenuated using phorbol ester. A. caliginosa coelomocytes showed a weak response to ionophore, while chloragocytes, similar to those in E. fetida, exhibited no changes after this stimulation. Intracellular calcium is mainly stored in the endoplasmic reticulum of coelomocytes as proved by thapsigargin treatments. Among several mitogens only phytohemagglutinin caused increased Ca(2+) level in E. fetida coelomocytes, but not in A. caliginosa coelomocytes. Moreover, the chemoattractant fMLP revealed calcium influx of Eisenia coelomocytes. For the first time we observed various basal Ca(2+) levels and sensibility to Ca(2+) influx inducers (including mitogens and chemoattractant) of coelomocyte subgroups using flow cytometry. These observations suggest that Ca(2+) influx and signal transduction may play crucial roles in the innate immunity of the earthworm.",M1
20438880,"Analysis of a novel calcium auxotrophy in Aspergillus nidulans.In Aspergillus nidulans a combination of null mutations in halA, encoding a protein kinase, and sltA, encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor having no yeast homologues, results in an elevated calcium requirement ('calcium auxotrophy') without impairing net calcium uptake. sltA(-) (+/-halA(-)) mutations result in hypertrophy of the vacuolar system. In halA(-)sltA(-) (and sltA(-)) strains, transcript levels for pmcA and pmcB, encoding vacuolar <e>Ca</e>(2+)-ATPase homologues, are highly elevated, suggesting a regulatory relationship between vacuolar membrane area and certain vacuolar membrane ATPase levels. Deletion of both pmcA and pmcB strongly suppresses the 'calcium auxotrophy'. Therefore the 'calcium auxotrophy' possibly results from excessive vacuolar calcium sequestration, causing cytosolic calcium deprivation. Null mutations in nhaA, homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae NHA1, encoding a plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter effluxing Na(+) and K(+), and a non-null mutation in trkB, homologous to S. cerevisiae TRK1, encoding a plasma membrane high affinity K(+) transporter, also suppress the calcium auxotrophy.",M1

We investigated the differences between CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells from the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y in terms of the expressions of voltage-gated ion channels. A CD133(+) enriched (&gt;60%) population was isolated, and a subsequent whole-cell voltage-clamp study showed that these cells predominantly express TEA-sensitive outward K(+) currents (I(K,TEA)) and TTX-sensitive voltage-gated inward Na(+) currents (I(Na)). Cell-attached single channel recordings demonstrated higher density of large-conductance (155pS) channel in CD133(+) cells than in CD133(-) cells. The TEA-sensitivity and single channel conductance indicated the large-conductance <e>Ca</e>(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK(Ca)). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis of 22 transcripts of voltage-gated ion channels in SH-SY5Y cells showed the expressions of Cav1.3, Kir2.1, Kv1.4, Kv2.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, BK(Ca), and Nav1.7, and those of BK(Ca) and Nav1.7 were higher in CD133(+) than in CD133(-) cells. In addition, the increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) in response to ionomycin (a Ca(2+) ionophore) was higher and more sustained in CD133(+) than in CD133(-) cells. Plausibly membrane hyperpolarization via BK(Ca) might be responsible for the augmented Ca(2+) influx observed in CD133(+) cells. The physiological implications of the differential expression of BK(Ca) and Nav1.7 in CSCs require further investigation.",M1

However, still there were controversies of electromagnetic pollution within the scientific community. In this work, we studied the effects of alternative magnetic fields on intracellular calcium. Osteoblastic cells were used as a model both to test the hypothesis that extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields can alter the concentrations of the intracellular calcium, and to examine the 'window' effect predicted by our previous theoretical work. The outcome of this experiment demonstrated that 50 Hz, 0.8 mT magnetic field can induce the uptake of [Ca(2+)](i) in osteoblasts.

20435690,"Alpha1G T-type calcium channel selectively regulates P-selectin surface expression in pulmonary capillary endothelium.Regulated P-selectin surface expression provides a rapid measure for endothelial transition to a proinflammatory phenotype. In general, P-selectin surface expression results from Weibel-Palade body (WPb) exocytosis. Yet, it is unclear whether pulmonary capillary endothelium possesses WPbs or regulated P-selectin surface expression and, if so, how inflammatory stimuli initiate exocytosis. We used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence labeling, ultrastructural assessment, and an isolated perfused lung model to demonstrate that capillary endothelium lacks WPbs but possesses P-selectin. Thrombin stimulated P-selectin surface expression in both extra-alveolar vessel and alveolar capillary endothelium. Only in capillaries was the thrombin-stimulated P-selectin surface expression considerably mitigated by pharmacologic blockade of the T-type channel or genetic knockout of the T-type channel alpha(1G)-subunit. Depolarization of endothelial plasma membrane via high K(+) perfusion capable of eliciting cytosolic <e>Ca</e>(2+) transients also provoked P-selectin surface expression in alveolar capillaries that was abolished by T-type channel blockade or alpha(1G) knockout. Our findings reveal an intracellular WPb-independent P-selectin pool in pulmonary capillary endothelium, where the regulated P-selectin surface expression is triggered by Ca(2+) transients evoked through activation of the alpha(1G) T-type channel.",M1
20432440,"Dysregulated calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder caused by the oncogenic activity of the Bcr-Abl protein, a deregulated tyrosine kinase. Calcium may act directly on cellular enzymes and in conjunction with other cellular metabolites, such as cyclic nucleotides, to regulate cell functions. Alteration in the ionized calcium concentration in the cytosol has been implicated in the initiation of secretion, contraction, and cell proliferation as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been correlates with normal cell proliferation through activation of growth-related signaling pathways. In this study we evaluated in peripheral blood leukocytes from CML patients the role of the balance between intracellular calcium and oxidative stress in CML disease in order to identify possible therapeutic targets in patients affected by this pathology. Our results demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from CML patients displayed decreased intracellular calcium [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i) fluxes both after InsP(3) as well as ATP and ionomycin (IONO) administration. CML cells showed lower levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and significantly higher malondialdehyde levels (MDA) than peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from control patients.

Waves, evoked by the IP(3)-generating agonist carbachol (CCh), initiated as a uniform rise in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) over a single though substantial length (approximately 30 microm) of the cell. During regenerative propagation, the wave-front was about 1/3 the length (approximately 9 microm) of the initiation site. The wave-front progressed at a relatively constant velocity although amplitude varied through the cell; differences in sensitivity to IP(3) may explain the amplitude changes. Ca(2+) was required for IP(3)-mediated wave progression to occur. Increasing the Ca(2+) buffer capacity in a small (2 microm) region immediately in front of a CCh-evoked Ca(2+) wave halted progression at the site. However, the wave front does not progress by Ca(2+)-dependent positive feedback alone. In support, colliding [Ca(2+)](c) increases from locally released IP(3) did not annihilate but approximately doubled in amplitude. This result suggests that local IP(3)-evoked [Ca(2+)](c) increases diffused passively. Failure of local increases in IP(3) to evoke waves appears to arise from the restricted nature of the IP(3) increase. When IP(3) was elevated throughout the cell, a localized increase in Ca(2+) now propagated as a wave. Together, these results suggest that waves initiate over a surprisingly large length of the cell and that both IP(3) and Ca(2+) are required for active propagation of the wave front to occur.",M1
20427673,"Burst-induced anti-Hebbian depression acts through short-term synaptic dynamics to cancel redundant sensory signals.Weakly electric fish can enhance the detection and localization of important signals such as those of prey in part by cancellation of redundant spatially diffuse electric signals due to, e.g., their tail bending. The cancellation mechanism is based on descending input, conveyed by parallel fibers emanating from cerebellar granule cells, that produces a negative image of the global low-frequency signals in pyramidal cells within the first-order electrosensory region, the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). Here we demonstrate that the parallel fiber synaptic input to ELL pyramidal cell undergoes long-term depression (LTD) whenever both parallel fiber afferents and their target cells are stimulated to produce paired burst discharges. Paired large bursts (4-4) induce robust LTD over pre-post delays of up to +/-50 ms, whereas smaller bursts (2-2) induce weaker LTD. Single spikes (either presynaptic or postsynaptic) paired with bursts did not induce LTD. Tetanic presynaptic stimulation was also ineffective in inducing LTD. Thus, we have demonstrated a form of anti-Hebbian LTD that depends on the temporal correlation of burst discharge. We then demonstrated that the burst-induced LTD is postsynaptic and requires the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, elevation of postsynaptic <e>Ca</e>(2+), and activation of CaMKIIbeta. A model incorporating local inhibitory circuitry and previously identified short-term presynaptic potentiation of the parallel fiber synapses further suggests that the combination of burst-induced LTD, presynaptic potentiation, and local inhibition may be sufficient to explain the generation of the negative image and cancellation of redundant sensory input by ELL pyramidal cells.",M1
20427669,"Cholesterol-dependent kinase activity regulates transmitter release from cerebellar synapses.Changes in membrane cholesterol content can alter protein kinase activity, however, it is not known whether kinases regulating transmitter release are sensitive to membrane cholesterol content. Here we have used the cholesterol extracting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin to measure the effects of acute cholesterol reduction on transmitter release from cultured cerebellar neurons. Cholesterol depletion increased the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release without altering the amplitude and time course of mEPSCs. Evoked transmitter release was decreased by cholesterol extraction and the paired pulse ratio was also decreased. Alterations in synaptic transmission were not associated with failure of action potential generation or changes in presynaptic <e>Ca</e>(2+) signaling. Both the increase in mEPSC frequency and the change in paired pulse ratio were blocked by the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. The increase in mEPSC frequency was also sensitive to selective inhibitors of PKC and PKA. Our results therefore demonstrate that the activity of presynaptic protein kinases that regulate spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release is sensitive to changes of membrane cholesterol content.",M1
20427533,"Activation of the inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate calcium gate receptor is required for HIV-1 Gag release.The structural precursor polyprotein, Gag, encoded by all retroviruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is necessary and sufficient for the assembly and release of particles that morphologically resemble immature virus particles. Previous studies have shown that the addition of <e>Ca</e>(2+) to cells expressing Gag enhances virus particle production. However, no specific cellular factor has been implicated as mediator of Ca(2+) provision. The inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) gates intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Following activation by binding of its ligand, IP3, it releases Ca(2+) from the stores. We demonstrate here that IP3R function is required for efficient release of HIV-1 virus particles. Depletion of IP3R by small interfering RNA, sequestration of its activating ligand by expression of a mutated fragment of IP3R that binds IP3 with very high affinity, or blocking formation of the ligand by inhibiting phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of the precursor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, inhibited Gag particle release. These disruptions, as well as interference with ligand-receptor interaction using antibody targeted to the ligand-binding site on IP3R, blocked plasma membrane accumulation of Gag. These findings identify IP3R as a new determinant in HIV-1 trafficking during Gag assembly and introduce IP3R-regulated Ca(2+) signaling as a potential novel cofactor in viral particle release.",M1
20423337,"Isoflurane protects cardiomyocytes and mitochondria by immediate and cytosol-independent action at reperfusion.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The volatile anaesthetic isoflurane protects the heart from ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury when applied at the onset of reperfusion [anaesthetic postconditioning (APoC)]. However, the mechanism of APoC-mediated protection is unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of APoC on mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial matrix pH (pH(m)) and cytosolic pH (pH(i)), and intracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cardiac mitochondria from Wistar rats were isolated after in vivo I/R with or without APoC (1.4%-vol isoflurane, 1 minimum alveolar concentration), and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and oxygen consumption were assessed. In isolated cardiomyocytes and isolated mitochondria I/R injury was produced in vitro, with or without APoC (0.5 mM isoflurane). Intracellular Ca(2+), pH(m), pH(i) and DeltaPsi(m) were monitored with SNARF-1, TMRE and fluo-4, respectively. Myocyte survival was assessed when APoC was induced at pH 7.4 and 7.8. In isolated mitochondria oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were measured. KEY RESULTS: In vivo APoC protected against mPTP opening, slowed mitochondrial respiration and depolarized mitochondria. APoC decreased the number of hypercontracted cardiomyocytes at pH 7.4, but not at pH 7.8. APoC attenuated intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation, maintained lower pH(m), and preserved DeltaPsi(m) during reoxygenation. Isoflurane did not affect the regulation of cytosolic pH. In mitochondria, APoC preserved ATP production rate and respiration. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: At reperfusion, APoC inhibited mitochondrial respiration, depolarized mitochondria and acidified pH(m). These events may lead to inhibition of mPTP opening and, consequently, to preserved DeltaPsi(m) and ATP synthesis. This reduces intracellular Ca(2+) overload and cell death.",M1
20422450,"Ouabain-induced perturbations in intracellular ionic homeostasis regulate death receptor-mediated apoptosis.Apoptosis is defined by specific morphological and biochemical characteristics including cell shrinkage (termed apoptotic volume decrease), a process that results from the regulation of ion channels and plasma membrane transporter activity. The Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase is the predominant pump that controls cell volume and plasma membrane potential in cells and alterations in its function have been suggested to be associated with apoptosis. We report here that the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain, potentiates apoptosis in the human lymphoma Jurkat cells exposed to Fas ligand (FasL) or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) but not other apoptotic agents such as H(2)O(2), thapsigargin or UV-C implicating a role for the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in death receptor-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, ouabain also potentiated perturbations in cell <e>Ca</e>(2+) homeostasis only in conjunction with the apoptotic inducer FasL but not TRAIL. Ouabain did not affect alterations in the intracellular Ca(2+) levels in response to H(2)O(2), thapsigargin or UV-C. FasL-induced alterations in Ca(2+) were not abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium but incubation of cells with BAPTA-AM inhibited both Ca(2+) perturbations and the ouabain-induced potentiation of FasL-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that the impairment of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity during apoptosis is linked to perturbations in cell Ca(2+) homeostasis that modulate apoptosis induced by the activation of Fas by FasL.",M1
20421509,"Phenothiazines inhibit S100A4 function by inducing protein oligomerization.S100A4, a member of the S100 family of <e>Ca</e>(2+)-binding proteins, regulates carcinoma cell motility via interactions with myosin-IIA. Numerous studies indicate that S100A4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization. Together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which phenothiazines disrupt the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction by sequestering S100A4 via small molecule-induced oligomerization.",M1
20421502,"Calcium isotope constraints on the end-Permian mass extinction.The end-Permian mass extinction horizon is marked by an abrupt shift in style of carbonate sedimentation and a negative excursion in the carbon isotope (delta(13)C) composition of carbonate minerals. Several extinction scenarios consistent with these observations have been put forward. Secular variation in the calcium isotope (delta(44/40)<e>Ca</e>) composition of marine sediments provides a tool for distinguishing among these possibilities and thereby constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we report delta(44/40)Ca across the Permian-Triassic boundary from marine limestone in south China. The delta(44/40)Ca exhibits a transient negative excursion of approximately 0.3 per thousand over a few hundred thousand years or less, which we interpret to reflect a change in the global delta(44/40)Ca composition of seawater. CO(2)-driven ocean acidification best explains the coincidence of the delta(44/40)Ca excursion with negative excursions in the delta(13)C of carbonates and organic matter and the preferential extinction of heavily calcified marine animals. Calcium isotope constraints on carbon cycle calculations suggest that the average delta(13)C of CO(2) released was heavier than -28 per thousand and more likely near -15 per thousand; these values indicate a source containing substantial amounts of mantle- or carbonate-derived carbon. Collectively, the results point toward Siberian Trap volcanism as the trigger of mass extinction.",M1
20421376,"Cyclic AMP potentiates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in pancreatic duct epithelial cells.Exocytosis is evoked by intracellular signals, including <e>Ca</e>(2+) and protein kinases. We determined how such signals interact to promote exocytosis in exocrine pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDECs). Exocytosis, detected using carbon-fiber microamperometry, was stimulated by [Ca(2+)](i) increases induced either through Ca(2+) influx using ionomycin or by activation of P2Y2 or protease-activated receptor 2 receptors. In each case, the exocytosis was strongly potentiated when cyclic AMP (cAMP) was elevated either by activating adenylyl cyclase with forskolin or by activating the endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor. This potentiation was completely inhibited by H-89 and partially blocked by Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, inhibitors of protein kinase A. Optical monitoring of fluorescently labeled secretory granules showed slow migration toward the plasma membrane during Ca(2+) elevations. Neither this Ca(2+)-dependent granule movement nor the number of granules found near the plasma membrane were detectably changed by raising cAMP, suggesting that cAMP potentiates Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis at a later stage. A kinetic model was made of the exocytosis stimulated by UTP, trypsin, and Ca(2+) ionophores with and without cAMP increase. In the model, without a cAMP rise, receptor activation stimulates exocytosis both by Ca(2+) elevation and by the action of another messenger(s). With cAMP elevation the docking/priming step for secretory granules was accelerated, augmenting the releasable granule pool size, and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the final fusion step was increased, augmenting the rate of exocytosis. Presumably both cAMP actions require cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins. cAMP-dependent potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis has physiological implications for mucin secretion and, possibly, for membrane protein insertion in the pancreatic duct. In addition, mechanisms underlying this potentiation of slow exocytosis may also exist in other cell systems.",M1
20421375,"Allosteric mechanism of Ca2+ activation and H+-inhibited gating of the MthK K+ channel.MthK is a <e>Ca</e>(2+)-gated K(+) channel whose activity is inhibited by cytoplasmic H(+). To determine possible mechanisms underlying the channel's proton sensitivity and the relation between H(+) inhibition and Ca(2+)-dependent gating, we recorded current through MthK channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Each bilayer recording was obtained at up to six different [Ca(2+)] (ranging from nominally 0 to 30 mM) at a given [H(+)], in which the solutions bathing the cytoplasmic side of the channels were changed via a perfusion system to ensure complete solution exchanges. We observed a steep relation between [Ca(2+)] and open probability (Po), with a mean Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 9.9 +/- 0.9. Neither the maximal Po (0.93 +/- 0.005) nor n(H) changed significantly as a function of [H(+)] over pH ranging from 6.5 to 9.0. In addition, MthK channel activation in the nominal absence of Ca(2+) was not H(+) sensitive over pH ranging from 7.3 to 9.0. However, increasing [H(+)] raised the EC(50) for Ca(2+) activation by approximately 4.7-fold per tenfold increase in [H(+)], displaying a linear relation between log(EC(50)) and log([H(+)]) (i.e., pH) over pH ranging from 6.5 to 9.0. Collectively, these results suggest that H(+) binding does not directly modulate either the channel's closed-open equilibrium or the allosteric coupling between Ca(2+) binding and channel opening. We can account for the Ca(2+) activation and proton sensitivity of MthK gating quantitatively by assuming that Ca(2+) allosterically activates MthK, whereas H(+) opposes activation by destabilizing the binding of Ca(2+).",M1
20421372,"Coupling and cooperativity in voltage activation of a limited-state BK channel gating in saturating Ca2+.Voltage-dependent gating mechanisms of large conductance <e>Ca</e>(2+) and voltage-activated (BK) channels were investigated using two-dimensional maximum likelihood analysis of single-channel open and closed intervals. To obtain sufficient data at negative as well as positive voltages, single-channel currents were recorded at saturating Ca(2+) from BK channels mutated to remove the RCK1 Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) sensors. The saturating Ca(2+) acting on the Ca(2+) bowl sensors of the resulting BK(B) channels increased channel activity while driving the gating into a reduced number of states, simplifying the model. Five highly constrained idealized gating mechanisms based on extensions of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric proteins were examined. A 10-state model without coupling between the voltage sensors and the opening/closing transitions partially described the voltage dependence of Po but not the single-channel kinetics. With allowed coupling, the model gave improved descriptions of Po and approximated the single-channel kinetics; each activated voltage sensor increased the opening rate approximately an additional 23-fold while having little effect on the closing rate. Allowing cooperativity among voltage sensors further improved the description of the data: each activated voltage sensor increased the activation rate of the remaining voltage sensors approximately fourfold, with little effect on the deactivation rate. The coupling factor was decreased in models with cooperativity from approximately 23 to approximately 18. Whether the apparent cooperativity among voltage sensors arises from imposing highly idealized models or from actual cooperativity will require additional studies to resolve. For both cooperative and noncooperative models, allowing transitions to five additional brief (flicker) closed states further improved the description of the data. These observations show that the voltage-dependent single-channel kinetics of BK(B) channels can be approximated by highly idealized allosteric models in which voltage sensor movement increases Po mainly through an increase in channel opening rates, with limited effects on closing rates.",M1
20420839,"Inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I by S-glutathionylation of the active-site cysteine residue.We show that <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) is directly inhibited by its S-glutathionylation at the Cys(179). In vitro studies demonstrated that treatment of CaMKI with diamide and glutathione results in inactivation of the enzyme, with a concomitant S-glutathionylation of CaMKI at Cys(179) detected by mass spectrometry. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that S-glutathionylation of Cys(179) is both necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of CaMKI by diamide and glutathione. In transfected cells expressing CaMKI, treatment with diamide caused a reversible decrease in CaMKI activity. Cells expressing mutant CaMKI (179CV) proved resistant in this regard. Thus, our results indicate that the reversible regulation of CaMKI via its modification at Cys(179) is an important mechanism in processing calcium signal transduction in cells.",M1
20420204,"Plasma concentration of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus in chinchilla with and without tooth overgrowth.The aim of the study was to identify the causes underlying overgrowth of incisors in chinchillas through an analysis of selected plasma electrolyte concentrations, with particular consideration of minerals involved in the formation of osseous tissue, i.e., <e>Ca</e>, Mg, and P. The analysis involved 40 female standard chinchillas managed in a commercial farm system, aged 2 to 4 years, divided into two groups of 20 individuals each: D--chinchillas with incisor overgrowth and C--controls with normal dentition. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, and P were measured in blood plasma. The analysis was carried out using ICP OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) by means of the Optima 2000 DV instrument (Perkin Elmer). The resulting data were analysed statistically using one-way ANOVA with Duncan's range test. The results show that abnormal metabolism of dental tissue minerals, especially Ca and P, cannot be excluded as the cause of tooth overgrowth in chinchilla.",M1
20417711,"Effect of FSH and progesterone on human spermatozoa cytosolic calcium.Ejaculated spermatozoa must undergo a number of modifications before fertilizing the oocyte: among these the capacitation and the acrosome reaction. Calcium signals play an essential role in these functional and structural modifications. Mature spermatozoa have few organelles and a very small cytoplasmic volume but maintain the homeostasis of [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](c) with great accuracy. We study Ca(2+) mobilization in human spermatozoa exposed to FSH and progesterone by measuring the [Ca(2+)](c) with the FURA-2AM method and report for the first time that the exposure to FSH (up to 98ng/ml) produced an increase of [Ca(2+)](c) to an extent comparable to that observed with 1muM progesterone. FSH and progesterone increase the spermatozoa [Ca(2+)](c) by acting primarily on calcium entry from the external medium. The effects of the two hormones on [Ca(2+)](c) were similar but not identical; the pre-treatment of progesterone blocks the effects of FSH, but not vice-versa. The increase of [Ca(2+)](c) due to FSH was more sensitive to nifedipine (VOCCs inhibitor) than that of progesterone. The effects of these hormones on calcium homeostasis may be relevant for sperm activation.",M1
20417605,"Ca2+ hot spots on the mitochondrial surface are generated by Ca2+ mobilization from stores, but not by activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels.Although it is widely accepted that mitochondria in living cells can efficiently uptake <e>Ca</e>(2+) during stimulation because of their vicinity to microdomains of high [Ca(2+)], the direct proof of Ca(2+) hot spots' existence is still lacking. Thanks to a GFP-based Ca(2+) probe localized on the cytosolic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane, we demonstrate that, upon Ca(2+) mobilization, the [Ca(2+)] in small regions of the mitochondrial surface reaches levels 5- to 10-fold higher than in the bulk cytosol. We also show that the [Ca(2+)] to which mitochondria are exposed during capacitative Ca(2+) influx is similar between near plasma membrane mitochondria and organelles deeply located in the cytoplasm, whereas it is 2- to 3-fold higher in subplasma membrane mitochondria upon activation of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. These results demonstrate that mitochondria are exposed to Ca(2+) hot spots close to the ER but are excluded from the regions where capacitative Ca(2+) influx occurs.",M1
20413591,"The TRPV4 channel contributes to intercellular junction formation in keratinocytes.Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is a physiological sensor for hypo-osmolarity, mechanical deformation, and warm temperature. The channel activation leads to various cellular effects involving <e>Ca</e>(2+) dynamics. We found that TRPV4 interacts with beta-catenin, a crucial component linking adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton, thereby enhancing cell-cell junction development and formation of the tight barrier between skin keratinocytes. TRPV4-deficient mice displayed impairment of the intercellular junction-dependent barrier function in the skin. In TRPV4-deficient keratinocytes, extracellular Ca(2+)-induced actin rearrangement and stratification were delayed following significant reduction in cytosolic Ca(2+) increase and small GTPase Rho activation. TRPV4 protein located where the cell-cell junctions are formed, and the channel deficiency caused abnormal cell-cell junction structures, resulting in higher intercellular permeability in vitro.

20413506,"Inhibition of beta-cell sodium-calcium exchange enhances glucose-dependent elevations in cytoplasmic calcium and insulin secretion.OBJECTIVE: The sodium-calcium exchanger isoform 1 (NCX1) regulates cytoplasmic calcium (<e>Ca</e>(2+)(c)) required for insulin secretion in beta-cells. NCX1 is alternatively spliced, resulting in the expression of splice variants in different tissues such as NCX1.3 and -1.7 in beta-cells. As pharmacological inhibitors of NCX1 splice variants are in development, the pharmacological profile of beta-cell NCX1.3 and -1.7 and the cellular effects of NCX1 inhibition were investigated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patch-clamp technique was used to examine the pharmacological profile of the NCX1 inhibitor KB-R7943 on recombinant NCX1.3 and -1.7 activity. Ca(2+) imaging and membrane capacitance were used to assess the effects of KB-R7943 on Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in mouse and human beta-cells and islets. RESULTS: NCX1.3 and -1.7 calcium extrusion (forward-mode) activity was approximately 16-fold more sensitive to KB-R7943 inhibition compared with cardiac NCX1.1 (IC(50s) = 2.9 and 2.4 vs. 43.0 micromol/l, respectively). In single mouse/human beta-cells, 1 micromol/l KB-R7943 increased insulin granule exocytosis but was without effect on alpha-cell glucagon granule exocytosis. KB-R7943 also augmented sulfonylurea and glucose-stimulated Ca(2+)(c) levels and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets, although KB-R7943 was without effect under nonstimulated conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Islet NCX1 splice variants display a markedly greater sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition than the cardiac NCX1.1 splice variant. NCX1 inhibition resulted in glucose-dependent increases in Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets. Thus, we identify beta-cell NCX1 splice variants as targets for the development of novel glucose-sensitive insulinotropic drugs for type 2 diabetes.",M1
20412795,"Voltage-gated calcium channels are involved in the regulation of calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle cells from isolated porcine retinal arterioles.Disturbances in the regulation of retinal arteriolar tone are involved in the pathophysiology of major vision threatening diseases. Therefore, improving the treatment of these diseases requires knowledge about how the contraction of retinal arterioles is controlled. The present study hypothesized that in addition to calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium entry from the extracellular space is also involved in the generation of calcium oscillations as a basis for initiation of contraction in retinal arterioles. Isolated porcine retinal arterioles were mounted in a confocal microvascular myograph and loaded with the calcium sensitive fluorophore Oregon Green allowing simultaneous measurements of oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration in individual smooth muscle cells and changes in the vascular tone. Recordings were made after pre-contraction with the thromboxane analogue U46619 in a low and a high ambient calcium concentration, and after subsequent blocking of voltage-gated calcium channels using nifedipine or the sarcoplasmic reticulum dependent calcium recruitment using ryanodine, caffeine, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid. U46619 increased the number of oscillations in a low but not in physiological extracellular calcium concentration. In contrast to mesenteric arterioles, blocking of sarcoplasmic reticulum <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels with ryanodine was without effect on both retinal arteriolar tone and calcium oscillations. Conversely, blocking of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump with cyclopiazonic acid or thapsigargin significantly reduced calcium oscillations, but not arteriolar tone. At a physiological extracellular calcium concentration, addition of nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced vascular tone but increased the number of cells displaying calcium oscillations. Fast oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration in retinal smooth muscle cells depend on calcium transport by both the SR and the sarcolemma. However, both sites of calcium recruitment seem to have unique properties in porcine retinal arterioles as compared to other organs.",M1
20410305,"Removal of the cardiac troponin I N-terminal extension improves cardiac function in aged mice.The cardiac troponin I (cTnI) isoform contains a unique N-terminal extension that functions to modulate activation of cardiac myofilaments. During cardiac remodeling restricted proteolysis of cTnI removes this cardiac specific N-terminal modulatory extension to alter myofilament regulation. We have demonstrated expression of the N-terminal-deleted cTnI (cTnI-ND) in the heart decreased the development of the cardiomyopathy like phenotype in a beta-adrenergic-deficient transgenic mouse model. To investigate the potential beneficial effects of cTnI-ND on the development of naturally occurring cardiac dysfunction, we measured the hemodynamic and biochemical effects of cTnI-ND transgenic expression in the aged heart. Echocardiographic measurements demonstrate cTnI-ND transgenic mice exhibit increased systolic and diastolic functions at 16 months of age compared with age-matched controls. This improvement likely results from decreased <e>Ca</e>(2+) sensitivity and increased cross-bridge kinetics as observed in skinned papillary bundles from young transgenic mice prior to the effects of aging. Hearts of cTnI-ND transgenic mice further exhibited decreased beta myosin heavy chain expression compared to age matched non-transgenic mice as well as altered cTnI phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated cTnI-ND expressed in the heart is not phosphorylated indicating the cTnI N-terminal is necessary for the higher level phosphorylation of cTnI. Taken together, our data suggest the regulated proteolysis of cTnI during cardiac stress to remove the unique cardiac N-terminal extension functions to improve cardiac contractility at the myofilament level and improve overall cardiac function.",M1
20408559,"Scherffelia dubia centrin exhibits a specific mechanism for <e>Ca</e>(2+)-controlled target binding.Centrins are calcium binding proteins that belong to the EF-hand (or calmodulin) superfamily, which are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Herein, we report the molecular features and binding properties of the green alga Scherffelia dubia centrin (SdCen), a member of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin (CrCen) subfamily. The Ca(2+) binding capacity of SdCen and its isolated N- and C-terminal domains (N-SdCen and C-SdCen, respectively) was investigated using flow dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry. In contrast with human centrin 1 and 2 (from the same subfamily), but like CrCen, SdCen exhibits three physiologically significant Ca(2+) binding sites, two in the N-terminal domain and one in the C-terminal domain. Mg(2+) ions could compete with Ca(2+) in one of the N-terminal sites. When Ca(2+) binds, the N-terminal domain becomes more stable and exposes a significant hydrophobic surface that binds hydrophobic fluorescent probes. The Ca(2+) binding properties and the metal ion-induced structural changes in the C-terminal domain are comparable to those of human centrins. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the binding of SdCen, N-SdCen, and C-SdCen to three types of natural target peptides, derived from the human XPC protein (P17-XPC), the human Sfi1 protein (R17-hSfi1), and the yeast Kar1 protein (P19-Kar1). The three peptides possess the complete (P17-XPC and R17-hSfi1) or partial (P19-Kar1) centrin binding motif (W(1)L(4)L(8)). The integral SdCen exhibits two binding sites for each target peptide, with distinct affinities for each site and each peptide. The high-affinity peptide binding site corresponds to the C-terminal domain of SdCen and displays binding constants and the poor Ca(2+) sensitivities similar to those observed for human centrins. The low-affinity site constituted by the N-terminal domain is active only in the presence of Ca(2+). The thermodynamic binding parameters suggest that the C-terminal domain of SdCen may be constitutively bound to a target, while the N-terminal domain could bind a target only after a Ca(2+) signal. SdCen is also able to interact with calmodulin binding peptides (W(1)F(5)V(8)F(14) motif) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas the isolated N- and C-terminal domains have a much lower affinity. These data suggest particular molecular mechanisms used by SdCen (and probably by other algal centrins) to respond to cellular Ca(2+) signals.",M1
20407082,"Aerobic exercise training improves Ca2+ handling and redox status of skeletal muscle in mice.Exercise training is known to promote relevant changes in the properties of skeletal muscle contractility toward powerful fibers. However, there are few studies showing the effect of a well-established exercise training protocol on <e>Ca</e>(2+) handling and redox status in skeletal muscles with different fiber-type compositions. We have previously standardized a valid and reliable protocol to improve endurance exercise capacity in mice based on maximal lactate steady-state workload (MLSSw). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exercise training, performed at MLSSw, on the skeletal muscle Ca(2+) handling-related protein levels and cellular redox status in soleus and plantaris. Male C57BL/6J mice performed treadmill training at MLSSw over a period of eight weeks. Muscle fiber-typing was determined by myosin ATPase histochemistry, citrate synthase activity by spectrophotometric assay, Ca(2+) handling-related protein levels by Western blot and reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH:GSSG) by high-performance liquid chromatography. Trained mice displayed higher running performance and citrate synthase activity compared with untrained mice. Improved running performance in trained mice was paralleled by fast-to-slow fiber-type shift and increased capillary density in both plantaris and soleus. Exercise training increased dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) alpha2 subunit, ryanodine receptor and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger levels in plantaris and soleus. Moreover, exercise training elevated DHPR beta1 subunit and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) 1 levels in plantaris and SERCA2 levels in soleus of trained mice. Skeletal muscle GSH content and GSH:GSSG ratio was increased in plantaris and soleus of trained mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that MLSSw exercise-induced better running performance is, in part, due to increased levels of proteins involved in skeletal muscle Ca(2+) handling, whereas this response is partially dependent on specificity of skeletal muscle fiber-type composition. Finally, we demonstrated an augmented cellular redox status and GSH antioxidant capacity in trained mice.",M1
20406802,"Activation of polycystic kidney disease-2-like 1 (PKD2L1)-PKD1L3 complex by acid in mouse taste cells.Five basic tastes (bitter, sweet, umami, salty, and sour) are detected in the four taste areas where taste buds reside. Although molecular mechanisms for detecting bitter, sweet, and umami have been well clarified, those for sour and salty remain poorly understood. Several channels including acid-sensing ion channels have been proposed as candidate sour receptors, but they do not encompass all sour-sensing abilities in vivo. We recently reported a novel candidate for sour sensing, the polycystic kidney disease-2-like 1 (PKD2L1)-PKD1L3 channel complex. This channel is not a traditional ligand-gated channel and is gated open only after removal of an acid stimulus, called an off response. Here we show that off responses upon acid stimulus are clearly observed in native taste cells from circumvallate, but not fungiform papillae, of glutamate decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knock-in mice, from which Type III taste cells can be visualized, using <e>Ca</e>(2+) imaging and patch clamp methods. Off responses were detected in most cells where PKD2L1 immunoreactivity was observed. Interestingly, the pH threshold for acid-evoked intracellular Ca(2+) increase was around 5.0, a value much higher than that observed in HEK293 cells expressing the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex. Thus, PKD2L1-PKD1L3-mediated acid-evoked off responses occurred both in HEK293 cells and in native taste cells, suggesting the involvement of the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex in acid sensing in vivo.",M1
20404049,"Knockdown of stromal interaction molecule 1 attenuates hepatocyte growth factor-induced endothelial progenitor cell proliferation.Increased <e>Ca</e>(2+) entry through store-operated Ca(2+) channels (SOCCs) plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell proliferation. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is thought to transmit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) store depletion signals to the plasma membrane (PM), causing the opening of SOCCs in the PM. However, the relationship between HGF and STIM1 in endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) proliferation remains uncharacterized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential involvement of STIM1 in HGF-induced EPC proliferation. For this purpose, we used cultured rat bone marrow-derived EPCs and found that HGF-induced EPC proliferation at low concentrations. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) was elevated in HGF-treated EPCs, and the SOCC inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and BTP-2 inhibited the HGF-induced proliferation response. Moreover, STIM1 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in response to HGF stimulation and knockdown of STMI1 decreased SOCE and prevented HGF-induced EPC proliferation. In conclusion, our data suggest that HGF-induced EPC proliferation is mediated partly via activation of STIM1.",M1
20403327,"TRP channel regulates EGFR signaling in hair morphogenesis and skin barrier formation.A plethora of growth factors regulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation that control hair morphogenesis and skin barrier formation. Wavy hair phenotypes in mice result from naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in the genes for TGF-alpha and EGFR. Conversely, excessive activities of TGF-alpha/EGFR result in hairless phenotypes and skin cancers. Unexpectedly, we found that mice lacking the Trpv3 gene also exhibit wavy hair coat and curly whiskers. Here we show that keratinocyte TRPV3, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of <e>Ca</e>(2+)-permeant channels, forms a signaling complex with TGF-alpha/EGFR. Activation of EGFR leads to increased TRPV3 channel activity, which in turn stimulates TGF-alpha release. TRPV3 is also required for the formation of the skin barrier by regulating the activities of transglutaminases, a family of Ca(2+)-dependent crosslinking enzymes essential for keratinocyte cornification. Our results show that a TRP channel plays a role in regulating growth factor signaling by direct complex formation.",M1
20403083,"Mitochondrial protection after traumatic brain injury by scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals.Mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is manifested by increased levels of oxidative damage, loss of respiratory functions and diminished ability to buffer cytosolic calcium. This study investigated the detrimental effects of lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO(*)) and lipid peroxidation (LP) in brain mitochondria after TBI by examining the protective effects of U-83836E, a potent and selective scavenger of LOO(*) radicals. Male CF1 mice were subjected to severe controlled cortical impact TBI (CCI-TBI) and treated with either vehicle or U-83836E initiated i.v. at 15 min post-injury. Calcium (<e>Ca</e>(++)) buffering capacity and respiratory function were measured in isolated cortical mitochondrial samples taken from the ipsilateral hemisphere at 3 and 12 h post-TBI, respectively. In vehicle-treated injured mice, the cortical mitochondrial Ca(++) buffering capacity was reduced by 60% at 3 h post-injury (p &lt; 0.001) and the respiratory control ratio was decreased by 27% at 12 h post-TBI, relative to sham, non-injured mice. U-83836E treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.05) preserved Ca(++) buffering capacity and attenuated the reduction in respiratory control ratio values. Consistent with the functional effects of U-83836E being as a result of an attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative damage, the compound significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced LP-generated 4-hydroxynonenal levels in both cortical homogenates and mitochondria at both 3 and 12 h post-TBI. Unexpectedly, U-83836E also reduced peroxynitrite-generated 3-nitrotyrosine in parallel with the reduction in 4-hydroxynonenal. The results demonstrate that LOO(*) radicals contribute to secondary brain mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI by propagating LP and protein nitrative damage in cellular and mitochondrial membranes.",M1
20403073,"Reduced blockade by extracellular Mg(2+) is permissive to NMDA receptor activation in cerebellar granule neurons that model a migratory phenotype.NMDA receptors (NMDAR) contribute to neuronal development throughout the CNS. However, their mode(s) of activation preceding synaptic maturation is unclear, as they are not co-localized with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptors (AMPARs) which normally provide sufficient depolarization to relieve voltage-dependent blockade by Mg(2+). We used cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) cultured at a near-physiological KCl concentration to examine maturation-dependent changes in NMDAR responses. In contrast, most studies use KCl-supplemented medium to promote survival. At 2-4 days in vitro CGNs: (i) express developmental markers resembling the in vivo migratory phenotype; (ii) maintain a basal amount of calcium responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation that requires NMDARs and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, but not AMPARs; (iii) exhibit NMDA-mediated <e>Ca</e>(2+) influx not effectively blocked by ambient Mg(2+) (0.75 mM) or AMPARs; (iv) maintain a more depolarized resting membrane potential and increased resistance compared to synaptically-connected CGNs. Moreover, migrating CGNs in explant cultures demonstrate NMDA-mediated Ca(2+) influx not effectively blocked by 0.75 mM Mg(2+), and NMDAR but not AMPAR antagonists slow migration. These data suggest the biophysical properties of immature CGNs render NMDARs less sensitive to Mg(2+) blockade, enhancing the likelihood of activation in the absence of AMPAR depolarization.",M1
20400951,"Binding of the complexin N terminus to the SNARE complex potentiates synaptic-vesicle fusogenicity.Complexins facilitate and inhibit neurotransmitter release through distinct domains, and their function was proposed to be coupled to the <e>Ca</e>(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1). However, the mechanisms underlying complexin function remain unclear. We now uncover an interaction between the complexin N terminus and the SNARE complex C terminus, and we show that disrupting this interaction abolishes the facilitatory function of complexins in mouse neurons. Analyses of hypertonically induced exocytosis show that complexins enhance synaptic-vesicle fusogenicity. Genetic experiments crossing complexin- and Syt1-null mice indicate a functional interaction between these proteins but also show that complexins can promote Ca(2+)-triggered release in the absence of Syt1. We propose that the complexin N terminus stabilizes the SNARE complex C terminus and/or helps release the inhibitory function of complexins, thereby activating the fusion machinery in a manner that may cooperate with Syt1 but does not require Syt1.",M1
20400783,"The role of calcium in modulating the reactivity of the smooth muscle cells during ischemia/reperfusion. Part 2.BACKGROUND: Damage of transplanted organs during reperfusion is still a problem that prompts the search for new drugs able to diminish the risk of graft rejection. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of antioxidant system on the contraction of arteries induced by angiotensin II during ischemia/reperfusion and to determine the role of intracellular and extracellular calcium ions under these conditions. MATERIAL/METHODS:The experiments were performed on male Wistar rats' tail arteries. The effects of angiotensin II on vascular tone were examined after ischemia/reperfusion in the presence of catalase or aminotriazole. To determine the role of intracellular and extracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+), the experiments were performed in Ca(2+)-free PSS and PSS. RESULTS: Angiotensin II increased perfusion pressure in both Ca(2+)-free PSS and PSS. After ischemia, the reactions induced by angiotensin II were lower, while after reperfusion they were higher. In the presence of catalase the effects induced by angiotensin II were lower and in the presence of aminotriazole higher. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia inhibits and reperfusion augments the perfusion pressure induced by angiotensin II. The results confirm the vasoprotective effect of catalase and the destructive influence of aminotriazole in modulating the reactions of vascular smooth muscle cells to ANG II after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that the antioxidant system plays a role in modulating the reactions induced by angiotensin II after ischemia/reperfusion and that reperfusion disturbs the balance between antioxidants and the production of reactive oxygen species.",M1
20400631,"Effect of acute exposure to low environmental calcium on respiration and locomotion in Lymnaea stagnalis (L.).Environmental calcium is a major factor affecting the distribution of freshwater gastropods. Whilst the effects on growth and morphology are fairly well understood, little is known about how calcium availability affects other aspects of gastropod biology. Lymnaea stagnalis (L.) is considered a calciphile and exhibits reduced growth and survival in environments containing less than 20 mg l(-1) <e>Ca</e>(2+). Many freshwater systems exhibit fluctuations in calcium concentration over time: where calcium levels are normally high there may be periods of low [Ca(2+)], for example following periods of flooding. Here we examined the effects of acute periods of low (20 mg l(-1)) environmental calcium on the physiology and behaviour of L. stagnalis, specifically measuring how locomotion and respiration differ between high calcium (80 mg l(-1)) and low calcium (20 mg l(-1)) environments. We found that in a low calcium environment crawling speed is reduced, and that this coincides with an increase in cutaneous respiration, indicating that the increased metabolic demands of calcium acquisition at low [Ca(2+)] reduce the energy available for locomotion. Conversely we found a decrease in aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions in the low calcium relative to the high calcium environment. In conclusion, we found that acute exposure to low environmental calcium has a highly significant effect on locomotion and respiration, which may have consequences for snail fitness when no morphological effects are apparent.",M1
20400502,"The calcium-mobilizing messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate participates in sperm activation by mediating the acrosome reaction.Before a sperm can fertilize an egg it must undergo a final activation step induced by the egg termed the acrosome reaction. During the acrosome reaction a lysosome-related organelle, the acrosome, fuses with the plasma membrane to release hydrolytic enzymes and expose an egg-binding protein. Because NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) releases <e>Ca</e>(2+) from acidic lysosome-related organelles in other cell types, we investigated a possible role for NAADP in mediating the acrosome reaction. We report that NAADP binds with high affinity to permeabilized sea urchin sperm. Moreover, we used Mn(2+) quenching of luminal fura-2 and (45)Ca(2+) to directly demonstrate NAADP regulation of a cation channel on the acrosome. Additionally, we show that NAADP synthesis occurs through base exchange and is driven by an increase in Ca(2+). We propose a new model for acrosome reaction signaling in which Ca(2+) influx initiated by egg jelly stimulates NAADP synthesis and that this NAADP acts on its receptor/channel on the acrosome to release Ca(2+) to drive acrosomal exocytosis.",M1
20399800,"Side-specific effects by cadmium exposure: apical and basolateral treatment in a coculture model of the blood-air barrier.Cadmium (Cd(2+)) is a widespread environmental pollutant, which is associated with a wide variety of cytotoxic and metabolic effects. Recent studies showed that intoxication with the heavy metal most importantly targets the integrity of the epithelial barrier. In our study, the lung epithelial cell line, NCI H441, was cultured with the endothelial cell line, ISO-HAS-1, as a bilayer on a 24-well HTS-Transwell filter plate. This coculture model was exposed to various concentrations of CdCl(2). The transepithelial electrical resistance decreased on the apical side only after treatment with high Cd(2+) concentrations after 48 h. By contrast, a breakdown of TER to less than 5% of baseline could be observed much earlier (after 24 h) when Cd(2+) was administered from the basal side. Observations of cell layer fragmentation and widening of intercellular spaces confirmed the barrier breakdown only for the basolaterally treated samples. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and release of proinflammatory markers was enhanced if samples were exposed to Cd(2+) from the basal side compared to treatment from the apical side. Moreover, we could demonstrate that a high concentration of <e>Ca</e>(2+) could prevent the barrier-disrupting effect of Cd(2+). In conclusion, the exposure of Cd(2+) to cocultures of lung cells caused a decrease in TER, major morphological changes, a reduction of cell viability and an increase of cytokine release, but the effects markedly differed between the two modes of exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that intact epithelial TJs may play a major role in protecting the air-blood barrier from inhaled Cd(2+).",M1
20398793,"Phagocytic activity, respiratory burst, cytoplasmic free-<e>Ca</e>(2+) concentration and apoptotic cell ratio of haemocytes from the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon under acute copper stress.The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular toxicity of copper-induced injury to the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. The 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h LC(50) (median lethal concentration) of Cu(2+) on P. monodon (11.63+/-1.14g) were found to be 3.49, 1.54, 0.73 and 0.40mgL(-1), respectively. Total haemocyte count (THC), phagocytic activity, respiratory burst (RB), cytoplasmic free-Ca(2+) (cf-Ca(2+)) concentration and apoptotic cell ratio of shrimp were determined after exposure to different concentrations of Cu(2+) (0, 0.05, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.5mgL(-1)) for 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48h. There was no significant effect on the analytic indicator of shrimp exposed to 0.05mgL(-1) Cu(2+). THC decreased after Cu-exposure to 0.5mgL(-1) for 48h, 1.5mgL(-1) for 24h and 3.5mgL(-1) for 12h. Phagocytic activity decreased in P. monodon following 48h exposure to 3.5mgL(-1) Cu(2+). RB was induced after 6h exposure to 0.5, 1.5 and 3.5mgL(-1) Cu(2+). cf-Ca(2+) concentration increased after 48h exposure to 0.5mgL(-1) Cu(2+), and 12h exposure to 1.5 and 3.5mgL(-1) Cu(2+). The percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 9.5%, 16.3% and 18.6% respectively following 48h exposure to 0.5, 1.5 and 3.5mgL(-1) Cu(2+). These results indicate that Cu can induce oxidative stress, elevation of cf-Ca(2+) and cell apoptosis, and inhibit phagocytic activity in the shrimp P. monodon, and the lethal injury of Cu(2+) to P. monodon may be mainly due to the sharp reduction of THC caused by ROS-induced apoptosis.",M1

20398238,"Salinity tolerance of Populus.The genus Populus has a wide distribution in different climatic zones. Besides its economic and ecological relevance, Populus also serves as a model for elucidating physiological and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in tree species. In this review, adaptation strategies of poplars to excess soil salinity are addressed at different scales, from the cellular to the whole-plant level. Striking differences in salt tolerance exist among different poplar species and ecotypes, with Populus euphratica being outstanding in this respect. Key mechanisms identified in this species to mediate salt tolerance are compartmentalisation of Cl(-) in the vacuoles of the root cortex cells, diminished xylem loading of NaCl, activation of Na(+) extrusion into the soil solution under stress, together with simultaneously avoiding excessive K(+) loss by regulation of depolarisation-activated cation channels. This leads to improved maintenance of the K(+)/Na(+) balance, a crucial precondition for survival under salt stress. Leaf cells of this species are able to compartmentalise Na(+) preferentially in the apoplast, whereas in susceptible poplar species, as well as in crop plants, vacuolar Na(+) deposition precedes apoplastic transport. ABA, <e>Ca</e>(2+)and ROS are involved in stress sensing, with higher or faster activation of defences in tolerant than in susceptible poplar species. P. euphratica develops leaf succulence after prolonged salt exposure as a plastic morphological adaptation that leads to salt dilution. Transgenic approaches to improve salt tolerance by transformation of candidate genes have had limited success, since salt tolerance is a multigenic trait. In future attempts towards increased salt resistance, barriers between different poplar sections must be overcome and application of novel biotechnological tools, such as gene stacking, are recommended.",M1

20395597,"Calmodulin interacts with ATP binding cassette transporter A1 to protect from calpain-mediated degradation and upregulates high-density lipoprotein generation.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) with calmodulin in relation to its calpain-mediated degradation because many calpain substrates bind calmodulin to regulate cellular functions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The activity of ABCA1 is regulated through proteolysis by calpain. An immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay revealed that ABCA1 directly binds calmodulin in a <e>Ca</e>(2+)-dependent manner. The cytoplasmic loop of ABCA1 contains a typical calmodulin binding sequence of 1-5-8-14 motifs (1245 to 1257 amino acids). The peptide of this region showed binding to calmodulin, and deletion of the 1-5-8-14 motif abolished this interaction. This motif is located near the ABCA1 Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr sequence, and the presence of calmodulin/Ca(2+) protected the peptides from proteolysis by calpain. The knockdown of calmodulin by a specific small and interfering RNA increased the degradation of ABCA1 and decreased ABCA1 protein and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated lipid release. Surprisingly, calmodulin inhibitor W7 increased calmodulin binding to ABCA1 and protected it from calpain-mediated degradation, consistent with our previous finding that this compound increased apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cell cholesterol release. CONCLUSIONS: Calmodulin directly binds and stabilizes ABCA1 in the presence of Ca(2+) and increases the generation of high-density lipoprotein.",M1
20395302,"Farnesyl pyrophosphate is a novel pain-producing molecule via specific activation of TRPV3.Temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential ion channels (thermoTRPs) expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and sensory afferents play an important role as peripheral pain detectors for our body. Many natural and synthetic compounds have been found to act on the thermoTRPs leading to altered nociception, but little is known about endogenous painful molecules activating TRPV3. Here, we show that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), an intermediate metabolite in the mevalonate pathway, specifically activates TRPV3 among six thermoTRPs using <e>Ca</e>(2+) imaging and electrophysiology with cultured keratinocytes and TRPV3-overexpressing cells. Agonistic potencies of related compounds in the FPP metabolism were ignorable. Voltage-dependence of TRPV3 was shifted by FPP, which appears to be the activation mechanism. An intraplantar injection of FPP acutely elicits nociceptive behaviors in inflamed animals, indicating that FPP is a novel endogenous pain-producing substance via TRPV3 activation. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that this FPP-evoked signal in the keratinocytes is transmitted to sensory neurons. In addition, FPP reduced TRPV3 heat threshold resulting in heightened behavioral sensitivity to noxious heat. Taken together, our data suggest that FPP is the firstly identified endogenous TRPV3 activator that causes nociception. Our results may provide useful chemical information to elucidate TRPV3 physiology and novel pain-related metabolisms.",M1
20395295,"A novel native store-operated calcium channel encoded by Orai3: selective requirement of Orai3 versus Orai1 in estrogen receptor-positive versus estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells.Store-operated calcium (<e>Ca</e>(2+)) entry (SOCE) mediated by STIM/Orai proteins is a ubiquitous pathway that controls many important cell functions including proliferation and migration. STIM proteins are Ca(2+) sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum and Orai proteins are channels expressed at the plasma membrane. The fall in endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) causes translocation of STIM1 to subplasmalemmal puncta where they activate Orai1 channels that mediate the highly Ca(2+)-selective Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)). Whereas Orai1 has been clearly shown to encode SOCE channels in many cell types, the role of Orai2 and Orai3 in native SOCE pathways remains elusive. Here we analyzed SOCE in ten breast cell lines picked in an unbiased way. We used a combination of Ca(2+) imaging, pharmacology, patch clamp electrophysiology, and molecular knockdown to show that native SOCE and I(CRAC) in estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer cell lines are mediated by STIM1/2 and Orai3 while estrogen receptor-negative (ER(-)) breast cancer cells use the canonical STIM1/Orai1 pathway. The ER(+) breast cancer cells represent the first example where the native SOCE pathway and I(CRAC) are mediated by Orai3. Future studies implicating Orai3 in ER(+) breast cancer progression might establish Orai3 as a selective target in therapy of ER(+) breast tumors.",M1
20394142,"Role of calcium/ magnesium infusion in oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients.The combination of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin is known as the FOLFOX regimen, and it has become a standard regimen for colorectal cancer (CRC), both as adjuvant therapy and as treatment for metastatic disease. Unfortunately, platinum-based chemotherapies also produce neurotoxicity as a side effect. Neurotoxicity is the most common dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin, and it is one of the major causes for patients to stop receiving chemotherapy. It can manifest as either of two distinct syndromes: a transient, acute syndrome that can appear during or shortly after the infusion (approximately 1%-2% of patients), and a dose-limiting, cumulative sensory neuropathy. Calcium/magnesium (<e>Ca</e>/Mg) infusions have been used to decrease the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. The actual utility of Ca/Mg infusions in this setting has been an interesting and controversial topic. They may reduce the severity of neurotoxicity, but some investigators have questioned whether they also will alter the efficacy of these chemotherapy regimens. In this paper, we review the clinical data concerning the usefulness of Ca/Mg infusions in reducing the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy as well as their effect on responsiveness to chemotherapy.",M1
20392950,"Bicuculline-sensitive primary afferent depolarization remains after greatly restricting synaptic transmission in the mammalian spinal cord.Primary afferent neurotransmission is the fundamental first step in the central processing of sensory stimuli. A major mechanism producing afferent presynaptic inhibition is via a channel-mediated depolarization of their intraspinal terminals which can be recorded extracellularly as a dorsal root potential (DRP). Based on measures of DRP latency it has been inferred that this primary afferent depolarization (PAD) of low-threshold afferents is mediated by minimally trisynaptic pathways with GABAergic interneurons forming last-order axoaxonic synapses onto afferent terminals. We used an in vitro rat spinal cord preparation under conditions that restrict synaptic transmission to test whether more direct low-threshold pathways can produce PAD. Mephenesin or high divalent cation solutions were used to limit oligosynaptic transmission. Recordings of synaptic currents in dorsal horn neurons and population synaptic potentials in ventral roots provided evidence that conventional transmission was chiefly restricted to monosynaptic actions. Under these conditions, DRP amplitude was largely unchanged but with faster time to peak and reduced duration. Similar results were obtained following stimulation of peripheral nerves. Even following near complete block of transmission with high Mg(2+)/low <e>Ca</e>(2+)-containing solution, the evoked DRP was reduced but not blocked. In comparison, in nominally Ca(2+)-free or EGTA-containing solution, the DRP was completely blocked confirming that Ca(2+) entry mediated synaptic transmission is required for DRP genesis. Overall these results demonstrate that PAD of low-threshold primary afferents can occur by more direct synaptic mechanisms, including the possibility of direct negative-feedback or nonspiking dendroaxonic pathways.",M1
20392940,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mediates the electrophysiological and toxic actions of the cycad derivative beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine on substantia nigra pars compacta DAergic neurons.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-Parkinson dementia complex (ALS-PDC) is a neurodegenerative disease with ALS, parkinsonism, and Alzheimer's symptoms that is prevalent in the Guam population. beta-N-Methylamino alanine (BMAA) has been proposed as the toxic agent damaging several neuronal types in ALS-PDC, including substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic (SNpc DAergic) neurons. BMAA is a mixed glutamate receptor agonist, but the specific pathways activated in DAergic neurons are not yet known. We combined electrophysiology, microfluorometry, and confocal microscopy analysis to monitor membrane potential/current, cytosolic calcium concentration ([<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i)) changes, cytochrome-c (cyt-c) immunoreactivity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by BMAA. Rapid toxin applications caused reversible membrane depolarization/inward current and increase of firing rate and [Ca(2+)](i) in DAergic neurons. The inward current (I(BMAA)) was mainly mediated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), coupled to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and to a lesser extent, AMPA receptors. Indeed, mGluR1 (CPCCOEt) and TRP channels (SKF 96365; Ruthenium Red) antagonists reduced I(BMAA), and a small component of I(BMAA) was reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX. Calcium accumulation was mediated by mGluR1 but not by AMPA receptors. Application of a low concentration of NMDA potentiated the BMAA-mediated calcium increase. Prolonged exposure to BMAA caused significant modifications of membrane properties, calcium overload, cell shrinkage, massive cyt-c release into the cytosol and ROS production. In SNpc GABAergic neurons, BMAA activated only AMPA receptors. Our study identifies the mGluR1-activated mechanism induced by BMAA that may cause the neuronal degeneration and parkinsonian symptoms seen in ALS-PDC. Moreover, environmental exposure to BMAA might possibly also contribute to idiopathic PD.",M1
20392830,"Elucidation of mechanisms of the reciprocal cross talk between gonadotropin-releasing hormone and prostaglandin receptors.We recently described a novel GnRH receptor signaling pathway mediated by the prostaglandins (PGs) F(2alpha) and PGI(2), which acts through an autocrine/paracrine modality to limit autoregulation of the GnRH receptor and inhibit LH but not FSH release. Here we further explore the cross talk between GnRH and the PG receptors. GnRH stimulates arachidonic acid (AA) release from LbetaT2 gonadotrope cells via the <e>Ca</e>(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) and not via the more common Ca(2+)-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha). AA release was followed by a marked induction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 by GnRH via the protein kinase C/c-Src/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/MAPK pathway. COX-2 transcription by GnRH is mediated by the two nuclear factor-kappaB sites and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site within its promoter. Indeed, GnRH stimulates p65/RelA phosphorylation (22-fold) in LbetaT2 cells and the two nuclear factor-kappaB sites apparently act as a composite response element. Although GnRH stimulates cAMP formation in LbetaT2 cells, we found no role for cAMP acting via the cAMP response element site in the COX-2 promoter. PGF(2alpha), PGI(2), or PGE(2) had no effect on GnRH-stimulated ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38MAPK activation or on GnRH- and high K(+)-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) elevation in LbetaT2 and gonadotropes in primary culture. Although, PGF(2alpha), PGI(2), and PGE(2) reduced GnRH-stimulated cAMP formation, we could not correlate it to the inhibition of GnRH receptor expression, which is exerted only by PGF(2alpha) and PGI(2.) Hence, the inhibition by PGF(2alpha) and PGI(2) of the autoregulation of GnRH receptor expression is most likely mediated via inhibition of GnRH-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover and not by inhibition of Ca(2+) elevation and MAPK activation.",M1
20392813,"Vesicular storage, vesicle trafficking, and secretion of leptin and resistin: the similarities, differences, and interplays.Adipose tissue is a highly active endocrine organ secreting a variety of signaling molecules called adipokines. Leptin and resistin are two adipokines critically involved in metabolic homeostasis. Nevertheless, the secretory pathways of these adipokines and their interplays are poorly elucidated. In this work, we have comparatively studied several key aspects of leptin and resistin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was found that leptin and resistin molecules are compartmentalized into different secretory vesicles. The trafficking of leptin and resistin vesicles, and the secretion of leptin and resistin are oppositely regulated by insulin/glycolytic substrates and cAMP/protein kinase A. Interestingly, these two adipokines adversely influence each other on secretion and vesicle trafficking. Finally, we demonstrated that both leptin and resistin secretion are <e>Ca</e>(2+) dependent.",M1
20392260,"Calmodulin-an often-ignored signal in osteoclasts.Calcium signaling plays a key role in bone turnover, regulating both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Despite this the role of calmodulin, the primary intracellular calcium receptor regulatory protein, has received little attention. In this brief review, the function of <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin signaling in osteoclast development, function, and apoptosis is reviewed. Considerable evidence supports an important regulatory role for Ca(2+)/calmodulin signaling in each of these processes. The overall role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin in regulating bone turnover is also supported by animal and human studies showing that calmodulin antagonists preserve bone mass.",M1
20392259,"Regulation of bone turnover by calcium-regulated calcium channels.Calcium plays multiple roles in osteoclast formation, survival, and activity. Intracellular calcium is determined both by the release of intracellular stores and the influx of extracellular calcium through a variety of calcium channels. Osteoclasts express several classes of calcium channels, including ryanodine receptors (RyRs), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs), and calcium release-activated calcium channels (CRACs), which respond to depletion of intracellular stores. IP(3)R2 is expressed in osteoclast precursors and activated by cytokines that stimulate osteoclast differentiation. In mature osteoclasts, the IP(3)R1 isoform is highly expressed and is implicated in nitric oxide-cGMP-stimulated processes. RyR calcium channels may contribute to the release of intracellular calcium stores, while RyR2 in the plasma membrane may act to limit osteoclast activity based on extracellular calcium concentration. Orai, through regulation by endoplasmic reticular store-sensing proteins, including Stim-1, may also mediate calcium influx and act as a signal amplifier for calcium release by other calcium channels. Together, these receptors allow intracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+) signals to modulate bone turnover and, through calcium-sensing functions, allow coupling of osteoclast activity to extracellular conditions and integrating additional cytokine and nitric oxide signals via transient intracellular calcium signals.",M1
20392129,"Detecting intramolecular dynamics and multiple Förster resonance energy transfer states by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a robust method for the detection of intramolecular dynamics in proteins but is also susceptible to interference from other dynamic processes such as triplet kinetics and photobleaching. We describe an approach for the detection of intramolecular dynamics in proteins labeled with a FRET dye pair based on global fitting to the two autocorrelation functions (green-green and red-red) and the two cross-correlation functions (green-red and red-green). We applied the method to detect intramolecular dynamics in the <e>Ca</e>(2+) signaling protein calmodulin. Dynamics were detected on the 100 mus time scale in Ca(2+)-activated calmodulin, whereas in apocalmodulin dynamics were not detected on this time scale. Control measurements on a polyproline FRET construct (Gly-Pro(15)-Cys) demonstrate the reliability of the method for isolating intramolecular dynamics from other dynamic processes on the microsecond time scale and confirm the absence of intramolecular dynamics of polyproline. We further show the sensitivity of the initial amplitudes of the FCS auto- and cross-correlation functions to the presence of multiple FRET states, static or dynamic. The FCS measurements also show that the diffusion of Ca(2+)-calmodulin is slower than that of apocalmodulin, indicating either a larger average hydrodynamic radius or shape effects resulting in a slower translational diffusion.",M1
20391122,"Trihalomethanes in drinking water and the risk of death from rectal cancer: does hardness in drinking water matter?The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the relationship between total trihalomethanes (TTHM) levels in public water supplies and risk of rectal cancer development and (2) to determine whether calcium (<e>Ca</e>) and magnesium (Mg) levels in drinking water might modify the effects of TTHM on risk of developing rectal cancer. A matched cancer case-control study was used to investigate the relationship between the risk of death attributed to rectal cancer and exposure to TTHM in drinking water in 53 municipalities in Taiwan. All rectal cancer deaths in the 53 municipalities from 1998 through 2007 were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. Controls were deaths from other causes and were pair-matched to cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each cancer case. Data on TTHM levels in drinking water were collected from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. Information on the levels of Ca and Mg in drinking water was obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation. The municipality of residence for cancer cases and controls was presumed to be the source of the subject's TTHM, Ca, and Mg exposure via drinking water. Relative to individuals whose TTHM exposure level was &lt;4.9 ppb, the adjusted OR (95% CI) for rectal cancer occurrence was 1.04 (0.88-1.22) for individuals who resided in municipalities served by drinking water with a TTHM exposure &gt;or=4.9 ppb. There was no evidence of an interaction of drinking-water TTHM levels with low Ca intake via drinking water. However, evidence of an interaction was noted between drinking-water TTHM concentrations and Mg intake via drinking water. Our findings showed that the correlation between TTHM exposure and risk of rectal cancer is influenced by Mg in drinking water. Increased knowledge of the interaction between Mg and TTHM in reducing rectal cancer risk will aid in public policymaking and standard setting.",M1

20388794,"Piracy of prostaglandin E2/EP receptor-mediated signaling by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (HHV-8) for latency gene expression: strategy of a successful pathogen.Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is implicated in the pathogenesis of KS, a chronic inflammation-associated malignancy. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), two pivotal proinflammatory/oncogeneic molecules, are proposed to play roles in the expression of major KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen-1 (LANA-1). Microsomal PGE2 synthase, PGE2, and its receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) were detected in KS lesions with the distinct staining of EP2/EP4 in KS lesions. In latently infected endothelial TIVE-LTC cells, EP receptor antagonists downregulated LANA-1 expression as well as <e>Ca</e>(2+), p-Src, p-PI3K, p-PKCzeta/lambda, and p-NF-kappaB, which are also some of the signal molecules proposed to be important in KS pathogenesis. Exogenous PGE2 and EP receptor agonists induced the LANA-1 promoter in 293 cells, and YY1, Sp1, Oct-1, Oct-6, C/EBP, and c-Jun transcription factors seem to be involved in this induction. PGE2/EP receptor-induced LANA-1 promoter activity was downregulated significantly by the inhibition of Ca(2+), p-Src, p-PI3K, p-PKCzeta/lambda, and p-NF-kappaB. These findings implicate the inflammatory PGE2/EP receptors and the associated signal molecules in herpes virus latency and uncover a novel paradigm that shows the evolution of KSHV genome plasticity to use inflammatory response for its survival advantage of maintaining latent gene expression. These data also suggest that potential use of anti-COX-2 and anti-EP receptor therapy may not only ameliorate the chronic inflammation associated with KS but could also lead to elimination of the KSHV latent infection and the associated KS lesions.",M1
20388521,"Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation induced by CIJ-3-2F, a novel benzyl-furoquinoline with antiarrhythmic action, in rat aorta.AIMS: This study was designed to examine the mechanism of relaxation induced by CIJ-3-2F, a benzyl-furoquinoline antiarrhythmic agent, in rat thoracic aorta at the tissue and cellular levels. MAIN METHODS: Isometric tension of rat aortic ring was measured in response to drugs. Ionic channel activities in freshly dissociated aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. KEY FINDINGS: CIJ-3-2F relaxed both phenylephrine (PE) and high KCl (60mM)-induced contractions with respective pEC(50) (-log EC(50)) values of 6.91+/-0.07 and 6.32+/-0.06. Removal of endothelium or pretreatment with nitric oxide (NO)-pathway inhibitors N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (L-NIO), hemoglobin, methylene blue or 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,2-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) reduced the relaxant effect of CIJ-3-2F. Relaxation to CIJ-3-2F was also attenuated by K(+) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but not by charybdotoxin plus apamin, iberiotoxin, glibenclamide, or BaCl(2). CIJ-3-2F non-competitively antagonized the contractions induced by PE, <e>Ca</e>(2+), and Bay K8644 in endothelium-denuded rings. In addition, CIJ-3-2F inhibited both the phasic and tonic contractions induced by PE but did not affect the transient contraction induced by caffeine. CIJ-3-2F reduced the Ba(2+) inward current through L-type Ca(2+) channel (IC(50)=4.1microM) and enhanced the voltage-dependent K(+) (K(v)) current in aortic VSMCs. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that CIJ-3-2F induced both endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation; the former is likely mediated by the NO/cGMP pathway whereas the latter is probably mediated through inhibition of Ca(2+) influx or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3))-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) release, or through activation of K(v) channels.",M1
20388514,"Mitochondrial calcium channels.Mitochondrial <e>Ca</e>(2+) handling plays an important role in energy production and various cellular signaling processes. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is regulated by the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU), at least one non-MCU Ca(2+) channel and possibly a mitochondrial ryanodine receptor. Two distinct mechanisms mediate Ca(2+) outward transport, the Na(+)-dependent (mNCX) and the Na(+)-independent Ca(2+) efflux. In recent years we gained more insight into the regulation and function of these different Ca(2+) transport mechanisms. However, the precise physiological role and the molecular structure of all mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporters and channels still has to be determined.",M1
20384310,"Tailoring silica nanotribology for CMP slurry optimization: <e>Ca</e>(2+) cation competition in C(12)TAB mediated lubrication.Self-assembled surfactant structures at the solid/liquid interface have been shown to act as nanoparticulate dispersants and are capable of providing a highly effective, self-healing boundary lubrication layer in aqueous environments. However, in some cases in particular, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) applications the lubrication imparted by self-assembled surfactant dispersants can be too strong, resulting in undesirably low levels of wear or friction disabling material removal. In the present investigation, the influence of calcium cation (Ca(2+)) addition on dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (C(12)TAB) mediated lubrication of silica surfaces is examined via normal and lateral atomic force microscopy (AFM/LFM), benchtop polishing experiments and surface adsorption characterization methods. It is demonstrated that the introduction of competitively adsorbing cations that modulate the surfactant headgroup surface affinity can be used to tune friction and wear without compromising dispersion stability. These self-healing, reversible, and tunable tribological systems are expected to lead to the development of smart surfactant-based aqueous lubrication schemes, which include designer polishing slurries and devices that take advantage of pressure-gated friction response phenomena.",M1
20383031,"Effects of rolipram on U46619-induced contraction and cyclic nucleotide content in the porcine coronary artery.The effects of various selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on muscle contractility and cyclic nucleotide content in the porcine coronary artery were investigated. Various selective PDE inhibitors, vinpocetine (type 1), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA, type 2), milrinone (type 3), rolipram (type 4), Ro20-1724 (type 4), and zaprinast (type 5), inhibited U46619-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. The rank order of potency for the porcine coronary artery was rolipram &gt; Ro20-1724 &gt;milrinone &gt; vinpocetine &gt; zaprinast &gt; EHNA, which was different from that of both the porcine carotid artery and aorta. Rolipram inhibited the U46619-induced muscle tension with a decreased [<e>Ca</e>(2+)](i) level, but inhibited the high K(+)-induced contraction without a change in [Ca(2+)](i) level. Rolipram increased cAMP but not cGMP content. Iberiotoxin restored the inhibition of muscle tension and the [Ca(2+)](i) levels induced by rolipram. U46619 and caffeine induced a transient increase in the [Ca(2+)](i) levels in a Ca(2+)-free solution, but rolipram only inhibited the U46619-induced Ca(2+) transient. In conclusion, rolipram is the most potent inhibitor in the porcine coronary artery, but not in the carotid artery and aorta. Moreover it is suggested that the mechanism by which rolipram causes relaxation is due to a decrease in the [Ca(2+)](i) levels and of the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the contractile elements to cAMP.",M1
20382865,"Exotic behavior and crystal structures of calcium under pressure.Experimental studies established that calcium undergoes several counterintuitive transitions under pressure: fcc --&gt; bcc --&gt; simple cubic --&gt; <e>Ca</e>-IV --&gt; Ca-V, and becomes a good superconductor in the simple cubic and higher-pressure phases. Here, using ab initio evolutionary simulations, we explore the behavior of Ca under pressure and find a number of new phases. Our structural sequence differs from the traditional picture for Ca, but is similar to that for Sr. The beta-tin (I4(1)/amd) structure, rather than simple cubic, is predicted to be the theoretical ground state at 0 K and 33-71 GPa. This structure can be represented as a large distortion of the simple cubic structure, just as the higher-pressure phases stable between 71 and 134 GPa. The structure of Ca-V, stable above 134 GPa, is a complex host-guest structure. According to our calculations, the predicted phases are superconductors with Tc increasing under pressure and reaching approximately 20 K at 120 GPa, in good agreement with experiment.",M1
20382849,"Luminal <e>Ca</e>(2+) content regulates intracellular Ca(2+) release in subepicardial myocytes of intact beating mouse hearts: effect of exogenous buffers.Ca(+)-induced Ca(2+) release tightly controls the function of ventricular cardiac myocytes under normal and pathological conditions. Two major factors contributing to the regulation of Ca(2+) release are the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content. We hypothesized that the amount of Ca(2+) released from the SR during each heart beat strongly defines the refractoriness of Ca(2+) release. To test this hypothesis, EGTA AM, a high-affinity, slow-association rate Ca(2+) chelator, was used as a tool to modify luminal SR Ca(2+) content. An analysis of the cytosolic and luminal SR Ca(2+) dynamics recorded from the epicardial layer of intact mouse hearts indicated that the presence of EGTA reduced the diastolic SR free Ca(2+) concentration and fraction of SR Ca(2+) depletion during each beat. In addition, this maneuver shortened the refractory period and accelerated the restitution of Ca(2+) release. As a consequence of the accelerated restitution, the frequency dependence of Ca(2+) alternans was significantly shifted toward higher heart rates, suggesting a role of luminal SR Ca(2+) in the genesis of this highly arrhythmogenic phenomenon. Thus, intra-SR Ca(2+) dynamics set the refractoriness and frequency dependence of Ca(2+) transients in subepicardial ventricular myocytes.",M1
20382737,"Involvement of SLC17A9-dependent vesicular exocytosis in the mechanism of ATP release during T cell activation.Recent reports have shown that T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent ATP release from T cells is involved in production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) through activation of P2 receptors. Stimulation of TCR induces ATP release from T cells through gap junction hemichannels and maxianion channels, at least in part. However, the mechanisms of ATP release from activated T cells are not fully understood. Here, we studied the mechanisms of ATP release during TCR-dependent T cell activation by investigating the effects of various inhibitors on TCR-dependent ATP release from murine T cells. We found that not only anion channel and gap junction hemichannel inhibitors, but also exocytosis inhibitors suppressed the ATP release. These results suggest that ATP release from murine T cells is regulated by various mechanisms, including exocytosis. An inhibitor of exocytosis, bafilomycin A, significantly blocked TCR signaling, such as <e>Ca</e>(2+) elevation and IL-2 production. Furthermore, bafilomycin A, ectonucleotidase, and P2Y(6) receptor antagonist significantly inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from external antigen-restimulated splenocytes, indicating that vesicular exocytosis-mediated purinergic signaling has a significant role in TCR-dependent cytokine production. We also detected vesicular ATP in murine T cells and human T lymphoma Jurkat cells, both of which also expressed mRNA of SLC17A9, a vesicular nucleotide transporter. Knockdown of SLC17A9 in Jurkat cells markedly reduced ATP release and cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation after TCR stimulation, suggesting involvement of SLC17A9-dependent vesicular exocytosis in ATP release and T cell activation. In conclusion, vesicular exocytosis of ATP appears to play a role in T cell activation and immune responses.",M1

20199960,"Comparative effectiveness of two pharmacy-based colorectal cancer screening interventions during an annual influenza vaccination campaign.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of two different pharmacy-based colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) interventions taking place during an annual influenza vaccination campaign. DESIGN: Time-randomized clinical trial. SETTING: San Francisco, <e>CA</e>, in late 2008. PARTICIPANTS: 133 adults aged 50 to 80 years visiting a pharmacy during an influenza vaccination campaign and also due for CRCS. INTERVENTION: On five dates, eligible patients were provided education and encouraged to obtain screening from their primary care clinician. On 17 dates, a home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for CRCS was provided. A 16-item questionnaire was administered by phone 3 to 6 months after study enrollment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported CRCS activity, comparing CRCS completion rates for participants provided with the FIT versus those provided with education and encouragement to obtain screening from patients' primary care clinician. RESULTS: 86 participants in the FIT arm and 28 the CRCS education arm were interviewed. Interviews revealed that 19.8% of the FIT group and 50% of the CRCS education group discussed CRCS with their primary care clinician (P = 0.002). Of these participants, 59.3% in the FIT arm and 14.8% in the CRCS education arm reported completing screening (P &lt; 0.001). Of participants in the FIT group, 52.2% completed FIT dispensed to them by the investigators. Most participants in both groups reported interest in receiving CRCS education and home CRCS tests from pharmacists in the future. CONCLUSION: Pharmacy patients are receptive to CRCS interventions delivered in community pharmacies. Providing FIT to eligible patients during a pharmacy-based influenza vaccination campaign increases screening rates more than CRCS education alone.",M2
20138362,"Evaluation of methods to determine causes of sediment toxicity in San Diego Bay, California, USA.Regulation of waterbodies impaired due to sediment toxicity may require development of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) allocations to reduce chemicals of concern. A key step in this process is the identification of chemicals responsible for toxicity, and sediment toxicity identification evaluation procedures (TIEs) are the primary tools used to accomplish this. Several sites in San Diego Bay (<e>CA</e>, USA) are listed as impaired due to sediment toxicity associated with organic chemicals and metals, and due to degraded benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Sediment was collected from one of these sites, at the confluence of Switzer Creek in San Diego Harbor. The sediment was subjected to selected whole-sediment TIE treatments to evaluate the efficacy of these procedures for identifying the causes of toxicity at Switzer Creek. Toxicity was assessed using the estuarine amphipod Eohaustorius estuarius. The results indicated that toxicity of San Diego Bay sediment was likely partly due to mixtures of pyrethroid pesticides. These experiments showed that the effectiveness of the individual TIE procedures varied by treatment. Variability was mainly due to inconsistency between results of samples subjected to various Phase II TIE procedures, including chemical analyses of samples subjected to high-pressure liquid chromatography and direct analyses of acetone extractions of carbonaceous resin. The procedures require further refinement to ensure maximum sorption and complete elution and detection of sorbed chemicals. Despite these inconsistencies, the results indicate the utility of these procedures for identifying chemicals of concern in this system.",M2
20121235,"Real-Time detection and mixing state of methanesulfonate in single particles at an inland urban location during a phytoplankton bloom.Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), produced by oceanic phytoplankton, is oxidized to form methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate, which influence particle chemistry and hygroscopicity. Unlike sulfate, MSA has no known anthropogenic source making it a useful tracer for ocean-derived biogenic sulfur. Despite numerous observations of MSA, predominately in marine environments, the production pathways of MSA have remained elusive highlighting the need for additional measurements, particularly at inland locations. During the Study of Organic Aerosols in Riverside, <e>CA</e> from July-August 2005, MSA was detected in submicrometer and supermicrometer particles using real-time, single-particle mass spectrometry. MSA was detected due to blooms of DMS-producing organisms along the California coast. The detection of MSA depended on both the origin of the sampled air mass as well as the concentration of oceanic chlorophyll present. MSA was mainly mixed with coastally emitted particle types implying that partitioning of MSA occurred before transport to Riverside. Importantly, particles containing vanadium had elevated levels of MSA compared to particles not containing vanadium, suggesting a possible catalytic role of vanadium in MSA formation. This study demonstrates how anthropogenic, metal-containing aerosols can enhance the atmospheric processing of biogenic emissions, which needs to be considered when modeling coastal as well as urban locations.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study consists of 12,417 men aged 40 to 70 years (44% African American) who were referred for exercise testing at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, DC, or Palo Alto, <e>CA</e> (between January 1, 1983, and June 30, 2007). Fitness was quantified as metabolic equivalents achieved during a maximal exercise test and was categorized for analysis as low, moderate, and high (defined as &lt;5, 5-10, and &gt;10 metabolic equivalents, respectively). Adiposity was defined by body mass index (BMI) according to standard clinical guidelines. Separate and combined associations of fitness and adiposity with all-cause mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards analyses. RESULTS: We recorded 2801 deaths during a mean+/-SD follow-up of 7.7+/-5.3 years. Multivariate hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality, with normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) used as the reference group, were 1.9 (1.5-2.3), 0.7 (0.7-0.8), 0.7 (0.6-0.7), and 1.0 (0.8-1.1) for BMIs of less than 18.5, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and 35.0 or more kg/m2, respectively. Compared with highly fit normal-weight men, underweight men with low fitness had the highest (4.5 [3.1-6.6]) and highly fit overweight men the lowest (0.4 [0.3-0.6]) mortality risk of any subgroup. Overweight and obese men with moderate fitness had mortality rates similar to those of the highly fit normal-weight reference group. CONCLUSION: Fitness altered the obesity paradox. Overweight and obese men had increased longevity only if they registered high fitness.",M2
20117559,"Mobile food vending and the after-school food environment.BACKGROUND: Low-income and minority children have higher rates of obesity and overweight. Greater understanding of their food access is important. Because of higher rates of walking to school in these populations, these children likely have greater exposure to the food environment immediately around their schools. Mobile food vendors are an understudied aspect of the food environment in U.S. urban areas. PURPOSE: This study aims to observe the after-school food environment in an urban area where mobile vending is known to occur in order to study the range of vendors encountered near schools and the items sold in the after-school period. METHODS: In the spring of 2008, the presence of mobile food vendors after school within (1/4) mile of nine public schools was assessed in a predominantly Latino district of Oakland <e>CA</e>. At six schools with regular presence of vendors, observations were made at mobile vendors documenting characteristics of transactions, consumers, and items. RESULTS: During 37 observation-hours across 23 days, there were 1355 items sold to 1195 individuals. Fifty-six percent of the transactions involved children with no adults present. There was a wide range in foods sold, and although there were vendors selling low-nutrient, energy-dense foods, there were also vendors selling whole and processed (precut and bagged) fresh fruits and vegetables. Roughly 40% of these whole fruits and processed fruits and vegetables were consumed by children. On average, children each consumed $1.54 of foods per transaction. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile food vendors in urban areas contribute to after-school snacking among children, and should be considered as a component of the school food environment.",M2
20116824,"Influence of organic carbon loading, sediment associated metal oxide content and sediment grain size distributions upon Cryptosporidium parvum removal during riverbank filtration operations, Sonoma County, <e>CA</e>.This study assessed the efficacy for removing Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts of poorly sorted, Fe- and Al-rich, subsurface sediments collected from 0.9 to 4.9 and 1.7-13.9 m below land surface at an operating riverbank filtration (RBF) site (Russian River, Sonoma County, CA). Both formaldehyde-killed oocysts and oocyst-sized (3 microm) microspheres were employed in sediment-packed flow-through and static columns. The degree of surface coverage of metal oxides on sediment grain surfaces correlated strongly with the degrees of oocyst and microsphere removals. In contrast, average grain size (D(50)) was not a good indicator of either microsphere or oocyst removal, suggesting that the primary mechanism of immobilization within these sediments is sorptive filtration rather than physical straining. A low specific UV absorbance (SUVA) for organic matter isolated from the Russian River, suggested that the modest concentration of the SUVA component (0.8 mg L(-1)) of the 2.2 mg L(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is relatively unreactive. Nevertheless, an amendment of 2.2 mg L(-1) of isolated river DOC to column sediments resulted in up to a 35.7% decrease in sorption of oocysts and (or) oocyst-sized microspheres. Amendments (3.2 microM) of the anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) also caused substantive decreases (up to 31.9 times) in colloid filtration. Although the grain-surface metal oxides were found to have a high colloid-removal capacity, our study suggested that any major changes within the watershed that would result in long-term alterations in either the quantity and (or) the character of the river's DOC could alter the effectiveness of pathogen removal during RBF operations.",M2
20082344,"Impact of analysis interval on the multiple exhalation flow technique to partition exhaled nitric oxide.Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is elevated in asthmatics and is a purported marker of airway inflammation. By measuring eNO at multiple flows and applying models of eNO exchange dynamics, the signal can be partitioned into its proximal airway [J' aw NO (nl/sec)] and distal airway/alveolar contributions [<e>CA</e>(NO)(ppb)]. Several studies have demonstrated the potential significance of such an approach in children with asthma. However, techniques to partition eNO are variable, limiting comparisons among studies. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of the analysis interval (time or volume) on eNO plateau concentrations and the estimation of J' aw NO and CA(NO). In 30 children with mild to moderate asthma, spirometry and eNO at multiple flows (50, 100, and 200 ml/sec) were measured. The plateau concentration of eNO at each flow was determined using two different methods of analysis: (1) constant time interval and (2) constant volume interval. For both methods of analysis, a two-compartment model with axial diffusion was used to characterize J' aw NO and CA(NO). At a flow of 200 ml/sec, the time interval analysis predicts values for eNO that are smaller than the volume interval analysis. As a result, there are significant differences in CA(NO) between the methods of analysis (volume &gt; time). When using the multiple flow technique to partition eNO, the method of analysis (constant time vs. constant volume interval) significantly affects the estimation of CA(NO), and thus potentially the assessment and interpretation of distal lung inflammation.",M2
20082343,"An elevated bronchodilator response predicts large airway inflammation in mild asthma.Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is elevated in asthmatics and is a purported marker of airway inflammation. The bronchodilator response (BDR) has also been shown to correlate with markers of airway inflammation, including eNO at 50 ml/sec (FE(NO,50)) which is comprised of NO from both the proximal and distal airways. Using eNO at multiple flows and a two-compartment model of NO exchange, the eNO signal can be partitioned into its proximal [J'aw(NO) (nl/sec)] and distal contributions [<e>CA</e>(NO) (ppb)]. We hypothesized that the BDR reflects the inflammatory status of the larger airways with smooth muscle, and thus would correlate with J'aw(NO). In 179 predominantly (95%) Hispanic children with mild asthma (69 steroid naïve), and 21 non-asthmatic non-atopic controls, spirometry and eNO at multiple flows were measured prior and 10 min following inhalation of albuterol. A trumpet-shaped axial diffusion model of NO exchange was used to characterize J'aw(NO) and CA(NO). The BDR correlated moderately (r = 0.44) with proximal airway NO (J'aw(NO)), but weakly (r = 0.26) with distal airway/alveolar NO (CA(NO)), and only in inhaled corticosteroid naïve asthmatics. A BDR cut point as low as &gt;or=8% had a positive predictive value of 83% for predicting an elevated J'aw(NO) or FE(NO,50). We conclude that the BDR reflects inflammation in the large airways, and may be an effective clinical tool to predict elevated large airway inflammation.",M2
20053937,"Vitamin D intake needed to maintain target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in participants with low sun exposure and dark skin pigmentation is substantially higher than current recommendations.Cutaneous cholecalciferol synthesis has not been considered in making recommendations for vitamin D intake. Our objective was to model the effects of sun exposure, vitamin D intake, and skin reflectance (pigmentation) on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in young adults with a wide range of skin reflectance and sun exposure. Four cohorts of participants (n = 72 total) were studied for 7-8 wk in the fall, winter, spring, and summer in Davis, <e>CA</e> [38.5 degrees N, 121.7 degrees W, Elev. 49 ft (15 m)]. Skin reflectance was measured using a spectrophotometer, vitamin D intake using food records, and sun exposure using polysulfone dosimeter badges. A multiple regression model (R(2) = 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001) was developed and used to predict the serum 25(OH)D concentration for participants with low [median for African ancestry (AA)] and high [median for European ancestry (EA)] skin reflectance and with low [20th percentile, approximately 20 min/d, approximately 18% body surface area (BSA) exposed] and high (80th percentile, approximately 90 min/d, approximately 35% BSA exposed) sun exposure, assuming an intake of 200 iu/d (5 ug/d). Predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations for AA individuals with low and high sun exposure in the winter were 24 and 42 nmol/L and in the summer were 40 and 60 nmol/L. Corresponding values for EA individuals were 35 and 60 nmol/L in the winter and in the summer were 58 and 85 nmol/L. To achieve 25(OH)D &gt; or =75 nmol/L, we estimate that EA individuals with high sun exposure need 1300 iu/d vitamin D intake in the winter and AA individuals with low sun exposure need 2100-3100 iu/d year-round.",M2

20021501,"Phenotypic characteristics of novel swine-origin influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus.BACKGROUND: The 2009 novel A(H1N1) virus appears to be of swine origin. This strain causing the current outbreaks is a new virus that has not been seen previously either in humans or animals. We have previously reported that viruses causing pandemics or large outbreaks were able to grow at a temperature above the normal physiological range (temperature resistance, non-ts phenotype), were found to be inhibitor resistant and restricted in replication at suboptimal temperature (sensitivity to grow at low temperature, non-<e>ca</e> phenotype). In this study, we performed phenotypic analysis of novel A(H1N1) virus to evaluate its pandemic potential and its suitability for use in developing a live attenuated influenza vaccine. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to identify phenotypic properties of novel A(H1N1) influenza virus. METHODS: A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) swine-origin influenza virus was studied in comparison with some influenza A viruses isolated in different years with respect to their ability to grow at non-permissive temperatures. We also analyzed its sensitivity to gamma-inhibitors of animal sera and its ability to agglutinate chicken, human and guinea pig erythrocytes. RESULTS: Swine-origin A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus was found to be non-ts and inhibitor resistant and was not able to grow at 25 degrees C (non-ca). We did not find any difference in the ability of the hemagglutinin of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus to bind to erythrocytes of different origin. CONCLUSION: The novel swine-origin A(H1N1) virus displays a phenotype typical of the past pandemic and epidemic viruses. This finding suggests that this virus might be a good wild type parental prototype for live vaccine for potential use for controlling pandemic influenza.",M2
19996978,"Efficacy of brief interventions in clinical care settings for persons living with HIV.Prevention of HIV transmission from patients living with HIV (PLH) is a high national priority and strategies that are easy to implement and sustain to eliminate sexual transmission acts among PLH are needed. We evaluated a brief intervention that focused primarily on the enhancing motivations and encouraging PLH to act in accordance with their values without providing the intensity of the existing evidence-based programs for PLH. Using a quasiexperimental design, six medical clinics in Los Angeles County, <e>CA</e>, were evaluated across three intervention conditions: 1) computerized delivery; 2) provider delivery; or 3) standard care. We examined longitudinal changes in patients' reports of the number of HIV-negative (HIV-) or serostatus-unknown sexual partners and the number of unprotected vaginal and anal sex acts. Among 566 PLH, PLH in the computerized delivery condition reported a significant decrease in the number of HIV-/unknown sexual partners compared with the provider delivery and standard care conditions and a significant decrease in the number of unprotected sex acts in comparison to the standard care condition. Computerized motivational interventions delivered in waiting rooms at medical clinics may be an efficient strategy to reduce unprotected sex acts among PLH.",M2

19944943,"Partnership moves community toward complete streets.BACKGROUND: The Partnership for Active Communities brought together multidisciplinary organizations to create a 5-year project to support increased walking and bicycling in the Sacramento <e>CA</e> area. INTERVENTION: Using a community action model, the partnership focused on programs and promotions to expand walk- and bike-to-school programs. The partnership focused on policy and physical projects in conducting systematic reviews of development projects to influence land use. A comprehensive communications plan united diverse partnership interests to advocate for Complete Streets policy change and improve transportation infrastructure. RESULTS: Walk- and bike-to-school programs grew, and community-design workshops helped leverage more than $12 million in additional support, including Safe Routes to School grants. The partnership delivered more than 150 project reviews to city planners, architects, and developers with recommendations for improved pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and many positive changes resulted. Complete Streets is now included as a policy in the region's transportation plan, in the mobility element of the city's updated general plan and the county's draft circulation plan, and in the regional transit master plan. LESSONS LEARNED: The partnership's communications plan linked partners with diverse interests to produce a powerful advocacy network to influence adoption of Complete Streets policies. Project development reviews were most successful in communities that allowed comments at a conceptual stage in the process. CONCLUSIONS: The Partnership for Active Communities produced increased public and agency awareness of pedestrian and bicycle safety issues and influenced considerable changes to policies and the physical environment in the Sacramento area.",M2

19910276,"Lung cancer incidence trends by histologic type in areas of California vs. other areas in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program.BACKGROUND: This study compared temporal trends in incidence rates for the major histological types of lung cancer in areas of California (<e>CA</e>), which started a comprehensive state tobacco control program in 1989, and other selected geographic areas for which data on long-term trends were available. METHODS: Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) within age 25-64 years, most likely to have been affected by tobacco control programs, were compared for lung-bronchus adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma in 1992-2005 for non-Hispanic whites in three areas of CA in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program vs. 10 non-CA SEER areas. For 1985-2005, data were available for all whites in the San Francisco-Oakland CA SEER area and eight non-CA SEER areas. RESULTS: ASIRs were roughly similar in CA and non-CA areas in 1992, but declines from 1992 to 2005 were larger in CA than non-CA areas for each histological type. In San Francisco-Oakland CA, declines were not clearly evident from 1985 to 1988 (before the tobacco control program started) but from 1992 to 2005 declines were larger than in the non-CA areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support for expansion of statewide tobacco control programs, in order to reduce incidence rates for all histologic types of lung cancer.",M2
19783741,"Population structure of the lyme borreliosis spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in Northern California.Factors potentially contributing to the lower incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in the far-western than in the northeastern United States include tick host-seeking behavior resulting in fewer human tick encounters, lower densities of Borrelia burgdorferi-infected vector ticks in peridomestic environments, and genetic variation among B. burgdorferi spirochetes to which humans are exposed. We determined the population structure of B. burgdorferi in over 200 infected nymphs of the primary bridging vector to humans, Ixodes pacificus, collected in Mendocino County, <e>CA</e>. This was accomplished by sequence typing the spirochete lipoprotein ospC and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS). Thirteen ospC alleles belonging to 12 genotypes were found in California, and the two most abundant, ospC genotypes H3 and E3, have not been detected in ticks in the Northeast. The most prevalent ospC and IGS biallelic profile in the population, found in about 22% of ticks, was a new B. burgdorferi strain defined by ospC genotype H3. Eight of the most common ospC genotypes in the northeastern United States, including genotypes I and K that are associated with disseminated human infections, were absent in Mendocino County nymphs. ospC H3 was associated with hardwood-dominated habitats where western gray squirrels, the reservoir host, are commonly infected with LB spirochetes. The differences in B. burgdorferi population structure in California ticks compared to the Northeast emphasize the need for a greater understanding of the genetic diversity of spirochetes infecting California LB patients.",M2
19769055,"Stone Lakes virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), a variant of Fort Morgan virus isolated from swallow bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) west of the Continental Divide.Multiple isolates of an alphaviruses within the western equine encephalomyelitis-serocomplex that were related closely to Ft. Morgan and its variant Buggy Creek virus were made from swallow bugs, Oeciacus vicarius Horvath (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), collected from cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) nests at the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, Sacramento County, <e>CA</e>, during the summers of 2005 and 2006. This virus (hereafter Stone Lakes virus, family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, STLV) was the first record of this viral group west of the Continental Divide. STLV replicated well in Vero and other vertebrate cell cultures but failed to replicate in C6/36 cells or infect Culex tarsalis Coquillett mosquitoes. STLV failed to produce elevated viremias in adult chickens or house sparrows and was weakly immunogenic. In addition, STLV was not isolated from cliff swallow nestlings nor was antibody detected in adults collected at mist nets. We suggest that STL and related swallow bug viruses may be primarily infections of cimicids that are maintained and amplified either by vertical or nonviremic transmission and that cliff swallows may primarily be important as a bloodmeal source for the bugs rather than as an amplification host for the viruses.",M2
19741362,"Residential magnetic fields and measures of neutral-to-earth voltage: variability within and between residences.The objectives of this study were to characterize temporal patterns of magnetic fields (Bavg) and two measures of neutral-to-earth voltage: the voltage between the water line and earth (VW-E), and the voltage between bathtub plumbing fixtures and the drain (Vbath). The latter is a source of exposure to contact current in bathing children that has been proposed to explain the reported association between power-frequency magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. These quantities were measured each minute in a sample of 15 single-detached residences in San Jose, <e>CA</e>. Generally, Bavg, VW-E, and Vbath were positively correlated with each other within residences, and displayed similar diurnal patterns. Weekday and weekend patterns displayed qualitative differences that reflect the more scheduled workday for weekdays, and a less structured pattern for weekends. When pooled with two prior measurement studies, positive associations across residences between Bavg and both VW-E and Vbath were observed. Home designs over the past 30-40 years have lead to a decreasing prevalence of Vbath as conductive drains have been swapped out for non-conductive materials. Nonetheless, the observed relationships within and across residences indicate that contact current has the characteristics of a factor that could explain the association of magnetic fields with childhood leukemia.",M2

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data set and condensed version of the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH). SETTING: Data collected from 34 randomly selected high schools in San Bernardino, <e>CA</e>. PARTICIPANTS: 265 Latino high school adolescents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effects of acculturation and gender on variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior on intention to eat a healthful diet. ANALYSIS: Multiple regression analysis examined acculturation/gender differences, and modifications on the prediction of intention. General linear modeling determined differences across gender and acculturation groups. RESULTS: Females had stronger intention, more positive attitude, and greater subjective normative influence. Females indicated feeling healthy and looking good and males indicated good athletic performance as contributors to eating healthfully. Mother was influential for both genders, and stronger for females. Siblings were influential for less acculturated males, and friends were influential for highly acculturated females. Less acculturated adolescents had stronger intention to eat healthfully, more tolerance to give up liked food items, and more support and encouragement.

19671569,"The neighborhood alcohol environment and alcohol-related morbidity.AIMS: The aims of this study were (1) to examine the association between neighborhood alcohol outlet density and individual self-reported alcohol-related health outcomes in the last year-sexually transmitted infections (STI), motor vehicle accidents, injury, liver problems, hypertension and experienced violence; (2) to determine whether the relationship between morbidity and alcohol outlet density is mediated by individual alcohol consumption; and (3) to explore the role of alcohol outlet density in explaining any observed racial and ethnic differences in morbidity. METHOD: Hierarchical models from a random sample of Los Angeles, <e>CA</e>, and Louisiana residents (N = 2881) from 217 census tracts were utilized. The clustering of health and social outcomes according to neighborhood varied by health problem examined. RESULTS: There was substantial clustering of STI (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 12.8%) and experienced violence (ICC = 13.0%); moderate clustering of liver problems (ICC = 3.5%) and hypertension (ICC = 3.9%); and low clustering of motor vehicle accident (ICC = 1.2%) and injury (ICC = 1.4%). Alcohol outlet density was significantly and positively associated with STI (crude OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.10-3.00), liver problems (crude OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.75) and experienced violence (crude OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.13-1.51) although not with other morbidity outcomes. Mediation analyses of morbidity outcomes revealed partial mediation of individual alcohol consumption in the relationship between alcohol density and STI and violence, and full mediation for liver problems. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the concept that off-premise alcohol outlets in the neighborhood environment may impact health and social outcomes, either directly or indirectly, through individual alcohol consumption and these associations may be heterogeneous with respect to race and ethnicity.",M2

19544852,"Weathering and the fallout plume of heavy oil from strong petroleum seeps near Coal Oil Point, <e>CA</e>.The Coal Oil Point (COP) seeps offshore Goleta, CA, are estimated to release 20-25 tons of oil daily, providing an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the fate of oil in the coastal ocean. To address the long-term fate of COP oil, we collected 15 sediment samples down current from the seeps and quantified petroleum content and individual biomarkers using traditional and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. Similarities in the distributions of hopane biomarkers link the oil in the sediments to fresh seep oil (n=5) and underlying reservoirs (n=3), although sediment oil is heavily weathered. The spatial distribution of oil forms a plume along the continental shelf that we suggest represents a chronic fallout pattern for heavy oil from the persistent surface slicks; average surface currents appear to modulate the distribution of the fallout over a period of 0.4-5 days. The extent of hydrocarbon loss is consistent for all sediments, indicating a common limit to oil weathering with contributions from evaporation, biodegradation, and dissolution. Considering the amount of oil and quantity of sediment impacted, we estimate a sediment oil burden of 0.3 x 10(12) to 3 x 10(12) g in the study area, equivalent to 8-80 spills of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989.",M2

19530952,"Recurrent community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections among HIV-infected persons: incidence and risk factors.Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (<e>CA</e>-MRSA) infections are well described among the general population, but little is known regarding the incidence of and predictors for recurrent CA-MRSA infections among HIV-infected persons. We retrospectively evaluated HIV-infected patients seen at the Naval Medical Center San Diego from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2007 for wound culture-proven MRSA infections defined as community-associated based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Data on skin/soft tissue infections (SSTIs) following an initial CA-MRSA infection were collected by review of medical records and culture results. Patients with or without recurrent infections were compared for predictors of recurrence using multivariate logistic regression models. Thirty-one (6.8%) of 458 patients with HIV had wound culture-proven CA-MRSA SSTIs for an incidence rate of 12.3 infections per 1000 person-years. Those who developed a MRSA infection had a mean age of 40 years, 97% were male, 58% were Caucasian, 23% were Hispanic, 16% were African American, and 3% were other; demographics were similar to the overall study population. Fourteen (41%) HIV patients with an initial MRSA infection had recurrent SSTIs; of these, seven (21%) had culture-confirmed recurrent CA-MRSA. The median time between infection recurrences was 4 months (range, 1-20 months). Suppressed HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 1000 copies per milliliter (odds ratio [OR] 0.14, p = 0.03) was associated with a lower rate of SSTI recurrence. In summary, HIV-infected persons have a high incidence of CA-MRSA skin/soft tissue infections and a high rate of recurrence. HIV control may be associated with a reduced risk of recurrent skin/soft tissue infections.",M2
19516904,"First reported case of Cryptococcus gattii in the Southeastern USA: implications for travel-associated acquisition of an emerging pathogen.In 2007, the first confirmed case of Cryptococcus gattii was reported in the state of North Carolina, USA. An otherwise healthy HIV negative male patient presented with a large upper thigh cryptococcoma in February, which was surgically removed and the patient was started on long-term high-dose fluconazole treatment. In May of 2007, the patient presented to the Duke University hospital emergency room with seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed two large CNS lesions found to be cryptococcomas based on brain biopsy. Prior chest CT imaging had revealed small lung nodules indicating that C. gattii spores or desiccated yeast were likely inhaled into the lungs and dissemination occurred to both the leg and CNS. The patient's travel history included a visit throughout the San Francisco, <e>CA</e> region in September through October of 2006, consistent with acquisition during this time period. Cultures from both the leg and brain biopsies were subjected to analysis. Based on phenotypic and molecular methods, both isolates were C. gattii, VGI molecular type, and distinct from the Vancouver Island outbreak isolates. Based on multilocus sequence typing of coding and noncoding regions and virulence in a heterologous host model, the leg and brain isolates are identical, but the two differed in mating fertility. Two clinical isolates, one from a transplant recipient in San Francisco and the other from Australia, were identical to the North Carolina clinical isolate at all markers tested. Closely related isolates that differ at only one or a few noncoding markers are present in the Australian environment. Taken together, these findings support a model in which C. gattii VGI was transferred from Australia to California, possibly though an association with its common host plant E. camaldulensis, and the patient was exposed in San Francisco and returned to present with disease in North Carolina.",M2
19475930,"Vertical stability of mercury in historic and prehistoric sediments from Clear Lake, California.Clear Lake, California, USA, is the site of the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine, now a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund Site. Intermittent mining from 1873 to 1957 resulted in approximately 100 Mg of mercury (Hg) being deposited into the lake's ecosystem. Sediment cores to approximately 2.5 m depth (dated using 210Pb and 14C) represent approximately 3000 years of sedimentation. Clear Lake sediments have experienced Hg deposition from anthropogenic sources (mining) during historic times (to the mid-1900s) and geologic sources during prehistoric times (prior to the mid-1800s). This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate hypotheses relating to (1) the influence of the mine on Hg loading to the lake and (2) the potential upward mobilization of Hg by diagenetic processes proposed by some as an alternative explanation for increased Hg concentrations at the surface of the sediment column believed to be caused by increased global atmospheric deposition. Although Hg mining began in 1873, no significant evidence of anthropogenic Hg loading was detected in cores prior to open-pit mining <e>ca</e>. 1927, which also involved bulldozing mine waste rock and tailings into the lake. Exponential increases in total Hg (TotHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were observed above the 1927 horizon, where estimated sedimentation rates were 2.2-20.4 mm/yr and peaks of both forms of Hg maintained vertical stability within the sediment column. Below the 1927 horizon, a slow increase in both TotHg and MeHg with depth was observed from approximately 1000 to 3000 years before present, where sedimentation rates ranged from approximately 0.6 to 2.0 mm/yr and elevated Hg profiles appear stable. Vertical stability of Hg in the shallow and deep sediment column suggests that both TotHg and MeHg do not undergo diagenetic upward mobilization within the sediment column under rapid or slow sedimentation rates. Because (1) these data were collected at a site with known anthropogenic and geologic sources and (2) regions of elevated Hg concentrations from both sources remain stable within the sediment column under very different sedimentation regimes, these results also support the hypothesis that elevated Hg at the surface of cores in other worldwide locations likely represents global atmospheric deposition rather than upward diagenetic mobilization.",M2
19475929,"Anthropogenic stressors and changes in the Clear Lake ecosystem as recorded in sediment cores.Sediment cores were collected to investigate multiple stresses on Clear Lake, California, USA, through the period of European occupation to the present day. Earlier workers suggested the hypothesis that the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, starting in the 1920s and 1930s, was responsible for erosion, mercury (Hg) contamination, and habitat loss stresses. Cores (approximately 2.5 m in depth) were collected in 1996 and 2000 from each of the three arms of the lake. Carbon-14 dating suggests that these cores represent as much as 3000 years of the lake's history, beginning long before European settlement. Total mercury (TotHg) and methylmercury (MeHg), dry matter, water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and the stable isotopes 13C and 15N were measured at 5-cm intervals. Nearly all parameters show major changes at depths of 58-135 cm, beginning at <e>ca</e>. 1927 (dated with 210Pb). Accepting this date for concomitant major changes in seven cores yields an estimated 8.6 mm/yr average sedimentation rate after 1927. Pre-1927 sedimentation rates were approximately 1 mm/yr. Total mercury and MeHg, dry matter, phosphorus, and 15N increase significantly, whereas nitrogen, sulfur, carbon, and water content decrease significantly above the 1927 horizon. Both TotHg and MeHg show extremely large increases (roughly 10-fold) above the 1927 horizon. A peak in inorganic deposition rate and minimum values for percentage of water is present at depths corresponding to ca. 1970. Interestingly, the first 75 years of European settlement in the Clear Lake basin (including the most productive years of the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine) appeared to have had undetectable effects on lake cores. Changes since 1927 were dramatic. The large increase in Hg beginning about 1927 corresponds to the use of heavy equipment to exploit the ore deposit at the mine using open-pit methods. Increases in sediment deposition from increased earthmoving in the basin and sulfate loading from the mine are the most likely explanations for the dramatic changes seen in the post-1927 sections of the cores.",M2
19439339,"Accuracy and precision of the volume-concentration method for urban stormwater modeling.Land use based models have been widely used to estimate stormwater pollutant loads for establishing standards and selecting best management practices. Land use information is required to assign imperviousness or runoff coefficients and event mean concentrations for selected pollutants to the areas of the watersheds. This approach is useful to estimate the total mass discharges, but is dependent on various assumptions for parameters, which have rarely been validated with full-scale field data. This paper compares the assumptions, methodologies and predictions of six independent modeling efforts using literature and local data, and shows the variability of the different approaches and methodologies for the Upper Ballona Creek Watershed in Los Angeles <e>CA</e>. Differences in land use definitions among the six studies produced up to 14 % differences in average load predictions for TSS. Differences in runoff coefficient and EMC assumptions produced -70 to 124% differences in average TSS load. The combined effects of all assumptions produced differences in the estimated TSS mass loads by -68 to 118%. The most inaccurate estimates were based on the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program data, which were far too high. These results underscore the need for additional data collection and model validation, and provide error bounds for the use of this modeling approach for regulation and best management practice selection.",M2
19429552,"Community genomic and proteomic analyses of chemoautotrophic iron-oxidizing  Leptospirillum rubarum  (Group II) and  Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum  (Group III) bacteria in acid mine drainage biofilms.We analyzed near-complete population (composite) genomic sequences for coexisting acidophilic iron-oxidizing Leptospirillum group II and III bacteria (phylum Nitrospirae) and an extrachromosomal plasmid from a Richmond Mine, Iron Mountain, <e>CA</e>, acid mine drainage biofilm. Community proteomic analysis of the genomically characterized sample and two other biofilms identified 64.6% and 44.9% of the predicted proteins of Leptospirillum groups II and III, respectively, and 20% of the predicted plasmid proteins. The bacteria share 92% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity and &gt;60% of their genes, including integrated plasmid-like regions. The extrachromosomal plasmid carries conjugation genes with detectable sequence similarity to genes in the integrated conjugative plasmid, but only those on the extrachromosomal element were identified by proteomics. Both bacterial groups have genes for community-essential functions, including carbon fixation and biosynthesis of vitamins, fatty acids, and biopolymers (including cellulose); proteomic analyses reveal these activities. Both Leptospirillum types have multiple pathways for osmotic protection. Although both are motile, signal transduction and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins are more abundant in Leptospirillum group III, consistent with its distribution in gradients within biofilms. Interestingly, Leptospirillum group II uses a methyl-dependent and Leptospirillum group III a methyl-independent response pathway. Although only Leptospirillum group III can fix nitrogen, these proteins were not identified by proteomics. The abundances of core proteins are similar in all communities, but the abundance levels of unique and shared proteins of unknown function vary. Some proteins unique to one organism were highly expressed and may be key to the functional and ecological differentiation of Leptospirillum groups II and III.",M2
19409575,"Changes in sediment and organic carbon accumulation in a highly-disturbed ecosystem: the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (California, USA).We used the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta <e>CA</e> (Delta, hereafter) as a model system for understanding how human activities influence the delivery of sediment and total organic carbon (TOC) over the past 50-60 years. Sediment cores were collected from sites within the Delta representing the Sacramento River (SAC), the San Joaquin River (SJR), and Franks Tract (FT), a flooded agricultural tract. A variety of anthropogenic tracers including (137)Cs, total DDE (Sigma DDE) and brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) congeners were used to quantify sediment accumulation rates. This information was combined with total organic carbon (TOC) profiles to quantify rates of TOC accumulation. Across the three sites, sediment and TOC accumulation rates were four to eight-fold higher prior to 1972. Changes in sediment and TOC accumulation were coincident with completion of several large reservoirs and increased agriculture and urbanization in the Delta watershed. Radiocarbon content of TOC indicated that much of the carbon delivered to the Delta is  pre-aged  reflecting processing in the Delta watershed or during transport to the sites rather than an input of predominantly contemporary carbon (e.g., 900-1400 years BP in surface sediments and 2200 yrs BP and 3610 yrs BP at the base of the SJR and FT cores, respectively). Together, these data suggest that human activities have altered the amount and age of TOC accumulating in the Delta since the 1940s.",M2
19398255,"Mercury bioaccumulation and risk to three waterbird foraging guilds is influenced by foraging ecology and breeding stage.We evaluated mercury (Hg) in five waterbird species representing three foraging guilds in San Francisco Bay, <e>CA</e>. Fish-eating birds (Forster's and Caspian terns) had the highest Hg concentrations in their tissues, but concentrations in an invertebrate-foraging shorebird (black-necked stilt) were also elevated. Foraging habitat was important for Hg exposure as illustrated by within-guild differences, where species more associated with marshes and salt ponds had higher concentrations than those more associated with open-bay and tidal mudflats. Importantly, Hg concentrations increased with time spent in the estuary. Surf scoter concentrations tripled over six months, whereas Forster's terns showed an up to 5-fold increase between estuary arrival and breeding. Breeding waterbirds were at elevated risk of Hg-induced reproductive impairment, particularly Forster's terns, in which 48% of breeding birds were at high risk due to their Hg levels. Our results highlight the importance of habitat and exposure timing, in addition to trophic position, on waterbird Hg bioaccumulation and risk.",M2
19393810,"Alert eyes and DWIs: an indirect evaluation of a DWI witness reward program in Stockton, <e>CA</e>.We evaluate a  grassroots  anonymous reward program targeting drunken driving in Stockton, CA. The time-series cross-sectional data covers 19 years for Stockton and six other California cities. Exploiting interrupted time-series regression, Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework, and bootstrapped standard errors, we test for an impact of this program on alcohol-related injury or fatality accidents, the proportion of all accidents involving alcohol, and the number of DWI arrests. In its first decade, the citizen reward program appears to have averted some 275 alcohol-related accidents for social cost savings of between $21,000 and $5.6 million. Further, possibly 4495 arrests were precluded, saving some $1-3 million in arrest-related costs. Incentivized public monitoring of driving-after-drinking may be an effective drunken driving abatement program though our exploratory findings need further confirmation.",M2
19373506,"Small mammals collected from a site with elevated selenium concentrations and three reference sites.Small mammals were trapped in July, August, and September 1999 at Kesterson Reservoir (Merced County, <e>CA</e>), a site with elevated concentrations of selenium (Se), and at three nearby reference sites. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were the most frequently trapped species at all of the sites, and western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and house mice (Mus musculus) were also trapped frequently. About half the animals collected from the reference sites were in reproductive condition, compared to less than a quarter of the animals from Kesterson. A lower proportion of the deer mice trapped at Kesterson was male, compared to about half at the reference sites. Deer mice from Kesterson also tended to have a lower condition index (body weight/body length) than those from the reference sites. Mice from Kesterson had enlarged livers, based on a higher liver-to-body-weight ratio (% liver). Male mice from Kesterson tended to have a smaller anogenital distance than male mice from reference sites, suggesting some feminization of Kesterson mice. Mice from Kesterson had higher liver Se concentrations than mice from reference sites, and some mice from reference sites had surprisingly low liver Se concentrations. It is possible that the effects observed were caused by physical stressors at Kesterson such as lower water and food availability but it also suggests that long-term exposure to elevated levels of Se may be, in part, the cause of some of the differences observed in small mammals from Kesterson.",M2
19360028,"Temporal variation of Synechococcus clades at a coastal Pacific Ocean monitoring site.Marine cyanobacteria from the genus Synechococcus are found throughout the world's oceans and are important contributors to global primary productivity and carbon cycling. Cultured isolates and environmental DNA clone libraries of Synechococcus have demonstrated the diversity of these microbes. However, the natural distribution of this diversity through space and time and the ecological significance of their distribution are still poorly understood. To understand the seasonal dynamics of Synechococcus diversity, we have developed a quantitative PCR strategy using the gene encoding as a subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rpoC1) and applied it to a 3-year time series of surface samples from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier (La Jolla, <e>CA</e>, USA), a coastal site in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Synechococcus from clades I and IV were dominant throughout the time series and correlated with total Synechococcus abundance. The relative abundance of these two dominant clades showed evidence of a seasonal cycle. Synechococcus from clade IV were typically more abundant, but those from clade I dominated during periods just before the annual spring bloom of Synechococcus. Synechococcus from clades II and III were absent during spring and early summer, but appeared at low abundances in late summer and winter possibly due to changes in circulation in the Southern California Bight. As the first long-term time series describing Synechococcus population diversity, these temporal dynamics were used to interpret the genetic/genomic diversity observed in the environment and the potential factors regulating their distribution.",M2

19333126,"Leisure-time physical activity and all-cause mortality in an elderly cohort.BACKGROUND: Physical activity is one of the mainstays of secondary prevention in people with heart disease. It is not well understood, however, how the presence of heart disease or a history of habitual exercise prior to the study modify any mortality-sparing effects of leisure-time physical activity. METHODS: We analyzed data from a well-described cohort of subjects aged 54 years and older at intake (median age, 70 years) from Sonoma, <e>CA</e>, studied between 1993 and 2001 with mortality follow-up until 2003. A history-adjusted marginal structural model was used to obtain counterfactual excess risk estimates that were pooled across the different time points. Additive interaction was examined by comparing these excess risk estimates across strata of age, heart disease, and precohort physical activity. RESULTS: Estimates of the excess risk for 2-year all-cause mortality comparing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended levels of current physical activity to lower levels of activity ranged from -0.7% to -4.9% among subjects younger than 75 years of age and from -7.8% to -14.8% among older subjects. Heart disease or precohort physical activity were not found to modify the effect of leisure-time physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with the view that the mortality-sparing effect of recent physical activity is independent of the presence or absence of underlying cardiac disease and the pattern of past physical activity.",M2

19268564,"Evaluation of an overdose prevention and response training programme for injection drug users in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles, <e>CA</e>.BACKGROUND: Fatal opioid overdose is a significant cause of mortality among injection drug users (IDUs). METHODS: We evaluated an overdose prevention and response training programme for IDUs run by a community-based organisation in Los Angeles, CA. During a 1-h training session participants learned skills to prevent, recognise, and respond to opioid overdoses, including: calling for emergency services, performing rescue breathing, and administering an intramuscular injection of naloxone (an opioid antagonist). Between September 2006 and January 2008, 93 IDUs were trained. Of those, 66 (71%) enrolled in the evaluation study and 47 participants (71%) completed an interview at baseline and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of participants were female, 42% were white, 29% African American, and 18% Latino. Most were homeless or lived in temporary accommodation (73%). We found significant increases in knowledge about overdose, in particular about the use of naloxone. Twenty-two participants responded to 35 overdoses during the follow-up period. Twenty-six overdose victims recovered, four died, and the outcome of five cases was unknown. Response techniques included: staying with the victim (85%), administering naloxone (80%), providing rescue breathing (66%), and calling emergency services (60%). The average number of appropriate response techniques used by participants increased significantly from baseline to follow-up (p&lt;0.05). Half (53%) of programme participants reported decreased drug use at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Overdose prevention and response training programmes may be associated with improved overdose response behaviour, with few adverse consequences and some unforeseen benefits, such as reductions in personal drug use.",M2

19238954,"Storm drains are sources of human fecal pollution during dry weather in three urban southern California watersheds.Coastal urbanized areas in Southern California experience frequent beach water quality warnings in summer due to high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Remediation can be difficult, as sources are often unknown. During two summers, we sampled three urbanized watersheds in Santa Barbara, <e>CA</e> at sites with historically high FIB concentrations to determine if human fecal matter was influencing water quality. By quantification of a human-specific Bacteroides marker (HBM), human waste was evidenced throughout both transects, and concentrations were highest in the discharges of several flowing storm drains. The HBM concentrations in storm drain discharges varied by up to 5 orders of magnitude on the same day. While the exact points of entry into the storm drain systems were not definitively determined, further inspection of the drain infrastructure suggested exfiltrating sanitary sewers as possible sources. The HBM and FIB concentrations were not consistently correlated, although the exclusive occurrence of high HBM concentrations with high FIB concentrations warrants the use of FIB analyses for a first tier of sampling. The association of human fecal pollution with dry weather drainage could be a window into a larger problem for other urbanized coastal areas with Mediterranean-type climates.",M2

METHODS: We conducted 2 waves of interviews with 34 organization staff members. We analyzed activities reported by staff in the phases (preimplementation, implementation, and maintenance and evolution) and activities defined by the technology transfer model for evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. RESULTS: Staff members were able to select, adapt, and implement evidence-based HIV prevention interventions despite challenges in each phase of technology transfer. Preimplementation challenges included lack of information and poor fit between the interventions and organizations' clients. Implementation challenges included retention of participants across intervention sessions and staff turnover. A challenge in the maintenance and evolution phase was enhancing staff skills in outcome monitoring and cost analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Technical assistance must be matched to the specific challenges found in each phase of technology transfer. Successful transfer of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions will depend on their continued uptake and use by organization staff. This study highlights directions for improving communications regarding appropriate modifications to these interventions and for organizational planning to continue adapted interventions.",M2
19216193,"Aerosol measurement: the use of optical light scattering for the determination of particulate size distribution, and particulate mass, including the semi-volatile fraction.The GRIMM model 1.107 monitor is designed to measure particle size distribution and particulate mass based on a light scattering measurement of individual particles in the sampled air. The design and operation of the instrument are described. Protocols used to convert the measured size number distribution to a mass concentration consistent with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency protocols for measuring particulate matter (PM) less than 10 microm (PM10) and less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter are described. The performance of the resulting continuous monitor has been evaluated by comparing GRIMM monitor PM2.5 measurements with results obtained by the Rupprecht and Patashnick Co. (R&amp;P) filter dynamic measurement system (FDMS). Data were obtained during month-long studies in Rubidoux, <e>CA</e>, in July 2003 and in Fresno, CA, in December 2003. The results indicate that the GRIMM monitor does respond to total PM2.5 mass, including the semi-volatile components, giving results comparable to the FDMS. The data also indicate that the monitor can be used to estimate water content of the fine particles. However, if the inlet to the monitor is heated, then the instrument measures only the nonvolatile material, more comparable to results obtained with a conventional heated filter tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) monitor. A recent modification of the model 180, with a Nafion dryer at the inlet, measures total PM2.5 including the nonvolatile and semi-volatile components, but excluding fine particulate water. Model 180 was in agreement with FDMS data obtained in Lindon, UT, during January through February 2007.",M2
19210704,"Near real-time, autonomous detection of marine bacterioplankton on a coastal mooring in Monterey Bay, California, using rRNA-targeted DNA probes.A sandwich hybridization assay (SHA) was developed to detect 16S rRNAs indicative of phylogenetically distinct groups of marine bacterioplankton in a 96-well plate format as well as low-density arrays printed on a membrane support. The arrays were used in a field-deployable instrument, the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). The SHA employs a chaotropic buffer for both cell homogenization and hybridization, thus target sequences are captured directly from crude homogenates. Capture probes for seven of nine different bacterioplankton clades examined reacted specifically when challenged with target and non-target 16S rRNAs derived from in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA genes cloned from natural samples. Detection limits were between 0.10-1.98 and 4.43- 12.54 fmole ml(-1) homogenate for the 96-well plate and array SHA respectively. Arrays printed with five of the bacterioplankton-specific capture probes were deployed on the ESP in Monterey Bay, <e>CA</e>, twice in 2006 for a total of 25 days and also utilized in a laboratory time series study. Groups detected included marine alphaproteobacteria, SAR11, marine cyanobacteria, marine group I crenarchaea, and marine group II euryarchaea.

19198528,"Repeated West Nile virus epidemic transmission in Kern County, California, 2004-2007.West Nile virus (WNV) has remained epidemic in Kern County, <e>CA</e>, since its introduction in 2004 through 2007 when the human case annual incidence increased from 6-8 to 17 per 100,000, respectively. The 2007 increase in human infection was associated with contradicting surveillance indicators, including severe drought, warm spring but cool summer temperature anomalies, decreased rural and urban mosquito abundance but increased early season infection in urban Culex quinquefasciatus Say, moderate avian  herd immunity,  and declines in the catch of competent (western scrub-jay and house finch) and noncompetent (California quail and mourning dove) avian species. The decline in these noncompetent avian hosts may have increased contact with competent avian hosts and perhaps humans. The marked increase in home foreclosures and associated neglected swimming pools increased urban mosquito production sites, most likely contributing to the urban mosquito population and the WNV outbreak within Bakersfield. Coalescing five surveillance indicators into a risk assessment score measured each half month provided 2- to 6-wk early warning for emergency planning and was followed consistently by the onset of human cases after reaching epidemic conditions. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) antibody was detected rarely in wild birds but not mosquitoes or sentinel chickens, indicating that previously infected birds were detected in Kern County, but SLEV reintroduction was not successful. In contrast, western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) was detected during 3 of 5 yr in Culex tarsalis Coquillett, sentinel chickens, and wild birds, but failed to amplify to levels where tangential transmission was detected in Aedes mosquitoes or humans. A comparison of transmission patterns in Kern County to Coachella Valley in the southeastern desert of California showed the importance of mosquito phenology and spatial distribution, corvids, or other avian  super spreaders  and anthropogenic factors in WNV epidemiology.",M2
19193368,"The spatial relationship between traffic-generated air pollution and noise in 2 US cities.Traffic-generated air pollution and noise have both been linked to cardiovascular morbidity. Since traffic is a shared source, there is potential for correlated exposures that may lead to confounding in epidemiologic studies. As part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air), 2-week NO and NO(2) concentrations were measured at up to 105 locations, selected primarily to characterize gradients near major roads, in each of 9 US communities. We measured 5-min A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels (L(eq)) and ultrafine particle (UFP) counts at a subset of these NO/NO(2) monitoring locations in Chicago, IL (N=69 in December 2006; N=36 in April 2007) and Riverside County, <e>CA</e> (N=46 in April 2007). L(eq) and UFP were measured during non- rush hour  periods (10:00-16:00) to maximize comparability between measurements. We evaluated roadway proximity exposure surrogates in relation to the measured levels, estimated noise-air pollution correlation coefficients, and evaluated the impact of regional-scale pollution gradients, wind direction, and roadway proximity on the correlations. Five-minute L(eq) measurements in December 2006 and April 2007 were highly correlated (r=0.84), and measurements made at different times of day were similar (coefficients of variation: 0.5-13%), indicating that 5-min measurements are representative of long-term L(eq). Binary and continuous roadway proximity metrics characterized L(eq) as well or better than NO or NO(2). We found strong regional-scale gradients in NO and NO(2), particularly in Chicago, but only weak regional-scale gradients in L(eq) and UFP. L(eq) was most consistently correlated with NO, but the correlations were moderate (0.20-0.60). After removing the influence of regional-scale gradients the correlations generally increased (L(eq)-NO: r=0.49-0.62), and correlations downwind of major roads (L(eq)-NO: r=0.53-0.74) were consistently higher than those upwind (0.35-0.65). There was not a consistent effect of roadway proximity on the correlations. In conclusion, roadway proximity variables are not unique exposure surrogates in studies of endpoints hypothesized to be related to both air pollution and noise. Moderate correlations between traffic-generated air pollution and noise suggest the possibility of confounding, which might be minimized by considering regional pollution gradients and/or prevailing wind direction(s) in epidemiologic studies.",M2
19170213,"Paleoepidemiological patterns of interpersonal aggression in a prehistoric central California population from <e>CA</e>-ALA-329.Interpersonal aggression is assessed paleoepidemiologically in a large skeletal population from the CA-ALA-329 site located on the southeastern side of San Francisco Bay, California. This comprehensive analysis included all currently recognized skeletal criteria, including craniofacial fracture, projectile injury, forearm fracture, and perimortem bone modification. Craniofacial injury is moderately common, showing an adult prevalence of 9.0% with facial lesions accounting for &gt;50% of involvement. Clinical studies suggest that such separate evaluation of facial involvement provides a useful perspective for understanding patterns of interpersonal aggression. In this group male facial involvement is significantly greater than in females, paralleling the pattern found widely in contemporary populations as well as in African apes. When compared to other North American skeletal samples the prevalence of adult cranial vault injury (3.3%) and especially projectile injury (4.4%) are quite high. However, well documented populations from southern California show markedly higher prevalence for both types of skeletal markers of aggression. Forearm fracture is also assessed using a rigorous radiographic methodology and results suggest that these injuries are not reliable indicators of interpersonal aggression. Lastly, perimortem bone modification was not observed in this population, although it has been recorded from other (older) sites nearby. This study provides an evaluation of multiple skeletal markers of interpersonal aggression in the largest sample from a single site yet reported in North America and, joined with consideration of cultural context, helps further illuminate both geographic and temporal patterns of interpersonal aggression in California.",M2
19168781,"Body adiposity in late life and risk of dementia or cognitive impairment in a longitudinal community-based study.BACKGROUND: The association between body adiposity at older ages and the development of cognitive impairment is unclear. METHODS: The association of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in late life with incidence of cognitive impairment was prospectively examined in a cohort study of 1,351 Latinos, aged 60-101 and residents of the Sacramento, <e>CA</e>, area at study baseline. The status of dementia and  cognitive impairment but not demented  (CIND) was determined at baseline and at each of five follow-up examinations by a multistage assessment protocol. Incident cases of dementia and CIND were combined (dementia/CIND) for more than 8 years of follow-up. BMI was categorized as less than 25.0, 25.0-29.9 (overweight), and 30 kg/m(2) or greater (obese). Waist circumference was categorized into sex-specific tertiles. RESULTS: Dementia/CIND was diagnosed in 110 (8.2%) participants. Compared with the lowest BMI category, overweight participants had a 48% decreased rate of dementia/CIND (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.91) and obese participants had a 61% decreased rate of dementia/CIND (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20-0.78). Rates of dementia/CIND for the middle and high tertile of waist circumference, compared with the low tertile, were 80% and 90% higher, respectively (adjusted HR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.1, and adjusted HR = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.91-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal fat in late life appears to confer an increased risk for dementia/CIND, whereas overall obesity appears to be protective. This may reflect age-related changes in body composition and the association of visceral fat with metabolic dysregulation.",M2

18947452,"Host plant influence on susceptibility of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) to insecticides.A resistance monitoring program conducted for the polyphagous whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), in Imperial Valley, <e>CA</e>, USA generated a large set of LC50s for adults collected from broccoli, cantaloupe and cotton crops over a four-year period. A vial bioassay and, subsequently, a yellow-sticky card bioassay produced similar temporal profiles of relative susceptibilities to the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin. Both bioassays revealed that whiteflies collected from broccoli were significantly less susceptible to bifenthrin compared to the other two crops. A similar finding was observed for endosulfan and the mixture of bifenthrin+endosulfan in the yellow-sticky card bioassay. The possibility that seasonal differences contributed to the observed differences in susceptibility provided the impetus to conduct a reciprocal transfer experiment using broccoli (or kale) and cantaloupe grown simultaneously in the field and greenhouse. Whitefly adults collected from an organic farm over three consecutive weeks had significantly higher LC50s on kale than those collected the same day on cantaloupe. After culturing in the greenhouse on broccoli or cantaloupe and testing again, LC50s remained significantly higher on broccoli after one week and again at the F1 generation. In contrast, whiteflies originating on kale in the field and transferred to cantaloupes in the greenhouse had significantly reduced LC50s at the F1 generation. When tested against the bifenthrin+endosulfan mixture, significantly higher LC50s were generated for whiteflies reared on broccoli in the greenhouse at one week and the F1 compared to the field source from cantaloupes. The consistently higher LC50s for whiteflies on broccoli and other Brassica spp. crops, compared to cantaloupes or cotton, point to statistically significant host-plant influences that are expressed in both field-collected and greenhouse-reared populations of whiteflies.",M2
18941841,"Cuticular hydrocarbons and soldier defense secretions of Reticulitermes in southern California: a critical analysis of the taxonomy of the genus in North America.Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) and soldier defense secretions (SDS) were characterized for collections of Reticulitermes from six counties (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Santa Barbara) in southern California. Collection sites included the type locality for R. hesperus, Lake Arrowhead (formerly known as Little Bear Lake) in the San Bernardino Mountains. In southern California, there are two CHC phenotypes, SC-A and SC-B, which are easily distinguished by the presence or absence of 5-methyl pentacosane, 5-methyl heptacosane, 5,17-dimethyl pentacosane, and 5,17-dimethyl heptacosane. These phenotypes are similar, but not identical, to previously designated phenotypes of Reticulitermes from northern California. The SDS of termites collected from southern California were characterized; (-)-germacrene A was abundant in all but the four samples from Lake Arrowhead. Soldiers of phenotype SC-A produced &gt;79% germacrene A. The four samples from Lake Arrowhead produced no germacrene A, but contained &gt;78% gamma-cadinene. The SDS from the Lake Arrowhead samples were more similar to those of <e>CA</e>-A/CA-A' from northern California than to any of the CHC phenotypes from southern California. Soldiers of CHC phenotype SC-B produced germacrene A, with the proportion varying from 16.2 to 98.7%. The SDS of SC-B were more similar to those of SC-A than to any of the phenotypes from northern California. The CHC phenotype SC-A found in southern California likely represents R. hesperus and SC-B appears to be a new, as yet undescribed species. We discuss the state of current taxonomic research on Reticulitermes.",M2
18939530,"Diurnal cycles of acrolein and other small aldehydes in regions impacted by vehicle emissions.This research determined the diurnal and seasonal differences in the ambient atmospheric concentrations of acrolein and several small aldehydes and attempted to link the chemicals to their potential sources. Two summertime and two wintertime sampling episodes were conducted in Roseville, <e>CA</e> at a site located near several busy roadways. One additional sampling episode was conducted at a remote site in the summer to estimate regional background concentrations of aldehydes. Each sampling episode consisted of duplicate samples collected every two hours around the clock for three days. Acrolein concentrations did not correlate with traffic density, ozone concentrations, or tracers of direct vehicle emissions, which argues against vehicles being a dominant source of ambient acrolein through primary emissions or secondary oxidation products. The results showed that wintertime acrolein concentrations correlated well with 2-furaldehyde, which is a tracer of biomass burning, thus suggesting that wood smoke is an important source of ambient acrolein. Other regularly detected carbonyls were tentatively assigned to different source classes (direct vehicle emissions, photochemical oxidation, wood smoke or transport from the Sierra Nevada Mountains) based on time series patterns and correlations with indicators of potential sources (e.g., ozone, traffic density, etc.).",M2
18855128,"Rates and severity of perforation from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads: a 4-year study.INTRODUCTION: Although recent case reports and one small single-year observational study report a substantially increased rate of perforation with the St. Jude Riata series defibrillator lead, these results have not been externally validated. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2004 to 2007, 593 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants were performed by six faculty and 13 fellows at four University of California, San Francisco, <e>CA</e>, USA and affiliate hospitals. An electronic medical records system was systematically searched to identify clinically significant cases of ICD lead dislodgment or perforation. Of 307 (56%) St. Jude leads (all Riata series 6.3- and 7.3-French leads), 188 (29%) Medtronic leads (including 99 Sprint Fidelis 6.6 French leads), and 98 (15%) Guidant/Boston Scientific leads, there were three perforations in 593 cases (0.51%). One perforation occurred with a Medtronic Sprint Fidelis 6949 lead (0.53%), and two with a St. Jude Riata 1581 lead (0.65%). There were no statistically significant differences in perforation or dislodgement rates between manufacturers or lead models (p = NS for all). In both cases of perforation with the St. Jude Riata leads, the lead tip perforated through the pericardium into the pleural space. CONCLUSIONS: In our 4-year series of ICD implants, perforation and dislodgement rates were low, similar across all lead makes and models, and well below published and accepted complication rates. Our findings contradict previously-reported higher rates of perforation with the Riata lead. Registry and product performance reports should also classify complications by severity and outcome to provide a more complete assessment of product safety.",M2
18843299,"Natural acidophilic biofilm communities reflect distinct organismal and functional organization.Pellicle biofilms colonize the air-solution interface of underground acid mine drainage (AMD) streams and pools within the Richmond Mine (Iron Mountain, Redding, <e>CA</e>, USA). They exhibit relatively low species richness and, consequently, represent good model systems to study natural microbial community structure. Fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with epifluorescent microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed spatially and temporally defined microbial assemblages. Leptospirillum group II dominates the earliest developmental stages of stream pellicles. With increasing biofilm maturity, the proportion of archaea increases in conjunction with the appearance of eukaryotes. In contrast, mature pool pellicles are stratified with a densely packed bottom layer of Leptospirillum group II, a less dense top layer composed mainly of archaea and no eukarya. Immunohistochemical detection of Leptospirillum group II cytochrome 579 indicates a high abundance of this protein at the interface of the biofilm with the AMD solution. Consequently, community architecture, which most likely develops in response to chemical gradients across the biofilm, is reflected at the functional gene expression level.",M2
18800542,"An evaluation of compound-specific isotope analyses for assessing the biodegradation of MTBE at Port Hueneme, <e>CA</e>.The use of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) as a diagnostic tool for MTBE biodegradation in aquifers was tested at the Port Hueneme, CA site. There, a 1500-m long dissolved MTBE plume and associated engineered aerobic flow-through biobarrier have been well-studied, leading to delineation of regions of known significant and limited bioattenuation. This allowed comparison of field-scale CSIA results with a priori knowledge of aerobic MTBE biodegradation, leading to conclusions concerning the utility of CSIA as a diagnostic tool for other aerobic biodegradation sites. Groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for both 13C and 2H (D) in MTBE through the bioactive treatment zone and within the larger MTBE plume. For reference, the 13C enrichment factor for MTBE biodegradation in laboratory-scale microcosms using site groundwater and sediments was also quantified. Aerobic microcosms showed a 13C enrichment of 5.5 to 6.4 +/- 0.2 per thousand over a two-order of magnitude concentration decrease, with an average isotope enrichment factor (epsilon(c)) of -1.4 per thousand, in agreement with other aerobic microcosm studies. Less 13C enrichment (about 25%) was observed for similar MTBE concentration reductions in groundwater samples collected within the aerobic biotreatment zone, and this enrichment was comparable to the scatter in delta13C values within the source zone. Increasing enrichment with decreasing MTBE concentration seen in microcosm data was not evident in either the 13C or D field data. The discrepancy between field and laboratory data may reflect small-scale (&lt;1 m) spatial heterogeneity in MTBE biodegradation activity and the mixing of water from adjacent strata during groundwater sampling; for example, relatively nonattenuated MTBE-impacted water from one stratum could be mixed with highly attenuated/low-MTBE concentration from another, and this could produce a sample with both reduced MTBE concentration and low enrichment. Overall, the results suggest that 13C data alone may produce inconclusive results at sites where MTBE undergoes aerobic biodegradation, and that even with two-dimensional CSIA (13C and D), an increase in the confidence of data interpretation may only be possible with data sets larger than those typically collected in practice.",M2
18800506,"DDE in sediments of the Palos Verdes Shelf, California: in situ transformation rates and geochemical fate.From 1947 to 1971 the world's largest manufacturer of DDT discharged process wastes into the sewers of Los Angeles County. Roughly 870-1450 t of DDT were released to the ocean off Palos Verdes, <e>CA</e>, a portion of which (approximately 100 t) resides in sediments on the continental shelf and slope. The most abundant DDT compound in the sediments, p,p'-DDE, is degrading by reductive dechlorination, but the rate of transformation and factors controlling it are not well understood. In order to estimate in situ transformation rates and predict the long-term fate of p,p'-DDE, box cores were collected in 1992 and 2003 from a single location on the Palos Verdes Shelf and analyzed for 8 DDT compounds and 84 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The PCBs show no evidence of dechlorination, and inventories did not change between 1992 and 2003. By contrast, the inventory of p,p'-DDE decreased by 43%, whereas that of p,p'-DDMU, the putative reductive dechlorination product, increased by 34%. The first-order transformation rate for p,p'-DDE at the study site is 0.051 +/- 0.006 yr(-1). A multistep reaction model suggests that inventories of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDMU will continue to decline, whereas that of p,p'-DDNU will reach a maximum around 2014.",M2
18788960,"Statewide efforts in promoting palliative care.BACKGROUND: In 2002, Means to a Better End: A Report of Dying in America Today, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) report, was issued that included grades for each state on their ability to provide end-of-life care. Most states, including California, rated as mediocre and the report called for extensive efforts at a state level to improve the quality of palliative care. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive statewide effort to improve end-of-life care education for 350 California nurses as an example of state-level change as recommended by the RWJF report. DESIGN: Funded by the Archstone Foundation (Long Beach, <e>CA</e>), this effort was based on the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC)  Train the Trainer  project, a national educational initiative to improve end-of-life care by providing training to nurses (www.aacn.nche.edu/ELNEC). ELNEC is a partnership between City of Hope, Duarte, California, and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, Inc., Washington D.C. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Three courses were held from October 2005 through March 2007 in which 350 nurses from various clinical settings across California applied and participated in the training program. MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS/CONCLUSION: In order to be accepted in the course, participants agreed to follow-up for 12 months postcourse in order to evaluate the impact of their attendance on their institutions' commitment to palliative care. This paper reports findings from this California effort as an example of a state-intensive effort and to encourage other statewide palliative care initiatives in order to improve care for the dying.",M2
18773328,"Evaluation of risk factors and a community intervention to increase control and treatment of asthma in a low-income semi-rural California community.To better understand risk factors associated with current asthma in a low-income, ethnically diverse population, we analyzed pooled data from the 2004-2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey conducted in Salinas, <e>CA</e>. We were particularly interested in modifiable risk factors, as the survey was conducted as part of a large community-based intervention that addresses asthma, obesity, and diabetes. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants involved with the clinical, school, and community aspects of the intervention to inform the intervention's progress, and adapt practices and programs to reach those most in need. Of the 4925 adults in this analysis, 51% were Mexican-American and 32% lacked a high-school diploma; 227 women and 84 men had current asthma, and 194 were parents of children with current asthma; prevalences of 7.7%, 4.3%, and 7.0% respectively. Over 20% of women and men with asthma were current smokers and/or exposed to passive smoking, more than 50% reported less than the recommended 60 minutes or more of physical activity per day, and approximately 40% were obese or morbidly obese (42% of women and 36% of men compared to 26% of adults without asthma). Two of the strongest modifiable risk factors associated with current asthma and identified by the stepwise multiple regression models were: could not afford prescription medication(s) in the past 12 months (OR 2.5, p &lt; 0.001 for adults with asthma, OR 1.8, p &lt; 0.01 for parents of children with asthma) and morbid obesity (OR 3.4, p &lt; 0.001 for adults with asthma). Among adults who reported one or more episodes of asthma in the past 30 days, 28% of women and 30% of men had not used a preventive medication, and 48% of women and 57% of men had not used a prescription asthma inhaler (20% had not used either). This study adds to the scarce body of literature on the prevalence of asthma and related risk factors in a predominately Mexican-American, semi-rural community, and illustrates how survey and key informant data can enhance knowledge of local study populations and guide interventions to improve asthma control and treatment.",M2
18773190,"Mapping of genetic loci that regulate quantity of beta-carotene in fruit of US Western Shipping melon (Cucumis melo L.).Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is highly nutritious vegetable species and an important source of beta-carotene (Vitamin A), which is an important nutrient in the human diet. A previously developed set of 81 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Group Cantalupensis US Western Shipper market type germplasm was examined in two locations [Wisconsin (WI) and California (<e>CA</e>), USA] over 2 years to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with quantity of beta-carotene (QbetaC) in mature fruit. A moderately saturated 256-point RIL-based map [104 SSR, 7 CAPS, 4 SNP in putative carotenoid candidate genes, 140 dominant markers and one morphological trait (a) spanning 12 linkage groups (LG)] was used for QbetaC-QTL analysis. Eight QTL were detected in this evaluation that were distributed across four LG that explained a significant portion of the associated phenotypic variation for QbetaC (R (2) = 8 to 31.0%). Broad sense heritabilities for QbetaC obtained from RIL grown in WI. and CA were 0.56 and 0.68, respectively, and 0.62 over combined locations. The consistence of QbetaC in high/low RIL within location across years was confirmed in experiments conducted over 2 years. QTL map positions were not uniformly associated with putative carotenoid genes, although one QTL (beta-car6.1) interval was located 10 cM from a beta-carotene hydroxylase gene. These results suggest that accumulation of beta-carotene in melon is under complex genetic control. This study provides the initial step for defining the genetic control of QbetaC in melon leading to the development of varieties with enhanced beta-carotene content.",M2
18697303,"Effects of the El Niño--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle on mosquito populations in southern California.The abundance and species composition of adult mosquitoes collected by carbon dioxide-baited suction traps and gravid traps in western Los Angeles County, <e>CA</e>, were compared before and during a strong El Niño--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle from December 1996 until November 1999. Following El Niño conditions in the winter 1997-1998, adult host-seeking mosquito abundance during spring was twice that observed during spring 1997 and species composition favored cool-weather mosquitoes such as Culiseta incidens and Culex tarsalis. The comparatively cool temperatures from early April until early June and increased rainfall of the 1998 El Niño negatively affected warm-weather mosquitoes such as Culex quinquefasciatus that inhabit eutrophic habitats such as urban storm drains. Gravid mosquito abundance during the early summer following El Niño conditions also increased 2- to 3-fold relative to 1997, but gravid mosquito species composition was not significantly affected by ENSO cycles, reflecting an inherent bias of gravid traps to collect predominantly Cx. quinquefasciatus. Relative to spring 1997, host-seeking and gravid mosquito abundances were reduced 3- to 7-fold from March until June 1999 under the comparatively dry La Niña conditions. The increased abundance and prolonged host-seeking activity of Cx. tarsalis during the spring and early summer following a strong El Niño may have a significant impact on public health in urban southern California because this mosquito is an important arbovirus vector and constructed wetlands in urban areas may increase suitable, comparatively permanent developmental sites for important mosquito vectors such as Cx. tarsalis that are usually rare in urban environments.",M2
18684489,"Sources of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in urban wastewater, Oakland, <e>CA</e>.Synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been found in surface waters throughout the United States, and are known to enter waterways via discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Studies addressing EDCs in wastewater do not examine their specific sources upstream of WWTPs. Presented here are results of a pilot study of potential sources of selected EDCs within an urban wastewater service area. Twenty-one wastewater samples were collected from a range of sites, including 16 residential, commercial, or industrial samples, and five samples from influent and effluent streams at the WWTP. Samples were analyzed for the following known and suspected EDCs: five phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, 4-nonylphenol (NP), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), using well-established methods (EPA 625 and USGS O-1433-01). Twenty of 21 samples contained at least one EDC. Phthalates were widely detected; one or more phthalate compound was identified in 19 of 21 samples. Measurement of two phthalates in a field blank sample suggests that the accuracy of sample detections for these two compounds may be compromised by background contamination. Triclosan was detected in nine samples, BPA in five samples, and TCEP in four samples; NP was not detected. The results of this and future source-specific studies may be used to develop targeted pollution prevention strategies to reduce levels of EDCs in wastewater.",M2
18647164,"Gastrointestinal pythiosis in 10 dogs from California.BACKGROUND: Pythium insidiosum is an aquatic oomycete that causes severe segmental thickening of the canine gastrointestinal (GI) tract, resulting in weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and death. Infection in dogs previously has been observed primarily in the southeastern United States. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic and epidemiologic findings associated with GI pythiosis in 10 dogs from California. METHODS: Dogs were initially identified on the basis of supportive clinical findings and routine histology. Pythiosis was confirmed in each dog with at least one of the following: immunoblot serology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology, immunohistochemistry, and culture followed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction, rRNA gene sequencing, or both. RESULTS: Between September 2003 and December 2006, GI pythiosis was confirmed in 1 dog from central California and 9 dogs that lived within a 30-mile radius of Davis, <e>CA</e>. Seven of 8 dogs for which environmental data were available had frequent access to flooded rice fields or other water sources. Esophageal lesions were present in 2 of 10 dogs. Common laboratory findings included eosinophilia (7/9), hypoalbuminemia (9/9), and hyperglobulinemia (8/9). Median survival time was 26.5 days (range, 0-122 days), and the disease was ultimately fatal in all 10 dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The geographic distribution of pythiosis has widened in recent years to include the western United States. Factors that may have contributed to this change include altered rice-farming practices and landscape irrigation. Veterinarians in California should be familiar with the clinicopathologic features associated with GI pythiosis to aid in early diagnosis and effective treatment.",M2
18547612,"Perfluorochemicals in water reuse.Faced with freshwater shortages, water authorities are increasingly utilizing wastewater reclamation to augment supplies. However, concerns over emerging trace contaminants that persist through wastewater treatment need to be addressed to evaluate potential risks. In the present study, perfluorinated surfactant residues were characterized in recycled water from four California wastewater treatment plants that employ tertiary treatment and one that treats primary sewage in a wetland constructed for both treatment and wildlife habitat. Effluent concentrations were compared with surface and groundwater from a creek where recycled water was evaluated as a potential means to augment flow (Upper Silver and Coyote Creeks, San Jose, <e>CA</e>). In the recycled water, 90-470 ng/l perfluorochemicals were detected, predominantly perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; 10-190 ng/l) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; 20-190 ng/l). No significant removal of perfluorochemicals was observed in the wetland (total concentration ranged 100-170ng/l across various treatment stages); in this case, 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido) acetic acid (N-EtFOSAA), perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS), and PFOS were dominant. Though there is currently no wastewater discharge into the creeks, perfluorochemicals were found in the surface water and underlying groundwater at a total of 20-150 ng/l with PFOS and PFOA again making the largest contribution. With respect to ecotoxicological effects, perfluorochemical release via recycled water into sensitive ecosystems requires evaluation.",M2
18522692,"Influence of habitat discontinuity, geographical distance, and oceanography on fine-scale population genetic structure of copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus).The copper rockfish is a benthic, nonmigratory, temperate rocky reef marine species with pelagic larvae and juveniles. A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly-spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, <e>CA</e>, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale (approximately 2200 km), significant population subdivision (F(ST) = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections (approximately 450 km, F(ST) = 0.001). Hierarchical amova identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (N(e)m) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.",M2
18507791,"The effect of cactus spines on light interception and Photosystem II for three sympatric species of Opuntia from the Mojave Desert.Cactus spines reduce herbivory, direct water toward roots and reduce the impacts of high- and low-temperature extremes. Yet, shading of stems by spines reduces incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD), photosynthesis and growth. This study compared spinescence, PFD interception, stem temperature, Photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and xanthophyll pigment composition for three species of cacti from the Mojave Desert, <e>CA</e>. The species vary in spinescence: Opuntia basilaris, which has no central or radial spines; Opuntia erinacea, which is densely covered with spines; and Opuntia phaeacantha, which has an intermediate coverage of spines. The role of spines was tested by removing spines from stems of O. erinacea. PFD interception was similar for both O. basilaris and O. phaeacantha, and about three times that for densely spined O. erinacea; removal of spines increased incident PFD three-fold. There were no effects of spines on stem temperatures. Steady-state light-response curves of chlorophyll a fluorescence from PSII indicated that PhiPSII, photochemical quenching (qP) and electron flux within PSII were lower, and non-photochemical quenching was higher, for O. erinacea in comparison to the other two species with less spines. After 2 months, qP was higher and electron flux lower, and xanthophyll pigment pool size was higher, for stems from which spines had been removed compared with intact stems. These three species allocate different amounts of biomass to spines, resulting in species-specific PFD interception, PSII photochemistry and xanthophyll pigment pool size, which may help maintain rates of photosynthesis during the hot, dry Mojave Desert summer.",M2
18425011,"Cyberknife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia treatment: a preliminary multicenter experience.OBJECTIVE: Radiosurgery has gained acceptance as a treatment option for trigeminal neuralgia. We report our preliminary multicenter experience treating trigeminal neuralgia with the CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, <e>CA</e>). METHODS: A total of 95 patients were treated for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia between May 2002 and October 2005. Radiosurgical dose and volume parameters were retrospectively analyzed in relation to pain response, complications, and recurrence of symptoms. Optimal treatment parameters were identified for patients who had excellent and sustained pain relief with no complications, including severe or moderate hypesthesia. RESULTS: Excellent pain relief was initially experienced by 64 out of 95 patients (67%). The median time to pain relief was 14 days (range, 0.3-180 d). Posttreatment numbness occurred in 45 (47%) of the patients treated. Using higher radiation doses and treating longer segments of the nerve led to both better pain relief and a higher incidence of hypesthesia. The presence of posttreatment numbness was predictive of better pain relief. The overall rate of complications was 18%. At the mean follow-up time of 2 years, 47 of the 95 patients (50%) had sustained pain relief, all of whom were completely off pain medications. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest the following optimal radiosurgical treatment parameters for treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia: a median maximal dose of 78 Gy (range, 70-85.4 Gy) and a median length of the nerve treated of 6 mm (range, 5-12 mm).",M2
18419911,"Yellow sticky trap catches of parasitoids of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in vegetable crops and their relationship to in-field populations.We examined the relationship of yellow sticky trap captures of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype B parasitoids to the local population of parasitoids as measured by leaf samples of parasitized whiteflies and mass release of parasitoids. Traps were placed in experimental collard and cowpea field plots in Charleston, SC, and in commercial organic fields of spring cantaloupe and watermelon in the Imperial Valley, <e>CA</e>. The exotic parasitoid Eretmocerus emiratus Zolnerowich and Rose was released in Imperial Valley fields to ensure parasitoid populations would be present. Bemisia adults were trapped in the greatest numbers on the upper surface of horizontally oriented sticky traps in melon fields. In contrast, the lower trap surfaces consistently captured more Eretmocerus than upper surfaces. Female parasitoids were trapped in greater numbers than males, especially on the lower trap surfaces. Progeny of released exotic Eretmocerus greatly outnumbered native E. eremicus Rose and Zolnerowich and Encarsia spp. on traps. Throughout the season, the trend of increasing numbers of Eretmocerus on traps parallelled the increase in numbers of whiteflies. Over the season, 23-84% of all B. tabaci fourth instars were visibly parasitized by Eretmocerus. The numbers of Eretmocerus caught by traps in cantaloupe were similar in trend to numbers on leaf samples in melons, but not with those in watermelon, where whitefly populations were lower. Parasitoid numbers were low in collard and cowpea samples, and no trend was observed in numbers of parasitoids captured on traps and numbers on leaves for these two crops. Overall, there were no significant correlations between sticky trap catches of parasitoids and numbers of parasitized whiteflies on leaf samples in any test fields. Nevertheless, sticky traps placed within crops may be useful for observing trends in whitefly parasitoid populations at a particular site and for detecting parasitoids at specific locations.",M2
18375110,"Outreach-based drug treatment for sex trading women: the Cal-Pep risk-reduction demonstration project.BACKGROUND: California Prevention Education Program (Cal-Pep) provides street outreach services to injection drugs users and sex traders in Oakland and San Francisco, <e>CA</e>, to reduce their chances of contracting HIV/AIDS. Drug treatment is an effective barrier to HIV infections, but only clients who are ready for total abstinence from drug use can be referred to traditional treatment. Drug treatment readiness is currently defined by funding policies in the U.S. as a client's willingness to totally abstain from alcohol and illegal drug use. This policy and practice eliminates a major harm reduction opportunity to reach drug users who are just contemplating recovery with treatment. With a CSAT grant to demonstrate an effective innovation in treatment, Cal-Pep started a harm reduction outpatient program for women who were active drug users. Over the course of 1 year, actively drug-using clients came to the program house during the day for meals, for risk-reduction education sessions, group discussions, and one-on-one psychological counselling. METHOD: From April 2001 to March 2006, 37 clients per year were interviewed at program entry and after 6 and 12 months to see if the intervention activities had an impact on their drug use and readiness for abstinence drug treatment. RESULTS: By the 6th and 12th month of clients' progression through the risk-reduction program, they reported a statistically significant reduction in their poly-drug use (cocaine, cannabis, heroin, PCP) in the 30 days prior to their interviews (p&lt;.000). There were also significant reductions in poly-drug use with alcohol (p&lt;.000) and use of crack cocaine alone (p&lt;.003). There was also an added benefit: clients significantly improved their living circumstances from the streets and shelters to rooms and apartments while in the program (p&lt;.034). There was no significant improvement in employment. CONCLUSION: This intervention shows that a harm reduction intermediate treatment program for actively using drug users can significantly reduce their drug use and improve readiness for full recovery.",M2
18350879,"A new role for sulfur in arsenic cycling.Sulfur and arsenic often coexist in the environment and share similar microbial redox transformations. We examined the effects of sulfide on aerobic arsenite oxidation in alkaline lake water samples and in laboratory enrichment cultures. Significant arsenite oxidation occurred only in treatments with bacteria present, and production of arsenate was greatly enhanced by the addition of sulfide or thiosulfate. IC-ICP-MS analysis of samples showed that mono- and dithioarsenate formed in arsenite + sulfide amended lake water. Our data indicate that these two thioarsenic compounds are fairly stable in sterile alkaline solutions, but are transformed predominantly to arsenate when bacteria are present. Enrichment culture experiments suggest that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria use free or arsenic-bound sulfur as a growth substrate and directly or indirectly transform arsenite and thioarsenates to arsenate during growth. Increases in cell density resulted in more rapid conversion of arsenite and thioarsenates. The rate and extent of these processes appearto be controlled bythe concentration of bacteria and the ratio of reduced sulfur to arsenite present. Sulfur-driven arsenite oxidation and microbial thioarsenate transformation may be important biogeochemical processes in the arsenic cycle of our study site (Mono Lake, <e>CA</e>, USA) and other alkaline environments as well.",M2

In surface water (unfiltered and filtered) and pore water, the concentration of total mercury was correlated with methylmercury levels (R2=0.29, 0.26, 0.27, respectively, p&lt;0.05), in contrast to sediments, where organic matter and reduced iron levels were most correlated with methylmercury content (R2=0.37, 0.26, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, levels for percent methylmercury of total mercury in sediments were higher than typical values for estuarine sediments (average 5.4%, range 0.024-38%, n=59), while pore water methylmercury Kd values were also high (average 3.1, range 2.0-4.2l kg(-1), n=39), and the estimated methylmercury flux from sediments was low (average 1.7, range 0.14-5.3ng m(-2) day(-1), n=19). Mercury levels in predatory fish tissue at Mugu are &gt;0.3ppm, suggesting biogeochemical controls on methylmercury mobility do not completely mitigate methylmercury uptake through the food web.",M2
18330708,"Identification and education of adolescents with asthma in an urban school district: results from a large-scale asthma intervention.Asthma is a leading cause of hospitalizations, acute care utilization, health care costs, and school absences in children. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in inner city populations. In general, community-based public health interventions to reduce asthma morbidity have had modest success due in part to their limited reach and low participation by the targeted population. Adolescents have been especially difficult to reach. A coalition of community organizations developed a school-based, population-level system to identify, prioritize, and provide interventions for middle school children with asthma in a large urban school district in Oakland, <e>CA</e>. Nearly 92% (n = 8,326) of students in the targeted schools took an asthma case identification survey. Of those students who took the survey, 17.5% (n = 1,458) had active asthma and were eligible for services. Among those identified with active asthma, 83% (n = 1,217) voluntarily attended asthma self-management classes at school. The 4-week curriculum previously has been shown to significantly improve several indicators of asthma control in this population. Retention was high-72% of students who enrolled attended at least three of the four curriculum sessions. Many higher-risk students were subsequently referred to and enrolled in off-site asthma services. Large school districts with incomplete or inadequate health records, high asthma prevalence, and internal or external services available for students with asthma may benefit from a similar model. A system such as the one described may be an effective public health strategy for school districts, health departments, and community coalitions addressing asthma or other conditions with high childhood prevalence.",M2
18284102,"Psychosocial and behavioral correlates of depressed mood among female methamphetamine users.Female methamphetamine (meth) users report more depressive symptoms than do males. This study examined psychosocial and behavioral correlates of depressed mood in 146 heterosexual, meth-using women in San Diego, <e>CA</e>. Sixty percent met Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) criteria for moderate to severe depressive symptoms (i.e., higher levels of depressive symptoms); 40% had minimal to mild depressive symptoms (i.e., lower levels of depressive symptoms). The two groups were compared on background characteristics, reasons for meth use, patterns of meth use, psychosocial factors, social and sexual consequences of meth use, and sexual risk behavior. Women with higher levels of depressive symptoms were less likely to be employed, were more likely to use meth to cope with mood, used more grams of meth in a 30-day period, used meth more times per day on a greater number of consecutive days, and were more likely to be binge users of meth. They also scored lower on a measure of self-esteem and higher on measures of impulsivity, social stigma, and social network members' use of meth. In multivariate analyses, lower self-esteem and higher ratings of social network members' use of meth were significant predictors of higher levels of depressive symptoms. Psychosocial and behavioral factors are discussed in terms of treatment protocols for mood regulation and meth abatement in the target population.",M2
18260508,"Serologic evidence of a Rickettsia akari-like infection among wild-caught rodents in Orange County and humans in Los Angeles County, California.We detected antibodies reactive with Rickettsia akari, the etiologic agent of rickettsialpox in humans and in 83 of 359 (23%) rodents belonging to several species, collected in Orange County, <e>CA</e>. Reciprocal antibody titers &gt;1:16 to R. akari were detected in native mice and rats (Peromyscus maniculatus, P. eremicus, and Neotoma fuscipes) and in Old World mice and rats (Mus musculus, Rattus rattus, and R. norvegicus), representing the first time that antibodies reactive with this agent have been detected in four of these species and the first report of these antibodies in rodents and humans west of the Mississippi River. We then tested serum samples from individuals who used a free clinic in downtown Los Angeles and found that 25 of 299 (8%) of these individuals had antibody titers &gt;1:64 to R. akari. Serologic evidence suggested that R. akari or a closely related rickettsia is prevalent among several rodent species at these localities and that infection spills over into certain segments of the human population. Isolation or molecular confirmation of the agent is needed to conclusively state that R. akari is the etiologic agent infecting these rodents.",M2
18256434,"Identification of Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes in a hybrid zone of West Nile virus transmission in Fresno County, California.Culex pipiens sensu lato mosquitoes were collected from 24 gravid traps (mid-June to mid-October, 2005) in Fresno County, <e>CA</e>. Captured gravid females were allowed to oviposit before sibling species identification by Ace.2 PCR and detection of West Nile virus (WNV) RNA by RT-PCR were performed on the mother and her offspring. Of the 442 Cx. pipiens s.l. female mosquitoes collected, 88 were positive for WNV viral RNA (peaked in August) with no significant differences among complex members or habitat. Vertical transmission was detected in 4 out of 20 families originating from WNV-positive mothers, however, in only a small number of offspring from each family. Out of 101 families that had PCR-based maternal and offspring identifications, the offspring from 15 families produced inexplicable amplicon patterns, suggesting ambiguities in the PCR assay identifications. Male genitalia (DV/D ratio) and Ace.2 PCR identifications revealed numerous discrepancies in our ability to accurately determine the identity of Cx. pipiens complex members in the hybrid zone of Fresno County.",M2
18242661,"Water quality prediction of marine recreational beaches receiving watershed baseflow and stormwater runoff in southern California, USA.Beach advisories are issued to the public in California when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including total coliform, fecal coliform (or Escherichia coli), and Enterococcus, exceed their recreational water health standards, or when the amount of a rainfall event is above the pre-determined threshold. However, it is not fully understood about how and to what degree stormwater runoff or baseflow exerts impacts on beach water quality. Furthermore, current laboratory methods used to determine the FIB levels take 18-96 h, which is too slow to keep pace with changes in FIB levels in water. Thus, a beach may not be posted when it is contaminated, and may be posted under advisory when bacterial levels have already decreased to within water quality standards. The study was designed to address the above critical issues. There were large temporal and spatial variations in FIB concentrations along two popular State Beaches in San Diego, <e>CA</e>, USA. The rainstorm-induced runoff from the watersheds exerts significant impacts on the marine recreational water quality of the beaches adjacent to lagoons during the first 24-48 h after a rain event. The large volume of stormwater runoff discharging to beaches caused high FIB concentrations in beach water not only at the lagoon outlet channel and the mixing zone, but also at the locations 90 m away from the channel northward or southward along the shoreline. The geomorphology of beach shoreline, distance from the outlet channel, wind strength, wind direction, tide height, wave height, rainfall, time lapse after a rainstorm, or channel flow rate played a role in affecting the distribution of FIB concentrations in beach water. Despite the great temporal and spatial variability of FIB concentrations along a shoreline, the artificial neural network-based models developed in this study are capable of successfully predicting FIB concentrations at different beaches, different locations, and different times under baseflow or rainstorm conditions. The models are based on readily measurable variables including temperature, conductivity, pH, turbidity, channel water flow, rainfall, and/or time lapse after a rainstorm. The established models will help fill the current gap between beach posting and actual water quality and make more meaningful and effective decisions on beach closures and advisories.",M2
18187785,"Risk factors associated with human infection during the 2006 West Nile virus outbreak in Davis, a residential community in northern California.We collected a total of 15,329 mosquitoes during weekly sampling in Davis, <e>CA</e>, from April through mid-October 2006 at 21 trap sites uniformly spaced 1.5 km apart over an area of approximately 26 km(2). Of these mosquitoes, 1,355 pools of Culex spp. were tested by multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, of which 16 pools (1.2%) were positive for West Nile virus (WNV). A degree-day model with a developmental threshold of 14.3 degrees C accurately predicted episodic WNV transmission after three extrinsic incubation periods after initial detection. Kriging interpolation delineated that Culex tarsalis were most abundant at traps near surrounding agriculture, whereas Cx. pipiens clustered within residential areas and greenbelt systems in the old portion of Davis. Spatial-temporal analyses were performed to test for clustering of locations of WNV-infected dead birds and traps with WNV-positive Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens; human case incidence was mapped by census blocks. Significant multivariate spatial-temporal clustering was detected among WNV-infected dead birds and WNV-positive Cx. tarsalis, and a WNV-positive Cx. pipiens cluster overlapped areas with high incidences of confirmed human cases. Spatial analyses of WNV surveillance data may be an effective method to identify areas with an increased risk for human infection and to target control efforts to reduce the incidence of human disease.",M2
18178362,"Injecting drug use and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.To demonstrate that injecting drug use is a major risk factor of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (<e>CA</e>-MRSA) infection and injecting drug users may be a reservoir of CA-MRSA infection in our community, we conducted a matched case-control study. Cases were CA-MRSA-infected patients at University of California, Davis, Medical Center, Sacramento, CA, from December 1, 2003, to May 31, 2004. Two control groups were community-associated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA)-infected patients and a randomly selected uninfected patient group in the same hospital. Controls were matched to cases by age and isolate culture date. One hundred twenty-seven CA-MSSA patients and 381 randomly selected uninfected controls were selected to match the 127 CA-MRSA cases. The adjusted odds ratio of injecting drug use compared with the CA-MSSA group was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.3) and 4.09 (95% CI, 2.2-7.5) compared with the uninfected group. We suggest that injecting drug use is a significant risk factor for CA-MRSA infection, which could contribute to the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA in an urban community.",M2
18044501,"Relative congener scaling of Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans to estimate building fire contributions in air, surface wipes, and dust samples.The United States Environmental Protection Agency collected ambient air samples in lower Manhattan for about 9 months following the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center (WTC) attacks. Measurements were made of a host of airborne contaminants including volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos, lead, and other contaminants of concern. The present study focuses on the broad class of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and dibenzofurans (CDFs) with specific emphasis on the 17 CDD/CDF congeners that exhibit mammalian toxicity. This work is a statistical study comparing the internal patterns of CDD/CDFs using data from an unambiguous fire event (WTC) and other data sets to help identify their sources. A subset of 29 samples all taken between September 16 and October 31, 2001 were treated as a basis set known to be heavily impacted by the WTC building fire source. A second basis set was created using data from Los Angeles and Oakland, <e>CA</e> as published by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and treated as the archetypical background pattern for CDD/CDFs. The CARB data had a congener profile appearing similar to background air samples from different locations in America and around the world and in different matrices, such as background soils. Such disparate data would normally be interpreted with a qualitative pattern recognition based on congener bar graphs or other forms of factor or cluster analysis that group similar samples together graphically. The procedure developed here employs aspects of those statistical methods to develop a single continuous output variable per sample. Specifically, a form of variance structure-based cluster analysis is used to group congeners within samples to reduce collinearity in the basis sets, new variables are created based on these groups, and multivariate regression is applied to the reduced variable set to determine a predictive equation. This equation predicts a value for an output variable, OPT: the predicted value of OPT is near zero (0.00) for a background congener profile and near one (1.00) forthe profile characterized by the WTC air profile. Although this empirical method is calibrated with relatively small sets of airborne samples, it is shown to be generalizable to other WTC, fire source, and background air samples as well as other sample matrices including soils, window films and other dust wipes, and bulk dusts. However, given the limited data set examined, the method does not allow further discrimination between the WTC data and the other fire sources. This type of analysis is demonstrated to be useful for complex trace-level data sets with limited data and some below-detection entries.",M2

17964310,"Is price a barrier to eating more fruits and vegetables for low-income families?OBJECTIVE: To determine if price is a barrier to fruit and vegetable consumption for low-income families by comparing the average cost of a market basket of fruits and vegetables from the Thrifty Food Plan and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (2005 Dietary Guidelines), investigating variations in price by neighborhood income and by type of supermarket, and estimating the influence of a 2005 Dietary Guidelines fruit and vegetable basket on the food budget of a low-income family. DESIGN: A market basket survey was conducted at 25 supermarkets across three time periods to allow for seasonal variation in produce prices. SETTING: Stores were selected from census tracts with a variety of income levels in Sacramento, <e>CA</e>, and Los Angeles, CA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The average cost of a Thrifty Food Plan and 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket for fruits and vegetables. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Student t tests were used to compare the mean cost of market baskets. RESULTS: The 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket cost 4% less than the Thrifty Food Plan (P&lt;0.001), and was significantly less expensive in low-income areas at 65 dollars (P&lt;0.05), and in bulk supermarkets at 59 dollars (P&lt;0.05). The 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket would require a low-income family to devote 43% to 70% of their food budget to fruits and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Public policies should examine ways to make fruits and vegetables more affordable to low-income families.",M2
17939516,"Nontarget effects of the mosquito adulticide pyrethrin applied aerially during a West Nile virus outbreak in an urban California environment.In August 2006, a pyrethrin insecticide synergized with piperonyl butoxide (EverGreen Crop Protection EC 60-6, McLaughlin Gormley King Company, Golden Valley, MN) was sprayed in ultralow volumes over the city of Davis, <e>CA</e>, by the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District to control mosquitoes transmitting West Nile virus. Concurrently, we evaluated the impact of the insecticide on nontarget arthropods by 1) comparing mortality of treatment and control groups of sentinel arthropods, and 2) measuring the diversity and abundance of dead arthropods found on treatment and control tarps placed on the ground. We found no effect of spraying on nontarget sentinel species including dragonflies (Sympetrum corruptum), spiders (Argiope aurantia), butterflies (Colias eurytheme), and honeybees (Apis mellifera). In contrast, significantly higher diversity and numbers of nontarget arthropods were found on ground tarps placed in sprayed versus unsprayed areas. All of the dead nontarget species were small-bodied arthropods as opposed to the large-bodied sentinels that were not affected. The mortality of sentinel mosquitoes placed at the same sites as the nontarget sentinels and ground tarps ranged from 0% to 100%. Dead mosquitoes were not found on the ground tarps. We conclude that aerial spraying with pyrethrins had no impact on the large-bodied arthropods placed in the spray zone, but did have a measurable impact on a wide range of small-bodied organisms.",M2
17922190,"Prevalence and correlates of lifetime disordered gambling in Cambodian refugees residing in Long Beach, <e>CA</e>.BACKGROUND: Research has suggested that disordered gambling is endemic to Cambodian refugees. Whereas earlier study of the prevalence and correlates of disordered gambling has relied on convenience sampling, this investigation used a subset of a sample representative of the largest Cambodian refugee community in the US. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews assessing gambling disorder were conducted with a subsample of persons (N = 127) participating in a broader study of the mental health of this community. RESULTS: 13.9% of participants met screening criteria for lifetime disordered gambling, in contrast to previous research suggesting that prevalence rates may exceed 70%. After adjusting for a range of covariates, breadth of trauma exposure and marital status emerged as significant predictors of disordered gambling. DISCUSSION: Given the myriad mental health challenges facing the Cambodian refugee community, these data indicate that scarce prevention and treatment resources may be more productively channeled toward addressing other mental health and social service needs.",M2

17867891,"Activated carbon amendment as a treatment for residual DDT in sediment from a superfund site in San Francisco Bay, Richmond, California, USA.Pesticide formulators formerly operating at Lauritzen Channel, a portion of San Francisco Bay near Richmond (<e>CA</e>, USA), caused contamination of sediment with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). The present study evaluated the distribution of residual DDT in channel sediment six years following extensive remedial dredging. High DDT concentrations (up to 252 mg/ kg) were found in Young Bay Mud sampled across the channel. Particle analyses showed most of the contamination is contained in the clay/silt sediment fraction, and desorption tests showed that availability is greater for DDT metabolites than parent DDT. The present study examined the feasibility of using activated carbon amendment to sequester DDT from sediment, including an evaluation of reactivated carbon as a less costly alternative to virgin activated carbons. Treatment success of activated carbon amendment to sediment collected from Lauritzen Channel was measured by reductions in aqueous equilibrium concentrations and uptake in semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs). Four different activated carbons were tested and, after one month of treatment with 3.2 weight % carbon, DDT aqueous equilibrium concentrations were reduced up to 83% and SPMD uptake was reduced up to 91%. Reactivated carbon was comparable with virgin carbons in all tests. Reduction in SPMD uptake of DDT by treatment with 3.2% reactivated carbon increased to 99% after 26 months of treatment. The effectiveness of activated carbon was dependent on the type, size, dose, and contact time. The results show the potential usefulness of activated carbon amendment as a follow-up remedial technology for management of residuals after dredging contaminated sediment.",M2

Fish collected from the three sites exhibited male-oriented sex ratios. With few exceptions, developmental stages, CF, and GSI of both genders and plasma Vtg concentrations of females were not significantly different in samples collected from different sites at the same sampling period. More advanced gonad developmental stages and higher plasma Vtg concentrations in females were observed in August, indicating the seasonality of the reproductive cycle for this species. Plasma Vtg concentrations in males were observed in all of the sampling sites with the highest prevalence at T11 relative to T1 and Dana Point. The Vtg expression in males from the three sampling sites indicated widespread exposure to estrogenic compounds in waters of coastal California. However, the histopathological and reproductive relevance of the responses appeared to be insignificant and may not affect the population in these locations.",M2
17695890,"Beach sands along the California coast are diffuse sources of fecal bacteria to coastal waters.Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are nearly ubiquitous in California (<e>CA</e>) beach sands. Sands were collected from 55 beaches along the CA coast. Ninety-one percent of the beaches had detectable enterococci (ENT) while 62% had detectable E. coli (EC) in their sands. The presence of a putative bacterial source (such as a river), the degree of wave shelter, and surrounding land use explained a significant (p &lt; 0.05) fraction of the variation in both ENT and EC densities between beaches. Sand characteristics including moisture content, organic carbon, and percentfines, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced only EC densities in beach sand. We assayed 34 of 163 sand samples for salmonellae, but did not detect this bacterial pathogen. The potential for FIB to be transported from the sand to sea was investigated at a single wave-sheltered beach with high densities of ENT in beach sand: Lovers Point, CA (LP). We collected samples of exposed and submerged sands as well as water over a 24 h period in order to compare the disappearance or appearance of ENT in sand and the water column. Exposed sands had significantly higher densities of ENT than submerged sands with the highest densities located near the high tide line. Water column ENT densities began low, increased sharply during the first flood tide and slowly decreased over the remainder of the study. During the first flood tide, the number of ENT that entered the water column was nearly equivalent to the number of ENT lost from exposed sands when they were submerged by seawater. The decrease in nearshore ENT concentrations after the initial influx can be explained by ENT die-off and dilution with clean ocean water. While some ENT in the water and sand at LP might be of human origin because they were positive for the esp gene, others lacked the esp gene and were therefore equivocal with respect to their origin. Follow-up sampling at LP revealed the presence of the human specific Bacteroides marker in water and sand.",M2
17686212,"Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections among HIV-infected persons.Community-acquired (<e>CA</e>) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates have rapidly increased in the general population; however, little data on recent incidence rates and risk factors of CA-MRSA infections among HIV patients appear in the literature. A retrospective study was conducted from 1993 through 2005 among patients at a large HIV clinic. Trends in CA-MRSA infection incidence rates, clinical characteristics and risk factors for CA-MRSA were evaluated. Seven percent of our cohort developed a CA-MRSA infection during the study period. The rate of CA-MRSA infections among HIV-infected population significantly increased since 2003, with an incidence of 40.3 cases/1000 person-years in 2005, which was 18-fold higher than the general population served at our facility. In all, 90% of infections were skin/soft tissue infections with a predilection for buttock or scrotal abscess formation; 21% of patients experienced a recurrent infection. Risk factors included a low CD4 count at the time of infection (odds ratio [OR] per 100 CD4 cells 0.84, P = 0.03), high maximum log(10) HIV viral load (OR 4.54, P&lt;0.001), recent use of beta-lactam antibiotics (OR 6.0 for receipt of two prescriptions, P&lt;0.001) and a history of syphilis (OR 4.55, P = 0.01). No patient receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis developed a CA-MRSA infection. Over the study period, CA-MRSA accounted for an increasing percentage of positive wound cultures and Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 37% and 65%, respectively, during 2005. In conclusion, CA-MRSA infections have rapidly increased among HIV-infected patients, a group which has a higher rate of these infections than the general population. Risk factors for CA-MRSA among HIV-infected patients include low current CD4 cell count, recent beta-lactam antibiotic use and potentially high-risk sexual activity as demonstrated by a history of syphilis infection.",M2

17608007,"Evaluations of the chemical mass balance method for determining contributions of gasoline and diesel exhaust to ambient carbonaceous aerosols.The US. Department of Energy Gasoline/Diesel PM Split Study was conducted to assess the sources of uncertainties in using an organic compound-based chemical mass balance receptor model to quantify the relative contributions of emissions from gasoline (or spark ignition [SI]) and diesel (or compression ignition [CI]) engines to ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in California's South Coast Air Basin (SOCAB). In this study, several groups worked cooperatively on source and ambient sample collection and quality assurance aspects of the study but worked independently to perform chemical analysis and source apportionment. Ambient sampling included daily 24-hr PM2.5 samples at two air quality-monitoring stations, several regional urban locations, and along freeway routes and surface streets with varying proportions of automobile and truck traffic. Diesel exhaust was the dominant source of total carbon (TC) and elemental carbon (EC) at the Azusa and downtown Los Angeles, <e>CA</e>, monitoring sites, but samples from the central part of the air basin showed nearly equal apportionments of CI and SI. CI apportionments to TC were mainly dependent on EC, which was sensitive to the analytical method used. Weekday contributions of CI exhaust were higher for Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE; 41+/-3.7%) than Speciation Trends Network (32+/-2.4%). EC had little effect on SI apportionment. SI apportionments were most sensitive to higher molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (indeno[123-cd]pyrene, benzo(ghi)perylene, and coronene) and several steranes and hopanes, which were associated mainly with high emitters. Apportionments were also sensitive to choice of source profiles. CI contributions varied from 30% to 60% of TC when using individual source profiles rather than the composites used in the final apportionments. The apportionment of SI vehicles varied from 1% to 12% of TC depending on the specific profile that was used. Up to 70% of organic carbon (OC) in the ambient samples collected at the two fixed monitoring sites could not be apportioned to directly emitted PM emissions.",M2

17593734,"Simultaneous measurement of the effective density and chemical composition of ambient aerosol particles.Simultaneous measurements of the effective density and chemical composition of individual ambient particles were made in Riverside, California by coupling a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) with an ultrafine aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UF-ATOFMS). In the summer, chemically diverse particle types (i.e., aged-OC, vanadium-OC-sulfate-nitrate, biomass) all had similar effective densities when measured during the same time period. This result suggests that during the summer study the majority of particle mass for the different particle types was dominated by secondary species (OC, sulfates, nitrates) of the same density, while only a small fraction of the total particle mass is accounted for by the primary particle cores. Also shown herein, the effective density is a dynamic characteristic of the Riverside, <e>CA</e> ambient aerosol, changing by as much as 40% within 16 h. During the summer measurement period, changes in the ambient atmospheric water content correlated with changes in the measured effective densities which ranged from approximately 1.0 to 1.5 g x cm(-3). This correlation is potentially due to evaporation of water from particles in the aerodynamic lens. In contrast, in the fall during a Santa Ana meteorological event, ambient particles with a mobility diameter of 450 nm showed three distinct effective densities, each related to a chemically unique particle class. Particles with effective densities of approximately 0.27 g x cm(-3), 0.87 g x cm(-3), and 0.93 g x cm(-3) were composed mostly of elemental carbon, lubricating oil, and aged organic carbon, respectively. It is interesting to contrast the seasonal differences where in the summer, particle density and mass were determined by high amounts of secondary species, whereas in the fall, relatively clean and dry Santa Ana conditions resulted in freshly emitted particles which retained their distinct source chemistries and densities.",M2

However, we demonstrate here that ant/penetratin fusion to CN27 compromised CaMKII-selectivity, by enhancing a previously unnoticed direct binding of CaM to ant/penetratin. In contrast to antCN27, the improved cell-penetrating inhibitor tatCN21 (5 mum) showed neither CaM binding nor inhibition of basal synaptic transmission. In vitro, tatCN21 inhibited stimulated and autonomous CaMKII activity with equal potency. In rat hippocampal slices, tatCN21 inhibited LTP induction, but not LTP maintenance. Correspondingly, tatCN21 also inhibited learning, but not memory storage or retrieval in a mouse in vivo model. Thus, CaMKII autonomy provides a short-term molecular memory that is important in the signal computation leading to memory formation, but is not required as long-term memory store.",M3
20554861,"Modulations of NeuroD activity contribute to the differential effects of morphine and fentanyl on dendritic spine stability.The cellular level of neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD) is modulated differentially by mu-opioid receptor agonists; fentanyl increases NeuroD level by reducing the amount of microRNA-190 (miR-190), an inhibitor of NeuroD expression, whereas morphine does not alter NeuroD level. In the current study, NeuroD activity was demonstrated to be also under agonist-dependent regulation. After 3 d of treatment, morphine and fentanyl decreased the activity of the <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha), which phosphorylates and activates NeuroD. Because NeuroD activity is determined by both the CaMKIIalpha activity and the cellular NeuroD level, the overall NeuroD activity was reduced by morphine, but maintained during fentanyl treatment. The differential effects of agonists on NeuroD activity were further confirmed by measuring the mRNA levels of four NeuroD downstream targets: doublecortin, Notch1, neurogenic differentiation 4, and Roundabout 1. Decreased dendritic spine stability and mu-opioid receptor signaling capability were also observed when NeuroD activity was attenuated by miR-190 overexpression or treatment with KN93, a CaMKIIalpha inhibitor. The decrease could be rescued by NeuroD overexpression, which restored NeuroD activity to the basal level. Furthermore, elevating NeuroD activity attenuated the morphine-induced decrease in dendritic spine stability. Therefore, by regulating NeuroD activity, mu-opioid receptor agonists modulate the stability of dendritic spines.",M3
20505089,"Parvalbumin deficiency and GABAergic dysfunction in mice lacking PGC-1alpha.The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a master regulator of metabolism in peripheral tissues, and it has been proposed that PGC-1alpha plays a similar role in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that PGC-1alpha is concentrated in GABAergic interneurons, so we investigated whether male and female PGC-1alpha -/- mice exhibit abnormalities in interneuron gene expression and/or function. We found a striking reduction in the expression of the <e>Ca</e>(2+)-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), but not other GABAergic markers, throughout the cerebrum in PGC-1alpha +/- and -/- mice. Furthermore, PGC-1alpha overexpression in cell culture was sufficient to robustly induce PV expression. Consistent with a reduction in PV rather than a loss of PV-expressing interneurons, spontaneous synaptic inhibition was not altered in PGC-1alpha -/- mice. However, evoked synaptic responses displayed less paired-pulse depression and dramatic facilitation in response to repetitive stimulation at the gamma frequency. PV transcript expression was also significantly reduced in retina and heart of PGC-1alpha -/- animals, suggesting that PGC-1alpha is required for proper expression of PV in multiple tissues. Together these findings indicate that PGC-1alpha is a novel regulator of interneuron gene expression and function and a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders associated with interneuron dysfunction.",M3

METHODS: Forty male SD rats were randomized into control, hyperlipemia+ CI (model), acupuncture I, and acupuncture II groups, with 10 cases in each. Hyperlipemia model was established by feeding the animals with high fat forage for 6 weeks and CI model established by occlusion of the unilateral middle cerebral artery. For rats of acupuncture I group, EA (1-3 mA, 15 Hz) was applied to bilateral  Sanyinjiao  (SP 6) and  Fenglong  (ST 40) for 20 min every time, once daily for 10 days before CI. For rats of both acupuncture I and II groups, after CI, EA was applied to SP 6, ST 40,  Baihui  (GV 20) and  Shuigou  (GV 26) were punctured with filiform needles and stimulated by twirled the needle with hand continuously for 1 min, once daily for 7 days. The apoptotic cells of hippocampal <e>CA</e> 3 area were displayed by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling) method. CB antibody staining with immunohistochemistry was used to show CB-positive cells which were observed by optic microscope. RESULTS: In comparison with control group, the percentage of apoptotic cells of the hippocampal CA 3 area in model group increased considerably (P &lt; 0.01), while the number of CB immunoreaction (IR)-positive cells in the same area decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with model group, the percentages of apoptotic cells of CA 3 area in acupuncture I and acupuncture II groups lowered remarkably (P &lt; 0.01), while the numbers of CB IR-positive cells in the later two groups increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01). The therapeutic effect of acupuncture I group was apparently superior to that of acupuncture II group in lowering the percentage of apoptotic cells and upregulating CB IR-positive cell number (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can effectively lessen neuronal apoptosis of the hippocampus CA 3 area which may be closely related to its effect in upregulating the expression of CB in hyperlipemia + CI rats. Moreover, the cerebral ischemia injury degree may be lightened by acupuncture-lowering hyperlipemia first.",M3
20458898,"[Effect of electroacupuncture on hippocampal LTP in Alzheimer' s disease rats induced by Abeta(25-35)]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture(EA) on the learning-memory ability in Alzheimer's disease(AD) rats. METHODS: Thirty SD rats were equally randomized into control, model and EA groups. AD model was established by injecting beta-amyloid (Abeta(25-35), 10 microg) into the bilateral dentate gyri of the hippocampal <e>CA</e> 1 area (AP--3.5 mm, ML +/- 2.0 mm, DV 2.7 mm). EA (4 Hz, 1-2 mA) was applied to  Baihui  (GV 20),  Dazhui  (GV 14), bilateral  Shenshu  (BL 23) and bilateral  Yongquan  (KI 1) for 30 min, once daily for 7 days. The learning-memory ability was detected by using step-down test. Long term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA 1 area was recorded by using tungsten microelectrodes after high frequency stimulation (HFS) conditioning of the cortical anterior perforated substance. RESULTS: In AD rats, the error number and total error time of step-down test were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), and the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), and the amplitude and area of population spikes (PS) at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min after high-frequency stimulation of the cortical anterior perforated substance lowered markedly in comparison with sham operation (control) group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). After EA treatment, the error number and total error time decreased significantly, the slope of EPSP, and the amplitude and area of PS from 30 min to 120 min after high-frequency stimulation increased considerably in comparison with model group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), suggesting an improvement of the synaptic transmission after EA. CONCLUSION: EA can improve AD rats' learning-memory ability and raise the slope of EPSP and the amplitude of PS, which may contribute to its effect in relieve symptoms of AD in clinic.",M3
20445048,"Coincidence detection and stress modulation of spike time-dependent long-term depression in the hippocampus.Associative long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus is a form of spike time-dependent synaptic plasticity that is induced by the asynchronous pairing of postsynaptic action potentials and EPSPs. Although metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and postsynaptic <e>Ca</e>(2+) signaling have been suggested to mediate associative LTD, mechanisms are unclear further downstream. Here we show that either mGluR1 or mGluR5 activation is necessary for LTD induction, which is therefore mediated by group I mGluRs. Inhibition of postsynaptic phospholipase C, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, and PKC prevents associative LTD. Activation of PKC by a phorbol ester causes a presynaptic potentiation of synaptic responses and facilitates LTD induction by a postsynaptic mechanism. Lithium, an inhibitor of the PKC pathway, inhibits LTD and the presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of the phorbol ester. Furthermore, LTD is sensitive to the postsynaptic application of synthetic peptides that inhibit the interaction of AMPA receptors with PDZ domains, suggesting an involvement of protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1)-mediated receptor endocytosis. Finally, enhanced PKC phosphorylation, induced by behavioral stress, is associated with enhanced LTD. Both increased PKC phosphorylation and stress-induced LTD facilitation can be reversed by lithium, indicating that this clinically used mood stabilizer may act on synaptic depression via PKC modulation. These data suggest that PKC mediates the expression of associative LTD via the PICK1-dependent internalization of AMPA receptors. Moreover, modulation of the PKC activity adjusts the set point for LTD induction in a behavior-dependent manner.",M3
20427664,"Aging-related gene expression in hippocampus proper compared with dentate gyrus is selectively associated with metabolic syndrome variables in rhesus monkeys.Age-dependent metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but it also confers major risk for impaired cognition in normal aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the specific pathways mediating MetS-brain interactions. Here, we performed the first studies quantitatively linking MetS variables to aging changes in brain genome-wide expression and mitochondrial function. In six young adult and six aging female rhesus monkeys, we analyzed gene expression in two major hippocampal subdivisions critical for memory/cognitive function [hippocampus proper, or cornu ammonis (<e>CA</e>), and dentate gyrus (DG)]. Genes that changed with aging [aging-related genes (ARGs)] were identified in each region. Serum variables reflecting insulin resistance and dyslipidemia were used to construct a quantitative MetS index (MSI). This MSI increased with age and correlated negatively with hippocampal mitochondrial function (state III oxidation). More than 2000 ARGs were identified in CA and/or DG, in approximately equal numbers, but substantially more ARGs in CA than in DG were correlated selectively with the MSI. Pathways represented by MSI-correlated ARGs were determined from the Gene Ontology Database and literature. In particular, upregulated CA ARGs representing glucocorticoid receptor (GR), chromatin assembly/histone acetyltransferase, and inflammatory/immune pathways were closely associated with the MSI. These results suggest a novel model in which MetS is associated with upregulation of hippocampal GR-dependent transcription and epigenetic coactivators, contributing to decreased mitochondrial function and brain energetic dysregulation. In turn, these MSI-associated neuroenergetic changes may promote inflammation, neuronal vulnerability, and risk of cognitive impairment/AD.",M3
20357104,"Different relationship of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to channel-interacting slots in controlling neurotransmission at cultured hippocampal synapses.Synaptic transmission at CNS synapses is often mediated by joint actions of multiple <e>Ca</e>(2+) channel subtypes, most prominently, P/Q- and N-type. We have proposed that P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels saturate type-preferring slots at presynaptic terminals, which impose a ceiling on the synaptic efficacy of the channels. To test for analogous interactions for presynaptic N-type Ca(2+) channels, we overexpressed their pore-forming Ca(V)2.2 subunit in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, recorded excitatory synaptic transmission from transfected cells, and dissected the contributions of N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels with subtype-specific blockers. Overexpression of Ca(V)2.2 did not increase the absolute size of the EPSC even though somatic N-type current was augmented by severalfold. Thus, the strength of neurotransmission is saturated with regard to levels of Ca(2+) channel expression for both N-type and P/Q-type channels. Overexpression of Ca(2+)-impermeable Ca(V)2.2 subunits decreased EPSC size, corroborating competition for channel slots. Striking asymmetries between N- and P/Q-type channels emerged when their relative contributions were compared with channel overexpression. Overexpressed N-type channels could competitively displace P/Q-type channels from P/Q-preferring slots and take over the role of supporting transmission. The converse was not found with overexpression of P/Q-type channels, regardless of their C-terminal domain. We interpret these findings in terms of two different kinds of presynaptic slots at excitatory synapses, one accepting N-type channels but rejecting P/Q-type (N(specific)) and the other preferring P/Q-type but also accepting N-type (PQ(preferring)). The interaction between channels and slots governs the respective contributions of multiple channel types to neurotransmission and, in turn, the ability of transmission to respond to various stimulus patterns and neuromodulators.",M3
20345908,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway in excitotoxic cell death following kainic acid-induced status epilepticus.Systemic injections of kainic acid (KA) cause epileptic seizures with delayed neuronal damage in the limbic system, particularly in the hippocampus. KA excitotoxicity activates complex signal transduction events that trigger apoptotic cell death. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays an important role in cell death, and the peptide D-JNKI1, a competitive JNK inhibitor, is a potent neuroprotective agent. To analyse the role of JNK and the effects of D-JNKI1 administration on excitotoxic neuronal death, we induced epileptic seizures by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of KA in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats; a group of rats received i.p. D-JNKI1 2 h after KA. KA caused massive cell death in the hippocampus: in Nissl-stained sections, stereological counts showed a significant decrease in neuronal density in all <e>CA</e> fields, both at 1 and 5 days after seizures, which was partially prevented by D-JNKI1 treatment. These results were confirmed by counts of degenerating neurons in CA3 in FluoroJade B-stained sections. Seizure activity also induced marked gliosis as observed with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry. We also analysed c-Jun activation as a target of JNK and central transcriptional effector in the adult rat brain following KA injection. Phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity was absent in the hippocampus of untreated animals, whereas strong nuclear neuronal labeling could be observed, starting from 3 h after KA administration, in microtubule-associated protein-2-positive neurons but not in GFAP-positive astrocytes. D-JNKI1 treatment also reduced the positivity for phospho-c-Jun in the hippocampus, thus confirming the specificity of the peptide in blocking JNK. Therefore, JNK is a promising target for blocking seizure-induced cell death.",M3
20304030,"MAP1B binds to the NMDA receptor subunit NR3A and affects NR3A protein concentrations.Incorporation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR3A into functional NMDARs results in reduced channel conductance and <e>Ca</e>(2+) permeability. To further investigate the function of NR3A, we have set out to characterize its intracellular binding partners. Here, we report a novel protein interaction between NR3A and microtubule associated-protein (MAP) 1B, which both are localized to dendritic shafts and filopodia. NR3A protein levels were increased in MAP1B deficient (-/-) mice, with a corresponding decrease in NR1 levels, but the fraction of filopodia immunoreactive for NR3A was equal in cells from -/- and wild type (WT) mice. NR3A has previously been shown to interact with another member of the MAP1 family, MAP1S. We showed that MAP1S binds to microtubules in a similar manner as MAP1B, and suggest that MAP1S and MAP1B both are involved in regulating trafficking of NR3A-containing NMDAR.",M3
20211153,"Hippocampal cell loss and propagation of abnormal discharges accompanied with the expression of tonic convulsion in the spontaneously epileptic rat.Spontaneously epileptic rats (SER) are double mutants with both tonic convulsion and absence-like seizures from the age of 8 weeks. Hippocampal CA3 neurons in SER display a long-lasting depolarizing shift accompanied by repetitive firing (attributed to abnormalities of the <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels) with a single stimulation of the mossy fibers. In the present investigation, we examined if the seizure discharges of SER were correlated with the hippocampal abnormality of SER using electrophysiological and histological methods. In CA1 neurons of seizure-susceptible mature SER, higher-voltage (&lt;8-11 V) stimulations induced a long depolarization shift (in 25% of neurons) with repetitive firing (in 12.5% of neurons). However, the tremor rat, one of the parent strains of SER, did not exhibit such abnormal firing in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The number of CA3 neurons in SER was significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower than that in tremor rats and Wistar rats, although no significant difference was established in the hilus. Sprouting of mossy fiber was observed in the dentate of mature SER; however, negligible staining was spotted in the dentate of both mature tremor and Wistar rats. Interestingly, expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor was higher in the hilus, CA3, and granular cell layer of dentate gyrus in SER than normal Wistar rats. The expression levels of TUNEL, bax, and Caspase-3 did not show significant changes between the SER and Wistar rats. SER exhibited hippocampal sclerosis-like changes which did not have enough potential for epileptogenesis. Repetitive tonic seizures and vulnerable CA3 neurons of SER could be involved in the induction of sclerosis-like changes in the hippocampus.",M3
20203201,"Impact of actin filament stabilization on adult hippocampal and olfactory bulb neurogenesis.Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for dynamic cellular processes. Decreased actin turnover and rigidity of cytoskeletal structures have been associated with aging and cell death. Gelsolin is a <e>Ca</e>(2+)-activated actin-severing protein that is widely expressed throughout the adult mammalian brain. Here, we used gelsolin-deficient (Gsn(-/-)) mice as a model system for actin filament stabilization. In Gsn(-/-) mice, emigration of newly generated cells from the subventricular zone into the olfactory bulb was slowed. In vitro, gelsolin deficiency did not affect proliferation or neuronal differentiation of adult neural progenitors cells (NPCs) but resulted in retarded migration. Surprisingly, hippocampal neurogenesis was robustly induced by gelsolin deficiency. The ability of NPCs to intrinsically sense excitatory activity and thereby implement coupling between network activity and neurogenesis has recently been established. Depolarization-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases and exocytotic neurotransmitter release were enhanced in Gsn(-/-) synaptosomes. Importantly, treatment of Gsn(-/-) synaptosomes with mycotoxin cytochalasin D, which, like gelsolin, produces actin disassembly, decreased enhanced Ca(2+) influx and subsequent exocytotic norepinephrine release to wild-type levels. Similarly, depolarization-induced glutamate release from Gsn(-/-) brain slices was increased. Furthermore, increased hippocampal neurogenesis in Gsn(-/-) mice was associated with a special microenvironment characterized by enhanced density of perfused vessels, increased regional cerebral blood flow, and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS-III) expression in hippocampus. Together, reduced filamentous actin turnover in presynaptic terminals causes increased Ca(2+) influx and, subsequently, elevated exocytotic neurotransmitter release acting on neural progenitors. Increased neurogenesis in Gsn(-/-) hippocampus is associated with a special vascular niche for neurogenesis.",M3
20188150,"Voltage-activated calcium channel expression profiles in mouse brain and cultured hippocampal neurons.The importance and diversity of calcium signaling in the brain is mirrored by the expression of a multitude of voltage-activated calcium channel (<e>Ca</e>(V)) isoforms. Whereas the overall distributions of alpha(1) subunits are well established, the expression patterns of distinct channel isoforms in specific brain regions and neurons, as well as those of the auxiliary beta and alpha(2)delta subunits are still incompletely characterized. Further it is unknown whether neuronal differentiation and activity induce changes of Ca(V) subunit composition. Here we combined absolute and relative quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to analyze mRNA expression of all high voltage-activated Ca(V) alpha(1) subunits and all beta and alpha(2)delta subunits. This allowed for the first time the direct comparison of complete Ca(V) expression profiles of mouse cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cultured hippocampal neurons. All brain regions expressed characteristic profiles of the full set of isoforms, except Ca(V)1.1 and Ca(V)1.4. In cortex development was accompanied by a general down regulation of alpha(1) and alpha(2)delta subunits and a shift from beta(1)/beta(3) to beta(2)/beta(4). The most abundant Ca(V) isoforms in cerebellum were Ca(V)2.1, beta(4), and alpha(2)delta-2, and in hippocampus Ca(V)2.3, beta(2), and alpha(2)delta-1. Interestingly, cultured hippocampal neurons also expressed the same Ca(V) complement as adult hippocampus. During differentiation specific Ca(V) isoforms experienced up- or down-regulation; however blocking electrical activity did not affect Ca(V) expression patterns. Correlation analysis of alpha(1), beta and alpha(2)delta subunit expression throughout all examined preparations revealed a strong preference of Ca(V)2.1 for beta(4) and alpha(2)delta-2 and vice versa, whereas the other alpha(1) isoforms were non-selectively expressed together with each of the other beta and alpha(2)delta isoforms. Together our results revealed a remarkably stable overall Ca(2+) channel complement as well as tissue specific differences in expression levels. Developmental changes are likely determined by an intrinsic program and not regulated by changes in neuronal activity.",M3
20170690,"Bidirectional synaptic plasticity in response to single or paired pulse activation of NMDA receptors.It is still incompletely known how NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) regulate bidirectional synaptic plasticity. We examined this issue by an experimental protocol in which paired pulse stimulation (PPS) with 50ms interstimulus interval and basal frequency of 0.1Hz was applied to CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices during low Mg(2+) perfusion. Under blockade of NMDA-Rs by AP5, PPS for 12-60min led to only a minor depression. In contrast, when PPS was applied in the absence of AP5, there was a prominent short-term potentiation (STP), mainly of AMPA-R mediated responses, with peak at 1min and lasting 10-15min. The STP was followed by a slowly developing long-term depression (LTD). Applying AP5 during the STP, converted it to a stable increase relative to the control pathway. Following peak STP, plasticity was controlled in a composite manner. Whereas the initial decay was counteracted by NMDA-R activation, the following LTD was dependent on such activation. Our data suggest that synaptic changes do not only depend on the instantaneous, NMDA-dependent <e>Ca</e>(2+) concentration in the dendritic spine, but are also influenced by prior induction events. In addition to NMDA-R driven processes, passive relaxation contributes to the synaptic plasticity and in some cases outbalances the active control.",M3
20130191,"12-Lipoxygenase regulates hippocampal long-term potentiation by modulating L-type Ca2+ channels.Although long-term potentiation (LTP) has been intensively studied, there is disagreement as to which molecules mediate and modulate LTP. This is partly attributable to the presence of mechanistically distinct forms of LTP that are induced by different patterns of stimulation and that depend on distinct <e>Ca</e>(2+) sources. Here, we report a novel role for the arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) in LTP at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses that is dependent on the pattern of tetanic stimulation. We find that 12-LO activity is required for the induction of LTP in response to a theta burst stimulation protocol that depends on Ca(2+) influx through both NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. In contrast, LTP induced by 100 Hz tetanic stimulation, which requires Ca(2+) influx through NMDA receptors but not L-type channels, does not require 12-LO. We find that 12-LO regulates LTP by enhancing postsynaptic somatodendritic Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels during theta burst stimulation, an action exerted via 12(S)-HPETE [12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-tetraenoic acid], a downstream metabolite of 12-LO. These results help define the role of a long-disputed signaling enzyme in LTP.",M3

METHODS: Twelve APP 695 V 717 I transgenic mice were randomly divided into model group and EA group; and other 6 negative transgenic mice (C 57 BL/6 J) were made up of normal control group. After 3 months treatment by EA (15 min per other day, 2 Hz/100 Hz, 3-4 mA) applied to  Baihui  (GV 20) and  Yongquan  (KI 1), the learning and memory ability of mice was measured by Lashley III water maze test, and the ultrastructural changes of hippocampal <e>CA</e> 1 region was observed by electronic microscopy. RESULTS: The swimming escape latency and the number of navigating errors (dead-end forward swimming) in model group were significantly longer and more than those in normal control group (P &lt; 0.05); and those in EA group were considerably shorter and fewer than those in model group (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting an improvement of learning-memory ability after EA. Comparison of the ultrastructure of the neurons in the hippocampal CA 1 region showed swelling of the mitochondria, broken or disappearance of the mitochondrial cristae, degeneration of the synapses, breakage and vague outline of the basement membrane of the blood capillaries in mice of model group; and basically distinct outline of the mitochondrial cristae and microvessels, and more synaptic vesicles in EA group. CONCLUSION: EA may effectively improve the learning-memory capacity of the APP transgenic AD mice and alleviate the pathological changes of neurons of the hippocampal CA 1 region, which may be one of the mechanisms underlying the improvement of AD by EA.",M3
20107062,"Acute dynamin inhibition dissects synaptic vesicle recycling pathways that drive spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission.Synapses maintain synchronous, asynchronous, and spontaneous forms of neurotransmission that are distinguished by their <e>Ca</e>(2+) dependence and time course. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these three forms of release, it remains unclear whether they originate from the same vesicle population or arise from distinct vesicle pools with diverse propensities for release. Here, we used a reversible inhibitor of dynamin, dynasore, to dissect the vesicle pool dynamics underlying the three forms of neurotransmitter release in hippocampal GABAergic inhibitory synapses. In dynasore, evoked synchronous release and asynchronous neurotransmission detected after activity showed marked and unrecoverable depression within seconds. In contrast, spontaneous release remained intact after intense stimulation in dynasore or during prolonged (approximately 1 h) application of dynasore at rest, suggesting that separate recycling pathways maintain evoked and spontaneous synaptic vesicle trafficking. In addition, simultaneous imaging of spectrally separable styryl dyes revealed that, in a given synapse, vesicles that recycle spontaneously and in response to activity do not mix. These findings suggest that evoked synchronous and asynchronous release originate from the same vesicle pool that recycles rapidly in a dynamin-dependent manner, whereas a distinct vesicle pool sustains spontaneous release independent of dynamin activation. This result lends additional support to the notion that synapses harbor distinct vesicle populations with divergent release properties that maintain independent forms of neurotransmission.",M3

20064552,"Differential expression of TRPM2 and TRPV4 channels and their potential role in oxidative stress-induced cell death in organotypic hippocampal culture.TRPM2 and TPPV4 channels, two members of TRP channel family, are known to be widely expressed in the brain but their exact expression pattern and function are not well understood. Due to their high <e>Ca</e>(2+) permeability and gating by reactive oxygen species (TRPM2), or cell swelling, low pH and high temperature (TRPV4), they are likely to be involved in cell damage associated with various brain pathologies. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of these channels and their potential role in oxidative stress-induced cell damage in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, a model that retains the complex interaction between neurons and astrocytes. Channel expression was confirmed with RT-PCR and western blotting, while immunocytochemistry demonstrated TRPM2 in CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons and TRPV4 in astrocytes. Oxidative stress induced by exogenous application of H(2)O(2) (600 microM) caused preferential damage of pyramidal neurons, while oxidative stress evoked with mercaptosuccinate (MCS; 400 microM) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 4 microM) mainly damaged astrocytes, as identified by propidium iodide fluorescence. Antioxidants (Trolox 500 microM; MitoE 2 microM) reduced both neuronal and astrocytic cell death. Blockers of TRPV4 channels (Gd(3+) 500 microM; Ruthenium red 1 microM) increased the viability of astrocytes following MCS or BSO treatments, consistent with the expression pattern of these channels. Blockers of TRPM2 channels clotrimazole (20 microM), N-(p-amylcinnomoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA, 25 microM) or flufenamic acid (FFA, 200 microM) failed to protect pyramidal neurons from damage caused by exogenous H(2)O(2), and increased damage of these neurons caused by MCS and BSO. The differential expression of stress-sensitive TRPM2 and TRPV4 channels in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes that show distinct differences in vulnerability to different forms of oxidative stress suggests the specific involvement of these channels in oxidative stress-induced cell damage. However, the exact relationship between TRPM2 channel activation and cell death still remains to be determined due to the lack of protective effects of TRPM2 channel blockers.",M3
20060899,"Lipid raft disruption protects mature neurons against amyloid oligomer toxicity.A specific neuronal vulnerability to amyloid protein toxicity may account for brain susceptibility to protein misfolding diseases. To investigate this issue, we compared the effects induced by oligomers from salmon calcitonin (sCTOs), a neurotoxic amyloid protein, on cells of different histogenesis: mature and immature primary hippocampal neurons, primary astrocytes, MG63 osteoblasts and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In mature neurons, sCTOs increased apoptosis and induced neuritic and synaptic damages similar to those caused by amyloid beta oligomers. Immature neurons and the other cell types showed no cytotoxicity. sCTOs caused cytosolic <e>Ca</e>(2+) rise in mature, but not in immature neurons and the other cell types. Comparison of plasma membrane lipid composition showed that mature neurons had the highest content in lipid rafts, suggesting a key role for them in neuronal vulnerability to sCTOs. Consistently, depletion in gangliosides protected against sCTO toxicity. We hypothesize that the high content in lipid rafts makes mature neurons especially vulnerable to amyloid proteins, as compared to other cell types; this may help explain why the brain is a target organ for amyloid-related diseases.",M3

20043003,"A sensitive period of mice inhibitory system to neonatal GABA enhancement by vigabatrin is brain region dependent.Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, have been associated with disturbances of the GABAergic system in the brain. We examined immediate and long-lasting influences of exposure to the GABA-potentiating drug vigabatrin (GVG) on the GABAergic system in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, before and during the developmental switch in GABA function (postnatal days P1-7 and P4-14). GVG induced a transient elevation of GABA levels. A feedback response to GABA enhancement was evident by a short-term decrease in glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and 67 levels. However, the number of GAD65/67-immunoreactive (IR) cells was greater in 2-week-old GVG-treated mice. A long-term increase in GAD65 and GAD67 levels was dependent on brain region and treatment period. Vesicular GABA transporter was insensitive to GVG. The overall effect of GVG on the Cl(-) co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2 was an enhancement of their synthesis, which was dependent on the treatment period and brain region studied. In addition, a short-term increase was followed by a long-term decrease in KCC2 oligomerization in the cell membrane of P4-14 hippocampi and cerebral cortices. Analysis of the <e>Ca</e>(2+) binding proteins expressed in subpopulations of GABAergic cells, parvalbumin and calbindin, showed region-specific effects of GVG during P4-14 on parvalbumin-IR cell density. Moreover, calbindin levels were elevated in GVG mice compared to controls during this period. Cumulatively, these results suggest a particular susceptibility of the hippocampus to GVG when exposed during days P4-14. In conclusion, our studies have identified modifications of key components in the inhibitory system during a critical developmental period. These findings provide novel insights into the deleterious consequences observed in children following prenatal and neonatal exposure to GABA-potentiating drugs.",M3
20018755,"Secretagogin is a Ca2+-binding protein specifying subpopulations of telencephalic neurons.The <e>Ca</e>(2+)-binding proteins (CBPs) parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin are phenotypic markers of terminally differentiated neurons in the adult brain. Although subtle phylogenetic variations in the neuronal distribution of these CBPs may occur, morphologically and functionally diverse subclasses of interneurons harbor these proteins in olfactory and corticolimbic areas. Secretagogin (scgn) is a recently cloned CBP from pancreatic beta and neuroendocrine cells. We hypothesized that scgn is expressed in the mammalian brain. We find that scgn is a marker of neuroblasts commuting in the rostral migratory stream. Terminally differentiated neurons in the olfactory bulb retain scgn expression, with scgn being present in periglomerular cells and granular layer interneurons. In the corticolimbic system, scgn identifies granule cells distributed along the dentate gyrus, indusium griseum, and anterior hippocampal continuation emphasizing the shared developmental origins, and cytoarchitectural and functional similarities of these neurons. We also uncover unexpected phylogenetic differences in scgn expression, since this CBP is restricted to primate cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. Overall, we characterize scgn as a neuron-specific CBP whose distribution identifies neuronal subtypes and hierarchical organizing principles in the mammalian brain.",M3
20018732,"Sigma-1 receptors regulate hippocampal dendritic spine formation via a free radical-sensitive mechanism involving Rac1xGTP pathway.Sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1Rs) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins known to be involved in learning and memory. Dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons play important roles in neuroplasticity and learning and memory. This study tested the hypothesis that Sig-1Rs might regulate denritic spine formation in hippocampal neurons and examined potential mechanisms therein. In rat hippocampal primary neurons, the knockdown of Sig-1Rs by siRNAs causes a deficit in the formation of dendritic spines that is unrelated to ER <e>Ca</e>(2+) signaling or apoptosis, but correlates with the mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome c release, followed by caspase-3 activation, Tiam1 cleavage, and a reduction in Rac1.GTP. Sig-1R-knockdown neurons contain higher levels of free radicals when compared to control neurons. The activation of superoxide dismutase or the application of the hydroxyl-free radical scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to the Sig-1R-knockdown neurons rescues dendritic spines and mitochondria from the deficits caused by Sig-1R siRNA. Further, the caspase-3-resistant TIAM1 construct C1199DN, a stable guanine exchange factor able to constitutively activate Rac1 in the form of Rac1.GTP, also reverses the siRNA-induced dendritic spine deficits. In addition, constitutively active Rac1.GTP reverses this deficit. These results implicate Sig-1Rs as endogenous regulators of hippopcampal dendritic spine formation and suggest a free radical-sensitive ER-mitochondrion-Rac1.GTP pathway in the regulation of dendritic spine formation in the hippocampus.",M3
19996312,"Reciprocal interactions regulate targeting of calcium channel beta subunits and membrane expression of alpha1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons.Auxiliary beta subunits modulate current properties and mediate the functional membrane expression of voltage-gated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels in heterologous cells. In brain, all four beta isoforms are widely expressed, yet little is known about their specific roles in neuronal functions. Here, we investigated the expression and targeting properties of beta subunits and their role in membrane expression of Ca(V)1.2 alpha(1) subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed equal expression, and immunofluorescence showed a similar distribution of all endogenous beta subunits throughout dendrites and axons. High resolution microscopy of hippocampal neurons transfected with six different V5 epitope-tagged beta subunits demonstrated that all beta subunits were able to accumulate in synaptic terminals and to colocalize with postsynaptic Ca(V)1.2, thus indicating a great promiscuity in alpha(1)-beta interactions. In contrast, restricted axonal targeting of beta(1) and weak colocalization of beta(4b) with Ca(V)1.2 indicated isoform-specific differences in local channel complex formation. Membrane expression of external hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Ca(V)1.2 was strongly enhanced by all beta subunits in an isoform-specific manner. Conversely, mutating the alpha-interaction domain of Ca(V)1.2 (W440A) abolished membrane expression and targeting into dendritic spines. This demonstrates that in neurons the interaction of a beta subunit with the alpha-interaction domain is absolutely essential for membrane expression of alpha(1) subunits, as well as for the subcellular localization of beta subunits, which by themselves possess little or no targeting properties.",M3
19968972,"Effect of 835 MHz radiofrequency radiation exposure on calcium binding proteins in the hippocampus of the mouse brain.Worldwide expansion of mobile phones and electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure has raised question of their possible biological effects on the brain and nervous system. Radiofrequency (RF) radiation might alter intracellular signaling pathways through changes in calcium (<e>Ca</e>(2+)) permeability across cell membranes. Changes in the expression of calcium binding proteins (CaBP) like calbindin D28-k (CB) and calretinin (CR) could indicate impaired Ca(2+)homeostasis due to EMF exposure. CB and CR expression were measured with immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus of mice after EMF exposure at 835 MHz for different exposure times and absorption rates, 1 h/day for 5 days at a specific absorption rate (SAR)=1.6 W/kg, 1 h/day for 5 days at SAR=4.0 W/kg, 5 h/day for 1 day at SAR=1.6 W/kg, 5 h/day for 1 day at SAR=4.0 W/kg, daily exposure for 1 month at SAR=1.6 W/kg. Body weights did not change significantly. CB immunoreactivity (IR) displayed moderate staining of cells in the cornu ammonis (CA) areas and prominently stained granule cells. CR IR revealed prominently stained pyramidal cells with dendrites running perpendicularly in the CA area. Exposure for 1 month produced almost complete loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 area. CaBP differences could cause changes in cellular Ca(2+)levels, which could have deleterious effect on normal hippocampal functions concerned with neuronal connectivity and integration.",M3
19963028,"Decreased kainate receptors in the hippocampus of apolipoprotein D knockout mice.Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) has many actions critical to maintaining mammalian CNS function. It is therefore significant that levels of ApoD have been shown to be altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia, suggesting a role for ApoD in the pathophysiology of the disorder. There is also a large body of evidence that cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems are affected by the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, we decided to use in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography to measure levels of ionotropic glutamate, some muscarinic and serotonin 2A receptors in the CNS of ApoD(-/-) and isogenic wild-type mice. These studies revealed a 20% decrease (mean+/-SEM: 104+/-10.2 vs. 130+/-10.4 fmol/mg ETE) in the density of kainate receptors in the <e>CA</e> 2-3 of the ApoD(-/-) mice. In addition there was a global decrease in AMPA receptors (F(1,214)=4.67, p&lt;0.05) and a global increase in muscarinic M2/M4 receptors (F(1,208)=22.77, p&lt;0.0001) in the ApoD(-/-) mice that did not reach significance in any single cytoarchitectural region. We conclude that glutamatergic pathways seem to be particularly affected in ApoD(-/-) mice and this may contribute to the changes in learning and memory, motor tasks and orientation-based tasks observed in these animals, all of which involve glutamatergic neurotransmission.",M3
19961834,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in TEA-induced long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the rat hippocampus.Gq-protein-coupled Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) reportedly activate phospholipase C (PLC), leading to <e>Ca</e>(2+) release from intracellular stores and the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG). We electrophysiologically examined the involvement of the Group I mGluR in tetraethylammonium (TEA)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in the rat hippocampus. TEA-induced LTP was almost completely blocked under the selective blockade of either mGluR1 or mGluR5, both of which are Group I mGluR. This result was supported by the blockade of TEA-induced LTP even in the absence of these blockers under low temperature conditions, in which the activation of Group I mGluR is thought not to be fully effective. In addition, the blockade of mGluR1 resulted in lower short-term potentiation (STP) during TEA application compared with the blockade of mGluR5. These results demonstrate the crucial roles of Group I mGluR in the TEA-induced LTP at MF-CA3 synapses and the different contributions of mGluR1 and mGluR5 to the initial component of plasticity.",M3

19917565,"Homeostasis of intrinsic excitability in hippocampal neurones: dynamics and mechanism of the response to chronic depolarization.In order to maintain stable functionality in the face of continually changing input, neurones in the CNS must dynamically modulate their electrical characteristics. It has been hypothesized that in order to retain stable network function, neurones possess homeostatic mechanisms which integrate activity levels and alter network and cellular properties in such a way as to counter long-term perturbations. Here we describe a simple model system where we investigate the effects of sustained neuronal depolarization, lasting up to several days, by exposing cultures of primary hippocampal pyramidal neurones to elevated concentrations (10-30 mm) of KCl. Following exposure to KCl, neurones exhibit lower input resistances and resting potentials, and require more current to be injected to evoke action potentials. This results in a rightward shift in the frequency-input current (FI) curve which is explained by a simple linear model of the subthreshold I-V relationship. No changes are observed in action potential profiles, nor in the membrane potential at which action potentials are evoked. Furthermore, following depolarization, an increase in subthreshold potassium conductance is observed which is accounted for within a biophysical model of the subthreshold I-V characteristics of neuronal membranes. The FI curve shift was blocked by the presence of the L-type <e>Ca</e>(2+) channel blocker nifedipine, whilst antagonism of NMDA receptors did not interfere with the effect. Finally, changes in the intrinsic properties of neurones are reversible following removal of the depolarizing stimulus. We suggest that this experimental system provides a convenient model of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability, and permits the study of temporal characteristics of homeostasis and its dependence on stimulus magnitude.",M3
19914894,"Hippocampal gamma oscillations in rats.Previous studies suggested that gamma oscillations in the brain are associated with higher order cognitive functions, including selective visual attention, motor task planning, sensory perception, working memory, and dreaming rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are mainly observed in the cortical regions and also occur in neocortical and subcortical areas and hippocampus. These oscillations may occur under certain pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, and are mainly observed in the cortical regions and hippocampus. The previous studies have suggested that epilepsy may be associated with disturbances of autonomic nervous system(ANS) and with changes in autonomic cardioregulatory function. In this article, we investigate the influence of acute exposure to 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB), a membrane-permeable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) receptor, and store-operated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channel (SOC) blocker on the complexity of hippocampal gamma oscillations. Our central hypothesis is that acute exposure to 2-APB significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations.

Our nonlinear dynamical analysis results estimated from brain-slice recordings suggested that 2-APB exposure significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations.",M3
19909283,"Positive allosteric activation of GABAA receptors bi-directionally modulates hippocampal glutamate plasticity and behaviour.Long-term BZ (benzodiazepine) anxiolytic therapy increases the risk of physical dependence manifested as withdrawal anxiety. BZ-induced potentiation of GABA(A)R (gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor) function by 1-week oral administration of FZP (flurazepam) bi-directionally modulates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons during drug withdrawal. Previous electrophysiological studies on acutely isolated and intact CA1 neurons, as well as immunofluorescence and post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy studies, suggest increased synaptic insertion of GluR (glutamate receptor) 2-lacking AMPARs (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors) in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Preliminary studies indicated a similar increase in GluR1, then phospho-Ser(831)-GluR1, as well as CaMKIIalpha (<e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha), but not phospho-Thr(286)-CaMKII levels at the same time point. In our studies, whole-cell recordings in hippocampal slices revealed that AMPAR mEPSC [miniature EPSC (excitatory postsynaptic current)] amplitude was increased in 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats followed by an increase in estimated single-channel conductance in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Enhanced conductance was no longer observed in slices pre-incubated for 2 h in the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analogue KN-92. To evaluate whether CaMKII-mediated AMPA potentiation could occlude LTP (long-term potentiation), LTP was induced by TBS (theta burst stimulation) and recorded using whole-cell and extracellular techniques. LTP was induced in both groups, but only maintained for &lt;15 min in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. LTP was fully restored after 7-day withdrawal. Despite the lack of LTP maintenance, impairment of object recognition, place and context was not observed in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Since L-VGCC (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) current density was doubled on drug withdrawal and up to 2 days, Ca(2+) entry through L-VGCCs and perhaps subsequently through Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs are proposed to be responsible for enhanced CaMKIIalpha levels and AMPAR potentiation. Mechanisms associated with several different models of activity-dependent plasticity may underlie BZ physical dependence.",M3
19861491,"Rapid endocytosis provides restricted somatic expression of a K+ channel in central neurons.Trafficking motifs present in the intracellular regions of ion channels affect their subcellular location within neurons. The mechanisms that control trafficking to dendrites of central neurons have been identified, but it is not fully understood how channels are localized to the soma. We have now identified a motif within the calcium-activated potassium channel K(<e>Ca</e>)2.1 (SK1) that results in somatic localization. Transfection of hippocampal neurons with K(Ca)2.1 subunits causes expression of functional channels in only the soma and proximal processes. By contrast, expressed K(Ca)2.3 subunits are located throughout the processes of transfected neurons. Point mutation of K(Ca)2.1 within this novel motif to mimic a sequence present in the C-terminus of K(Ca)2.3 causes expression of K(Ca)2.1 subunits throughout the processes. We also demonstrate that blocking of clathrin-mediated endocytosis causes K(Ca)2.1 subunit expression to mimic that of the mutated subunit. The role of this novel motif is therefore not to directly target trafficking of the channel to subcellular compartments, but to regulate channel location by subjecting it to rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",M3
19828810,"Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is associated with selective changes in calcineurin/NFAT signaling.Upon activation by calcineurin, the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates to the nucleus and guides the transcription of numerous molecules involved in inflammation and <e>Ca</e>(2+) dysregulation, both of which are prominent features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, NFAT signaling in AD remains relatively uninvestigated. Using isolated cytosolic and nuclear fractions prepared from rapid-autopsy postmortem human brain tissue, we show that NFATs 1 and 3 shifted to nuclear compartments in the hippocampus at different stages of neuropathology and cognitive decline, whereas NFAT2 remained unchanged. NFAT1 exhibited greater association with isolated nuclear fractions in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), whereas NFAT3 showed a strong nuclear bias in subjects with severe dementia and AD. Similar to NFAT1, calcineurin-Aalpha also exhibited a nuclear bias in the early stages of cognitive decline. But, unlike NFAT1 and similar to NFAT3, the nuclear bias for calcineurin became more pronounced as cognition worsened. Changes in calcineurin/NFAT3 were directly correlated to soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta((1-42))) levels in postmortem hippocampus, and oligomeric Abeta, in particular, robustly stimulated NFAT activation in primary rat astrocyte cultures. Oligomeric Abeta also caused a significant reduction in excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) protein levels in astrocyte cultures, which was blocked by NFAT inhibition. Moreover, inhibition of astrocytic NFAT activity in mixed cultures ameliorated Abeta-dependent elevations in glutamate and neuronal death. The results suggest that NFAT signaling is selectively altered in AD and may play an important role in driving Abeta-mediated neurodegeneration.",M3
19811616,"Nuclear localization of <e>Ca</e>(v)2.2 and its distribution in the mouse central nervous system, and changes in the hippocampus during and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.AIMS: To investigate the subcellular localization of Ca(v)2.2 calcium channel in the mouse central nervous system (CNS), and changes of Ca(v)2.2 at acute and chronic stages during and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE), in order to find out the roles it may play in epileptogenesis. METHODS: Combined immunocytochemistry at both light and electron microscopic levels with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cell transfection approach were used in this study. RESULTS: N-type calcium channel Ca(v)2.2 subunit was distributed in different regions of the mouse CNS. It was mainly localized in the nuclei in different types of neurones and in astrocytes. At acute stages during and after PISE, Ca(v)2.2 expression decreased in the stratum pyramidale of CA3 area and in the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus, but increased in the stratum lucidum of CA3 area and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. At chronic stage at 2 months after PISE, increased expression of Ca(v)2.2 in both the strata granulosum and molecular of the dentate gyrus was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ca(v)2.2 is a nuclear protein in neurones and astrocytes in the mouse CNS. Its translocation occurs at acute stages during and after PISE. The increased expression of Ca(v)2.2 in both the strata granulosum and moleculare of the dentate gyrus at chronic stage at 2 months after PISE may be involved in the occurrence of spontaneously recurrent seizures.",M3

Here we asked the question, whether and how these enzymes may become affected by single seizure activity. Male epilepsy-prone Krushinsky-Molodkina rats were exposed to single sound stimulation (80 dB, 12-15 kHz). Biochemical studies carried out two days after the sound exposure. Immunoblots of hippocampal and cortical (from sensomotor area) homogenates reacted with monoclonal antibodies to neurospecific alpha-subunit CaMKII showed an increased presence of this protein in seizured animals in comparison with naive controls. The level of the calcineurin catalytic subunit was increased in the hippocampus only. Additionally, studies of CaMKII activity revealed that the total enzyme activity from hippocampus and cortex of seizured rats was increased as compared with controls. However, it was no differences in functional (Ca(2+)-calmodulin-independent) CaMKII activity between experimental and control groups. It was suggested that observed long-lasting changes in rats brain induced by seizure activity may be a one in a number adaptative mechanisms against neuronal exitability.",M3
19777062,"Glutamate uptake triggers transporter-mediated GABA release from astrocytes.BACKGROUND: Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters play important roles in regulating neuronal activity. Glu is removed from the extracellular space dominantly by glial transporters. In contrast, GABA is mainly taken up by neurons. However, the glial GABA transporter subtypes share their localization with the Glu transporters and their expression is confined to the same subpopulation of astrocytes, raising the possibility of cooperation between Glu and GABA transport processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used diverse biological models both in vitro and in vivo to explore the interplay between these processes. We found that removal of Glu by astrocytic transporters triggers an elevation in the extracellular level of GABA. This coupling between excitatory and inhibitory signaling was found to be independent of Glu receptor-mediated depolarization, external presence of <e>Ca</e>(2+) and glutamate decarboxylase activity. It was abolished in the presence of non-transportable blockers of glial Glu or GABA transporters, suggesting that the concerted action of these transporters underlies the process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that activation of Glu transporters results in GABA release through reversal of glial GABA transporters. This transporter-mediated interplay represents a direct link between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission and may function as a negative feedback combating intense excitation in pathological conditions such as epilepsy or ischemia.",M3

METHODS: APP 695 V 717 I transgenic mice were randomly divided into model and EA groups, with 6 cases in each. The other 6 negatively-transgenic mice (C 57 BL/6 J) were used as the normal control group. EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 3 mA) was applied to  Baihui  (GV 20) and  Yongquan  (KI 1) for 15 min, once every other day for 3 months. The learning-memory ability of mice was measured by Y-type maze test and the expression levels of APP, Abeta, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the cerebral cotex and hippocampal CA 1 area were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In comparison with control group, the times of training for gaining correct reaction and the expression levels of Abeta and APP in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area in model group increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), while the expression level of ChAT of cerebral cortex in model group decreased considerably (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to model group, +he times of training for gaining correct reaction and the expression levels of APP in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area, and Abeta in CA 1 area of EA group lowered remarkably (P &lt; 0.05), while those of ChAT in cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area of EA group increased evidently (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can improve the learning-memory capacity of the APP transgenic mice, which may be related to its effects in increasing the production of acetylcholine and lowering the levels of APP and Abeta in the brain.",M3
19756023,"Minocycline reduces neuronal death and attenuates microglial response after pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest.The mechanisms leading to delayed neuronal death after asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA) in the developing brain are unknown. This study aimed at investigating the possible role of microglial activation in neuronal death in developing brain after ACA. Postnatal day-17 rats were subjected to 9 mins of ACA followed by resuscitation. Rats were randomized to treatment with minocycline, (90 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) or vehicle (saline, i.p.) at 1 h after return of spontaneous circulation. Thereafter, minocycline (22.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated every 12 h until sacrifice. Microglial activation (evaluated by immunohistochemistry using ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) antibody) coincided with DNA fragmentation and neurodegeneration in CA1 hippocampus and cortex (assessed by deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), Fluoro-Jade-B and Nissl stain). Minocycline significantly decreased both the microglial response and neuronal degeneration compared with the vehicle.

Minocycline attenuated ACA-induced increases in MIP-1alpha and RANTES (P&lt;0.05). These data show that microglial activation and cytokine production are increased in immature brain after ACA.

19753104,"Biphasic synaptic <e>Ca</e> influx arising from compartmentalized electrical signals in dendritic spines.Excitatory synapses on mammalian principal neurons are typically formed onto dendritic spines, which consist of a bulbous head separated from the parent dendrite by a thin neck. Although activation of voltage-gated channels in the spine and stimulus-evoked constriction of the spine neck can influence synaptic signals, the contribution of electrical filtering by the spine neck to basal synaptic transmission is largely unknown. Here we use spine and dendrite calcium (Ca) imaging combined with 2-photon laser photolysis of caged glutamate to assess the impact of electrical filtering imposed by the spine morphology on synaptic Ca transients. We find that in apical spines of CA1 hippocampal neurons, the spine neck creates a barrier to the propagation of current, which causes a voltage drop and results in spatially inhomogeneous activation of voltage-gated Ca channels (VGCCs) on a micron length scale. Furthermore, AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs and NMDARs, respectively) that are colocalized on individual spine heads interact to produce two kinetically and mechanistically distinct phases of synaptically evoked Ca influx. Rapid depolarization of the spine triggers a brief and large Ca current whose amplitude is regulated in a graded manner by the number of open AMPARs and whose duration is terminated by the opening of small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels. A slower phase of Ca influx is independent of AMPAR opening and is determined by the number of open NMDARs and the post-stimulus potential in the spine. Biphasic synaptic Ca influx only occurs when AMPARs and NMDARs are coactive within an individual spine. These results demonstrate that the morphology of dendritic spines endows associated synapses with specialized modes of signaling and permits the graded and independent control of multiple phases of synaptic Ca influx.",M3
19735288,"GABAergic interneurons targeting dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus.The dendrites of pyramidal cells are active compartments capable of independent computations, input/output transformation and synaptic plasticity. Pyramidal cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus receive 92% of their GABAergic input onto dendrites. How does this GABAergic input participate in dendritic computations of pyramidal cells? One key to understanding their contribution to dendritic computation lies in the timing of GABAergic input in relation to excitatory transmission, back-propagating action potentials, <e>Ca</e>(2+) spikes and subthreshold membrane dynamics. The issue is further complicated by the fact that dendritic GABAergic inputs originate from numerous distinct sources operating with different molecular machineries and innervating different subcellular domains of pyramidal cell dendrites. The GABAergic input from distinct sources is likely to contribute differentially to dendritic computations. In this review, I describe four groups of GABAergic interneuron according to their expression of parvalbumin, cholecystokinin, axonal arborization density and long-range projections. These four interneuron groups contain at least 12 distinct cell types, which innervate mainly or exclusively the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. Furthermore, I summarize the different spike timing of distinct interneuron types during gamma, theta and ripple oscillations in vivo, and I discuss some of the open questions on how GABAergic input modulates dendritic operations in CA1 pyramidal cells.",M3
19729001,"Dihydrotestosterone activates CREB signaling in cultured hippocampal neurons.Although androgens induce numerous actions in brain, relatively little is known about which cell signaling pathways androgens activate in neurons. Recent work in our laboratory showed that the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activate androgen receptor (AR)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling. Since the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a downstream effector of MAPK/ERK and androgens activate CREB in non-neuronal cells, we investigated whether androgens activate CREB signaling in neurons. First, we observed that DHT rapidly activates CREB in cultured hippocampal neurons, as evidenced by CREB phosphorylation. Further, we observed that DHT-induced CREB phosphorylation is AR-dependent, as it occurs in PC12 cells stably transfected with AR but in neither wild-type nor empty vector-transfected cells. Next, we sought to identify the signal transduction pathways upstream of CREB phosphorylation using pharmacological inhibitors. DHT-induced CREB phosphorylation in neurons was found to be dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC) signaling but independent of MAPK/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase A, and <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV. These results demonstrate that DHT induces PKC-dependent CREB signaling, which may contribute to androgen-mediated neural functions.",M3
19719810,"Parvalbumin-, calbindin-, and calretinin-immunoreactive hippocampal interneuron density in autism.BACKGROUND: There has been a long-standing interest in the possible role of the hippocampus in autism and both postmortem brain and neuroimaging studies have documented varying abnormalities in this limbic system structure. AIMS: This study investigates the density of subsets of hippocampal interneurons, immunostained with the calcium binding proteins, calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) to determine whether specific subpopulations of interneurons are impacted in autism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unbiased stereological techniques were used to quantify the neuronal density of these immunoreactive subpopulations of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) interneurons analyzed in the <e>CA</e> and subicular fields in postmortem brain material obtained from five autistic and five age-, gender- and postmortem interval-matched control cases. RESULTS: Results indicate a selective increase in the density of CB-immunoreactive interneurons in the dentate gyrus, an increase in CR-immunoreactive interneurons in area CA1, and an increase in PV-immunoreactive interneurons in areas CA1 and CA3 in the hippocampus of individuals with autism when compared with controls. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size is small, these findings suggest that GABAergic interneurons may represent a vulnerable target in the brains of individuals with autism, potentially impacting upon their key role in learning and information processing. These preliminary findings further suggest the need for future more expanded studies in a larger number of postmortem brain samples from cases of autism and controls.",M3
19679076,"Recruitment of N-Type <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels during LTP enhances low release efficacy of hippocampal CA1 perforant path synapses.The entorhinal cortex provides both direct and indirect inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons through the perforant path and Schaffer collateral synapses, respectively. Using both two-photon imaging of synaptic vesicle cycling and electrophysiological recordings, we found that the efficacy of transmitter release at perforant path synapses is lower than at Schaffer collateral inputs. This difference is due to the greater contribution to release by presynaptic N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels at the Schaffer collateral than perforant path synapses. Induction of long-term potentiation that depends on activation of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels enhances the low efficacy of release at perforant path synapses by increasing the contribution of N-type channels to exocytosis. This represents a previously uncharacterized presynaptic mechanism for fine-tuning release properties of distinct classes of synapses onto a common postsynaptic neuron and for regulating synaptic function during long-term synaptic plasticity.",M3
19657032,"Transient receptor potential canonical 5 channels activate Ca2+/calmodulin kinase Igamma to promote axon formation in hippocampal neurons.Functionality of neurons is dependent on their compartmentalized polarization of dendrites and an axon. The rapid and selective outgrowth of one neurite, relative to the others, to form the axon is critical in initiating neuronal polarity. Axonogenesis is regulated in part by an optimal intracellular calcium concentration. Our investigation of <e>Ca</e>(2+)-signaling pathways involved in axon formation using cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrates a role for Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase kinase (CaMKK) and its downstream target Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase I (CaMKI). Expression of constitutively active CaMKI induced formation of multiple axons, whereas blocking CaMKK or CaMKI activity with pharmacological, dominant-negative, or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) methods significantly inhibited axon formation. CaMKK signals via the gamma-isoform of CaMKI as shRNA to CaMKIgamma, but not the other CaMKI isoforms, inhibited axon formation. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type CaMKIgamma, but not a mutant incapable of membrane association, accelerated the rate of axon formation. Pharmacological or small interfering RNA inhibition of transient receptor potential canonical 5 (TRPC5) channels, which are present in developing axonal growth cones, suppressed CaMKK-mediated activation of CaMKIgamma as well as axon formation. We demonstrate using biochemical fractionation and immunocytochemistry that CaMKIgamma and TRPC5 colocalize to lipid rafts. These results are consistent with a model in which highly localized calcium influx through the TRPC5 channels activates CaMKK and CaMKIgamma, which subsequently promote axon formation.",M3
19657031,"Requirement for protein synthesis at developing synapses.Activity and protein synthesis act cooperatively to generate persistent changes in synaptic responses. This forms the basis for enduring memory in adults. Activity also shapes neural circuits developmentally, but whether protein synthesis plays a congruent function in this process is poorly understood. Here, we show that brief periods of global or local protein synthesis inhibition decrease the synaptic vesicles available for fusion and increase synapse elimination. <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a critical target; its levels are controlled by rapid turnover, and blocking its activity or knocking it down recapitulates the effects of protein synthesis inhibition. Mature presynaptic terminals show decreased sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibition, and resistance coincides with a developmental switch in regulation from CaMKII to PKA (protein kinase A). These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism regulating presynaptic activity and synapse elimination during development, and suggest that protein translation acts coordinately with activity to selectively stabilize appropriate synaptic interactions.",M3
19644042,"Neuroprotection by tosyl-polyamine derivatives through the inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors.Tosyl-polyamine derivatives such as N-{4-[4-(guanidinobutylamino)-butylamino]butyl}-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide trihydrochroride (TsHSPMG) have been found to strongly inhibit macroscopic currents through heteromeric N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B) and <e>Ca</e>(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (homomeric glutamate receptor 1) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes on voltage-clamp recording. In the present study, it was found that the inhibition of NMDA receptor activity induced by tosyl-polyamine derivatives was voltage-dependent. Some mutations located in the intracellular region of the channel pore, such as NR1 E621Q and NR2B W607L, reduced the inhibition by tosyl-polyamine derivatives, suggesting that tosyl-polyamine derivatives penetrate deeply into the channel pore of NMDA receptors. The neuroprotective effects of tosyl-polyamine derivatives against cell injury caused by NMDA were investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Addition of 1 microM TsHSPMG to medium ablated the neurotoxicity induced by NMDA, and a similar effect was observed with 30 microM memantine. The neuroprotective effects of tosyl-polyamine derivatives on NMDA-induced seizures in mice were also assayed. Intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of TsHSPMG (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg) decreased the seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of NMDA in mice. These findings indicate that tosyl-polyamine derivatives exhibit neuroprotective effects not only in primary cultured neurons but also in mice.",M3
19633704,"Functional analysis of calcium channel-mediated exocytosis in synaptic terminals by FM imaging technique.OBJECTIVE: Presynaptic voltage-gated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels mediate rapid Ca(2+) influx into the synaptic terminal which triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. The FM 1-43 dye was firstly introduced as a fluorescence probe by Betz and his colleagues in 1992, and has been used to monitor exocytosis, endocytosis and endosomal traffic in a variety of cell types. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of applying the FM 1-43 dye in the functional analysis of calcium channel-mediated exocytosis in synaptic terminals. METHODS: The hippocampi were isolated from embryos of pregnant rats, and hippocampal neurons were then transfected with Ds-Red conjugated plasmid. The neurons were then loaded with 8 micromol/L FM 1-43 and 47 mmol/L KCl for 90 s after transfection. After that, 90 mmol/L KCl was employed to induce FM dye destaining, which was recorded by FM imaging system. RESULTS: The neuron synaptic terminals of rat hippocampus could be effectively stained by the FM 1-43 dye. Besides, the destaining of the labeled neuron terminals was in accordance with the transmitter release, which could be blocked by the application of nifedipine (inhibitor for L-type calcium channel). CONCLUSION: The FM imaging technique is an advanced and effective method for analyzing synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, and can be applied in various synaptic functional studies.",M3
19632308,"Differential gene expression in the rat hippocampus during learning of an operant conditioning task.Changes in transcription levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB), Synapsin I, <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), c-jun and c-fos have been associated to several learning paradigms in different brain areas. In this study, we measured mRNA expression in the hippocampus by real time (RT)-PCR mRNA levels of BDNF, CREB, Synapsin I, CamKII, Arc, c-jun and c-fos, during learning and operant conditioning task. Experimental groups were as follows: control (C, the animals never left the bioterium), when the animals reached 50-65% of the expected response (Incompletely Trained, IT), when animals reached 100% of the expected response with a latency time lower than 5 s (Trained, Tr), Box Control of Incompletely Trained (BCIT), animals spent the same time as the IT in the operant conditioning box and Box Control of Trained (BCTr) animals spent the same time as the Tr in the operant conditioning box. All rats were killed at the same time by cervical dislocation 15 min after training and hippocampi were removed and processed. We found increments of mRNA levels of most genes (BDNF, CREB, Synapsin I, Arc, c-jun and c-fos) in IT and Tr groups compared to their box controls, but increments in Tr were smaller compared with IT. These results describe a differential gene expression in the rat hippocampus when the animals are learning and when animals have already learned. Taking together the results presented herein with the known functions of these genes, we propose a link between changes in gene expression in the hippocampus and different degrees of cellular activation and plasticity during learning of an operant conditioning task.",M3
19609731,"Interaction between <e>Ca</e>(v)2.1alpha (1) and CaMKII in Ca (v)2.1alpha (1) mutant mice, Rolling Nagoya.It has been reported earlier that interactions between Ca(v)2.1alpha(1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the presynaptic fraction and between the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and CaMKII in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction are important for neuronal function. Ca(v)2.1alpha(1), CaMKII, and NR2B are predominantly expressed in the hippocampus. To examine the above interactions and CaMKII activity in the hippocampal presynapse and PSD of Rolling Nagoya mice carrying a mutation in Ca(v)2.1alpha(1) subunit, we performed immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. In the presynapse, the interaction between Ca(v)2.1alpha(1) and CaMKII and the phosphorylation of CaMKII (at Thr286) and its substrate Synapsin I (at Ser603) were decreased in mutant mice compared to wild-type mice. In the PSD, a similar pattern was observed for the interaction between NR2B and CaMKII and the phosphorylation of CaMKII (at Thr286) and its substrate AMPA receptor subunit glutamate receptor 1 (at Ser831) between mutant and wild-type mice. Our data indicate that disruption of the interaction between Ca(v)2.1alpha(1) and CaMKII may down-regulate presynaptic CaMKII activity and that Rolling Nagoya mice would be a useful model for examining presynaptic function.",M3
19596850,"<e>Ca</e>(2+) signaling evoked by activation of Na(+) channels and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers is required for GABA-induced NG2 cell migration.NG2 cells originate from various brain regions and migrate to their destinations during early development. These cells express voltage-gated Na(+) channels but fail to produce typical action potentials. The physiological role of Na(+) channels in these cells is unclear. We found that GABA induces membrane depolarization and Ca(2+) elevation in NG2 cells, a process requiring activation of GABA(A) receptors, Na(+) channels, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs), but not Ca(2+) channels. We have identified a persistent Na(+) current in these cells that may underlie the GABA-induced pathway of prolonged Na(+) elevation, which in turn triggers Ca(2+) influx via NCXs. This unique Ca(2+) signaling pathway is further shown to be involved in the migration of NG2 cells. Thus, GABAergic signaling mediated by sequential activation of GABA(A) receptors, noninactivating Na(+) channels, and NCXs may play an important role in the development and function of NG2 glial cells in the brain.",M3
19596052,"Long-term green tea catechin administration prevents spatial learning and memory impairment in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 mice by decreasing Abeta1-42 oligomers and upregulating synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus.The senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) is characterized by early onset of learning and memory deficits along with spontaneous overproduction of soluble beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain. In our study, 4 month old male SAMP8 mice were orally administered 0.05% and 0.1% green tea catechins (GTC, w/v) in drinking water for 6 months. We found that a supplementation with 0.05% or 0.1% GTC prevented spatial learning and memory impairments of mice in the Morris water maze. Better performance of GTC-treated mice was associated with decreased levels of Abeta(1-42) oligomers in the hippocampus. The activity of the protein kinase A/cAMP-response element binding protein (PKA/CREB) pathway, one of the molecular targets of Abeta oligomers which is crucial for late long-term potentiation and long-term memory formation, was significantly increased after GTC administration. We also found that chronic 0.05% or 0.1% GTC consumption prevented the reductions of three representative proteins of synaptic function and synaptic structure, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) and <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). These results demonstrated that long-term 0.05% or 0.1% green tea catechin administration may prevent spatial learning and memory decline of SAMP8 mice by decreasing Abeta(1-42) oligomers and upregulating synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus.",M3
19587275,"Positive AMPA receptor modulation rapidly stimulates BDNF release and increases dendritic mRNA translation.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulates local dendritic mRNA translation and is involved in formation and consolidation of memory. 2H,3H,6aH-pyrrolidino[2'',1''-3',2']1,3-oxazino[6',5'-5,4]-benzo[e]1,4-dioxan-10-one (CX614), one of the best-studied positive AMPA receptor modulators (also known as ampakines), increases BDNF mRNA and protein and facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. Several other ampakines also improve performance in various behavioral and learning tasks. Since local dendritic protein synthesis has been implicated in LTP stabilization and in memory consolidation, this study investigated whether CX614 could influence synaptic plasticity by upregulating dendritic protein translation. CX614 treatment of primary neuronal cultures and acute hippocampal slices rapidly activated the translation machinery and increased local dendritic protein synthesis. CX614-induced activation of translation was blocked by K252a [(9S,10R,12R)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid methyl ester], CNQX, APV, and TTX, and was inhibited in the presence of an extracellular BDNF scavenger, TrkB-Fc. The acute effect of CX614 on translation was mediated by increased BDNF release as demonstrated with a BDNF scavenging assay using TrkB-Fc during CX614 treatment of cultured primary neurons and was blocked by nifedipine, ryanodine, and lack of extracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+) in acute hippocampal slices. Finally, CX614, like BDNF, rapidly increased dendritic translation of an exogenous translation reporter. Together, our results demonstrate that positive modulation of AMPA receptors rapidly stimulates dendritic translation, an effect mediated by BDNF secretion and TrkB receptor activation. They also suggest that increased BDNF secretion and stimulation of local protein synthesis contribute to the effects of ampakines on synaptic plasticity.",M3
19568478,"Enhancement of the function of rat serotonin and norepinephrine neurons by sustained vagus nerve stimulation.BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a recent intervention for treatment-resistant depression. Electrophysiological recordings in the rat brain showed that VNS increases the firing rate of norepinephrine (NE) neurons after 1 day of stimulation and that of serotonin (5-HT) neurons after 14 days. This study was conducted to further characterize these effects. METHODS: We implanted rats with a VNS electrode and stimulator. We used the selective noradrenergic toxin DSP-4 to lesion NE neurons of the locus coeruleus. We recorded dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons under chloral hydrate anesthesia. We recorded hippocampus <e>CA</e>(3) pyramidal neurons using 5-barreled iontophoretic pipettes. RESULTS: Analysis of a previously published data set revealed that VNS increased not only the spontaneous firing rates of NE neurons, but also the percentage of neurons firing in bursts. The enhancement of the 5-HT neuron firing rate by VNS was abolished by lesioning NE neurons. We found that VNS increased the degree of activation of postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on 5-HT neurons, probably through an increased release of endogenous NE. The tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the hippocampus was enhanced after 14 days of VNS, as with other antidepressant treatments. LIMITATIONS: Our study limitations include the fact that we turned off the stimulator during the electrophysiological recordings, which likely decreased the vagal tone to the brain. Also, we obtained the data while the animals were under anesthesia, therefore studies need to be carried out in unanesthetized rats to ascertain whether the anesthetic agent influenced the changes observed between control rats and those treated with VNS. CONCLUSION: Vagus nerve stimulation initially increases the firing activity and pattern of NE neurons and subsequently those of 5-HT neurons, presumably as a cascade effect via alpha(1)-postsynaptic adrenoceptors. To date, VNS appears to be a unique antidepressant treatment increasing 5-HT transmission and enhancing the firing activity of NE neurons. These effects could contribute to the effectiveness of VNS in treatment-resistant depression.",M3
19563781,"Non-fibrillar amyloid-beta peptide reduces NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, but not AMPA-induced neurotoxicity.Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is thought to be linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that Abeta has important physiological roles in addition to its pathological roles. We recently demonstrated that Abeta42 protects hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, but the relationship between Abeta42 assemblies and their neuroprotective effects remains largely unknown. In this study, we prepared non-fibrillar and fibrillar Abeta42 based on the results of the thioflavin T assay, Western blot analysis, and atomic force microscopy, and examined the effects of non-fibrillar and fibrillar Abeta42 on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Non-fibrillar Abeta42, but not fibrillar Abeta42, protected hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, non-fibrillar Abeta42 decreased both neurotoxicity and increases in the intracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+) concentration induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), but not by alpha-amino-3-hydrozy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA).

19544382,"Involvement of cathepsin B in the processing and secretion of interleukin-1beta in chromogranin A-stimulated microglia.Cathepsin B (CB) is a cysteine lysosomal protease implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases. Although it is now evident that caspase-1, an essential enzyme for maturation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), can be activated through the inflammasome, there is still evidence suggesting the existence of lysosomal-proinflammatory caspase pathways. In the present study, a marked induction of pro-IL-1beta, its processing to the mature form and secretion were observed in the primary cultured microglia prepared from wild-type mice after stimulation with chromogranin A (CGA). Although pro-IL-1beta also markedly increased in microglia prepared from CB-deficient mice, CB-deficiency abrogated the pro-IL-1beta processing. <e>CA</e>-074Me, a specific inhibitor for CB, inhibited the pro-IL-1beta maturation and its release from microglia. Furthermore, the caspase-1 activation was also inhibited by CA-074Me and E-64d, a broad cysteine protease inhibitor. After treatment with CGA, CB was markedly induced at both protein and mRNA levels. The induced pro-CB was rapidly processed to its mature form. The immunoreactivity for CB co-localized with both that for caspase-1 and the cleaved IL-1beta, in the acidic enlarged lysosomes. Inconsistent with these in vitro observations, the immunoreactivity for the cleaved IL-1beta was markedly observed in microglia of the hippocampus from aged wild-type but not CB-deficient mice. These observations strongly suggest that CB plays a key role in the pro-IL-1beta maturation through the caspase-1 activation in enlarged lysosomes of CGA-treated microglia. Therefore, either pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CB may provide therapeutic intervention in inflammation-associated neurological diseases.",M3
19539697,"Comparative roles of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and Ca2+-activated BK+ channels in posthypoxic hyperexcitability and rapid hypoxic preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro.The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative effects of glibenclamide (GC), a selective blocker of K(+)(ATP) channels, and iberiotoxin (IbTX), a selective blocker of BK(+)(<e>Ca</e>) channels, on the repeated brief hypoxia-induced posthypoxic hyperexcitability and rapid hypoxic preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. The method of field potentials measurement in CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices was used. In contrast to GC (10 microM), IbTX (10nM) significantly abolished both posthypoxic hyperexcitability and rapid hypoxic preconditioning induced by brief hypoxic episodes. These effects of IbTX did not depend on its ability to reduce the hypoxia-induced decrease of population spike (PS) amplitude during hypoxic episodes since GC (10 microM), comparatively with IbTX (10nM), significantly reduced the depressive effect of hypoxia on the PS amplitude during hypoxic episodes but did not abolish both posthypoxic hyperexcitability and rapid hypoxic preconditioning in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results indicated that BK(+)(Ca) channels, in comparison with K(+)(ATP) channels, play a more important role in such repeated brief hypoxia-induced forms of neuroplasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons as posthypoxic hyperexcitability and rapid hypoxic preconditioning.",M3

METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats were randomized into normal control group (n=10), model group (n=11) and EA group (n=11). Chronic depression model was established by lonely raising, and chronic unpredictable mild stress for 21 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to  Baihui  (GV 20) and  Sanyinjiao  (SP 6) for 20 minutes, once daily for 14 days. 5-HT and AChE expression of hippocampal <e>CA</e> 4 region was detected by using immunohistochemistry, and their integrated optical density (IOD) values were determined by using image analysis system. RESULTS: Compared with normal control group, IOD values of 5-HT and AChE immuno-reaction (IR) positive neurons in hippocampal CA 4 region of model group decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05). In comparison with model group, the IOD values of 5-HT and AChE IR positive neurons of CA 4 region in EA group increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found between EA and normal control groups in IOD values of both 5-HT and AChE IR positive neurons. CONCLUSION: EA can upregulate 5-HT and AChE expression in hippocampal CA 4 region in depression rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving depression.",M3
19526863,"[Morphological plasticity of hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro after short-term anoxia/hypoglycemia followed by reoxygenation]Oxygen and glucose are known to modulate the neuronal plasticity. Their fluctuations have ability to induce cell damage, the degree of which is thought to depend on the intensity and duration of pathological events. Experimental investigations have shown that a short-term anoxia-hypoglycemia results in delayed cell destruction through multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms and these processes are accompanied by certain morphological alterations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the neuronal, synaptic and glial plasticity in hippocampal <e>CA</e> I area after short-term (10 min) oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation during 1 h. The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slice cultures. We estimated the following parameters: viability and condensation of CA1 neurons, the number and volume of the simple and complex asymmetric synapses, postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness, total vesicle number and the state of vesicle pools, the glial volume contacted with CA1 synapses. It is revealed that 10 min OGD has no influence on cell viability and condensation but the synapse number and volume have the tendency for reduction. Though, we found some changes in synaptic remodeling (an increase in PSD thickness, a decrease in the total vesicle number and the density of the active and reserve vesicle pools) and significant increase of the glial volume contacted with CA1 synapses. Thus, it was assumed that the early structure changes could be the reason of the functional abnormality and tissue damage. Our data confirm also the glial ability to modulate the neuronal function.",M3
19493168,"Protein kinase C epsilon activation delays neuronal depolarization during cardiac arrest in the euthermic arctic ground squirrel.During the pre-hibernation season, arctic ground squirrels (AGS) can tolerate 8 min of asphyxial cardiac arrest (<e>CA</e>) without detectable brain pathology. Better understanding of the mechanisms regulating innate ischemia tolerance in AGS has the potential to facilitate the development of novel prophylactic agents to induce ischemic tolerance in patients at risk of stroke or CA. We hypothesized that neuroprotection in AGS involves robust maintenance of ion homeostasis similar to anoxia-tolerant turtles. Ion homeostasis was assessed by monitoring ischemic depolarization (ID) in cerebral cortex during CA in vivo and during oxygen glucose deprivation in vitro in acutely prepared hippocampal slices. In both models, the onset of ID was significantly delayed in AGS compared with rats. The epsilon protein kinase C (epsilonPKC) is a key mediator of neuroprotection and inhibits both Na+/K+-ATPase and voltage-gated sodium channels, primary mediators of the collapse of ion homeostasis during ischemia. The selective peptide inhibitor of epsilonPKC (epsilonV1-2) shortened the time to ID in brain slices from AGS but not in rats despite evidence that epsilonV1-2 decreased activation of epsilonPKC in brain slices from both rats and AGS. These results support the hypothesis that epsilonPKC activation delays the collapse of ion homeostasis during ischemia in AGS.",M3
19513994,"Growth cone-like waves transport actin and promote axonogenesis and neurite branching.Axonogenesis involves a shift from uniform delivery of materials to all neurites to preferential delivery to the putative axon, supporting its more rapid extension. Waves, growth cone-like structures that propagate down the length of neurites, were shown previously to correlate with neurite growth in dissociated cultured hippocampal neurons. Waves are similar to growth cones in their structure, composition and dynamics. Here, we report that waves form in all undifferentiated neurites, but occur more frequently in the future axon during initial neuronal polarization. Moreover, wave frequency and their impact on neurite growth are altered in neurons treated with stimuli that enhance axonogenesis. Coincident with wave arrival, growth cones enlarge and undergo a marked increase in dynamics. Through their engorgement of filopodia along the neurite shaft, waves can induce de novo neurite branching. Actin in waves maintains much of its cohesiveness during transport whereas actin in nonwave regions of the neurite rapidly diffuses as measured by live cell imaging of photoactivated GFP-actin and photoconversion of Dendra-actin. Thus, waves represent an alternative axonal transport mechanism for actin. Waves also occur in neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices where they propagate along neurites in the dentate gyrus and the <e>CA</e> regions and induce branching. Taken together, our results indicate that waves are physiologically relevant and contribute to axon growth and branching via the transport of actin and by increasing growth cone dynamics.",M3
19489004,"Dose-dependent long-term effects of Tat in the rat hippocampal formation: a design-based stereological study.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) is believed to play a critical role in mediating central nervous system (CNS) pathology in pediatric HIV-1 infection. Long-term neurotoxicity was investigated in a design-based stereology study following intrahippocampal injection of Tat on postnatal day (P)10, a time period that approximates the peak in the rats' rate of brain growth and mimics clinical HIV-1 CNS infection at labor/delivery. The goal was to examine the impact of P10 intrahippocampal Tat injection on the anatomy of the adult hippocampus (5 month) to gain a better understanding about how timing of infection influences the rate of progression of pediatric HIV-1 infection [cf. Fitting et al. (2008a) Hippocampus 18:135-147]. Male P10 Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally injected with vehicle or one of three different doses of Tat (5, 25, or 50 mug). Unbiased stereological estimates were used to quantify total neuron number (Nissl stain) in five major subregions of the rat hippocampus: granular layer (GL), hilus of the dentate gyrus (DGH), cornu ammonis fields (<e>CA</e>)2/3, CA1, and subiculum (SUB). Glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were quantified in the DGH and SUB. No significant reduction of neuron number was noted for any of the five hippocampal subregions, in contrast to the very prominent reductions reported when Tat was administered on P1 [Fitting et al. (2008a) Hippocampus 18:135-147]. However, for glial cells, the number of astrocytes in the DGH and SUB as well as the number of oligodendrocytes in the DGH were linear dose dependently increased as a function of dose of Tat. In conjunction with previous stereological research [Fitting et al., (2008a) Hippocampus 18:135-147], the present data suggest that variability in the progression of pediatric HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be better understood with the knowledge of the factor of timing of HIV-1 CNS infection.",M3

DCP-LA induced a transient huge facilitation of synaptic transmission monitored from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, which was largely inhibited by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. DCP-LA potentiated kainate-evoked whole-cell membrane currents for Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors composed of the GluR1, GluR3, GluR1/GluR2, GluR1/GluR3, and GluR1/GluR2/GluR3 subunits, and the potentiation was significantly inhibited by KN-93. A similar potentiation was still found with mutant GluR1 (S831A) receptor lacking CaMKII phosphorylation site. The GluR1 and GluR2 subunits formed AMPA receptors in the rat hippocampus, and DCP-LA increased expression of both the subunits on the plasma membrane. The DCP-LA action was blocked by KN-93 and the exocytosis inhibitor botulinum toxin type A, but not by the endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide. DCP-LA, thus, appears to activate CaMKII through PP-1 inhibition, that stimulates AMPA receptor exocytosis to increase expression of the receptors on the plasma membrane, responsible for potentiate AMPA receptor responses and facilitation of hippocampal synaptic transmission.",M3
19457080,"Nicotine-induced and depolarisation-induced glutamate release from hippocampus mossy fibre synaptosomes: two distinct mechanisms.Hippocampus mossy fibre terminals activate CA3 pyramidal neurons via two distinct mechanisms, both quantal and glutamatergic: (i) rapid excitatory transmission in response to afferent action potentials and (ii) delayed and prolonged release following nicotinic receptor activation. These processes were analysed here using rat hippocampus mossy fibres synaptosomes. The relationships between synaptosome depolarisation and glutamate release were established in response to high-KCl and gramicidin challenges. Half-maximal release corresponded to a 52 mV depolarisation step. KCl-induced release was accompanied by transient dissipation of the proton gradient across synaptic vesicle membrane. Nicotine elicited a substantial glutamate release from mossy fibre synaptosomes (EC(50) 3.14 microM; V(max) 12.01 +/- 2.1 nmol glutamate/mg protein; Hill's coefficient 0.99). However, nicotine-induced glutamate release was not accompanied by any change in the membrane potential or in the vesicular proton gradient. The effects of acetylcholine (200 microM) were similar to those of nicotine (25 microM). Nicotinic alpha7 receptors were evidenced by immuno-cytochemistry on the mossy fibre synaptosome plasma membrane. Therefore, the same terminals can release glutamate in response to two distinct stimuli: (i) rapid neurotransmission involving depolarisation-induced activation of voltage-gated <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels and (ii) a slower nicotinic activation which does not involve depolarisation or dissipation of the vesicular proton gradient.",M3
19466637,"Effect of prenatal exposure to mobile phone on pyramidal cell numbers in the mouse hippocampus: a stereological study.Because of the possible risk factor for the health, World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the study with animals on the developing nervous system concerning the exposure to radiofrequency (RF) field. A few studies related to hippocampal exposure are available, which indicate the impact of RF field in some parameters. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to mobile phone on developing hippocampus. Male and female Swiss albino mice were housed as control and mobile phone exposed groups. The pregnant animals in tested group were exposed to the effects of mobile phone in a room possessing the exposure system. The left hemispheres of the brains were processed by frozen microtome. The sections obtained were stained with Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin. For cell counting by the optical fractionator method, a pilot study was first performed. Hippocampal areas were analyzed using Axiovision software running on a personal computer. The optical dissector, systematically and randomly spaced, was focused to the widest profile of the pyramidal cell nucleus. No significant difference in pyramidal cell number of total Cornu Ammonis (<e>CA</e>) sectors of hippocampus was found between the control and the mobile phone exposed groups (p &gt; .05). It was concluded that further study is needed in this field due to popular use of mobile telephones and relatively high exposure to the developing brain.",M3
19437421,"KCa2 channels transiently downregulated during spatial learning and memory in rats.Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (K(<e>Ca</e>)2) are essential components involved in the modulation of neuronal excitability, underlying learning and memory. Recent evidence suggests that K(Ca)2 channel activity reduces synaptic transmission in a postsynaptic NMDA receptor-dependent manner and is modulated by long-term potentiation. We used radioactive in situ hybridization and apamin binding to investigate the amount of K(Ca)2 subunit mRNA and K(Ca)2 proteins in brain structures involved in learning and memory at different stages of a radial-arm maze task in naive, pseudoconditioned, and conditioned rats. We observed significant differences in K(Ca)2.2 and K(Ca)2.3, but not K(Ca)2.1 mRNA levels, between conditioned and pseudoconditioned rats. K(Ca)2.2 levels were transiently reduced in the dorsal CA fields of the hippocampus, whereas K(Ca)2.3 mRNA levels were reduced in the dorsal and ventral CA fields of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus in conditioned rats, during early stages of learning. Levels of apamin-binding sites displayed a similar pattern to K(Ca)2 mRNA levels during learning. Spatial learning performance was positively correlated with levels of apamin-binding sites and K(Ca)2.3 mRNA in the dorsal CA1 field and negatively correlated in the dorsal CA3 field. These findings suggest that K(Ca)2 channels are transiently downregulated in the early stages of learning and that regulation of K(Ca)2 channel levels is involved in the modification of neuronal substrates underlying new information acquisition.",M3
19437543,"Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling is essential for the development of the hippocampal formation and dentate gyrus.Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling in neuronal development was studied in mutant mice with blunted igf1r gene expression in nestin-expressing neuronal precursors. At birth [postnatal (P) day 0] brain weights were reduced to 37% and 56% of controls in mice homozygous (nes-igf1r(-/-)) and heterozygous (nes-igf1r(-/Wt)) for the null mutation, respectively, and this brain growth retardation persisted postnatally. Stereological analysis demonstrated that the volumes of the hippocampal formation, <e>CA</e> fields 1-3, dentate gyrus (DG), and DG granule cell layer (GCL) were decreased by 44-54% at P0 and further by 65-69% at P90 in nes-igf1r(-/Wt) mice. In nes-igf1r(-/-) mice, volumes were 29-31% of controls at P0 and, in the two mice that survived to P90, 6-19% of controls, although the hilus could not be identified. Neuron density did not differ among the mice at any age studied; therefore, decreased volumes were due to reduced cell number. In postnatal nes-igf1r(-/Wt) mice, the percentage of apoptotic cells, as judged by activated caspase-3 immunostaining, was increased by 3.5-5.3-fold. The total number of proliferating DG progenitors (labeled by BrdU incorporation and Ki67 staining) was reduced by approximately 50%, but the percentage of these cells was similar to the percentages in littermate controls. These findings suggest that 1) the postnatal reduction in DG size is due predominantly to cell death, pointing to the importance of the IGF1R in regulating postnatal apoptosis, 2) surviving DG progenitors remain capable of proliferation despite reduced IGF1R expression, and 3) IGF1R signaling is necessary for normal embryonic brain development.",M3
19430810,"H(2)O(2)-mediated modulation of cytosolic signaling and organelle function in rat hippocampus.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from (dys-)functioning mitochondria contribute to normal and pathophysiological cellular signaling by modulating cytosolic redox state and redox-sensitive proteins. To identify putative redox targets involved in such signaling, we exposed hippocampal neurons to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Redox-sensitive dyes indicated that externally applied H(2)O(2) may oxidize intracellular targets in cell cultures and acute tissue slices. In cultured neurons, H(2)O(2) (EC(50) 118 microM) induced an intracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+) rise which could still be evoked upon Ca(2+) withdrawal and mitochondrial uncoupling. It was, however, antagonized by thapsigargin, dantrolene, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and high levels of ryanodine, which identifies the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the intracellular Ca(2+) store involved. Intracellular accumulation of endogenously generated H(2)O(2)-provoked by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-also released Ca(2+) from the ER, as did extracellular generation of superoxide. Phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated metabotropic signaling was depressed in the presence of H(2)O(2), but cytosolic cyclic adenosine-5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels were not affected. H(2)O(2) (0.2-5 mM) moderately depolarized mitochondria, halted their intracellular trafficking in a Ca(2+)- and cAMP-independent manner, and directly oxidized cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH(2)). In part, the mitochondrial depolarization reflects uptake of Ca(2+) previously released from the ER. We conclude that H(2)O(2) releases Ca(2+) from the ER via both ryanodine and inositol trisphosphate receptors. Mitochondrial function is not markedly impaired even by millimolar concentrations of H(2)O(2). Such modulation of Ca(2+) signaling and organelle interaction by ROS affects the efficacy of PLC-mediated metabotropic signaling and may contribute to the adjustment of neuronal function to redox conditions and metabolic supply.",M3
19433577,"The glycine transport inhibitor sarcosine is an NMDA receptor co-agonist that differs from glycine.Sarcosine is an amino acid involved in one-carbon metabolism and a promising therapy for schizophrenia because it enhances NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function by inhibiting glycine uptake. The structural similarity between sarcosine and glycine led us to hypothesize that sarcosine is also an agonist like glycine. We examined this possibility using whole-cell recordings from cultured embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons. We found that sarcosine is an NMDAR co-agonist at the glycine binding site. However, sarcosine differed from glycine because less NMDAR desensitization occurred with sarcosine than with glycine as the co-agonist. This finding led us to examine whether the physiological effects of NMDAR activation with these two co-agonists are the same. The difference in desensitization probably accounts for rises in intracellular <e>Ca</e>(2+), as assessed by the fluorescent indicator fura-FF, being larger when NMDAR activation occurred with sarcosine than with glycine. In addition, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents following NMDAR activation were larger with sarcosine than with glycine. Compared to glycine, NMDAR-mediated autaptic currents decayed faster with sarcosine suggesting that NMDAR deactivation also differs with these two co-agonists. Despite these differences, NMDAR-dependent neuronal death as assessed by propidium iodide was similar with both co-agonists. The same was true for neuronal bursting. Thus, sarcosine may enhance NMDAR function by more than one mechanism and may have different effects from other NMDAR co-agonists.",M3
19429105,"Low-frequency stimulation of the hippocampal CA3 subfield is anti-epileptogenic and anti-ictogenic in rat amygdaloid kindling model of epilepsy.Neuromodulation with low-frequency stimulation (LFS), of brain structures other than epileptic foci, is effective in inhibiting seizures in animals and patients, whereas selection of targets for LFS requires further investigation. The hippocampal <e>CA</e>(3) subfield is a key site in the circuit of seizure generation and propagation. The present study aimed to illustrate the effects of LFS of the CA(3) region on seizure acquisition and generalization in the rat amygdaloid kindling model of epilepsy. We found that LFS (monophasic square-wave pulses, 1Hz, 100 microA and 0.1ms per pulse) of the CA(3) region significantly depressed the duration of epileptiform activity and seizure acquisition by retarding progression from focal to generalized seizures (GS). Moreover, GS duration was significantly shortened and its latency was significantly increased in the LFS group demonstrating an inhibition of the severity of GS and the spread of epileptiform activity. Furthermore, LFS prevented the decline of afterdischarge threshold (ADT) and elevated GS threshold indicating an inhibition of susceptibility to GS. These results suggest that LFS of the hippocampal CA(3) subfield is anti-epileptogenic and anti-ictogenic. Neuromodulation of CA(3) activity using LFS may be an alternative potential approach for temporal lobe epilepsy treatment.",M3
19430048,"Orexin-A induces long-term depression of nmda responses in <e>CA</e>-1 field of hippocampal slices.We have studied the effects of orexin-A on NMDA component of registered field potentials in pyramidal (str. pyramidale) and radial layers (st. radiatum) of CA-1 field of the hippocampus. To facilitate generation of NMDA responses in vitro experiments were performed in Mg(2+)- free solution. From field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was induced by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, NMDA component was isolated using modified physiological solution: bicuculline metiodide (20-40 microM) and CNQX (5 microM) were eddied for removing GABA-ergic inhibition and blocking AMPA-glutamatergic receptor-mediated responses, respectively. Application of orexin-A (100 nM, for 5 -15 min) evoked inhibition of NMDA component of population spike (84.4+/-5%, n=7) and long-term depression of isolated NMDA component of field EPSP, which was made up (77.7+/-2.8%, n=12) comparing with control after 45 min of orexin-A application. Orexin-A mediated depression starts after 7-10 min of application, which is sufficient for NE release from adrenergic terminals in the hippocampus. As the agonist of alpha-adrenoreceptors clonidine completely mimicked the effects of orexin-A possible involvement of adrenergic system of the brain in these effects are considered.",M3
19422887,"Intracranial self-stimulation to the lateral hypothalamus, a memory improving treatment, results in hippocampal changes in gene expression.Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) within the medial forebrain bundle of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) facilitates consolidation of implicit and explicit memories for a variety of learning paradigms in rats. However, the neural and molecular mechanisms involved in memory facilitation by ICSS are not known. Here, we investigated the influence of ICSS treatment on hippocampal gene expression in order to identify potential signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in ICSS-mediated cognitive improvements. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that ICSS caused a rapid induction of c-Fos expression in hippocampal cornu ammonis (<e>CA</e>) 3 and dentatus gyrus areas. Moreover, using microarray or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, we showed that ICSS modulates the expression of 62 hippocampal genes shortly after training. Most of the proteins encoded by these genes, such as calmodulin-dependent-phosphodiesterase 1 A (Pde1a), are part of signal transduction machineries or are related to anti-apoptosis, as heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (Hspa1a). Importantly, 10 of the regulated genes have been previously related with learning and memory or neural plasticity, including the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (Cart), adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (Adcyap1), serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (Sgk), Ret proto-oncogene (Ret), and Fos. The fact that the Fos gene was differentially expressed in our microarray experiments validated our findings from our immunohistochemical studies mentioned above. In addition, using quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed the observed expression changes for several of the genes identified by our microarray analyses. Our results suggest that ICSS may facilitate learning and memory by regulation of multiple signaling pathways in the hippocampus that may promote neuroplasticity.",M3
19426876,"Imaging axonal transport of mitochondria.Neuronal mitochondria need to be transported and distributed in axons and dendrites in order to ensure an adequate energy supply and provide sufficient <e>Ca</e>(2+) buffering in each portion of these highly extended cells. Errors in mitochondrial transport are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

19388897,"Isoflurane enhances spontaneous <e>Ca</e>(2+) oscillations in developing rat hippocampal neurons in vitro.BACKGROUND: During the nervous system development, spontaneous synchronized Ca(2+) oscillations are thought to possess integrative properties because their amplitude and frequency can influence the patterning of neuronal connection, neuronal differentiation, axon outgrowth, and long-distance wiring. Accumulating studies have confirmed that some drugs such as volatile anesthetic isoflurane produced histopathologic changes in the central nervous system in juvenile animal models. Because the hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory, the present work was designed to characterize the Ca(2+) oscillations regulated by volatile anesthetic isoflurane in primary cultures of developing hippocampal neurons (5-day-cultured). METHODS: Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (5-day-cultured) were loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4AM (4 microM) and were studied with a confocal laser microscope. RESULTS: Approximately 22% of 5-day-cultured hippocampal neurons exhibited typical Ca(2+) oscillations. These oscillations were dose-dependently enhanced by isoflurane (EC50 0.5 MAC, minimum alveolar concentration) and this effect could be reverted by bicuculline (50 microM), a specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist. CONCLUSION: Unlike its depressant effect on the Ca(2+) oscillations in adult neurons in previous researches, isoflurane dose-dependently enhanced calcium oscillations in developing hippocampal neurons by activating GABA(A) receptors, a major excitatory receptor in synergy with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors at the early stages of development. It may be involved in the mechanism of an isoflurane-induced neurotoxic effect in the developing rodent brain.",M3
19409206,"Long-term administration of green tea catechins prevents age-related spatial learning and memory decline in C57BL/6 J mice by regulating hippocampal cyclic amp-response element binding protein signaling cascade.Flavonoid-rich foods have been shown to be effective at reversing age-related deficits in learning and memory in both animals and humans. However, little investigation of the preventative effects of flavonoids on the naturally aged animals was reported. In our study, 14-month-old female C57BL/6 J mice were orally administered 0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% green tea catechins (GTC, w/v) in drinking water for 6 months; we found that a supplementation with 0.05% or 0.1% GTC prevented age-related spatial learning and memory decline of mice in the Morris water maze. Better performance of GTC-treated mice was associated with increased levels of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the hippocampus. The expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Bcl-2, two target genes of CREB which can exhibit long-term regulatory roles in synaptic plasticity and synaptic structure, were also increased. We also found that long-term 0.05% or 0.1% GTC administration prevented age-related reductions of two representative post-synaptic density proteins PSD95 and <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, suggesting that synaptic structural changes may be involved. These results demonstrated that long-term 0.05% or 0.1% green tea catechin administration may prevent age-related spatial learning and memory decline of female C57BL/6 J mice by regulating hippocampal CREB signaling cascade.",M3
19383493,"Profile of the new pyrrolidone derivative seletracetam (ucb 44212) in animal models of epilepsy.Seletracetam is a pyrrolidone derivative with a one-log-unit higher affinity for the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) than levetiracetam (Keppra). This study explored its anticonvulsant properties in animal models of epilepsy. Seletracetam reduced both the amplitude and repetitive firing of population spikes induced by a high K(+)/low <e>Ca</e>(2+) concentration fluid (HKLCF) in rat hippocampal slices. The reduction of HKLCF-induced increases in population spike amplitude was particularly pronounced, and occurred at approximately 10 times lower seletracetam concentrations than previously observed for levetiracetam. These invitro data suggest that desynchronisation of epileptiform activity may contribute significantly to the antiepileptic properties of seletracetam. Seletracetam also showed a potent anti-seizure activity in animal models mimicking partial-onset (kindled animals) and generalized epilepsy (audiogenic seizure susceptible mice and genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS)). In amygdala-kindled rats, seletracetam increased the generalized seizure threshold current and decreased the duration of the after-discharge and the seizure severity observed at the after-discharge threshold current, and generally had a much more potent effect than previously observed for levetiracetam. Seletracetam showed no psychomimetic effects and a very high central nervous system (CNS) tolerability in both kindled and GAERS rats, markedly superior to that of levetiracetam and other antiepileptic drugs. These results suggest that seletracetam may represent an effective and very well tolerated broad-spectrum agent for the symptomatic treatment of epilepsy.",M3
19386229,"Low molecular weight Abeta induces collapse of endoplasmic reticulum.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic multifunction organelle that is responsible for <e>Ca</e>(2+) homeostasis, protein folding, post-translational modification, protein degradation, and transportation of nascent proteins. Disruption of ER architecture might affect the normal physiology of the cell. In yeast, expansion of the ER is observed under unfolded protein response (UPR) and subsequently induces autophagy initiated from the ER. Here, we found that soluble low molecular weight of Abeta disrupted the anchoring between ER and microtubules (MT) and induced collapse of ER. In addition, it decreased the stability of MT. Subsequently, low molecular weight Abeta triggered autophagy and enhanced lysosomal degradation, as shown by electron microscopy and live-cell imaging. Dysfunction of ER can be further proved in postmortem AD brain and transgenic mice bearing APP Swedish mutation by immunohistochemical analysis of calreticulin. Treatment with Taxol, a MT-stabilizing agent, could partially inhibit collapse of the ER and induction of autophagy. The results show that Abeta-induced disruption of MT can affect the architecture of the ER. Collapse/aggregation of the ER may play an important role in Abeta peptide-triggered neurodegenerative processes.",M3
19376203,"Fatigue reversibly reduced cortical and hippocampal dendritic spines concurrent with compromise of motor endurance and spatial memory.Fatigue could be induced following forced exercise, sickness, heat stroke or sleep disturbance and impaired brain-related functions such as concentration, attention and memory. Here we investigated whether fatigue altered the dendrites of central neurons. Central fatigue was induced by housing rats in cage with 1.5-cm deep water for 1-5 days. Three days of sleep deprivation seriously compromised rats' performance in weight-loaded forced swimming and spatial learning tests, and 5 days of treatment worsened it further. Combinations of intracellular dye injection and three-dimensional analysis revealed that dendritic spines on retrograde tracer-identified corticospinal neurons and Cornu Ammonis (<e>CA</e>)1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons were significantly reduced while the shape or length of the dendritic arbors was not altered. Three days of rest restored the spine loss and the degraded spatial learning and weight-loaded forced swimming performances to control levels. In conclusion, although we could not rule out additional non-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress, the apparent fatigue induced following a few days of sleep deprivation could change brain structurally and functionally and the effects were reversible with a few days of rest.",M3
19382241,"Possible promotion of neuronal differentiation in fetal rat brain neural progenitor cells after sustained exposure to static magnetism.We have previously shown significant potentiation of <e>Ca</e>(2+) influx mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, along with decreased microtubules-associated protein-2 (MAP2) expression, in hippocampal neurons cultured under static magnetism without cell death. In this study, we investigated the effects of static magnetism on the functionality of neural progenitor cells endowed to proliferate for self-replication and differentiate into neuronal, astroglial, and oligodendroglial lineages. Neural progenitor cells were isolated from embryonic rat neocortex and hippocampus, followed by culture under static magnetism at 100 mT and subsequent determination of the number of cells immunoreactive for a marker protein of particular progeny lineages. Static magnetism not only significantly decreased proliferation of neural progenitor cells without affecting cell viability, but also promoted differentiation into cells immunoreactive for MAP2 with a concomitant decrease in that for an astroglial marker, irrespective of the presence of differentiation inducers. In neural progenitors cultured under static magnetism, a significant increase was seen in mRNA expression of several activator-type proneural genes, such as Mash1, Math1, and Math3, together with decreased mRNA expression of the repressor type Hes5. These results suggest that sustained static magnetism could suppress proliferation for self-renewal and facilitate differentiation into neurons through promoted expression of activator-type proneural genes by progenitor cells in fetal rat brain.",M3
19366611,"Adenine nucleotide translocator 1 deficiency increases resistance of mouse brain and neurons to excitotoxic insults.The mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocators (Ant) are bi-functional proteins that transport ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) which initiates apoptosis. The mouse has three Ant isoforms: Ant1 expressed in heart, muscle, and brain; Ant2 expressed in all tissues but muscle; and Ant4 expressed primarily in testis. Ant1-deficient mice manifest muscle and heart but not brain pathology. Brain Ant1 is induced by stress, while Ant2 is not. Ant1-deficient mice are resistant to death induced by systemic exposure to the brain excitotoxin, kainic acid (KA), and their hippocampal and cortical neurons are significantly more resistant to neuronal death induced by glutamate, KA, and etoposide. The mitochondrial membrane potential of Ant1-deficient brain mitochondria is increased and the mtPTP is more resistance to <e>Ca</e>(++) induced permeability transition. Hence, Ant1-deficiency may protect the brain from excitotoxicity by desensitizing the mtPTP and by blocking the pro-apoptotic induction of Ant1 by stress.",M3
19371576,"BDNF mediates the neuroprotective effects of positive AMPA receptor modulators against MPP+-induced toxicity in cultured hippocampal and mesencephalic slices.Neurotoxicity is involved in various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), which affects mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). Positive alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor modulators (PARMs, a.k.a. Ampakines, such as CX614) increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in vivo and in cultured hippocampal slices. BDNF is a survival factor for various neuronal cell types including mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Using cultured mesencephalic and hippocampal slices, we investigated whether preincubation with CX614 could provide neuroprotection against MPP(+) toxicity and whether such neuroprotection was mediated by BDNF. Various treatment protocols were tested to demonstrate CX614-induced neuroprotection against MPP(+). Pretreatment with CX614 significantly reduced MPP(+)-induced toxicity and increased BDNF levels in both hippocampal and mesencephalic cultured slices; CX614 pretreatment for 6 h in hippocampal slices and 24 h in mesencephalic slices was sufficient to produce significant neuroprotection as assessed with lactate dehydrogenase release in slice medium and propidium iodide uptake in slices. Both a BDNF scavenger and an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor TrkB, abrogated CX614-mediated reduction of MPP(+)-induced toxicity. Inhibition of <e>Ca</e>(2+)-activated proteases, calpains, was also protective against MPP(+)-induced toxicity. However, co-application of calpain inhibitor with CX614 abolished CX614-mediated protection, suggesting a dual action of calpains in this model. We conclude that CX614 is neuroprotective against MPP(+)-induced toxicity, an effect mediated by increased BDNF expression and activation of BDNF-dependent signaling pathways. Our results provide support for using PARMs as a new therapy for neurodegenerative disorders, including PD.",M3
19350220,"Toward an animal model of extinction-induced despair: focus on aging and physiological indices.Behaviors that are under the control of positive or negative reinforcers undergo extinction when the anticipated reward/reinforcer is withheld. Despair, an important symptom of environmentally determined depression in humans, can be generated by extinction, or the failure of expected reward to accrue. Although well known to clinicians dealing with depressive patients, an animal model has not been available for extinction-induced depression. We have made a beginning towards validating such a model, based on the extinction of negatively reinforced behavior in the rat, i.e., upon removal of the possibility to escape onto a safety platform in the water maze. As a marker for despair, we employed behavioral immobility, i.e., the cessation of swimming in the attempt to find safety from the water, presumably, a type of learned helplessness. This measure was sensitive to antidepressants and correlated with neurotransmitter contents, neurotrophins and hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis markers in selected sites of the brain. Given that some cases of depression in the elderly may be biologically distinct from others and from early-onset depression, and since particularly the aged are prone to experience extinction-induced despair, we compared aged (<e>ca</e>. 24 months old) animals with adults in most of our studies. We found a number of distinct differences in behavioral and biological measures, indicative of differences in propensity to, as well as response to, extinction-induced despair between aged and adults. Our results add to the body of evidence for differences in the neurobiological substrates of depressive disorders between aged and adults, with the implication for the requirement of different treatment strategies in these two populations.",M3
19357290,"Activity-dependent compartmentalized regulation of dendritic Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal interneurons.Activity-dependent regulation of synaptic inputs in neurons is controlled by highly compartmentalized and dynamic dendritic calcium signaling. Among multiple <e>Ca</e>(2+) mechanisms operating in neuronal dendrites, voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels (VSCCs) represent a major source of Ca(2+) influx; however, their use-dependent implication, regulation, and function in different types of central neurons remain widely unknown. Using two-photon microscopy to probe Ca(2+) signaling in dendrites of hippocampal oriens/alveus interneurons, we found that intense synaptic activity or local activation of mGluR5 induced long-lasting potentiation of action potential evoked Ca(2+) transients. This potentiation of dendritic Ca(2+) signaling required mGluR5-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release and PKC activation and was expressed as a selective compartmentalized potentiation of L-type VSCCs. Thus, in addition to mGluR1a-dependent synaptic plasticity, hippocampal interneurons in the feedback inhibitory circuit demonstrate a novel form of mGluR5-induced dendritic plasticity. Given an implication of L-type VSCCs in the induction of Hebbian LTP at interneuron excitatory synapses, their activity-dependent regulation may represent a powerful mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity.",M3
19321442,"PICK1-mediated glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) trafficking contributes to cell death in oxygen/glucose-deprived hippocampal neurons.Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) induces delayed cell death in hippocampal CA1 neurons via <e>Ca</e>(2+)/Zn(2+)-permeable, GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Following OGD, synaptic AMPAR currents in hippocampal neurons show marked inward rectification and increased sensitivity to channel blockers selective for GluR2-lacking AMPARs. This occurs via two mechanisms: a delayed down-regulation of GluR2 mRNA expression and a rapid internalization of GluR2-containing AMPARs during the OGD insult, which are replaced by GluR2-lacking receptors. The mechanisms that underlie this rapid change in subunit composition are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that this trafficking event shares features in common with events that mediate long term depression and long term potentiation and is initiated by the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors. Using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we show that peptides that interfere with PICK1 PDZ domain interactions block the OGD-induced switch in subunit composition, implicating PICK1 in restricting GluR2 from synapses during OGD. Furthermore, we show that GluR2-lacking AMPARs that arise at synapses during OGD as a result of PICK1 PDZ interactions are involved in OGD-induced delayed cell death. This work demonstrates that PICK1 plays a crucial role in the response to OGD that results in altered synaptic transmission and neuronal death and has implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell death during stroke.",M3
19339497,"Structural rearrangement of CaMKIIalpha catalytic domains encodes activation.At its fundamental level, human memory is thought to occur at individual synaptic contact sites and manifest as persistent changes in synaptic efficacy. In digital electronics, the fundamental structure for implementing memory is the flip-flop switch, a circuit that can be triggered to flip between two stable states. Recently, crystals of <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) catalytic domains, the enzymatic portion of a dodecameric holoenzyme involved in memory, were found to form dimers [Rosenberg OS, Deindl S, Sung RJ, Nairn AC, Kuriyan J (2005) Structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII and SAXS analysis of the holoenzyme. Cell 123:849-860]. Although the formation of dimers in the intact holoenzyme has not been established, several features of the crystal structure suggest that dimers could act as a synaptic switch. ATP-binding sites were occluded, and the T286 autophosphorylation site responsible for persistent kinase activation was buried. These features would act to stabilize an autoinhibited  paired -enzyme state. Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding was postulated to trigger the formation of an active state with unpaired catalytic domains. This conformation would allow ATP access and expose T286, autophosphorylation of which would act to maintain the  unpaired  conformation. We used fluorescence anisotropy and FRET imaging of Venus-tagged CaMKIIalpha to test the hypothesis that neuronal CaMKIIalpha can flip between two stable conformations in living cells. Our data support the existence of catalytic domain pairs, and glutamate receptor activation in neurons triggered an increase in anisotropy consistent with a structural transition from a paired to unpaired conformation.",M3
19289137,"Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is differentially influenced by two ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls in the hippocampal slice preparation.Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls impairs cognition and behavior in children. Two environmental PCBs 2,2',3,3',4,4',5-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB170) and 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB95) were examined in vitro for influences on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the CA1 region using a multi-electrode array. Perfusion with PCB170 (10 nM) had no effect on fEPSP slope relative to baseline period, whereas (100 nM) initially enhanced then depressed fEPSP slope. Perfusion of PCB95 (10 or 100 nM) persistently enhanced fEPSP slope &gt;200%, an effect that could be inhibited by dantrolene, a drug that attenuates ryanodine receptor signaling. Perfusion with picrotoxin (PTX) to block GABA neurotransmission resulted in a modest increase in fEPSP slope, whereas PTX+PCB170 (1-100 nM) persistently enhanced fEPSP slope in a dose dependent manner. fEPSP slope reached &gt;250% of baseline period in the presence of PTX+100 nM PCB170, conditions that evoked marked epileptiform after-potential discharges. PCB95 and PCB170 were found to differentially influence the <e>Ca</e>(2+)-dependence of [(3)H]ryanodine-binding to hippocampal ryanodine receptors. Non-coplanar PCB congeners can differentially alter neurotransmission in a manner suggesting they can elicit imbalances between inhibitory and excitatory circuits within the hippocampus. Differential sensitization of ryanodine receptors by Ca(2+) appears to mediate, at least in part, hippocampal excitotoxicity by non-coplanar PCBs.",M3
19295394,"Propofol and ketamine-induced anesthetic depth-dependent decrease of CaMKII phosphorylation levels in rat hippocampus and cortex.<e>Ca</e>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation through autophosphorylation at threonine 286 was involved in the modulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. Both propofol and ketamine may affect the intracellular Ca levels through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors or voltage-dependent Ca channels, but they have different mechanisms in general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of propofol and ketamine on CaMKII total protein and phosphorylation (p-CaMKII) levels in the brain of rats. We found that both propofol and ketamine could induce a decrease of p-CaMKII, not CaMKII total protein, in an anesthetic depth-dependent manner, whereas only ketamine caused a dose (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg)-dependent depression of p-CaMKII in hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats after intraperitoneal injections for 30 minutes. The significant depressions of p-CaMKII started at 5 minutes both in hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats after 100 mg/kg propofol treatment, whereas 100 mg/kg ketamine-induced significant depression of p-CaMKII initiated at 30 minutes in hippocampus and 5 minutes (no reduction observed at 15 min) in frontal cortex of rats. The maximum reduction of p-CaMKII with both drugs was at 60 minutes, and then restored to control level at 240 minutes. In addition, we confirmed the depression of p-CaMKII in hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats after 100 mg/kg of propofol or ketamine treatment for 60 minutes by using immunostaining. These results suggested that decreased p-CaMKII levels correlate with anesthetic depths achieved by propofol and ketamine, which may be related to the effects of propofol and ketamine on central nervous system function and their clinical effect.",M3
19288187,"Alterations induced by ischemic preconditioning on secretory pathways Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA) gene expression and oxidative damage after global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats.Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) represents the phenomenon of CNC adaptation, which results in increased tolerance of CNS to lethal ischemia. Brain ischemia/reperfusion (IRI) initiates a catastrophic cascade in which many subcellular organelles play an important role. The Golgi apparatus, which is a part of secretory pathways (SP), represents the <e>Ca</e>(2+) store and regulates secretion of proteins for growth/reorganization of neuronal circuit by secretory Ca(2+)ATPases (SPCA1). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of IRI and preconditioning on SPCA1 gene expression and oxidative damage after 4-vessel occlusion for 15 min and after being exposed to different reperfusion periods. Rats were preconditioned by 5 min of sub-lethal ischemia and 2 days later, 15 min of lethal ischemia was induced. Our experiments conclusively showed IRI-induced depression of SPCA activity and lipo- and protein oxidation in rat hippocampal membranes. IRI also activates the induction of SPCA1 gene expression in later reperfusion periods. IPC partially suppresses lipo- and protein oxidation in hippocampal membranes and leads to partiall rovery of the ischemic-induced depression of SPCA activity. In addition, IPC initiates earlier cellular response to the injury by the significant elevation of mRNA expression to 142% comparing to 1 h of corresponding reperfusion and to 11% comparing to 24 h of corresponding reperfusion, respectively. Similar patterns were observed on the translational level by Western blot analysis. Our results indicate the specific SPCA1 expression pattern in ischemic hippocampus. It also shows that the SPCA expression and the post-translational changes induced by ischemia are modulated by the IPC. This might serve to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the structural integrity and function of the SP after ischemic challenge. It also suggests that there is a correlation of SPCA function with the role of SP in the response to pre-ischemic challenge.",M3
19288901,"[Effect of acupuncture on long-term potentiation of hippocampal <e>CA</e> 1 area in diabetic rats with concurrent cerebral ischemia]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of manual acupuncture on long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA 1 area in hippocampal slices from rats suffered from diabetes mellitus (DM) and cerebral ischemia (CI). METHODS: A total of 54 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control (Con), CI, DM + Sham-CI, DM + CI and DM + CI + acupuncture (Acup). DM model was established by i.p. of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg), and CI model duplicated by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion and reperfusion.  Baihui  (GV 20), bilateral  Sanyinjiao  (SP 6) and  Pishu  (BL 20) or  Baihui  (GV 20), bilateral  Shenshu  (BL 23) and  Zusanli  (ST 36) were punctured alternatively and stimulated manually, once every other day for 15 times. Hippocampal slices were taken 40 days after modeling. LTP in hippocampal CA 1 induced by high frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 100 pulses) of Schaffer collaterals and population spikes (PS) were recorded by using glass micropipettes. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between DM + CI and normal control groups in the shape and amplitude of PS (P&gt;0.05). After stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, the amplitude and slope rate of PS in hippocampal CA 1 of DM + CI rats were decreased significantly in comparison with normal control group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). While compared with DM + CI group, both the amplitude and slope rate of PS in DM + CI + Acup group increased significantly (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), suggesting basic restoration of LTP after acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can promote the recovery of DM+CI induced decline of the amplitude and slope rate of PS, which may contribute to its effect in improving memory ability in DM + CI rats through regulating hippocampal neuronal synaptic plasticity.",M3
19272443,"Proteomic identification of carbonylated proteins in the monkey hippocampus after ischemia-reperfusion.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to participate in neurodegeneration after ischemia-reperfusion. With the aid of ROS, the calpain-induced lysosomal rupture provokes ischemic neuronal death in the cornu Ammonis (<e>CA</e>) 1 of the hippocampus; however, the target proteins of ROS still remain unknown. Here a proteomic analysis was done to identify and characterize ROS-induced carbonyl modification of proteins in the CA1 of the macaque monkey after transient whole-brain ischemia followed by reperfusion. We found that carbonyl modification of heat shock 70-kDa protein 1 (Hsp70-1), a major stress-inducible member of the Hsp70 family, was extensively increased before the neuronal death in the CA1 sector, and the carbonylation site was identified to be Arg469 of Hsp70-1. The CA1 neuronal death conceivably occurs by calpain-mediated cleavage of carbonylated Hsp70 that becomes prone to proteolysis with the resultant lysosomal rupture. In addition, the carbonyl levels of dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 isoform 2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and beta-actin were remarkably increased in the postischemic CA1. Therefore, ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative damage to these proteins in the CA1 may lead to loss of the neuroprotective function, which contributes to neuronal death.",M3
19279262,"Carbonic anhydrases CA4 and CA14 both enhance AE3-mediated Cl--HCO3- exchange in hippocampal neurons.Carbonic anhydrase (<e>CA</e>) activity in the brain extracellular space is attributable mainly to isoforms CA4 and CA14. In brain, these enzymes have been studied mostly in the context of buffering activity-dependent extracellular pH transients. Yet evidence from others has suggested that CA4 acts in a complex with anion exchangers (AEs) to facilitate Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchange in cotransfected cells. To investigate whether CA4 or CA14 plays such a role in hippocampal neurons, we studied NH(4)(+)-induced alkalinization of the cytosol, which is mitigated by Cl(-) entry and HCO(3)(-) exit. The NH(4)(+)-induced alkalinization was enhanced when the extracellular CAs were inhibited by the poorly permeant CA blocker, benzolamide, or by inhibitory antibodies specific for either CA4 or CA14. The NH(4)(+)-induced alkalinization was also increased with inhibition of anion exchange by 4,4*-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2*-disulfonic acid, or by eliminating Cl(-) from the medium. No effect of benzolamide was seen under these conditions, in which no Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchange was possible. Quantitative PCR on RNA from the neuronal cultures indicated that AE3 was the predominant AE isoform. Single-cell PCR also showed that Slc4a3 (AE3) transcripts were abundant in isolated neurons. In hippocampal neurons dissociated from AE3-null mice, the NH(4)(+)-induced alkalinization was much larger than that seen in neurons from wild-type mice, suggesting little or no Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchange in the absence of AE3. Benzolamide had no effect on the NH(4)(+)-induced alkalinization in the AE3 knock-out neurons. Our results indicate that CA4 and CA14 both play important roles in the regulation of intracellular pH in hippocampal neurons, by facilitating AE3-mediated Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchange.",M3
19261885,"Synaptically released zinc triggers metabotropic signaling via a zinc-sensing receptor in the hippocampus.Zn(2+) is coreleased with glutamate from mossy fiber terminals and can influence synaptic function. Here, we demonstrate that synaptically released Zn(2+) activates a selective postsynaptic Zn(2+)-sensing receptor (ZnR) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. ZnR activation induced intracellular release of <e>Ca</e>(2+), as well as phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase and Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II. Blockade of synaptic transmission by tetrodotoxin or CdCl inhibited the ZnR-mediated Ca(2+) rises. The responses mediated by ZnR were largely attenuated by the extracellular Zn(2+) chelator, CaEDTA, and in slices from mice lacking vesicular Zn(2+), suggesting that synaptically released Zn(2+) triggers the metabotropic activity. Knockdown of the expression of the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) attenuated ZnR activity in a neuronal cell line. Importantly, we observed widespread GPR39 labeling in CA3 neurons, suggesting a role for this receptor in mediating ZnR signaling in the hippocampus. Our results describe a unique role for synaptic Zn(2+) acting as the physiological ligand of a metabotropic receptor and provide a novel pathway by which synaptic Zn(2+) can regulate neuronal function.",M3
19272431,"Prenatal exposure to heroin in mice elicits memory deficits that can be attributed to neuronal apoptosis.Maternal heroin abuse has been shown to result in teratogenic neurobehavioral defects in the offspring, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study was designed to explore the role of neuronal apoptosis in the heroin-induced neurobehavioral defects of learning and memory. Pregnant BALB/c mice were treated with either heroin or saline. The animals in the heroin group received heroin subcutaneously at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day on embryonic days (E) 9-18, while those in the saline group were treated as drug-naive. Offspring were grouped as prenatal heroin exposure (HER), prenatal saline exposure (SAL), and control (CON) groups, according to the maternal treatment regimen. Some of the mice were killed and their hippocampus harvested on postnatal day (P) 14, and the tissue subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to reveal the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax. The Morris water maze was applied to assess the learning and memory capability of the mice at P30; poor maze performances were observed for the animals in the HER group. The results also showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-3 and Bax were significantly increased, while that of Bcl-2 was markedly decreased in the HER group compared with both the SAL and CON groups. The immunohistochemistry revealed significant caspase-3 immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis (<e>CA</e>) 1 subareas of the hippocampal formation, whereas, no significant changes were seen in subarea CA3. These findings suggest that prenatal heroin exposure during the E9-18 period enhances neuronal apoptosis by altering the expressions of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in the mouse hippocampus, and leads to impairment in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.",M3
19233146,"Improvement of depressive behaviors by nefiracetam is associated with activation of CaM kinases in olfactory bulbectomized mice.Olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice exhibit depressive-like behaviors as assessed by the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST). Interestingly, chronic intraperitoneal administration (1 mg/kg/day) of nefiracetam (DM-9384), a prototype cognitive enhancer, significantly improved depressive-like behaviors as well as spatial reference memory assessed by Y-maze task. As previously reported (Moriguchi, S., Han, F., Nakagawasai, O., Tadano, T., Fukunaga, K., 2006. Decreased calcium/calmoculin-dependent protein kinase II and protein kinase C activities mediate impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation in the olfactory bulbectomized mice. J. Neurochem. 97, 22-29), decreased activities of <e>Ca</e>(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala were observed in OBX mice. Nefiracetam treatment (1 mg/kg/day) significantly elevated CaMKII but not ERK activities in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 regions. In addition, we found an elevation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampal CA1 region. Increased CREB phosphorylation was associated with activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV as well as CaMKII in these regions. Taken together, in addition to CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV activation mediated by nefiracetam treatment might mediate CREB phosphorylation following chronic nefiracetam treatment, thereby eliciting an anti-depressive and cognition-enhancing effect on OBX mice.",M3
19247238,"The effect of diabetes mellitus on active avoidance learning in rats: the role of nitric oxide.BACKGROUND: Growing data report memory and other cognitive problems among individuals with diabetes mellitus. Nitric oxide may play a key role in many physiological and pathological situations. The aim was to investigate the role of NO in diabetes-induced changes in learning and lipid peroxidation. MATERIAL/METHODS: Six groups of 10 rats each were formed: control (C), diabetic (D), control+L-arginine (<e>CA</e>), diabetic+L-arginine (DA), control+L-NAME (CN), and diabetic+L-NAME (DN) groups. Experimental diabetes mellitus was induced by injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). 160 mg/kg/day L-arginine or 10 mg/kg/day L-NAME were injected intraperitoneally to the relevant groups for eight weeks. Active avoidance behavior was studied in the middle of the eighth week using an automated shuttle box. Brain and hippocampal nitrite levels were measured by a fluorometric method. TBARS levels were measured fluorometrically using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as a standard. RESULTS: The active avoidance training indicated that diabetes was associated with learning impairment. Administration of L-NAME and L-arginine significantly impaired active avoidance performance compared with the control group. They also decreased glucose level in group DA compared with the diabetic group. Brain nitrite level was significantly different in the diabetic group; hippocampus nitrite level tended to be lower in the L-NAME groups than the diabetic and control groups, although L-arginine increased hippocampal and brain nitrite values in the CA group compared with control groups. Brain and hippocampal TBARS levels were significantly higher in diabetic than in control rats. CONCLUSIONS: Imbalance related to nitric oxide production may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.",M3
19230827,"900 MHz electromagnetic field exposure affects qualitative and quantitative features of hippocampal pyramidal cells in the adult female rat.The effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by mobile phones on humans hold special interest due to their use in close proximity to the brain. The current study investigated the number of pyramidal cells in the cornu ammonis (<e>CA</e>) of the 16-week-old female rat hippocampus following postnatal exposure to a 900 megahertz (MHz) EMF. In this study were three groups of 6 rats: control (Cont), sham exposed (Sham), and EMF exposed (EMF). EMF group rats were exposed to 900 MHz EMF (1 h/day for 28 days) in an exposure tube. Sham group was placed in the exposure tube but not exposed to EMF (1 h/day for 28 days). Cont group was not placed into the exposure tube nor were they exposed to EMF during the study period. In EMF group rats, the specific energy absorption rate (SAR) varied between 0.016 (whole body) and 2 W/kg (locally in the head). All of the rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment and the number of pyramidal cells in the CA was estimated using the optical fractionator technique. Histopathological evaluations were made on sections of the CA region of the hippocampus. Results showed that postnatal EMF exposure caused a significant decrease of the pyramidal cell number in the CA of the EMF group (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, cell loss can be seen in the CA region of EMF group even at qualitative observation. These results may encourage researchers to evaluate the chronic effects of 900 MHz EMF on teenagers' brains.",M3
19230830,"Selective alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation regulates glycogen synthase kinase3beta and decreases tau phosphorylation in vivo.The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays an important role in cognitive processes and has generated recent interest as a potential drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The property of <e>Ca</e>(2+) permeation associated with alpha7 nAChR agonism may lead to Ca(2+)-dependent intracellular signaling that contribute to the procognitive and neuroprotective effects that have been described with this pharmacology. In this study, we investigated whether alpha7 nAChR agonism leads to increased phosphorylation of the inhibitory regulating amino acid residue Ser-9 on GSK3beta, a major kinase responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation in AD neuropathology. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the selective alpha7 agonist A-582941 increased S(9)-GSK3beta phosphorylation in mouse cingulate cortex and hippocampus that was not observed in alpha7 nAChR knock-out mice. A-582941 steady state exposure through continuous (2 wk) infusion also increased S(9)-GSK3beta phosphorylation in the hippocampus of Tg2576 (APP), as well as wild-type mice. Moreover, A-582941 continuous infusion decreased phosphorylation of tau in hippocampal CA3 Mossy fibers and spinal motoneurons in a hypothermia-induced tau hyperphosphorylation mouse model and AD double transgenic APP/tau mouse line, respectively. These studies demonstrate that inactivation of GSK3beta may be associated with alpha7 nAChR-induced signaling leading to attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation, raising the intriguing possibility that alpha7 nAChR agonism may have disease modifying benefit in the treatment of tauopathies, in particular AD.",M3
20392087,"Biogeochemical controls on PCB deposition in Hudson Bay.PCB concentrations, congener patterns, and fluxes were examined in 13 dated and organically characterized (C, N, delta(13)C, delta(15)N) marine sediment cores from Hudson Bay, Canada, to investigate the importance of organic matter (OM) supply and transport to PCB sequestration. Drawdown of PCBs, supported by marine primary production, is reflected in elevated summation operatorPCB concentrations and more highly chlorinated PCB signatures in surface sediments underlying eutrophic regions. Sediments in oligotrophic regions, which are dominated by  old  marine OM, have lower PCB concentrations and weathered signatures. For the surface of Hudson Bay, average atmospheric deposition appears to be very low (<e>ca</e>. 1.4 pg summation operatorPCBs cm(-2) a(-1)) compared to fluxes reported for nearby lakes (ca. 44 pg summation operatorPCBs cm(-2) a(-1)). (210)Pb fails to provide a means to normalize the fluxes, highlighting important differences in the biocycling of (210)Pb and PCBs. Unlike (210)Pb, atmospheric PCB exchange with the water's surface is partially forced by the aquatic organic carbon cycle. The extremely low atmospheric deposition of PCBs to the surface of Hudson Bay is likely a reflection of the Bay's exceptionally low productivity and vertical carbon fluxes. If future marine production and vertical flux of carbon increase due to loss of ice cover or change in river input as consequences of global warming, PCB deposition would also increase.",M4
19217373,"Heterosynaptic molecular dynamics: locally induced propagating synaptic accumulation of CaM kinase II.Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key mediator of synaptic plasticity and learning. Global pyramidal cell glutamate stimulation induces translocation of CaMKII from dendritic shafts to spines. Here we show that local dendritic stimulation by puffing glutamate onto a region containing 7-32 synapses induces translocation of CaMKII to synapses initially at the puff site but that translocation subsequently spreads within dendrites to the distal dendrite arbor, resulting in a persistent, widespread synaptic accumulation. This locally induced propagating synaptic (L-IPS) accumulation of CaMKII requires activation of NMDA receptors and L-type <e>Ca</e>(2+) channels and is preceded by a Ca(2+) spike. L-IPS translocation of CaMKII alters biochemical signaling and is associated with an increase in AMPA receptor GluR1 at both stimulated and nonstimulated synapses and thus provides a molecular mechanism for heterosynaptic plasticity.",M3

20352133,"End-of-life planning in heart failure: it should be the end of the beginning.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a chronic, progressive, incurable condition characterized by periods of apparent stability interspersed with acute exacerbations. Despite many important advances in its treatment, approximately one-third of deaths in Canada each year result from CVD. While this might lead one to assume that a comprehensive medical approach exists to the management of this inevitable outcome, the reality is much different. The current Canadian medical model emphasizes the management of acute exacerbations of CVD during which end-of-life issues figure frequently and prominently, although in a setting that is inappropriate to address the comprehensive needs of patients and their families.As a result, end-of-life care was made a theme of the recently reported Canadian Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan (www.chhs-scsc.<e>ca</e>). From this, several recommendations are made, central to which is the need to reframe CVD as a condition ideally suited to a chronic disease management approach. In addition, replacement of the term 'palliative care' with the term 'end-of-life planning and care' is proposed to foster earlier and more integrated comprehensive care, which, it is proposed, denotes the provision of advanced care planning, palliative care, hospice care and advanced directives, with a focus on decision making and planning. Finally, end-of-life planning and care should be a routine part of assessment of any patient with CVD, should be reassessed whenever important clinical changes occur and should be provided in a manner consistent with relevant CVD practice guidelines. Specifically, a Canadian strategy to improve end-of-life planning and care should focus on the following: * Integrated end-of-life planning and care across the health care system; * Facilitated communication and seamless care provision across all providers involved in end-of-life planning and care; * Adequate resources in the community for end-of-life planning and care; * Specialized training in sensitive communication and supportive care as part of core training for all members of the interdisciplinary care team; * Measurement of key performance indicators for end-of-life planning and care; and * Research into effective end-of-life planning and care.Heart failure is an advanced form of CVD with very high morbidity, mortality and burden of care, making it an ideal condition for implementation and testing of interventions to improve end-of-life planning and care.",M4

20103543,"Anesthesia-related cardiac arrest in children with heart disease: data from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest (POCA) registry.BACKGROUND: From 1994 to 2005, the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry collected data on 373 anesthesia-related cardiac arrests (<e>CAs</e>) in children, 34% of whom had congenital or acquired heart disease (HD). METHODS: Nearly 80 North American institutions that provide anesthesia for children voluntarily enrolled in the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry. A standardized data form for each perioperative CA in children 18 years old or younger was submitted anonymously. We analyzed causes of and outcomes from anesthesia-related CA in children with and without HD. RESULTS: Compared with the 245 children without HD, the 127 children with HD who arrested were sicker (92% vs 62% ASA physical status III-V; P &lt; 0.01) and more likely to arrest from cardiovascular causes (50% vs 38%; P = 0.03), although often the exact cardiovascular cause of arrest could not be determined. Mortality was higher in patients with HD (33%) than those without HD (23%, P = 0.048) but did not differ when adjusted for ASA physical status classification. More than half (54%) of the CA in patients with HD were reported from the general operating room compared with 26% from the cardiac operating room and 17% from the catheterization laboratory. The most common category of HD lesion in patients suffering CA was single ventricle (n = 24). At the time of CA, most patients with congenital HD were either unrepaired (59%) or palliated (26%). Arrests in patients with aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy were associated with the highest mortality rates (62% and 50%, respectively), although statistical comparison was precluded by small sample size for some HD lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Children with HD were sicker compared with those without HD at the time of anesthesia-related CA and had a higher mortality after arrest. These arrests were reported most frequently from the general operating room and were likely to be from cardiovascular causes. The identification of causes of and factors relating to anesthesia-related CA suggests possible strategies for prevention.",M4
19840421,"Assessing dietary intake in a population undergoing a rapid transition in diet and lifestyle: the Arctic Inuit in Nunavut, Canada.The aims of the present study were to (1) characterise the diets of adult Inuit; (2) highlight foods for a nutritional and lifestyle intervention programme; (3) develop a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) to evaluate the programme and monitor changes in dietary intake in this population over time. A dietary survey using single 24-h dietary recalls was conducted among Inuit aged between 19 and 87 years in two communities in Nunavut, Canada. Eighty-seven subjects completed the recalls (response rate was approximately 73 %). The mean energy intake for men and women was 9530 and 6939 kJ, respectively. The intakes of dietary fibre and the majority of vitamins and minerals (especially vitamins A, D, and E, total folate and <e>Ca</e>) were far below the recommendations. Traditional foods contributed 40 and 42 %, respectively, to protein and Fe intakes. Non-nutrient-dense store-bought foods were consumed much more frequently than the nutrient-dense traditional foods. Foods high in fat and sugar were highlighted, and will be replaced by healthier, more nutrient-dense alternatives to address the dietary inadequacies for the nutritional intervention programme. A 154-item QFFQ was developed and pilot tested in the Arctic Inuit. The present study highlighted foods to be targeted for a nutritional and lifestyle intervention programme not previously undertaken in this population. This QFFQ is culturally appropriate and specific for evaluating the effectiveness of the programme, as well as monitoring nutritional transition in this population.",M4
20012908,"Population-based study of the epidemiology and the risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection.BACKGROUND: Detailed population-based data on the epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections are sparse. We sought to describe the incidence rate, risk factors, and outcomes associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia in a large Canadian health region. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective population-based surveillance for P. aeruginosa bacteremia was conducted in the Calgary Health Region (CHR, population:approx. 1.2 million) during the period from 2000 to 2006. RESULTS: A total of 284 incident cases of P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified in CHR residents, corresponding to an annual incidence rate of 3.6/100,000.Nosocomial acquisition accounted for 45% of cases,healthcare-associated community onset for 34% of cases,and community-acquired (<e>CA</e>) cases for 21%. Relative to the general population, risk factors for blood stream infection included male sex, increasing age, hemodialysis,solid organ transplant, diagnosis of cancer, heart disease, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, and/or chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD). Overall mortality was 29%. Factors associated with mortality in univariate analysis included pulmonary focus of infection and co-morbidities, including chronic liver disease, substance abuse, heart disease, COPD, and cancer, and increased with the burden of co-morbidities. Despite those patients with CA disease having fewer co-morbidities,they had a significantly higher mortality rate than either healthcare-associated cases or nosocomial cases(RR 1.88, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that P. aeruginosa bacteremic disease is responsible for a significant burden of illness in general populations and identifies those groups at increased risk of infection and subsequent mortality. This information can be used to identify those individuals likely to benefit from empiric anti-pseudomonal therapies.",M4
19721782,"Demographic survey of veterinarians employed in western Canada.The objective of this study was to generate demographic data on veterinarians working in western Canada. A sample of 551 veterinarians was randomly selected from a population of 2474 veterinarians employed in western Canada, 425 (77.1%) of whom responded to the survey. The respondents were evenly split between males (53.1%) and females (46.9%). More than half (58.0%) of the private practitioners practised exclusively on companion animals (small animals and horses), while 2.9% devoted 100% of their time to food animals. There were 351 respondents who had had &gt; or = 2 employers since graduation; 80% of those who had begun their careers in companion animal (<e>CA</e>) practice had remained in this type of practice, while 54.3% of those who had begun their careers in mixed animal practice had switched to CA practice. Analyses of wage and workload data from 85 full-time veterinary employees showed that CA practitioners worked the fewest hours/week (47.0), had the least number of evenings on-call/month (3.7), and earned the highest hourly wage (35.79 dollars) as compared with non-CA practitioners.",M4
19721783,"Factors associated with the career path choices of veterinarians in western Canada.This second of 2 articles, relating to the veterinary profession in western Canada, explores the factors associated with veterinarians' career path choices. Among other factors, companion animal (small animal and equine) (<e>CA</e>) practitioners were less likely to have been raised in, or near to, a small center (&lt; or = 10 000), were more concerned with their workload (hours of work and number of nights on-call), and preferred to work in progressive practices. Food animal (FA) practitioners were more likely to be male, have been raised in a small center, have been raised in the Province of Saskatchewan, and to have self-assessed themselves as having an above average knowledge of agriculture at the time they applied for admission to veterinary college. Mixed animal (MA) practitioners had more factors in common with FA than with CA practitioners. Three main factors were associated with leaving mixed or food animal practice: hours of work and too many nights on-call, the level of remuneration, and lack of support and mentorship.",M4
19418237,"Comparison of precipitation chemistry measurements obtained by the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network and National Atmospheric Deposition Program for the period 1995-2004.Precipitation chemistry and depth measurements obtained by the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) and the US National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) were compared for the 10-year period 1995-2004. Colocated sets of CAPMoN and NADP instrumentation, consisting of precipitation collectors and rain gages, were operated simultaneously per standard protocols for each network at Sutton, Ontario and Frelighsburg, Ontario, Canada and at State College, PA, USA. CAPMoN samples were collected daily, and NADP samples were collected weekly, and samples were analyzed exclusively by each network's laboratory for pH, H(+), <e>Ca</e>(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), K(+), NH4(+), Cl(-), NO3(-), and SO4(2-). Weekly and annual precipitation-weighted mean concentrations for each network were compared. This study is a follow-up to an earlier internetwork comparison for the period 1986-1993, published by Alain Sirois, Robert Vet, and Dennis Lamb in 2000. Median weekly internetwork differences for 1995-2004 data were the same to slightly lower than for data for the previous study period (1986-1993) for all analytes except NO3(-), SO4(2-), and sample depth. A 1994 NADP sampling protocol change and a 1998 change in the types of filters used to process NADP samples reversed the previously identified negative bias in NADP data for hydrogen-ion and sodium concentrations. Statistically significant biases (alpha = 0.10) for sodium and hydrogen-ion concentrations observed in the 1986-1993 data were not significant for 1995-2004. Weekly CAPMoN measurements generally are higher than weekly NADP measurements due to differences in sample filtration and field instrumentation, not sample evaporation, contamination, or analytical laboratory differences.",M4
19528621,"Selection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and quality of genotypes used in genomic evaluation of dairy cattle in the United States and Canada.Nearly 57,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, <e>CA</e>) were investigated to determine usefulness of the associated SNP for genomic prediction. Genotypes were obtained for 12,591 bulls and cows, and SNP were selected based on 5,503 bulls with genotypes from a larger set of SNP. The following SNP were deleted: 6,572 that were monomorphic, 3,213 with scoring problems (primarily because of poor definition of clusters and excess number of clusters), and 3,649 with a minor allele frequency of &lt;2%. Number of SNP for each minor allele frequency class (&gt; or =2%) was fairly uniform (777 to 1,004). For 5 contiguous SNP assigned to chromosome 7, no bulls were heterozygous, which indicated that those SNP are actually on the nonpseudoautosomal portion of the X chromosome. Another 178 SNP that were not assigned to a chromosome but that had many fewer heterozygotes than expected were also assigned to the X chromosome. Existence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was investigated by comparing observed with expected heterozygosity. For 11 SNP, the observed percentage of heterozygous individuals differed from the expected by &gt;15%; therefore, those SNP were deleted. For 2,628 SNP, the genotype at another SNP was highly correlated (i.e., genotypes were identical for &gt;99.5% of bulls), and those were deleted. After edits, 40,874 SNP remained. A parent-progeny conflict was declared when the genotypes were alternate homozygotes. Mean number of conflicts was 2.3 when pedigree was correct and 2,411 when it was incorrect. The sire was genotyped for &gt;93% of animals. Maternal grandsire genotype was similarly checked; however, because alternate homozygotes could be valid, a conflict threshold of 16% was used to indicate a need for further investigation. Genotyping consistency was investigated for 21 bulls genotyped twice with differences primarily from SNP that were not scored in one of the genotypes. Concordance for readable SNP was extremely high (99.96-100%). Thousands of SNP that were polymorphic in Holsteins were monomorphic in Jerseys or Brown Swiss, which indicated that breed-specific SNP sets are required or that all breeds need to be considered in the SNP selection process. Genotypes from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip are of high accuracy and provide the basis for genomic evaluations in the United States and Canada.",M4
19323748,"Amino acid and mineral composition of protein and other components and their recovery yields from whole Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) using isoelectric solubilization/precipitation.Proteins and insolubles were recovered from whole Antarctic krill via novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation using different pH treatments. The protein recovery yield was 45% to 50% (dry basis). The recovered proteins had higher (P &lt; 0.05) content of essential amino acids (EAAs) and non-EAAs as well as higher (P &lt; 0.05) ratio of total EAA/total AA than whole krill. The EAAs constituted almost 50% of total AAs. The least extreme pH treatments (pHs 3 and 12) yielded highest (P &lt; 0.05) content of EAAs. The quality of recovered proteins was high based on EAAs meeting FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for adults and infants. The basic pH yielded proteins with the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) amount of minerals and the highest (P &lt; 0.05) amount of <e>Ca</e>, P, and Mg in the insolubles when compared to the acidic treatments. However, both basic and acidic treatments effectively removed minerals from recovered proteins without the removal of the exoskeleton before processing. Therefore, besides high-quality proteins, the insolubles may provide a mineral supplement in the animal diet.",M4

19149391,"Congenital anomalies surveillance in Canada.Congenital anomalies (<e>CA</e>) are present in approximately 3% of all newborn babies and account for about 12% of paediatric hospital admissions. They represent an important public health problem. Surveillance is especially important so that preventive measures such as folic acid fortification can be properly assessed without resorting to a series of ad hoc studies. Canada's surveillance of CAs is weak, with only Alberta and British Columbia having established sytems. Most provinces have perinatal systems but their CA data are incomplete and they do not capture terminations of pregnancy. The same is true of the Public Health Agency of Canada's system. A new system, the Fetal Alert Network, has been proposed for Ontario, which represents a start but will require additional sources of ascertainment if it is to be a truly population-based system for Ontario.",M4
19247692,"Analyses of associations with asthma in four asthma population samples from Canada and Australia.Asthma, atopy, and related phenotypes are heterogeneous complex traits, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Extensive research has been conducted and over hundred genes have been associated with asthma and atopy phenotypes, but many of these findings have failed to replicate in subsequent studies. To separate true associations from false positives, candidate genes need to be examined in large well-characterized samples, using standardized designs (genotyping, phenotyping and analysis). In an attempt to replicate previous associations we amalgamated the power and resources of four studies and genotyped 5,565 individuals to conduct a genetic association study of 93 previously associated candidate genes for asthma and related phenotypes using the same set of 861 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a common genotyping platform, and relatively harmonized phenotypes. We tested for association between SNPs and the dichotomous outcomes of asthma, atopy, atopic asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness using a general allelic likelihood ratio test. No SNP in any gene reached significance levels that survived correction for all tested SNPs, phenotypes, and genes. Even after relaxing the usual stringent multiple testing corrections by performing a gene-based analysis (one gene at a time as if no other genes were typed) and by stratifying SNPs based on their prior evidence of association, no genes gave strong evidence of replication. There was weak evidence to implicate the following: IL13, IFNGR2, EDN1, and VDR in asthma; IL18, TBXA2R, IFNGR2, and VDR in atopy; TLR9, TBXA2R, VDR, NOD2, and STAT6 in airway hyperresponsiveness; TLR10, IFNGR2, STAT6, VDR, and NPSR1 in atopic asthma. Additionally we found an excess of SNPs with small effect sizes (OR &lt; 1.4). The low rate of replication may be due to small effect size, differences in phenotypic definition, differential environmental effects, and/or genetic heterogeneity. To aid in future replication studies of asthma genes a comprehensive database was compiled and is available to the scientific community at http://genapha.icapture.ubc.<e>ca</e>/.",M4
18975688,"Statistical process control for IMRT dosimetric verification.Patient-specific measurements are typically used to validate the dosimetry of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). To evaluate the dosimetric performance over time of our IMRT process, we have used statistical process control (SPC) concepts to analyze the measurements from 330 head and neck (H&amp;N) treatment plans. The objectives of the present work are to: (i) Review the dosimetric measurements of a large series of consecutive head and neck treatment plans to better understand appropriate dosimetric tolerances; (ii) analyze the results with SPC to develop action levels for measured discrepancies; (iii) develop estimates for the number of measurements that are required to describe IMRT dosimetry in the clinical setting; and (iv) evaluate with SPC a new beam model in our planning system. H&amp;N IMRT cases were planned with the PINNACLE treatment planning system versions 6.2b or 7.6c (Philips Medical Systems, Madison, WI) and treated on Varian (Palo Alto, <e>CA</e>) or Elekta (Crawley, UK) linacs. As part of regular quality assurance, plans were recalculated on a 20-cm-diam cylindrical phantom, and ion chamber measurements were made in high-dose volumes (the PTV with highest dose) and in low-dose volumes (spinal cord organ-at-risk, OR). Differences between the planned and measured doses were recorded as a percentage of the planned dose. Differences were stable over time. Measurements with PINNACLE3 6.2b and Varian linacs showed a mean difference of 0.6% for PTVs (n=149, range, -4.3% to 6.6%), while OR measurements showed a larger systematic discrepancy (mean 4.5%, range -4.5% to 16.3%) that was due to well-known limitations of the MLC model in the earlier version of the planning system. Measurements with PINNACLE3 7.6c and Varian linacs demonstrated a mean difference of 0.2% for PTVs (n=160, range, -3.0%, to 5.0%) and -1.0% for ORs (range -5.8% to 4.4%). The capability index (ratio of specification range to range of the data) was 1.3 for the PTV data, indicating that almost all measurements were within +/-5%. We have used SPC tools to evaluate a new beam model in our planning system to produce a systematic difference of -0.6% for PTVs and 0.4% for ORs, although the number of measurements is smaller (n=25). Analysis of this large series of H&amp;N IMRT measurements demonstrated that our IMRT dosimetry was stable over time and within accepted tolerances. These data provide useful information for assessing alterations to beam models in the planning system. IMRT is enhanced by the addition of statistical process control to traditional quality control procedures.",M4
19017451,"Cost-effectiveness of a new interferon-based blood assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold, in screening tuberculosis contacts.BACKGROUND: Recent approval of interferon-gamma release assays that are more specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis has given new options for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Quanti-FERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) vs. the tuberculin skin test (TST) in diagnosing LTBI in contacts of active TB cases using a decision analytic Markov model. METHODS: Three screening strategies--TST alone, QFT-G alone and sequential screening of TST then QFT-G--were evaluated. The model was further stratified according to ethnicity and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination status. Data sources included published studies and empirical data. Results were reported in terms of the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of each strategy compared with the baseline strategy of TST-based screening in all contacts. RESULTS: The most economically attractive strategy was to administer QFT-G in BCG-vaccinated contacts, and to reserve TST for all others (INMB <e>CA</e>$3.70/contact). The least cost-effective strategy was QFT-G for all contacts, which resulted in an INMB of CA$-11.50 per contact. Assuming a higher prevalence of recent infection, faster conversion of QFT-G, a higher rate of TB reactivation, reduction in utility or greater adherence to preventive treatment resulted in QFT-G becoming cost-effective in more subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Selected use of QFT-G appears to be cost-effective if used in a targeted fashion.",M4
18839760,"Impact of nutrient removal through harvesting on the sustainability of the boreal forest.The cycling of base cations (K, <e>Ca</e>, Mg, and Na) was investigated in a boreal balsam fir forest (the Lake Laflamme Watershed) between 1999 and 2005. Base cation budgets were calculated for the soil rooting zone that included atmospheric deposition and soil leaching losses, two scenarios of tree uptake (whole-tree and stem-only harvesting), and three scenarios of mineral weathering, leading to six different scenarios. In every scenario there was a net accumulation of Mg within the soil exchangeable reservoir, while Ca accumulated in four scenarios. Potassium was lost in five of the six scenarios. Contrary to Ca and Mg, immobilization of K within tree biomass (69 mol x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) was the main pathway of K losses from the soil exchangeable reservoir, being five times higher than losses via soil leaching (14 mol x ha(-1) x yr(-1)). The amounts of K contained within the aboveground biomass and the exchangeable soil reservoir were 3.3 kmol/ha and 4.2 kmol/ha, respectively. Whole-tree harvesting may thus remove 44% of the K that is readily available for cycling in the short term, making this forest sensitive to commercial forestry operations. Similar values of annual K uptake as well as a similar distribution of K between tree biomass and soil exchangeable reservoirs at 14 other coniferous sites, distributed throughout the boreal forest of Quebec, suggest that the Lake Laflamme Watershed results can be extrapolated to a much larger area. Stem-only harvesting, which would reduce K exports due to biomass removal by 60%, should be used for these types of forest.",M4

Dietary restraint was assessed using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and daily calcium intake (<e>Ca</e>++) was assessed by the rapid assessment method. Quantitative ultrasound was used to measure SOS at the tibia and radius. Bone formation was estimated from plasma osteocalcin (OC), 25-OH vitamin D, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP). Bone resorption was determined from serum cross-linked N-teleopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) and plasma C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx). Weekly physical activity energy expenditure (WAeq) was assessed using a standardized questionnaire, and height, body mass, relative body fat (%BF), and chest, waist, and hip circumferences were also measured. Participants were divided into low and moderate to high dietary restrainers (LDRs and MDRs, respectively). These groups were further sub-divided into users and non-users of oral contraceptives. All groups had similar age at menarche, body composition, WAeq, and equally low levels of Ca++ and vitamin D. Within the non-users of oral contraceptives, MDR exhibited a lower tibial SOS (p &lt;or= 0.024) and OC (p &lt;or= 0.009) than LDR. Moreover, amongst the LDR, the oral contraceptive users had a lower tibial SOS (p &lt;or= 0.015) and BAP (p &lt;or= 0.002) than non-users. These results show that bone SOS and bone turnover were influenced by oral contraceptives and cognitive dietary restraint among this population of young women independent of body composition and physical activity.",M4
18829360,"Ethics issues for HIV/AIDS researchers in international settings - perspectives from the Canadian experience.In recognition of the level of international HIV/AIDS research being conducted by Canadians, the Canadian Association for HIV Research (CAHR), along with its partners, has developed a resource document to assist researchers in identifying and preparing for the unique ethics issues and challenges that may arise during international HIV/AIDS research. Between 2004 and 2007, face-to-face consultations were undertaken with community and government stakeholders, and interviews were conducted with eight prominent HIV/AIDS researchers with international experience to identify key research ethics challenges and structural, cultural, political, social, and economic factors that may impact HIV/AIDS research ethics in resource-limited settings. These challenges and factors served as the basis for the hypothetical ethics issues case scenarios developed for each of the four research tracks. Ethics issues were identified at every stage of the research process. Key contextual issues included: (1) stigma and culturally-embedded conceptualizations of HIV; (2) local and global politics and economics; (3) gender inequities, power dynamics, and sexual roles; and (4) allocation and availability of resources for research and health services. The final document resulting from the consultation process provides a framework for open dialogue on the complex and interconnected ethics issues researchers may experience in the field of international HIV/AIDS research, and contributes to the HIV/AIDS research field by reinforcing the need for high quality and ethically sound research.

The aim of this initiative, called the CAM in UME Project, is to facilitate high quality and balanced teaching of CAM related issues in UME. The project's activities include the development of (1) CAM-oriented competencies, (2) peer-reviewed summaries of topics relevant to CAM, (3) a searchable repository of teaching and learning resources, and (4) a guide for the development, implementation and sustainability of CAM curriculum. All these are housed on the CAM in UME Web site (http://www.caminume.<e>ca</e>) which is freely accessible to interested individuals. It appears that teaching students about natural health products, an important component of CAM, would be a natural fit for pharmacologists based at medical schools.",M4

Concentrations of Ag and Tl ranged from 0.02 to 5.84 pg/g and from 0.03 to 3.40 pg/g, respectively. The natural Tl/Sc background ratio established with ice samples dating between 10,590 and 15,010 yr BP, amounted to 0.11+/-0.03 which is in good agreement with the corresponding value of 0.107 reported for the Upper Continental Crust (UCC). The Ag/Sc background ratio in ice (0.09+/-0.06), in turn, is much more variable and approximately 10-times higher than UCC values. The high temporal resolution provided by 45 samples from the 5 m snow pit representing the period AD 1994 to 2004, revealed the greatest elemental concentrations as well as accumulation rates during the winter months when air masses reach the Arctic predominantly from Eurasia. The greatest Sc concentrations, however, are also found during winter months which clearly reflect strong seasonal variations in atmospheric dust inputs. Enrichment factors calculated for both elements (Ag, Tl) using Sc show contrasting behaviours, with the maximum EF for Tl (up to 48) during summer when air masses arriving to the Arctic are predominantly from North America, probably reflecting coal burning, base metal mining and smelting. The greatest enrichments of Ag (up to 17), on the other hand, tend generally to be found in winter, although some enrichment maxima corresponding to summer months are also seen. While modern Ag EF are comparable to those corresponding to ancient (back to <e>ca</e>. 3 k yr) anthropogenic activities, modern Tl EF clearly exceed the impact of Medieval, Roman and Greek/Phoenician civilization. Accumulation rates during the past decade have been variable (mean 36 and 130 ng/m(2)/yr for Ag and Tl, respectively), but the trend is clearly in decline. Based on the best estimate of natural inputs, more than 80% of the Ag and 90% of the Tl supplied to the Arctic today (AD 1994-2004) are derived from anthropogenic sources.",M4
18448347,"Recent peat accumulation rates in minerotrophic peatlands of the Bay James region, Eastern Canada, inferred by 210Pb and 137Cs radiometric techniques.(210)Pb and (137)Cs dating techniques are used to characterise recent peat accumulation rates of two minerotrophic peatlands located in the La Grande Rivière hydrological watershed, in the James Bay region (Canada). Several cores were collected during the summer 2005 in different parts of the two selected peatlands. These minerotrophic patterned peatlands are presently affected by erosion processes, expressed by progressive mechanical destruction of their pools borders. This erosion process is related to a water table rise induced by a regional increase of humidity since the last century. The main objective of the present paper is to (1) evaluate if (210)Pb and (137)Cs dating techniques can be applied to build accurate chronologies in these environments and (2) detect changes in the peat accumulation rates in regard to this amplification of humidity. In both sites, unsupported (210)Pb shows an exponential decreasing according to the depth. Chronologies inferred from (210)Pb allow to reconstruct peat accumulation rates since <e>ca</e>. 1855 AD. The (137)Cs data displayed evident mobility and diffusion, preventing the establishment of any sustained chronology based on these measurements. In the two sites, peat accumulation rates inferred from (210)Pb chronologies fluctuate between 0.005 and 0.038 g cm(-2) yr(-1). As a result, the rise of the water table during the last decade has not yet affected peat accumulation rates.",M4
18326385,"Patient education as a strategy for provider education and engagement: a case study using myJointReplacement.<e>ca</e>.MyJointReplacement.ca was initiated to integrate patient and provider perspectives with the evidence on joint replacement care into a patient education website to promote consistency in practice. The project's leadership ensured that the project fit into a larger system change initiative. The literature was reviewed and a qualitative study determined patient perspectives on what information was required. Findings were discussed with providers and integrated into the website. The site hosts nearly 1,700 one-hour sessions monthly. In a survey of 50 providers, 40 providers (80%) indicated that they would align their practice with the findings, and 45% (90%) believed that the site reflected best practice. Over 80% (n = 70) of patients surveyed indicated that the site increased their knowledge. It was concluded that developing a patient education website is an innovative approach to provider education if supported by leadership that can integrate the initiative into a broader context.",M4
18359192,"Health Utilities Index Mark 3 showed valid in Alzheimer disease, arthritis, and cataracts.OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in Alzheimer disease (AD), arthritis (AR), and cataracts (<e>CA</e>). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The 1996-97 Canadian National Population Health Survey for community and institution-dwelling respondents aged 40 years and above was used in the study. Adjusted means for overall and single-attribute HUI3 scores of five subgroups were compared: (1) AD only, (2) AR only, (3) CA only, (4) at least two of the three conditions, and (5) none of the three (reference group). Regression analyses were conducted for community and institutional data to obtain adjusted mean utility scores. RESULTS: Of the 76 a priori hypotheses, 55 were confirmed. HUI3 was able to describe overall burdens of AD, AR, and CA as well as vision problems associated with CA, speech and cognition problems associated with AD, and ambulation and pain problems associated with AR. Adjusted mean differences in overall HUI3 scores between AD, AR, or CA only groups and reference group ranged from -0.04 to -0.42 (P&lt;0.05); all differences were quantitatively important. CONCLUSION: HUI3 is useful in assessing the health-related quality of life of AD, AR, and CA of those living in the community and institutions.",M4
18186344,"Comparing WHAM 6 and MINEQL+ 4.5 for the chemical speciation of Cu2+ in the rhizosphere of forest soils.Metal speciation data calculated by modeling could give useful information regarding the fate of metals in the rhizospheric environment. However, no comparative study has evaluated the relative accuracy of speciation models in this microenvironment. Consequently, the present study evaluates the reliability of free Cu ion (Cu2+) activity modeled by WHAM 6 and MINEQL+ 4.5 for 18 bulk and 18 rhizospheric soil samples collected in two Canadian forested areas located near industrial facilities. The modeling of Cu speciation was performed on water extracts using pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), major ions, and total dissolved Al, <e>Ca</e>, Cu, Mg, and Zn concentrations as input data. Four scenarios representing the composition of dissolved organic substances using fulvic, humic, and acetic acids were derived from the literature and used in the modeling exercise. Different scenarios were used to contrast soil components (rhizosphere vs bulk) and soil pH levels (acidic vs neutral to alkaline). Reference Cu2+ activity values measured by an ion-selective electrode varied between 0.39 and 41 nM. The model MINEQL+ 4.5 provided good predictions of Cu2+ activities [root-mean-square residual (RMSR)= 0.37], while predictions from WHAM 6 were poor (RMSR = 1.74) because they overestimated Cu complexation with DOC. Modeling with WHAM 6 could be improved by adjusting the proportion of inert DOC and the composition of DOC (RMSR = 0.94), but it remained weaker than predictions with MINEQL+ 4.5. These results suggested that the discrepancies between speciation models were attributed to differences in the binding capacity of humic substances with Cu, where WHAM 6 appeared to be too aggressive. Therefore, we concluded that chemical interactions occurring between Cu and DOC were key factors for an accurate simulation of Cu speciation, especially in rhizospheric forest soils, where high variation of the DOC concentration and composition are observed.",M4

METHODS: Population health data, maternal health, and prenatal prescription records were linked to neonatal records, representing all live births (British Columbia, Canada, N=119,547) during a 39-month period (1998-2001). The incidence and risk differences (RD) for major congenital anomalies (<e>CA</e>) and congenital heart disease (CHD), including ventricular and atrial septal defects (VSD, ASD), from infants of mothers treated with an SRI alone, a benzodiazepine (BZ) alone, or SRI+BZ in combinationcompared to outcomesno exposure. RESULTS: Risk for a CA or CHD did increase following combined SRI+BZ exposure compared with no exposure. However, using a weighted regression model, controlling for maternal illness characteristics, combination therapy risk remained significantly associated only with CHD. The risk for an ASD was higher following SRI monotherapy compared with no exposure, after adjustment for maternal covariates. Dose/day was not associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Infants exposed to prenatal SRIs in combination with BZs had a higher a incidence of CHD compared to no exposure, even after controlling for maternal illness characteristics. SRI monotherapy was not associated with an increased risk for major CA, but was associated with an increased incidence of ASD. Risk was not associated with first trimester medication dose/day.",M4
18031633,"Origins of the Canadian school of surgery.BACKGROUND: Since its inception 50 years ago, the Canadian Journal of Surgery has published articles under the banner  History of Canadian Surgery.  Because no comprehensive history of surgery in this country has yet been written, these articles may provide its basis. METHOD: The Canadian Journal of Surgery was searched from October 1957 to August 2007 for articles on the practice of surgery in Canada before 1957. Articles regarding the development of surgery in provinces, universities, hospitals and surgical specialty societies were included, as well as biographies and obituaries of surgeons. RESULTS: Thirty-six articles dealing with the lives of 57 Canadian surgeons were located. Three periods of Canadian surgery were covered: the French regime (1535-1759), the transition period (1759-1870) and the early modern period (1870-1945). The review shows that persistent efforts were made in Canada to develop surgical education and to regulate the practice of surgery. Isolation forced a spirit of adaptability that led to innovation and progress. CONCLUSION: The practice of surgery in Canada today can be traced back to contributions made by pioneering surgeons over the entire history of modern Canada. An archive of materials related to the history of surgery in Canada is being created at www.historyofsurgery.<e>ca</e> to facilitate further research.",M4
18173361,"Coexistence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive and -negative community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA400 sibling strains in a large Canadian health-care region.Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (<e>CA</e>-MRSA) strains often carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. However, the specific role that PVL plays in the epidemiological features and pathogenesis of CA-MRSA infections has remained undefined and controversial. Conducting a retrospective study on a natural population of MRSA clinical isolates recovered from community and hospital patients in a large Canadian health-care region during a 6-year period, we identified the coexistence of 2 USA400 (a major clonal group of CA-MRSA) sibling strains with and without PVL genes. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis indicated that the PVL-carrying prophage phiSa2mw was present in PVL(+) but absent in PVL(-) USA400 isolates. These strains shared identical genotypic and phenotypic properties and similar clinical characteristics. This study provides direct evidence that PVL genes are not necessarily the key determinants associated with the increasing dissemination of CA-MRSA strains, suggesting that the genomic milieu may play a greater role in this regard.",M4
17689814,"ICD-10 adaptations of the Ontario acute myocardial infarction mortality prediction rules performed as well as the original versions.OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) version of the Ontario Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) mortality prediction rules, used to adjust for case-mix differences in studies of AMI patients using administrative data. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We linked the records of all Ontario patients admitted with AMI (2002-2004) with mortality data. The original ICD-9 codes were mapped to ICD-10-<e>CA</e> (Canada) codes using both a translation produced by coding experts and a manual search of codes; the final codes were determined by consensus. Comorbidity prevalence and mortality rates were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict 30-day and 1-year mortality and the C-statistic was used to evaluate the discrimination of the models. RESULTS: We identified 37,271 AMI patients. The most common comorbidities were heart failure and dysrhythmias; 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 12.3% and 21.8%, respectively; and mortality rates were highest among patients with shock, cancer, and acute renal failure. The C-statistics were 0.77 and 0.80, compared with 0.78 and 0.79 in the ICD-9 version, for 30-day and 1-year mortality, respectively. CONCLUSION: An ICD-10 version of the AMI mortality prediction rules predicted 30-day and 1-year mortality as well as the original ICD-9 version.",M4

METHODS: Data were collected through a) two separate interviews with each participant, b) two focus groups, c) field notes during the meetings the author had with the women once a week, and d) photographs of the photonovel project. RESULTS: The women created a participatory photonovel about nutrition entitled From Junk Food to Healthy Eating: Tanya's Journey to a Better Life (to view this photonovel go to: http://www.photonovel.<e>ca</e>). The findings demonstrate that the photonovel can be an effective health literacy tool for immigrant ESL-speaking women, that it created community among the women, that it helped the women feel important and that it shifted their consciousness about nutrition in Canada. DISCUSSION: More funding should be given towards participatory research to ensure that ways to address the health literacy needs of ESL-speaking immigrant women in Canada match their needs. This means researching ways to create health literacy materials that have visuals that are representative of the diverse population of Canadians and with language that can be understood. In order to ensure that health literacy materials are going to be effective, it is essential that the participants be involved in the process.",M4
17599429,"Health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness components of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial: rationale and design.Diabetes mellitus affects not only life expectancy but also quality of life. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cost-effectiveness components will enable the assessment of the relative importance of the various outcomes from the point of view of patients, provide an understanding of the balance between the burdens and benefits of the intervention strategies, and offer valuable insights into adherence. The HRQOL measures used include the Diabetes Symptoms Distress Checklist; the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) (RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, <e>CA</e>); the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) depression measure (Pfizer Inc, New York, NY); the World Health Organization (WHO) Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ); and the EuroQol Feeling Thermometer (EuroQol Group, Rotterdam, Netherlands). The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in ACCORD will provide information about the relative economic efficiency of the different interventions being compared in the trial. Effectiveness will be measured in terms of cardiovascular event-free years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained (using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 [HUI-3] [Health Utilities Inc., Dundas, Ontario, Canada] to measure health-state utility). Costs will be direct medical costs assessed from the perspective of a single-payer health system collected by means of patient and clinic cost forms and hospital discharge summaries. The primary HRQOL and CEA hypotheses mirror those in the main ACCORD trial, addressing the effects of the 3 main ACCORD interventions considered separately. There are also secondary (pairwise reference case) comparisons that do not assume independence of treatment effects on HRQOL. CEA will be done on a subsample of 4,311 ACCORD participants and HRQOL on a subsample of 2,053 nested within the CEA subsample. Most assessments will occur through questionnaires at baseline and at 12, 36, and 48 months.",M4

In 2005, business development managers from Allergan audited 1695 patient charts from the top 54 cosmetic practices in Canada. Despite the increasing popularity of this nonsurgical treatment, on average only 57% of patients return for a second injection within 6 months. In the author's clinical practice 92% of patients return for a second injection in this time frame. This paper will examine various factors that appear to result in satisfied patients with a high retention rate. This article will show that panfacial botulinum toxin injected in multiple sites with appropriate dosing improves patient retention.",M4
17547889,"Stage III endometrial cancer: preoperative predictability, prognostic factors, and treatment outcome.OBJECTIVE: The survival rate for the most common gynecologic cancer, endometrial cancer, has fallen significantly in the last 25 years. Stage III (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) disease accounts for most of the deaths. We evaluated prognostic factors, treatment-related survival, and routinely used assessments for identifying stage III disease before the operation. STUDY DESIGN: The data for patients with endometrial cancer stage III (n = 101) who had been treated at the McGill University Health Center between 1989 and 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS: Stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC tumors accounted for 63%, 4%, and 33% of the data, respectively. The cause-specific survival at 2, 3, and 5 years was 82%, 77%, and 67%, respectively. In multivariate analysis with an adjustment for the standard prognostic variables, the final tumor grade, adnexal involvement, and lymph node dissection were significant predictors of cause-specific survival (P = .001, .028, and .017, respectively). Of the preoperative investigations, an elevated <e>CA</e>-125 level was a significant predictor of cause-specific survival in multivariate analysis (P = .029). CONCLUSION: An elevated CA-125 level, adnexal involvement, the final tumor grade, and lymph node dissection were independent predictors for cause-specific survival.",M4
17071912,"Compost, manure, and gypsum application to timothy/red clover forage.Some of the most fertile agricultural land in Atlantic Canada includes dykelands, which were developed from rich salt marshes along the Bay of Fundy through the construction of dykes. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted on dykeland soil to evaluate the effect of fertility treatments: source-separated municipal solid waste (SS-MSW) compost, solid manure, commercial fertilizer, and gypsum on (1) timothy/red clover forage productivity, (2) N, S, and other nutrients uptake, and (3) residual NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N in the soil profile. All fertility treatments increased dry matter yields from the two cuts each year relative to the control. Residual soil NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N concentrations in the fall of the second year decreased with depth, and beyond 20-cm depth were lower than 1 mg kg(-1). Gypsum application equivalent to 40 kg S ha(-1) increased dry matter yields and N uptake by forage, and increased soil Mehlich 3-extractable S, tissue S, and uptake of S, <e>Ca</e>, P, Cu, Fe, and Mn relative to the control. High rates of compost can provide sufficient N, S, and perhaps other nutrients to a perennial forage system under the cool wet climate of Atlantic Canada with no heavy metal enrichment of forage. However, the chemical N provided greater total N uptake than organic sources, except the high rate of compost, suggesting that the N availability from organic sources was not well synchronized with forage N demand. Municipal solid waste compost may also increase soil and forage tissue Na, which might be of concern.",M4
17369002,"The great transformation: a long-run perspective on physical well-being in Canada.During the 19th century the physical stature of the Canadian-born stagnated or declined slightly in spite of a substantial increase in income. Stature varied regionally within Canada. The Quebec population was especially short; men in the Atlantic coastal region were taller than their low incomes would lead us to expect. Heights increased dramatically in the 20th Century. The pattern of long-run change is consistent with evidence of age-specific mortality and with the relationship between income and physical well-being envisaged by Preston [Preston, S., 1975. The changing relationship between mortality and the level of economic development. Popul. Stud. 29, 231-248].

16933218,"Aspiration during swallowing in typically developing children of the First Nations and Inuit in Canada.Children of the First Nations and Inuit in Canada have a high propensity for lower respiratory tract infections. Overcrowding, poor housing, passive smoke exposure, and lack of breast feeding (Martens P, Bond R, Jebamani L, Burchill C, et al. http://www.umanitoba.<e>ca</e>/centres/mchp/reports/pdfs/rfn_pdfs/rfn_report.pdf.; MacMillan H, Walsh C, Jamieson E, Crawford A, Boyle M. http://www.hcsc.gc.ca/fnihbdgspni/fnihb/aboriginalhealth/reports_summaries/regional_survey_ch1.pdf.; Wardman AE, Khan NA. Int J Circumpolar Health 2004;63:81-92) have been cited as important contributing factors in the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections. However, aspiration during swallowing has thus far not been considered as a co-factor in the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections in these children. We present a retrospective case series of seven typically developing children of the Canadian First Nations and Inuit, in whom aspiration during swallowing was detected in the course of investigating associations with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. None of the children had any of the known risk factors for aspiration during swallowing such as developmental variation, prematurity, neuromotor problems, or anatomic abnormalities of the upper aerodigestive tract. We speculate that aspiration during swallowing in typically developing children may be an important, previously unrecognized co-factor in the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in the communities of the Canadian First Nations and Inuit. Further prospective studies will be needed to determine whether aspiration during swallowing represents an independent risk factor for the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections in these children.",M4

The MICs of the isolates increased during therapy with vancomycin. The patient fractured her right hip while in the United States. She was started on treatment with vancomycin. The MICs of successive isolates increased from &lt; or =1 to 4 mg/L over 6 months. Then, an isolate tested at 8 mg/L initially and 4 mg/L with confirmatory E-test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). One month later, MRSA was still present in her wound, and therapy was changed to linezolid with rifampin. Subsequent cultures were negative for MRSA. Susceptibility testing was performed on the BD Phoenix (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), Dade Microscan (Dade Behring Microscan, Sacramento, <e>CA</e>), Pasco MIC (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), Vitek 2 (bioMerieux, St. Louis, MO), and Sensititre (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) systems, and by E-test. Molecular typing (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) was used to verify the relatedness of the isolates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess the cell wall thickness of isolates with differing MICs. Population analysis was performed to assess for vancomycin hetero-resistance. MICs of 4 mg/L were only obtained with BD Phoenix, E-test, and broth microdilution. All isolates were identical by PFGE. The most resistant isolate had a thicker cell wall on TEM. Vancomycin hetero-resistance was observed in the resistant isolates. This is the first strain of MRSA with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin reported in Canada. The breakpoints for vancomycin susceptibility have been revised in light of such observations.",M4

Libraries of chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene sequences were prepared from MLSS total microbial community DNA and each was compared with cpnDB, a reference database of cpn60 sequences (http://cpndb.cbr.nrc.<e>ca</e>) for assignment of taxonomic identities. Sequences similar to but distinct from the type strain of T. eikelboomii AP3 (ATCC 49788T) (approximately 89% identity over 555 bp) were recovered at high frequency from a mill sample that was experiencing bulking problems at the time of sample collection, which corresponded to microscopic observations using fluorescent in situ hybridization with commercially available 16S rDNA-based probes. We enumerated this strain in five mill-derived MLSS samples using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and found that two samples had high levels of the bulking strain (&gt;1012 genomes/g MLSS) and two contained lower but detectable levels of this organism. None of the mill samples contained cpn60 sequences that were identical to the type strain of T. eikelboomii. This technique shows promise for monitoring pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment systems by detecting and enumerating this strain of T. eikelboomii, which may be specific to pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment systems.",M4
16730252,"The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists: highlights of its first 50 years.This article has been written to mark the 50th anniversary of the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists (CSCC). It is not an exhaustive history of CSCC's activities but rather a review of many of the highlights that the Society and its members have experienced since its founding in October 1956. The names of many members who made important contributions to CSCC's development (but by no means all) are mentioned in the text. The historical material is presented by the decade but with blurred boundaries, as noteworthy advances in CSCC's history have most often developed gradually over several years and the terms of office of several CSCC Councils. From a founding roster of slightly over 70 members, the membership has grown to several hundred. The two main objectives for the Society's founding were stated by one of the three Montrealers who extended the original invitation, Dr. William S. Bauld:  to raise the standards of performance, and to raise the professional standing of clinical chemists . The early reports of committees on Instrumentation, Methods and Quality Control had rapid impact on individual members' laboratory practices across the country. The struggle for recognition of clinical chemists by other health professions inside and outside the clinical laboratories has taken much longer and has consisted of a long series of incremental successes through certification by examination, training programs, continuing education and, ultimately, the formation in 1986 of the Canadian Academy of Clinical Biochemistry. The CSCC's means of intra- and inter-communication with external organizations consist of its newsletter CSCC News, its scientific journal Clinical Biochemistry (established in 1967), and its more recently created website www.cscc.<e>ca</e> (1997). These three mechanisms ensure exchange of information between the officers of CSCC Council and the general membership and among members as well. National and international conferences have offered the newest scientific discoveries pertinent to the profession, exhibits featuring the latest in increasingly sophisticated instrumentation and reagents, and abundant opportunity to exchange information informally with old and newly met colleagues. By their contributions to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, CSCC members continue to play important roles far beyond Canada's borders.",M4
16526143,"Location of cardiac arrests in the public access defibrillation trial.BACKGROUND: The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) Trial found an overall doubling in the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (<e>CA</e>) survivors when a lay responder team was equipped with an automated external defibrillator (AED), compared with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) alone. OBJECTIVES: To describe the types of facilities that participated in the trial and to report the incidence of CA and survival in these different types of facilities. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of PAD Trial data, the physical characteristics of the participating facilities and the numbers of presumed CAs, treatable CAs, and survivors are reported for each category of facilities. RESULTS: There were 625 presumed CAs at 1,260 participating facilities. Just under half (n = 291) of the presumed CAs were classified as treatable CAs. Treatable CAs occurred at a rate of 2.9 per 1,000 person-years of exposure; rates were highest in fitness centers (5.1) and golf courses (4.8) and lowest in office complexes (0.7) and hotels (0.7). Survival from treatable CA was highest in recreational complexes (0.5), public transportation sites (0.4), and fitness centers (0.4) and lowest in office complexes (0.1) and residential facilities (0.0). CONCLUSIONS: During the PAD Trial, the exposure-adjusted rate of treatable CA was highest in fitness centers and golf courses, but the incidence per facility was low to moderate. Survival from treatable cardiac arrest was highest in recreational complexes, public transportation facilities, and fitness centers.",M4
16643086,"Ultraviolet B-photoprotection efficiency of mesocosm-enclosed natural phytoplankton communities from different latitudes: Rimouski (Canada) and Ubatuba (Brazil).Photoprotection against UV-B radiation (UVBR; 280-320 nm) was examined in natural phytoplankton communities from two coastal environments at different latitudes: temperate Rimouski (Canada) and tropical Ubatuba (Brazil). Mesocosm experiments were performed at these sites to examine the response of phytoplankton to increases in UVBR that corresponded to local depletions of 30% and 60% in atmospheric ozone levels (low and high UVBR treatments, respectively). A fluorescence method using a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer (Xe-PAM, Walz, Germany) with selective UV filters was used to estimate photoprotection, and these results were compared with an index of mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) concentrations determined using spectrophotometry of methanol extracts. The present study provided the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the suitability of this in vivo fluorescence method for the estimation of UV photoprotection efficiency in natural phytoplankton. No significant differences were found for most of the variables analyzed between the light treatments used at both sites, but differences were found between sites throughout the duration of the experiments. Vertical mixing, used to maintain cells in suspension, likely alleviated serious UVBR-induced damage during both experiments by reducing the length of time of exposure to the highest UVBR irradiances at the surface. In Rimouski, this was the main factor minimizing the effects of treatment, because optical properties of the coastal seawater rapidly attenuated UVBR throughout the water column of the <e>ca</e> 2 m deep mesocosms. In this location, synthesis of MAAs and photoprotective pigments likely contributed to the observed phototolerance of phytoplankton and, hence, to their growth; however, in a comparison of the UVBR treatments, these variables showed no differences. In Ubatuba, where nutrient concentrations were significantly lower than those in Rimouski, light attenuation was less than that in Rimouski and UVBR reached the bottom of the mesocosms. UVBR penetration and the forced vertical mixing of the cells, without the possibility of vertical migration below this photostress zone, resulted in photo-inhibition, because confinement in the mesocosms forced cells to remain constantly exposed to high levels of irradiance during the daytime. Hence, additional effects of UVBR were masked in this experiment, because cells were damaged too much and phytoplankton populations were rapidly declining. There was also an overall preservation of MAAs, in contrast with chlorophyll (Chl) degradation, in spite of the fact that this UV screening was not sufficient to counteract photo-inhibition, which suggests an important role for these molecules, either in the overall photoprotection strategy or in other physiological processes. Altogether, local water characteristics, namely attenuation, mixing, and nutrients concentration, can strongly modulate the photoprotection strategies used by natural phytoplankton populations in coastal environments.",M4
16275110,"An evaluation of the quality of epilepsy education on the Canadian World Wide Web.BACKGROUND: Despite the substantial amount of epilepsy-related information available on the Internet, little is known about its quality. Epilepsy-related information in English on the Canadian Internet was reviewed. METHODS: Popular search engines (google.<e>ca</e>, yahoo.ca, ca.altavista.com, simpatico.msn.ca) were interrogated. Web sites aimed primarily at patient and family education, geared toward human epilepsy, and epilepsy in general as opposed to one specific type or aspect of epilepsy, were included. Web sites were then subdivided in to proprietary (directly sponsored by the industry) and nonproprietary, and evaluated according to compliance with the principles of the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation Code of Conduct. Web sites without comprehensive contents were excluded. Comparison between total scores was done using the rank test. Categorized descriptors were assessed with t tests. RESULTS: Five proprietary and fourteen nonproprietary websites were identified. None of them were compliant with all eight principles of the HON code. The average number of principles with which these sites were in compliance was 3.3 (range: 1-6.5, P = 0.4, proprietary vs nonproprietary).

However, most of the easily accessed epilepsy web sites do not comply with accepted standards for health web sites.",M4
16485052,"ICD-10-<e>CA</e>/CCI coding algorithms for defining clinical variables to assess outcome after aortic and mitral valve replacement surgery.Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) and the Canadian Classification of Interventions (CCI) coding system presents challenges for using Canadian administrative data. Thus, a multi-step process was conducted to develop ICD-10-CA/CCI coding algorithms to define nine comorbidities and three procedures. These clinical variables have been used in ICD-9-CM data for risk adjustment in assessment of outcomes after aortic and mitral valve replacement surgery. Among patients included in the ICD-9-CM data during 1999 and 2001 and in the ICD-10-CA/CCI data during 2002 and 2003 in a Canadian Health Region, frequencies of the nine comorbidities and the three procedures remained generally similar across databases. The newly developed ICD-10-CA/CCI and previous ICD-9-CM coding algorithms are comparable in detecting these clinical variables. However, performance of ICD-10-CA/CCI coding algorithms in risk adjustment should be evaluated in a larger database.",M4
16171580,"National audit of the recent utilization of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in Canada: 2003 to 2004.OBJECTIVES: Worldwide, increasing proportions of aortic aneurysms are repaired electively via the endovascular route. The purpose of this study was to report the recent utilization of endovascular repair in Canada by reviewing a national administrative database. METHODS: The Canadian Institute for Health Information database (a collection of all acute care hospitalizations) was reviewed to identify patients who received nonemergent repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) between April 1, 2003 and March 31, 2004. During this 1-year period, differentiation between endovascular (EVAR) and open repair was possible using ICD-10-<e>CA</e> procedural codes in eight of ten provinces. Case volumes, patient age, length of hospitalization, and mortality were stratified by method of repair, province, and size and teaching status of hospitals. RESULTS: In this 1-year period, 1996 patients in eight provinces (representing 72% of Canada's population) underwent open repair (n = 1818, 91.1%) or EVAR (n = 178, 8.9%) of a nonruptured AAA. National utilization rates were 8.4 and 0.8 per 100,000 population for open repair and EVAR. These rates were more constant for EVAR (0 to 1.3) then for open repair (4 to 18.3) when analyzed on a provincial basis. Mean patient age did not differ between EVAR and open repair (73.7 vs 71.9 years, P = 0.4) while mean length of stay (5.8 vs 11.9 days, P = 0.03) and in-hospital mortality (0.6% vs 4.6%, P = .025) were significantly lower for EVAR than for open repair. Most EVAR (96%) and more than half of open repairs (56%) were performed in academic teaching centers. CONCLUSIONS: Although EVAR results in significant reductions in length of hospitalization and early mortality, it continues to be underutilized in Canada compared with other national reports involving administrative databases.",M4
16201626,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in indoor dust in Ottawa, Canada: implications for sources and exposure.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as additive flame retardants in plastics, soft furnishings, electrical and electronic equipment, and insulation in the indoor environment, and may be released indoors via volatilization or as dusts. The penta-and octa-brominated mixes are now banned in most parts of Europe, and phasing out of their use has recently begun in North America. This study follows a previous investigation into indoor air levels of PBDEs. House dust was analyzed from the family vacuum cleaners of 68 of the same 74 randomly selected homes, in Ottawa, Canada during the winter of 2002-2003. PBDEs, comprising on average 42% BDE-209, were found in all samples. The levels were log-normally distributed with a geometric mean sigmaPBDE of 2000 ng g(-1), and a median of 1800 ng g(-1) dust. The levels in dust did not correlate with questionnaire information on house characteristics. Correlations were found between pentamix congener levels in dust and in air from the same homes, but not for congeners of the more highly brominated mixes. Exposure scenarios are presented for mean and high dust ingestion rates, and compared against exposures from other pathways, for both adults and toddlers (6 months-2 years). Assuming a mean dust ingestion rate and median dust and air concentrations, adults would be exposed to <e>ca</e>. 7.5 ng sigmaPBDE d(-1) via the dust ingestion pathway, which represents approximately 14% of total daily exposure when compared to diet (82%) and inhalation (4%). However, for toddlers the equivalent intakes would be 99 ng d(-1), representing 80% of their daily PBDE exposure. At high dust ingestion rates these values increase to 180 ng d(-1) (80% daily intake) for adults and 360 ng d(-1) (89% daily intake) for toddlers. The data give a clearer picture of sources of PBDE exposure in the home environment and suggest that dust could be a significant exposure pathway for some individuals, particularly children.",M4
15931948,"Sources of data for rural health research: development of an inventory of Canadian databases.Secondary data sources can often be used to help address questions about the health status, health behavior, health resources allocation, and utilization of health services of rural Canadians. But the task of deciding which Canadian databases are amenable to rural health research remains a challenge. As part of a larger research project titled  Canada's Rural Communities: Understanding Rural Health and Its Determinants,  an inventory of 51 Canadian databases that have the potential of being used for rural health research was compiled, and it continues to be maintained and updated. The websites maintained by two of Canada's leading statistical data centers were systematically searched, along with other published articles and national reports, to produce this inventory. The criteria used to determine which data sources to include in this inventory are: (1) databases containing data at the national level that can be accessed by researchers, (2) databases containing data that are relevant to a variety of rural health issues, and (3) databases containing data that could be partitioned into rural and non-rural geographies. Detailed information is available by searching the inventory of national rural health research-related databases through the internet (www.cranhr.<e>ca</e>) or by contacting the lead author of this article. This article examines some of the issues in developing this resource and demonstrates the usefulness of its contents to Canadian and other rural health researchers.",M4
16079421,"Implementation of community-based public access defibrillation in the PAD trial.BACKGROUND: The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) Trial was a randomized, controlled trial designed to measure survival to hospital discharge following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-<e>CA</e>) in community facilities trained and equipped to provide PAD, compared with community facilities trained to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) without any capacity for defibrillation. OBJECTIVES: To report the implementation of community-based lay responder emergency response programs in 1,260 participating facilities recruited for the PAD Trial in the United States and Canada. METHODS: This was a descriptive study of the characteristics of participating facilities, volunteers, and automated external defibrillator (AED) placements compiled by the PAD Trial, and a qualitative study of factors that facilitated or impeded implementation of emergency lay responder programs using focus groups of PAD Trial site coordinators. RESULTS: The PAD Trial enrolled 1,260 community facilities (14.8% residential), with 20,400 lay volunteers (mean +/- standard deviation = 13.4 +/- 10.7 per facility) trained to respond to OOH-CA. The 598 locations randomized to receive AEDs required 2.7 +/- 1.8 AEDs per facility. Volunteer attrition was high, 36% after two years. Barriers to recruitment and implementation included identification of appropriate  at-risk  facilities, lack of interest or fear of litigation by a facility key decision maker, lack of motivated potential volunteer responders, training and retraining resource requirements, and lack of an existing communication/response infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that implementation of community-based lay responder programs is feasible in many types of facilities, although these programs require substantial resources and commitment, and many barriers to implementation of effective PAD programs exist.",M4
15912726,"An investigation of the construct of competence: a comparison of the FIT, the MacCAT-<e>CA</e>, and the MacCAT-T.The 1990s witnessed Supreme Court decisions in both Canada and the United States on issues of competence that went against longstanding case law, psychological research, and common sense. These decisions held that there is to be one standard for all types of criminal competencies. The present research attempts to investigate whether this is an appropriate assumption and thus tests whether there are one or more constructs that underlie different types of competence. Two divergent types of competence were examined, competence to stand trial (both Canadian and American conceptualizations) and competence to consent to treatment, to determine if these different types of competence share a common underlying construct. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test this question and results indicate that there is a common construct that underlies different types of competence.",M4
15915082,"Concerns in a primary care population about genetic discrimination by insurers.PURPOSE: Fear of genetic discrimination might deter participation in research or therapy. This is a major impetus for laws limiting insurers' use of genetic information, yet there is little information about the extent of this fear in the general population and how it varies by social factors. METHODS: This study measures concern about insurance problems relating to genetic testing, as part of primary-care screening for hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload). Data come from a multiethnic, primary care-based survey of 86,859 adults in five field centers in the United States (AL, <e>CA</e>, DC, HI, OR), and one in Canada (Ontario). Logistic regression was used to model the probability of agreeing to the question  Genetic testing is not a good idea because you might have trouble getting or keeping your insurance. RESULTS: Overall, 40.0% of participants agreed. Adjusting for other characteristics, African Americans and Asians were much less likely (OR = 0.52 and 0.39), and Hispanics were more likely (OR = 1.124), than Caucasians to express concern about insurance discrimination. Participants under 65 years old, US residents, and those without a high school diploma were substantially more likely to be concerned (ORs ranging from 1.4-1.6), as were participants with lower mental health scores. Education showed a nonlinear relationship, with significantly higher concern among both those with less than a high school education and those with a college degree, compared to high school graduates. CONCLUSIONS: Concern about genetic discrimination varies substantially by race and other demographic factors and by nationality. One possible explanation for lower concern about Canadians and by people over 64 is that both groups are covered by social insurance for health care (Medicare). However, US residents in states with some legal protections against genetic discrimination had more, not less, concern than either Canadians or US residents in states with no legal protections.",M4
15648764,"Influence of natural organic matter source on acute copper, lead, and cadmium toxicity to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).Natural organic matter (NOM) was concentrated from various sites across Canada using a portable reverse-osmosis unit to obtain a range of NOM types, from mainly allochthonous (terrestrially derived) to mainly autochthonous (aquatically derived) NOM. The addition of NOM to Cu exposures in ion-poor water always decreased Cu toxicity to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, approximately 1 g) over a 96-h period, and the degree of protection varied with respect to NOM source. A good correlation was found between the specific absorbance coefficient (SAC) and time to reach 50% mortality (LT50; p &lt; 0.001), indicating that more optically dark, allochthonous-like NOM decreases Cu toxicity better than does optically light, more autochthonous-like NOM. A similar, good relationship between NOM source and Pb toxicity was seen (p &lt; 0.001), once confounding effects of <e>Ca</e> binding to NOM were accounted for. No significant relationship between Cd toxicity and NOM optical quality was seen (p = 0.082), and in toxicity tests with Cd the presence of some of the NOM sources increased Cd toxicity compared to Cd-only controls. Specific absorbance coefficients were used as a proxy measurement of NOM aromaticity in our study, and fluorescence indices were run on some NOM samples to obtain percent aromaticity for each sample. A good correlation was found between SAC and percent aromaticity, indicating that the simple SAC measurement is a reasonable indication of NOM aromaticity and of metal binding by NOM.",M4
15910344,"Herbal and homeopathic medication use in pediatric surgical patients.BACKGROUND: Patients who present for surgery may be using herbal or homeopathic preparations; adverse effects of some of these substances include bleeding, cardiovascular changes, and liver dysfunction. Little information is available on the frequency of use in the pediatric surgical population. METHODS: With institutional approval, a survey was conducted to assess the use of vitamins, nutritional supplements, or herbal or homeopathic preparations in children presenting for surgery in five geographically diverse centers in the USA. RESULTS: A total of 894 completed surveys showed that overall, 3.5% of pediatric surgical patients had been given herbal or homeopathic medications in the 2 weeks prior to surgery. Most substances were prescribed by parents. The use of these medications did not differ between children with coexisting diseases and those without; use was also not different among ethnic groups or by residence setting (city, suburban, rural). There was a significant difference between the west coast centers in the study compared with the rest of the country (7.5% of patients in Palo Alto, <e>CA</e>; 5.5% of patients in Seattle, WA; 1.5% of patients in Chicago, IL; and 1.9% in Virginia and Delaware used herbal or homeopathic remedies). The most prevalent substance given to children presenting for elective surgery was Echinacea. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal and homeopathic medications are used by a small percentage of pediatric patients presenting for elective pediatric surgery patients. Use of these substances should be addressed in the preoperative history.",M4

15506187,"Atmospheric mercury accumulation rates between 5900 and 800 calibrated years BP in the High Arctic of Canada recorded by peat hummocks.In this paper, we present the first comprehensive long-term record of preanthropogenic rates of atmospheric mercury accumulation in dated peat deposits for the High Arctic of Canada. Geochemical studies of two peat hummocks from Bathurst Island, Nunavut reveal substantial inputs from soil dust (titanium), marine aerosols (bromine), and mineral-water interactions (uranium). Mercury, however, was supplied to these peat mounds exclusively by atmospheric deposition. Mercury concentration measurements and age dating of the peat profiles indicate rather constant natural  background  mercury flux of <e>ca</e>. 1 microgram per square meter per year from 5900 to 800 calibrated years BP. These values are well within the range of the mercury fluxes reported from other Arctic locations, but also by peat cores from southern Canada that provide a record of atmospheric Hg accumulation extending back 8000 years. Thus, preanthropogenic Hg fluxes in the Arctic were not significantly different from atmospheric Hg fluxes in the temperate zone. In preindustrial times, therefore, the High Arctic was no more important as a sink for global atmospheric mercury than was the temperate zone.",M4
15529059,"Public defibrillation: increased survival from a structured response system.The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled study designed to compare the number of persons surviving to hospital discharge after experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-<e>CA</e>) among  community units  randomized to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) only or CPR plus an automated external defibrillator (AED). In 24 centers across the United States and Canada, 993 community units, composed of 1260 individual facilities, trained more than 19,000 layperson responders in CPR-only or CPR+AED. Survival to hospital discharge in the CPR+AED arm was double that of the CPR-only arm (30 vs 15, P = .03; RR = 2.0, 95% CI [1.07-3.77]). Intense focus on facility infrastructure, including responder recruitment and training, communication, evaluation, and oversight, was necessary for implementing the emergency response systems for the trial. Use of an AED within this structured response system can increase the number of survivors to hospital discharge after OOH-CA. Trained nonmedical responders can use AEDs safely and effectively.",M4
15274043,"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene is associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component, and may involve autoimmune processes. Support for this latter hypothesis comes from the identification of a subgroup of children, described by the term pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), with onset of OCD symptoms following streptococcal infections. Genes involved in immune response therefore represent possible candidate genes for OCD, including the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene, which plays an important role in mediating the complement cascade in the immune system. Four polymorphisms in the MOG gene, a dinucleotide <e>CA</e> repeat (MOG2), a tetranucleotide TAAA repeat (MOG4), and 2 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms, C1334T and C10991T, were investigated for the possibility of association with OCD using 160 nuclear families with an OCD proband. We examined the transmission of alleles of these four polymorphisms with the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). A biased transmission of the 459-bp allele (allele 2: chi2 = 5.255, P = 0.022) of MOG4 was detected, while MOG2, C1334T, and C10991T showed no statistically significant bias in the transmission of alleles. The transmission of the C1334T.MOG2.C10991T.MOG4 haplotype 1.13.2.2 (chi2 = 6.426, P = 0.011) was also significant. Quantitative analysis using the family-based association test (FBAT) was significant for MOG4 in total Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale severity score (allele 2: z = 2.334, P = 0.020). Further investigations combining genetic, pathological, and pharmacological strategies, are warranted.",M4
15297482,"Molecular typing and distribution of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Eastern Canadian dairy herds.Macrorestriction analysis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to type and estimate genetic relationships among 288 Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from 58 Eastern Canadian dairy herds. In addition, a subset of the collection was phage typed and evaluated for sensitivity to 10 antimicrobial compounds. Of 288 isolates recovered, 29 distinct PFGE types were identified. Based on estimates of genetic relationships, the PFGE types were assigned to six lineage groups, designated A through F. Of all of the isolates, <e>ca</e>. 93% were assigned to lineage groups A, D, or F. In 58.6% of herds, only a single PFGE type was recovered, while the remainder had two to four types. Of the 212 isolates evaluated for antimicrobial resistance, 24.5% were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to penicillin (9.9%) was most common, followed by resistance to sulfadimethoxine (7.5%). Isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics were rare. A total of 63% of isolates responded to phages from groups 1 and 3, and 32.8% could not be typed with any of the phage strains used. The other 4.1% belonged to a variety of phage types. Most of the PFGE lineage group A and F isolates corresponded to phage groups 3 and 1, respectively, and most group D isolates were not typeable. PFGE typing had better discriminatory power than phage typing in defining the relatedness of the S. aureus isolates. Distribution of PFGE types and phage types was independent across regions and within herds.",M4
15210296,"Characterization and profiling of hepatic cytochromes P450 and phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from the St. Lawrence River Estuary and the Canadian Arctic.Cytochromes P450 (CYP, phase I) and conjugating (phase II) enzymes can be induced by and influence the toxicokinetics (metabolism) and toxicity of xenobiotic contaminants in exposed organisms. Beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) from the endangered St. Lawrence (SL) River Estuary population exhibit deleterious health effects and various severe pathologies that have been associated with contaminant exposure. In contrast, such effects (e.g. reproductive and immunological impairment) are generally less frequent in less exposed populations in the Canadian Arctic (<e>CA</e>). In the present study, opportunistic sampling resulted in the collection immediately after death of liver tissue from a single female neonate SL beluga (SL6) and male and female CA beluga (n=10) from the Arviat region of western Hudson Bay, in addition to sampling of stranded carcasses of male and female SL beluga (n=5) at least 12 h postmortem. We immunologically characterized cross-reactive proteins of hepatic microsomal CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP3A, CYP2E, epoxide hydrolase (EH) and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) isozymes. Cross-reactive proteins were found in all SL and CA beluga using anti-rat CYP1A1, anti-rainbow trout CYP3A, anti-human CYP2E1, anti-rabbit EH and anti-human UDPGT1A1 polyclonal antibodies (Abs), whereas faintly cross-reactive CYP2B proteins were only found in SL6 and the CA samples using an anti-rabbit CYP2B1 Ab. In corresponding catalytic activity assessments, only SL6 and all CA beluga microsomal samples exhibited CYP1A-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity (51-260 pmol/mg/min), CYP3A-mediated activity (113-899 pmol/mg/min) based on the formation of 6beta-hydroxytestosterone using a testosterone hydroxylase assay, and UDPGT activity (830-4956 pmol/mg/min) based on 1-naphthylglucuronide formation. The marginal cross-reactivity with the anti-CYP2B1 Ab and lack of catalytically measurable hydroxytestosterone isomers associated with CYP2B-type activity in all the SL and CA animals is suggestive of low CYP2B-type enzyme expression in beluga. The absence of measurable total P450 enzyme levels and catalytic activities in samples from the stranded SL belugas suggested catalytically inactive enzymes as a consequence of tissue degradation related due to the time delay of sample collection after death. However, all SL and CA animals demonstrated similar, immunologically cross-reactive phase I and II hepatic enzyme profiles, which is suggestive of the importance of metabolism in the toxicokinetics and fate of xenobiotics in animals from both populations",M4

DESIGN: A prospective, observational inception cohort pretest and posttest design was used. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary community cardiac center in Toronto, Canada. MEASURES: Disease-specific HRQL was measured using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at baseline (Time 1 [T1]) and 1 week before CA (Time 2 [T2]). The association between time on the waiting list and subjects' perceived anxiety was analyzed. RESULTS: Paired-sample t tests comparing mean anxiety levels at T1 and T2 indicated a statistically significant increase in anxiety levels at T2 that did not seem to be related to the waiting time for CA (P =.000). Comparison of mean Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores at T1 and T2 indicated a trend toward deterioration in HRQL over time.

14963373,"Biological age and 12-year cognitive change in older adults: findings from the Victoria Longitudinal Study.BACKGROUND: Although recent cross-sectional findings indicate that markers of biological age (BA) mediate chronological age (<e>CA</e>) differences in cognitive performance, little is known about their influence on actual cognitive changes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation is to examine CA and BA as predictors of 12-year cognitive change in a longitudinal sample of older adults. METHODS: Data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS) were examined for 125 adults between 67 and 95 years of age. Biomarkers, including visual and auditory acuity, grip strength, peak expiratory flow, blood pressure, and body mass index, were submitted to a factor analysis and a composite BA variable was computed based on factor loadings. Intraindividual change across 5 waves of measurement (3-year intervals) was examined as a function of CA and BA for 5 cognitive domains: verbal processing speed, working memory, reasoning, episodic memory, and semantic memory. RESULTS: The latent structure of biomarkers was consistent with previous investigations of functional age and a common factor view of biological aging. Results of hierarchical linear modeling showed that BA predicted actual cognitive change (decline) independent of CA. CONCLUSIONS: As a predictor of cognitive performance in late life, CA is a proxy for biological and environmental influences. We have shown that biological influences are independent predictors of actual cognitive change in older adults. This supports the view that cognitive decline is not due to aging per se, but rather is likely due to causal factors that operate along the age continuum.",M4

This rapid diagnostic assay (UTIscreen, Coral Biotechnology, San Diego, <e>CA</e>) utilizes a luciferin-luciferase reaction to detect bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is currently commercially available for screening bacteriuria in urine specimens. One hundred and twenty-eight BAL samples were examined microscopically with Gram's stain and tested in parallel using the bacterial ATP assay and standard quantitative culture. The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the detection of bacteria &gt;/=10(4) cfu/ml in BAL specimens for the bacterial ATP assay was 87%, 59%, 39%, and 94%, and for the Gram's stain was 73%, 65%, 39%, and 89%, respectively. The diagnostic utility was improved by combining the results of Gram's stain/bacterial ATP assay results with Sn, Sp, PPV, and NPV of 97%, 38%, 32%, and 97% respectively.

After a four-week exposure to soil spiked with lead acetate, earthworm neutral red retention time (NRRT). soil Pb concentrations, and earthworm Pb body burdens were measured. Lysosomal NRRT was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.0001), and NRRT was negatively correlated with earthworm Pb body burdens (r = -0.80, p &lt; 0.0001). To evaluate the effects of aged Pb, earthworms were exposed to soil from three skeet ranges, and responses were compared with three matched reference sites. After a four-week exposure, NRRT, growth, fecundity, soil total Pb levels, and earthworm Pb body burdens were measured. The potentially bioavailable fraction of Pb in these sites was measured using a <e>Ca</e>(NO3)2 extraction. Growth and fecundity did not differ significantly between any of the skeet ranges and their reference sites. However, NRRT was significantly reduced in all three ranges compared with their respective reference sites (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that the neutral red retention assay (NRRA) may be useful for detecting toxicity and potential hazards at Pb-contaminated sites. Lysosomal NRRT was negatively correlated with soil Ca(NO3)2-extractable Pb (r = -0.80, p &lt; 0.0001) and soil total Pb (r = -0.73, p = 0.001).

14570427,"Plant phenology in western Canada: trends and links to the view from space.One feature of climate change is the trends to earlier spring onset in many north temperate areas of the world. The timing of spring flowering and leafing of perennial plants is largely controlled by temperature accumulation; both temperature and phenological records illustrate changes in recent decades. Phenology studies date back over a century, with extensive databases existing for western Canada. Earlier spring flowering has been noted for many woody plants, with larger trends seen for species that develop at spring's start. Implications for ecosystems of trends to earlier spring arrival include changes in plant species composition, changes in timing and distribution of pests and disease, and potentially disrupted ecological interactions. While Alberta has extensive phenology databases (for species, years, and geographic coverage) for recent decades, these data cannot provide continuous ground coverage. There is great potential for phenological data to provide ground validation for satellite imagery interpretation, especially as new remote sensors are becoming available. Phenological networks are experiencing a resurgence of interest in Canada (www.plantwatch.<e>ca</e>) and globally, and linking these ground-based observations with the view from space will greatly enhance our capacity to track the biotic response to climate changes.",M4

Resources were included if they contained information about open, active cancer clinical trials available in Canada. Web sites reviewed were not limited to those based in Canada. For each eligible resource, the number of listed trials and the proportion of trials identified were calculated. RESULTS: Of 30 Web sites identified, 8 met all of the inclusion criteria; 3 were based in Canada and 5 in the United States. The total number of breast cancer trials identified as being available in Canada was 28. The Physician Data Query (PDQ) Clinical Trials Database of the US National Cancer Institute (cancer.gov/search/clinical_trials) identified 86% (24/28). The database of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) (ctg.queensu.<e>ca</e>) identified 29% (8/28) of the available breast cancer trials. CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing Service (centerwatch.com) identified 4% (1/28). INTERPRETATION: If the PDQ database included all of the NCIC CTG trials, it would become the most complete database of breast cancer clinical trials currently available in Canada. Online cancer data sources should strive to make access to clinical trials simpler and more reliable, particularly for residents of the country where the trial is to be conducted.",M4

The guidelines are based on the best information available at the time of publication; where scientific evidence was not available, best-accepted practice is presented.",M4
12677276,"Introduction to the Canadian Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Team's (CCORT) Canadian Cardiovascular Atlas project.The Canadian Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Team's (CCORT) Canadian Cardiovascular Atlas project was developed to provide Canadians with a national report on the state of cardiovascular health and health services in Canada. Written by a group of Canada's leading experts in cardiovascular outcomes research, the CCORT cardiac Atlas will cover a wide variety of topics ranging from cardiac risk factors and cardiac mortality rates to the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure and the outcomes of invasive cardiac procedures across Canada. Data in the Atlas will be presented at a national, provincial and health region level. The Atlas will be published as a series of 20 articles and chapters in future issues of The Canadian Journal of Cardiology and on CCORT's web site (www.ccort.<e>ca</e>). The journal version of the Atlas chapters will be written for a clinical audience and will include editorials written by invited experts, whereas the web-based version of each chapter will be written for a more general audience and will include additional supplemental information (for example, interactive colour maps and tables) that cannot be included in the journal version. Material from the Journal and the web will eventually be compiled into a book that will be distributed across Canada. This article serves as an introduction to the Atlas project and describes the rationale for and objectives of the CCORT national cardiac Atlas project.",M4
12705913,"Polycyclic aromatic musk compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents of Canada and Sweden--first results.Polycyclic musk fragrances (PMF) are widely used fragrances for cosmetics and other personal and household care products. Quantitative data on PMF (HHCB-Galaxolide, AHTN-Tonalide, ATTI-Traseolide, AHMI-Phantolide, ADBI-Celestolide, and DPMI-Cashmeran) and the most prominent nitro musks (Musk Xylene-MX, and Musk Ketone-MK) in different wastewater treatment effluents in Canada and Sweden are presented to provide preliminary information on the variations within the emission pattern of these compounds. In all samples HHCB and AHTN were detected at concentrations of up to 1300 and 520 ngl(-1), respectively. ADBI, AHMI were also present, but close to the detection limit. The other PMF DPMI, ATTI, and more surprisingly musk ketone and musk xylene were not detected in any sample analysed. In comparison the samples from Canada were contaminated at a higher level than the Swedish samples, by a maximum factor of <e>ca</e> 10 for HHCB and AHTN.",M4

These lay volunteers, who have no traditional responsibility to respond to a medical emergency as part of their primary job description, will form part of a comprehensive, integrated community approach to the treatment of OOH-CA. The study is being conducted at 24 field centers in the United States and Canada. Approximately 1000 community units (e.g. apartment or office buildings, gated communities, sports facilities, senior centers, shopping malls, etc.) were randomized to treatment by trained laypersons who will provide either cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) alone or CPR plus use of an AED, while awaiting arrival of the community's emergency medical services responders. The primary endpoint is the number of OOH-CA victims who survive to hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints include neurological status, health-related quality of life (HRQL), cost, and cost-effectiveness. Data collection will last approximately 15 months and is expected to be completed in September 2003.",M4
12647940,"The burden of COPD in Canada: results from the Confronting COPD survey.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition characterized by progressive airflow limitation, with symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, and sputum production. Aside from information on prevalence, mortality and hospital resource utilization arising from COPD in Canada, there is a lack of data on the impact of the disease on primary care healthcare resource utilization and the economic burden of the disease (i.e. direct and indirect costs). Canada is not unusual in this respect, as surprisingly few studies have attempted to quantify the impact of COPD on the healthcare system and society in other countries. In an attempt to address the need for information on the burden of COPD, an economic analysis of data from a large-scale international survey, Confronting COPD in North America and Europe, was conducted in Canada and six other countries. The results of the Canadian survey estimated the direct cost of the disease at <e>CA</e> dollar 1997.81 per patient, with over half of this due to inpatient hospitalizations. COPD also had an impact on the economy, with indirect costs amounting to CA dollar 1198.18, a third of the total per patient cost of COPD to society (CA dollar 3195.97). Reducing the impact of this disease will necessitate improvements to the way the disease is managed in primary care, as poor symptom control and frequent exacerbations are key drivers of hospital and other unscheduled care costs. Early diagnosis and the application of available but underused interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, inhaled drug therapies and pulmonary rehabilitation) could reduce the morbidity and costs of COPD in this country.",M4
12376024,"Evaluation of the Coral UTI Screen system for rapid automated screening of significant bacteriuria in a regional centralized laboratory.An evaluation of the Coral UTI screen system (Coral Biotechnology, San Diego, <e>CA</e>) compared to urinalysis/urine culture was done to assess its performance for rapidly screening a high volume of urine samples for significant bacteriuria in a regional central microbiology laboratory. A total of 1094 urine samples from ambulatory patients were evaluated. 670 (61.2%) urine samples were negative or positive [178 (16.3%)] by both methods. 217 (19.8%) other samples were UTI screen positive but had either no growth or no uropathogens on culture; 9 of these samples were possibly false negative by culture because of the presence of pyuria, indicating the presence of either a urinary tract infection or another inflammatory process. Another 29 (2.7%) samples had false negative screens because the urine culture was positive, but only 5 of these patients were treated with antibiotics after urine specimen collection. Overall, the Coral UTI screen has a sensitivity of 86.0%, a specificity of 75.5% and a positive and negative predictive value of 45.0% and 95.9% respectively. Routine use of the UTI screen would allow same day reporting of 65% of all urine culture results without having to proceed to culture.",M4
12568538,"Multielement analysis of Canadian wines by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and multivariate statistics.Trace element fingerprints were deciphered for wines from Canada's two major wine-producing regions, the Okanagan Valley and the Niagara Peninsula, for the purpose of examining differences in wine element composition with region of origin and identifying elements important to determining provenance. Analysis by ICP-MS allowed simultaneous determination of 34 trace elements in wine (Li, Be, Mg, Al, P, Cl, <e>Ca</e>, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, I, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th, and U) at low levels of detection, and patterns in trace element concentrations were deciphered by multivariate statistical analysis. The two regions were discriminated with 100% accuracy using 10 of these elements. Differences in soil chemistry between the Niagara and Okanagan vineyards were evident, without a good correlation between soil and wine composition. The element Sr was found to be a good indicator of provenance and has been reported in fingerprinting studies of other regions.",M4
12087568,"Randomized, controlled trial of darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients.BACKGROUND: Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, <e>CA</e>) is a new erythropoiesis-stimulating protein with a threefold longer terminal half-life than recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study is to determine whether darbepoetin alfa is as effective as epoetin for the treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients when administered at a reduced dosing frequency. METHODS: Patients receiving epoetin therapy were randomized to continue epoetin administered intravenously (IV) three times weekly (n = 338) or change to darbepoetin alfa administered IV once weekly (n = 169). The dose of darbepoetin alfa or epoetin was individually titrated to maintain hemoglobin concentrations within -1.0 to +1.5 g/dL (-10 to +15 g/L) of patients' baseline values and within a range of 9.0 to 13.0 g/dL (90 to 130 g/L) for up to 28 weeks (20-week dose-titration period followed by an 8-week evaluation period). The primary end point was change in hemoglobin level between baseline and the evaluation period (weeks 21 to 28). RESULTS: Mean changes in hemoglobin levels from baseline to the evaluation period were 0.24 +/- 0.10 (SE) g/dL (2.4 +/- 1.0 g/L) in the darbepoetin alfa group and 0.11 +/- 0.07 g/dL (1.1 +/- 0.7 g/L) in the epoetin group, a difference of 0.13 g/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.08 +/- 0.33 [1.3 g/L; 95% CI, -0.8 to 3.3]). This difference was not statistically significant or clinically relevant despite the reduced frequency of darbepoetin alfa administration. The safety profile of darbepoetin alfa was similar to that of epoetin, and no antibody formation to either treatment was detected. CONCLUSION: These results show that darbepoetin alfa maintains hemoglobin concentrations as effectively and safely as epoetin in patients with CKD, but with a reduced dosing frequency.",M4
12227936,"Survey of bottled drinking waters sold in Canada for chlorate, bromide, bromate, lead, cadmium and other trace elements.Mineral, spring and other bottled drinking waters sold in Canada in the winter of 1995-96 were surveyed for chlorate, bromide, bromate, Cr(VI), Li, B, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba, Be, V, Cr, Co, Ni, As, Se, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Tl, Pb, Na, K, <e>Ca</e> and Mg. Chlorate and bromide were determined by ion chromatography (IC) with conductivity detection, Cr(VI) by IC with colorimetric detection, bromate by solvent extraction and gas chromatography (GC), trace elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and Na, K, Ca and Mg by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAA). Most chemicals in the 199 samples analysed were well within national and international drinking water guidelines. World Health Organization and/or Canadian drinking water guidelines were exceeded for B (22 samples), Al (9), Cr (1), Mn (5), Ni (1), As (10), Se (24) and Pb (1). Bromate levels are reported for information purposes and are considered as the maximum concentrations in the samples. In three distilled water products, unexpectedly high concentrations of Cu (88-147 micro g l(-1)) and Ni (16-35 micro g l(-1)) were found, and a comparison of distilled and non-distilled waters from two of the brands suggested the likely cause to be contamination during the distillation process. Li concentration in one sample was at a therapeutic dose and could pose an overdose risk to individuals on Li medication.",M4
11881922,"Investigation of genotype x country interactions for growth traits in beef cattle.The importance of genotype x country interactions for weaning and birth weight and postweaning gain between Argentina (AR), Canada (<e>CA</e>), Uruguay (UY), and the United States (US) for populations of Hereford cattle was investigated. Three sample data sets of computationally manageable sizes were formed for each trait and pairwise combination of countries to investigate possible interactions. Parameters were estimated for each sample data set via an accelerated EM-REML algorithm and multiple-trait animal models that considered either weaning or birth weight as a different trait in each country. Direct and maternal (in parentheses) weaning weight genetic correlation estimates for AR-CA, AR-UY, AR-US, CA-UY, CA-US, and UY-US were 0.82 (0.80), 0.81 (0.72), 0.81 (0.79), 0.83 (0.78), 0.85 (0.82), and 0.86 (0.81), respectively. Direct and maternal (in parentheses) birth weight genetic correlation estimates were 0.92 (0.62), 0.97, (0.85), and 0.99 (0.97) for AR-CA, AR-US, and CA-US, respectively. Birth weight was not analyzed for UY due to small amounts of data. Postweaning gain in CA and US was 160-d gain, and in AR and UY 345-d gain was used. Across-country direct genetic correlations for postweaning gain were estimated for each pairwise country data set using a model that considered weaning weight as the same trait across each country, whereas postweaning gain was treated as a different trait in each country. Direct genetic correlation estimates for postweaning gain for AR-CA, AR-UY, AR-US, CA-UY, CA-US, and US-UY were 0.64, 0.80, 0.51, 0.84, 0.92, and 0.83, respectively. The overall results indicate that weaning and birth weights of Hereford calves can be analyzed as the same trait in all countries with a common set of heritabilities and genetic correlations, after adjustment for heterogenous phenotypic variances across countries. Postweaning gain in CA and US can be considered as the same trait and analyzed using a single set of parameters. Postweaning gain in AR and UY should be considered as a separate trait from postweaning gain in CA and US, and postweaning gain in AR and UY can be considered as the same trait and analyzed using a common heritability, after adjustment for phenotypic variance differences between the two countries.",M4

11596835,"Cost effectiveness in Canada of a multidrug prepackaged regimen (Hp-PAC)+ for Helicobacter pylori eradication.OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a multidrug prepackaged regimen for Helicobacter pylori, the Hp-PAC (lansoprazole 30mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, all twice daily), relative to alternative pharmacological strategies in the management of confirmed duodenal ulcer over a 1-year period from 2 perspectives: (i) a strict healthcare payer perspective (Ontario Ministry of Health) excluding the patient copayment; and (ii) a healthcare payer perspective including the patient copayment. DESIGN: A decision-analytical model was developed to estimate expected per patient costs [1998 Canadian dollars ($ Can)], weeks without ulcer and symptomatic ulcer recurrences for the Hp-PAC compared with: proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-clarithromycin-amoxicillin (PPI-<e>CA</e>), PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole (PPI-CM), PPI-amoxicillin-metronidazole (PPI-AM) and ranitidine-bismuthmetronidazole-tetracycline (RAN-BMT). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: All PPI-based regimens had higher expected costs but better outcomes relative to RAN-BMT. From a strict healthcare payer perspective, PPI-CM ($Can 209) yielded lower expected costs than PPI-CA ($Can 221) and slightly lower costs than Hp-PAC ($Can 211). However, these 3 regimens all shared identical outcomes (51.2 weeks without ulcer). When the current Ontario, Canada, $Can 2 patient copayment was added to the dispensing fee, Hp-PAC yielded lower costs ($Can 214) than PPI-CM ($Can 216). CONCLUSION: From a strict healthcare payer perspective, Hp-PAC is weakly dominated by PPI-CM with an incremental cost effectiveness (relative to RAN-BMT) of $Can 5.77 per ulcer week averted. When the patient copayment is added to this perspective, Hp-PAC weakly dominates PPI-CM ($Can 5 per ulcer week averted). Regardless of perspective, Hp-PAC and PPI-CM differed by only $Can 2 per patient over 1 year and the expected time without ulcer was 51.2 weeks for both. More data on the clinical and statistical differences in H. pylori eradication with Hp-PAC and PPI-CM would be useful. This analysis does not in clude the possible advantage of Hp-PAC in terms of compliance and antibacterial resistance.",M4

Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network.The objective of this study is to decide if chemical concentrations measured during 1988-1997 in precipitation by the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) indicate changes in the annual patterns. The inference is based on SO4, NO3, Cl, NH4, Na, <e>Ca</e> and K concentrations monitored daily with the rain water acidity pH. By pattern is understood the probability distribution of the annual sample at a particular location. Most of the annual data can be well described by means of a linear regression model with second order polynomial trend and autocorrelated noise. Statistical analysis based on the model shows luck of systematic significant year to year increases or declines of the concentrations.",M4
10947098,"Investigation of genotype x environment interactions for weaning weight for Herefords in three countries.The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of genotype x environment interactions for weaning weight (WWT) between different regions of the United States (US) and between Canada (<e>CA</e>), Uruguay (UY), and US for populations of Hereford cattle. Original data were composed of 487,661, 102,986, and 2,322,722 edited weaning weight records from CA, UY, and US, respectively. A total of 359 sires were identified as having progeny across all three countries; 240 of them had at least one progeny with a record in each environment. The data sets within each country were reduced by retaining records from herds with more than 500 WWT records, with an average contemporary group size of greater than nine animals, and that contained WWT records from progeny or maternal grand-progeny of the across-country sires. Data sets within each country were further reduced by randomly selecting among remaining herds. Four regions within US were defined: Upper Plains (UP), Cornbelt (CB), South (S), and Gulf Coast (GC). Similar sampling criteria and common international sires were used to form the within-US regional data sets. A pairwise analysis was done between countries and regions within US (UP-CB vs S-GC, UP vs CB, and S vs GC) for the estimation of (co)variance components and genetic correlation between environments. An accelerated EM-REML algorithm and a multiple-trait animal model that considered WWT as a different trait in each environment were used to estimate parameters in each pairwise analysis. Direct and maternal (in parentheses) estimated genetic correlations for CA vs UY, CA vs US, US vs UY, UP-CB vs S-GC, UP vs CB, and S vs GC were .88 (.84), .86 (.82), .90 (.85), .88 (.87), .88 (.84), and .87 (.85), respectively. The general absence of genotype x country interactions observed in this study, together with a prior study that showed the similarity of genetic and environmental parameters across the three countries, strongly indicates that a joint WWT genetic evaluation for Hereford cattle could be conducted using a model that treated the information from CA, UY, and US as a single population using single population-wide genetic parameters.",M4

Bacteriological characteristics were the same for all five isolates. The colonies were typical of Brucella spp., but took 2 to 5 days longer than the traditional species to appear on primary isolation media. Biotyping results did not match any of the known biovars of Brucella, but were similar to isolates of the genus Brucella previously reported from marine mammals inhabiting other areas of the northern hemisphere. This is the first confirmed report of brucellosis in marine mammals from Canada, and the first report of this organism in ringed and harp seals.",M4

Pentostatin was administered intravenously in cycles of 4 mg/m2 weekly x 3 repeated every 8 weeks. Patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) received two further cycles for consolidation. Of 28 evaluable patients, 25 achieved a CR and three a partial remission. Twenty-three patients are alive at a median follow-up duration of 118 months (range, 55 to 133 months). Of the 25 patients who achieved a CR, 14 (56%) remain in CR at a median of 119 months (range, 109 to 133 months) from the time of CR. Nine additional patients relapsed at a median time of 49 months (range, 15 to 122 months). Only three of the relapsed patients have required treatment: two patients who received cladribine achieved CRs; the third received interferon-alpha and died from hairy cell leukemia. The three patients in partial remission continue to have normal blood counts at 58, 105, and 120 months. Five patients have developed a second malignancy: one mycosis fungoides and four solid tumors. Three patients died from the second malignancies. There were no treatment-related deaths due to toxicity or opportunistic infection.

10635596,"Essential elements and priority contaminants in liver, kidney, muscle and blubber of harp seal beaters.Concentrations of 22 elements were determined in blubber, liver, kidney and muscle of five male and five female, 8-month-old harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) by ICP-MS. Young harp seals are hunted during the spring and fall and represent an important traditional dietary item for some northern fishing communities. Interest in the commercial use of seal meat products and the limited data on the level of contaminants in tissues of harp seal beaters motivated our investigation. For most elements, concentrations in liver or kidney were greater than those in muscle. Blubber concentrations were generally lowest, but concentrations of Li, As, Sr, Ba and Pb were highest in blubber. Largest concentration factors [(tissue)/(water) &gt; 10,000] were seen for P, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Se, Mn, Ag, Pb and Co, a list that includes essential elements such as Fe and Zn, as well as several important contaminants such as Cd and Pb. Differences in concentration between male and female seals were only seen in eight of 88 element/tissue comparisons. Any effects of environmental exposure due to location or dietary intake are difficult to detect. Principle component analysis shows an association of <e>Ca</e> with Sr and P with S; and also a distinct grouping of the elements V, Mo, Cu and Ag.",M4
10570841,"Potential of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) as a bioindicator of manganese arising from the use of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl in unleaded gasoline.Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is an organic manganese (Mn) compound currently added to unleaded gasoline in Canada. It has been suggested that the combustion of MMT containing Mn could cause various deleterious health effects in animals and humans at very high concentrations. This study evaluates the potential of dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) as bioindicators of Mn environmental contamination. Samples were picked at three different distances from a highway: a highly exposed site (E++), a lightly exposed site (E+) and a control site (E), located respectively at 10, 50 and 100 m. The total Mn, Mg, <e>Ca</e>, Al, Fe and Zn concentrations were measured in the soils and in the plants (flower, stem, leaves and root) by neutron activation analysis. Exchangeable Mn was measured in soils by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mn concentrations of the different parts of the plant and exchangeable Mn in soils were not correlated with distance from the roadway and, thus, do not seem to be a sensitive indicator of Mn contamination. Soil Mn concentrations were correlated with distance from the roadway. This suggests the hypothesis that the environmental fate of Mn from MMT sources could be associated with an increased total Mn in soil but does not lead to an increase in exchangeable Mn.",M4
10348268,"Pharmacoeconomics of amifostine in ovarian cancer.Physicians are frequently pressured to make therapeutic decisions within a cost-effective framework to demonstrate value to managed care. Because cancer is a chronic disease, health care costs are known to be expensive and physicians must use their resources as efficiently as possible. Historically, economic analyses in oncology have emphasized survival as their clinical end point. Today, both government groups and professional organizations are moving toward making quality of life the clinical end point in determining the economics of chemotherapy. This report evaluates the cost and efficacy of amifostine (Ethyol; Alza Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, <e>CA</e>/US Bioscience, West Conshohocken, PA) use in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer using two pharmacoeconomic analyses. A cost-utility analysis performed in the United States indicated that inclusion of amifostine therapy had both a favorable clinical and cost-utility profile compared with other medical therapies. A second cost-benefit analysis, conducted in Canada, suggested that use of amifostine in patients with advanced ovarian cancer would be cost saving. Amifostine is a novel agent that protects against both chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced toxicities, such as nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, mucositis, and xerostomia. These toxicities are disturbing to both patients and physicians alike. The results of these studies support the use of amifostine as a valuable resource both economically and clinically.",M4
10323651,"Economic evaluation of donepezil for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Canada.BACKGROUND: Donepezil is a new drug recently approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We estimated the cost-effectiveness of donepezil 5 mg daily as an adjunct to usual care in the management of persons with mild-to-moderate AD defined as a Mini-Mental Health State Examination (MMSE) score in the range 10 to 26. METHODS: Treatment effect data as MMSE change-over-baseline scores were obtained from a 30-week placebo-controlled trial of donepezil. MMSE scores beyond observed trial data were estimated using a Markov model with 10 cycles of 24 weeks based on the placebo MMSE progression observed in the trial. Data from AD subjects in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging were used to estimate costs of nursing home care, community services, medications, and caregiver time as a function of MMSE score. A clinic-based cohort study from Alberta was used to estimate the distribution of AD patients by MMSE score presenting for treatment. The effectiveness measure for the economic model was expected time (over 5 years) spent with nonsevere AD (MMSE &gt; or = 10). RESULTS: Over 5 years of treatment, donepezil is predicted to reduce health care costs by <e>CA</e>$929 per patient but increase caregiver time costs by CA$48 per patient for an overall cost saving to society of CA$882 per patient. Patients not receiving donepezil are predicted to spend 2.21 years of the 5 years in nonsevere AD compared with 2.41 years for treated patients (a gain of just over 2 months). Sensitivity analysis reveals that cost savings per patient increase if more AD patients are assumed to survive to 5 years; however, if donepezil treatment continues when patients' MMSE score falls below 10, the incremental cost is higher for treatment at CA$1554 per patient. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited available data, our model predicts that the use of donepezil for mild-to-moderate AD in Canada is associated with lower 5-year costs and less time spent with severe AD when compared with the alternative of usual care with no donepezil therapy. As more reliable long-term data become available, these predictions should be confirmed and/or updated.",M4

METHODS: A search for a mutation in the candidate gene, kerato-epithelin, was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses. RESULTS: AC --&gt; T mutation at position 417 was detected in exon 4 of the kerato-epithelin gene, which is expected to cause an Arg124 --&gt; Cys change. This is the same nucleotide change described previously in two Swiss families with lattice corneal dystrophy type 1. CONCLUSION: Although the possibility that the three families (two previously described Swiss families and this Canadian kindred) are related has not been excluded, it appears that the unique phenotype of lattice corneal dystrophy type 1 is caused by this particular amino acid change.",M4
11487119,"Development of the phytoplankton community in a pit-lake in relation to water quality changes.An open pit-lake was formed at a Northern Saskatchewan mine site after flooding with lake water in early 1992. Since then, water and phytoplankton samples have been collected regularly from the artificial lake over seven years. The resulting data set provides a unique opportunity to examine the physical and chemical changes in water quality and phytoplankton community over time. Seventeen major variables were examined in a principal component analysis. Axes 1, 2 and 4 are significantly correlated to other three variables, the number of days (since the first sampling after flooding of the pit), water temperature and depth, respectively. Total suspended solid (TSS), dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus (Total-P), arsenic, and iron decreased over time while Mg, <e>Ca</e>, K, Na, total organic carbon and HCO3 increased. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to infer the relationship between water quality variables and phytoplankton community structure, which changed substantially over the survey period. TSS, Total-P and arsenic were considered to be the key factors driving the change in phytoplankton community composition.",M4

11339652,"The GM2 gangliosidoses databases: allelic variation at the HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A gene loci.The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of recessive disorders characterized by accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal cells. The genes responsible for these disorders are HEXA (Tay-Sachs disease and variants), HEXB (Sandhoff disease and variants), and GM2A (AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis). We report the establishment of three relational locus-specific databases recording allelic variation at the HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A genes and accessed at the GM2 gangliosidoses home page (http://data.mch.mcgill.<e>ca</e>/gm2-gangliosidoses). Submission forms are available for the addition of new mutations to the databases. The databases are available online for users to search and retrieve information about specific alleles by a number of fields describing mutations, phenotypes, or author(s).",M4
11155396,"Writing a structured abstract.This article is part of the education initiative of the Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal to deliver information that will be of practical use and help to enhance the skills necessary for the continuing professional development of Canadian radiologists. The first article in the continuing professional development skills series is on writing a structured abstract. Future  how to  articles will focus on other skills such as critical appraisal. You can earn CPD credits in section 6 (Educational Development, Teaching and Research) for writing an abstract and in section 4 (Structured Learning Projects) if you use this information for a personal learning project. The call for abstracts for the 2001 CAR Annual Meeting in Vancouver, September 21-23, has gone out. The deadline for submitting abstracts for the meeting is March 31, 2001.
