20527557,"Refraction corrected transmission ultrasound computed <e>tomography</e> for application in breast imaging.PURPOSE: We present an iterative framework for CT reconstruction from transmission ultrasound data which accurately and efficiently models the strong refraction effects that occur in our target application: Imaging the female breast. METHODS: Our refractive ray tracing framework has its foundation in the fast marching method (FNMM) and it allows an accurate as well as efficient modeling of curved rays. We also describe a novel regularization scheme that yields further significant reconstruction quality improvements. A final contribution is the development of a realistic anthropomorphic digital breast phantom based on the NIH Visible Female data set. RESULTS: Our system is able to resolve very fine details even in the presence of significant noise, and it reconstructs both sound speed and attenuation data. Excellent correspondence with a traditional, but significantly more computationally expensive wave equation solver is achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the accurate modeling of curved rays, decisive factors have also been our regularization scheme and the high-quality interpolation filter we have used. An added benefit of our framework is that it accelerates well on GPUs where we have shown that clinical 3D reconstruction speeds on the order of minutes are possible.",M1
20443485,"Monitoring of hemodynamic changes induced in the healthy breast through inspired gas stimuli with MR-guided diffuse optical imaging.PURPOSE: The modulation of tissue hemodynamics has important clinical value in medicine for both tumor diagnosis and therapy. As an oncological tool, increasing tissue oxygenation via modulation of inspired gas has been proposed as a method to improve cancer therapy and determine radiation sensitivity. As a radiological tool, inducing changes in tissue total hemoglobin may provide a means to detect and characterize malignant tumors by providing information about tissue vascular function. The ability to change and measure tissue hemoglobin and oxygenation concentrations in the healthy breast during administration of three different types of modulated gas stimuli (oxygen/ carbogen, air/carbogen, and air/oxygen) was investigated. METHODS: Subjects breathed combinations of gases which were modulated in time. MR-guided diffuse optical <e>tomography</e> measured total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation in the breast every 30 s during the 16 min breathing stimulus. Metrics of maximum correlation and phase lag were calculated by cross correlating the measured hemodynamics with the stimulus. These results were compared to an air/air control to determine the hemodynamic changes compared to the baseline physiology. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that a gas stimulus consisting of alternating oxygen/carbogen induced the largest and most robust hemodynamic response in healthy breast parenchyma relative to the changes that occurred during the breathing of room air. This stimulus caused increases in total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation during the carbogen phase of gas inhalation, and decreases during the oxygen phase. These findings are consistent with the theory that oxygen acts as a vasoconstrictor, while carbogen acts as a vasodilator. However, difficulties in inducing a consistent change in tissue hemoglobin and oxygenation were observed because of variability in intersubject physiology, especially during the air/oxygen or air/carbogen modulated breathing protocols. CONCLUSIONS: MR-guided diffuse optical imaging is a unique tool that can measure tissue hemodynamics in the breast during modulated breathing. This technique may have utility in determining the therapeutic potential of pretreatment tissue oxygenation or in investigating vascular function. Future gas modulation studies in the breast should use a combination of oxygen and carbogen as the functional stimulus. Additionally, control measures of subject physiology during air breathing are critical for robust measurements.",M1

20400810,"Optimization of multiply acquired magnetic flux density B(z) using ICNE-Multiecho train in MREIT.The aim of magnetic resonance electrical impedance <e>tomography</e> (MREIT) is to visualize the electrical properties, conductivity or current density of an object by injection of current. Recently, the prolonged data acquisition time when using the injected current nonlinear encoding (ICNE) method has been advantageous for measurement of magnetic flux density data, Bz, for MREIT in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the ICNE method results in undesirable side artifacts, such as blurring, chemical shift and phase artifacts, due to the long data acquisition under an inhomogeneous static field. In this paper, we apply the ICNE method to a gradient and spin echo (GRASE) multi-echo train pulse sequence in order to provide the multiple k-space lines during a single RF pulse period. We analyze the SNR of the measured multiple B(z) data using the proposed ICNE-Multiecho MR pulse sequence. By determining a weighting factor for B(z) data in each of the echoes, an optimized inversion formula for the magnetic flux density data is proposed for the ICNE-Multiecho MR sequence. Using the ICNE-Multiecho method, the quality of the measured magnetic flux density is considerably increased by the injection of a long current through the echo train length and by optimization of the voxel-by-voxel noise level of the B(z) value. Agarose-gel phantom experiments have demonstrated fewer artifacts and a better SNR using the ICNE-Multiecho method. Experimenting with the brain of an anesthetized dog, we collected valuable echoes by taking into account the noise level of each of the echoes and determined B(z) data by determining optimized weighting factors for the multiply acquired magnetic flux density data.",M1

20307012,"Amygdala lateralization at rest and during viewing of neutral faces in major depressive disorder using low-resolution brain electromagnetic <e>tomography</e>.Neuroimaging experiments of amygdala activity during rest have shown abnormal amygdalar lateralization in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The current study is an exploratory investigation of the use of the neuroimaging technique Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) to measure current source density (CSD) in the amygdala. We examined seven adults with MDD and nine healthy control subjects at rest, and while they viewed images of emotionally neutral faces. The primary purpose was to compare the findings of LORETA with published findings using other neuroimaging techniques. Four frequency bands were examined: delta (1-3 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (7-11 Hz), and beta (11-29 Hz). Results showed that for both MDD and control groups, the right amygdala displayed higher overall activity (across frequencies) than the left, both at rest, and while viewing neutral faces. Results also showed that controls displayed significant differences between resting and viewing neutral images across all four bands in the right amygdala, with all four bands having higher CSD values in the right amygdala. There were no significant differences in CSD values between rest vs. viewing neutral images in the MDD group. Findings suggest a more pronounced lateralization effect in normal healthy controls than in MDD subjects when changing from a resting (eyes-closed) condition to viewing faces without emotional valence.",M1
20224160,"Transport-based quantitative photoacoustic <e>tomography</e>: simulations and experiments.In this paper we describe a method for quantitative photoacoustic tomography (qPAT) based on the photon radiative transfer equation (RTE) coupled with the Helmholtz photoacoustic wave equation. Considerable simulations and tissue-like phantom experiments are conducted to evaluate transport-based qPAT in comparison with diffusion-based qPAT. In these comparative simulations and experiments, we systematically examine the effects of the ratio of mu(a)/mu'(s) (absorption/reduced scattering coefficient), the anisotropy factor (g) and the imaging domain size on the transport- and diffusion-based photoacoustic image reconstruction. The results obtained show that transport-based qPAT allows for clearly more accurate recovery of the absolute absorption coefficient images of heterogeneous media over diffusion-based qPAT for all the cases examined and provides considerably improved image quality for cases where the photon diffusion approximation (DA) is invalid.",M1

20210456,"Enhanced photoacoustic stability of gold nanorods by silica matrix confinement.Photoacoustic <e>tomography</e> (PAT) has garnered much attention for its high contrast and excellent spatial resolution of perfused tissues. Gold nanorods (GNRs) have been employed to further enhance the imaging contrast of PAT. However, the photon fluences typically needed for PA wave induction often also result in GNR shape changes that significantly reduce the efficiency of acoustic wave generation. In this work, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate amorphous silica-coated gold nanorods (GNR-Si) in an effort to improve contrast agent stability and ameliorate efficiency loss during photoacoustic (PA) wave induction. TEM and optical absorption spectra measurements of GNR and GNR-Si show that encasing GNRs within amorphous silica provides substantial protection of nanorod conformation from thermal deformation. PA signals generated by GNR-Si demonstrate considerably greater resistance to degradation of signal intensity with repetitive pulsing than do uncoated GNRs, thereby enabling much longer, high-contrast imaging sessions than previously possible. The prolongation of high-contrast imaging, and biocompatibility and easy surface functionalization for targeting ligands afforded by amorphous silica, suggest GNR-Si to be potentially significant for the clinical translation of PAT.",M1
20210422,"Real-time photoacoustic <e>tomography</e> of cortical hemodynamics in small animals.For the first time, the hemodynamics within the entire cerebral cortex of a mouse were studied by using photoacoustic tomography (PAT) in real time. The PAT system, based on a 512-element full-ring ultrasound array, received photoacoustic signals primarily from a slice of 2-mm thickness. This system can provide high-resolution brain vasculature images. We also monitored the fast wash-in process of a photoacoustic contrast agent in the mouse brain. Our results demonstrated that PAT is a powerful imaging modality that can be potentially used to study small animal neurofunctional activities.",M1
20181513,"Theta EEG source localization using LORETA in partial epilepsy patients with and without medication.OBJECTIVE: To investigate and localize the sources of spontaneous, scalp-recorded theta activity in patients with partial epilepsy (PE). METHODS: Nine patients with beginning, untreated PE (Group 1), 31 patients with already treated PE (Group 2), and 14 healthy persons were investigated by means of spectral analysis and LORETA, low resolution electromagnetic <e>tomography</e> (1 Hz very narrow band analysis, age-adjusted, Z-scored values). The frequency of main interest was 4-8 Hz. RESULTS: Group analysis: Group 1 displayed bilateral theta maxima in the temporal theta area (TTA), parietal theta area (PTA), and frontal theta area (FTA). In Group 2, theta activity increased all over the scalp as compared to the normative mean (Z=0) and also to Group 1. Maximum activity was found in the TTA, PTA, and FTA. However, in the PTA and FTA the centers of the abnormality shifted towards the medial cortex. Individual analysis: all the patients showed preferential activation (maximum Z-values) within one of the three theta areas. CONCLUSIONS: EEG activity in the theta band is increased in anatomically meaningful patterns in PE patients, which differs from the anatomical distribution of theta in healthy persons. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings contribute to our understanding of the sources of theta rhythms and the pathophysiology of PE.",M1

Simulations are performed to show that our approach is not only capable of preserving shapes, details and intensities of bioluminescent sources in the presence of sparse or non-sparse sources with angular-resolved or angular-averaged data, but also robust to noise, and thus is potential for efficient high-resolution imaging with only boundary data.",M1

20166817,"Blastomycosis of the central nervous system: a multicenter review of diagnosis and treatment in the modern era.BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with Blastomyces dermatitidis is an uncommon and potentially fatal complication of blastomycosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients with CNS blastomycosis at our institutions from 1990 through 2008 (13 proven, 5 probable, and 4 possible cases). RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging was used in most patients, alone or in addition to computed <e>tomography</e>. CNS blastomycosis manifested as epidural abscess (1 of 22), meningitis (7 of 22), intracranial mass lesions (10 of 22), and concomitant intracranial mass lesions and meningitis (4 of 22). All patients received amphotericin B deoxycholate or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B as part of their treatment regimens. Most patients received amphotericin B followed by a prolonged course of oral azole therapy (voriconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole). Four (18%) of 22 patients died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, we recommend initial treatment with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B followed by a prolonged course of oral azole therapy, preferably voriconazole.",M1
20163261,"Severe pneumoperitoneum caused by infected pelvic hematoma: report of a case and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Pneumoperitoneum usually is caused by hollow viscus perforation with associated peritonitis. Severe pneumoperitoneum secondary to infection of a hematoma with gas-forming organisms is exceedingly rare. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 43-year-old man with a history of abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer developed abdominal distention, fever, and elevated white blood cell count after lysis of adhesions with bowel resection for recurrent small bowel obstruction. Abdominal radiography and a computed <e>tomography</e> scan demonstrated a large amount of free air in the peritoneal cavity. Contrary to expectations, reexploration revealed no signs of viscus perforation or anastomotic leak, but instead a large pelvic hematoma with an odor was identified and evacuated. Cultures from the hematoma yielded anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (not Bacteroides fragilis). The patient recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSION: Infected hematoma should be recognized as a cause of pneumoperitoneum after surgery. Awareness of this rare condition may prevent unnecessary surgical explorations in doubtful situations.",M1
20144736,"Abdominal visceral adipose tissue predicts risk of colorectal adenoma in both sexes.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Small studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the association between abdominal visceral adipose tissue and colorectal adenomas. We evaluated the effects of visceral adipose tissue volume on the development and growth of colorectal adenomas. METHODS: A total of 3922 participants underwent colonoscopy and computed <e>tomography</e> from February to November 2008. The associations between waist circumference, visceral adipose tissue volume, and colorectal adenomas were estimated with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, the association between characteristics of colorectal adenomas and visceral adipose tissue volume was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with participants who had visceral adipose tissue volume of less than 500 cm(3), the odds ratio for colorectal adenoma was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.36) for a volume of 500 to 999 cm(3), 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69) for a volume of 1000 to 1499 cm(3), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.06-1.94) for a volume of 1500 cm(3) or greater. The risk of colorectal adenomas increased with increasing visceral adipose tissue volume in both sexes (P trend = .004 in men and .009 in women). Waist circumference was associated with colorectal adenomas in men (P trend = .02), but not in women. High volume of visceral adipose tissue (&gt;or=1000 cm(3)) had a positive association with larger adenomas (&gt;or=10 mm) and multiple adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal visceral adipose tissue volume can contribute to the development and growth of colorectal adenomas, and it was a better predictor for risk of colorectal adenomas than body mass index or waist circumference in both sexes.",M1

20134086,"High-resolution <e>tomography</e> of positron emitters with clustered pinhole SPECT.State-of-the-art small-animal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) enables sub-half-mm resolution imaging of radio-labelled molecules. Due to severe photon penetration through pinhole edges, current multi-pinhole SPECT is not suitable for high-resolution imaging of photons with high energies, such as the annihilation photons emitted by positron emitting tracers (511 keV). To deal with this edge penetration, we introduce here clustered multi-pinhole SPECT (CMP): each pinhole in a cluster has a narrow opening angle to reduce photon penetration. Using simulations, CMP is compared with (i) a collimator with traditional pinholes that is currently used for sub-half-mm imaging of SPECT isotopes (U-SPECT-II), and (ii), like (i) but with collimator thickness adapted to image high-energy photons (traditional multi-pinhole SPECT, TMP). At 511 keV, U-SPECT-II is able to resolve the 0.9 mm rods of an iteratively reconstructed Jaszczak-like capillary hot rod phantom, and while TMP only leads to small improvements, CMP can resolve rods as small as 0.7 mm. Using a digital tumour phantom, we show that CMP resolves many details not assessable with standard USPECT-II and TMP collimators. Furthermore, CMP makes it possible to visualize uptake of positron emitting tracers in sub-compartments of a digital mouse striatal brain phantom. This may open up unique possibilities for analysing processes such as those underlying the function of neurotransmitter systems. Additional potential of CMP may include (i) the imaging of other high-energy single-photon emitters (e.g. I-131) and (ii) localized imaging of positron emitting tracers simultaneously with single photon emitters, with an even better resolution than coincidence PET.",M1
20126228,"Bioluminescence <e>tomography</e> based on the phase approximation model.A reconstruction method of bioluminescence sources is proposed based on a phase approximation model. Compared with the diffuse approximation, this phase approximation model more correctly predicts bioluminescence photon propagation in biological tissues, so that bioluminescence tomography can accurately locate and quantify the distribution of bioluminescence sources. The compressive sensing (CS) technique is applied to regularize the inverse source reconstruction to enhance numerical stability and efficiency. The numerical simulation and phantom experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",M1
20090249,"Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of thymus: a rare cause of Cushing's syndrome.Thymomas constitute majority of the thymic neoplasms. In contrast, neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid and neuroendocrine carcinoma) of thymus are extremely rare. Thymic carcinoids may present rarely with Cushing's syndrome due to the ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Recognition of this association is imperative for appropriate management of patients. We describe three cases of rare atypical carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine carcinoma) of the thymus. Case 1, of a 26-year-old man presenting with Cushing's syndrome, case 2--a 23-year-old female with Cushingoid features, and Case 3--a 39-year-old man complaining of progressively worsening dyspnea. Computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) scans of chest in all three patients revealed anterior mediastinal mass. Excision of tumors and histological examination of the three tumors showed a carcinoid tumor with nuclear pleomorphism, increased mitotic activity and focal necrosis. The features suggested a diagnosis of atypical carcinoid tumor in all the three cases. The tumor cells in Cases 1 and 2 showed focal immunohistochemical staining for ACTH. Atypical carcinoid (neuroendocrine carcinoma, well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated) of the thymus is a rare thymic tumor which carries a worse prognosis compared to thymoma and requires aggressive therapy. Hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential.",M1

Specifically, we use an optically reconstructed surface of the experimental animal and a digital mouse atlas to approximate the anatomy of the animal as structural priors to assist image reconstruction. Experiments are carried out on a cadaver of a nude mouse with a fluorescent inclusion (2.4-mm-diam cylinder) implanted in the chest cavity. Tomographic fluorescence images are reconstructed using an iterative algorithm based on a finite element method. Coregistration of the fluorescence reconstruction and micro-CT (computed tomography) data acquired afterward show good localization accuracy (localization error 1.2+/-0.6 mm). Using the optically reconstructed surface, but without the atlas anatomy, image reconstruction fails to show the fluorescent inclusion correctly. The method demonstrates the utility of anatomical priors in support of free-space fluorescence tomography.",M1

20051330,"In vivo impedance imaging with total variation regularization.We show that electrical impedance <e>tomography</e> (EIT) image reconstruction algorithms with regularization based on the total variation (TV) functional are suitable for in vivo imaging of physiological data. This reconstruction approach helps to preserve discontinuities in reconstructed profiles, such as step changes in electrical properties at interorgan boundaries, which are typically smoothed by traditional reconstruction algorithms. The use of the TV functional for regularization leads to the minimization of a nondifferentiable objective function in the inverse formulation. This cannot be efficiently solved with traditional optimization techniques such as the Newton method. We explore two implementations methods for regularization with the TV functional: the lagged diffusivity method and the primal dual-interior point method (PD-IPM). First we clarify the implementation details of these algorithms for EIT reconstruction. Next, we analyze the performance of these algorithms on noisy simulated data. Finally, we show reconstructed EIT images of in vivo data for ventilation and gastric emptying studies. In comparison to traditional quadratic regularization, TV regularization shows improved ability to reconstruct sharp contrasts.",M1

20006907,"Diagnostic ability of Heidelberg Retina <e>Tomography</e> in detecting glaucoma in a population setting: the Singapore Malay Eye Study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (HRT II, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) in diagnosing glaucoma in a population setting. DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Of 3280 Malay persons aged 40 to 80 years who participated in the survey, 112 subjects (124 eyes) with glaucoma and a subset of 196 bilaterally normal subjects (392 eyes) were included for the evaluation of diagnostic ability of HRT II. METHODS: All glaucomatous and normal eyes underwent standardized ophthalmic assessment (including automated perimetry) and HRT II. Glaucoma was defined according to International Society for Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria. Area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HRT II algorithms. Marginal logistic regression models were used to evaluate the influence of optic disc size on the results of HRT II algorithms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The HRT II algorithms: linear discriminant functions (LDFs) by Mikelberg et al (LDF1), Burk et al (LDF2), Bathija et al (LDF3), and Moorfields regression analysis (MRA). The MRA was subdivided into MRA1 with  borderline  outcomes as positive and MRA2 with  borderline  outcomes as negative. RESULTS: Subjects with cataract, visual impairment, astigmatism, and greater negative spherical equivalent, and of older age were more likely to yield lower quality images. For analyses by eye, AUCs were 0.789, 0.704, 0.755, 0.754, and 0.762 for MRA1, MRA2, LDF1, LDF2, and LDF3, respectively. At 85% specificity, sensitivities were 62.1%, 65.3%, and 66.9% for LDF1, LDF2, and LDF3, respectively. At 95% specificity, these figures decreased to 31.5%, 42.7%, and 45.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 71.0% and 86.7% for MRA1 and 43.6% and 97.2% for MRA2, respectively. Similar estimates were found for analyses by person. Larger optic disc size was associated with increased sensitivity and false-positive rate for MRA1, LDF1, and LDF2. LDF1 and LDF3 were least affected by optic disc area, but the sensitivities were moderate and the false-positive rates were high across different optic disc areas. CONCLUSIONS: The current HRT II algorithms are of limited value for population-based glaucoma screening in the Malay population and do not account adequately for optic disc size.",M1

Based on the Fourier diffraction projection theorem for acoustic media, it is demonstrated that the 3D Fourier components of an object's compressibility and density distributions can be decoupled algebraically, thereby providing a method for separately reconstructing the distributions. This is facilitated by the identification and exploitation of tomographic symmetries and the rotational invariance of the imaging model. The developed reconstruction methods are investigated by use of computer- simulation studies.

19965165,"Magnetic flux density measurement with balanced steady state free precession pulse sequence for MREIT: a simulation study.Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance <e>Tomography</e> (MREIT) utilizes the magnetic flux density B(z), generated due to current injection, to find conductivity distribution inside an object. This B(z) can be measured from MR phase images using spin echo pulse sequence. The SNR of B(z) and the sensitivity of phase produced by B(z) in MR phase image are critical in deciding the resolution of MREIT conductivity images. The conventional spin echo based data acquisition has poor phase sensitivity to current injection. Longer scan time is needed to acquire data with higher SNR. We propose a balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) based pulse sequence which is highly sensitive to small off-resonance phase changes. A procedure to reconstruct B(z) from MR signal obtained with b-SSFP sequence is described. Phases for b-SSFP signals for two conductivity phantoms of TX 151 and Gelatin are simulated from the mathematical models of b-SSFP signal. It was observed that the phase changes obtained from b-SSFP pulse sequence are highly sensitive to current injection and hence would produce higher magnetic flux density. However, the b-SSFP signal is dependent on magnetic field inhomogeneity and the signal deteriorated highly for small offset from resonance frequency. The simulation results show that the b-SSFP sequence can be utilized for conductivity imaging of a local region where magnetic field inhomogeneity is small. A proper shimming of magnet is recommended before using the b-SSFP sequence.",M1

19964795,"Magnetoacoustic <e>tomography</e> with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) for electrical conductivity imaging.Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a recently introduced method for imaging electrical conductivity properties of biological tissue with high spatial resolution close to sonography. In MAT-MI the sample resides in a static magnetic field and a time-varying magnetic stimulation is applied to the sample volume. Through the action of the Lorentz force, the magnetically induced eddy current in the conductive sample causes particle vibrations and generates detectable ultrasound waves. The acoustic signal is then measured around the object to reconstruct images that are related to the object electrical conductivity distribution. The feasibility to reconstruct high spatial resolution conductivity images using MAT-MI method has been demonstrated by both computer simulation and experimental studies. Though MAT-MI technique is still in its developing stage, all the pilot studies suggest that it has potential to become a noninvasive imaging modality for high spatial resolution conductivity imaging of biological tissue and merits further investigations. This paper reviews MAT-MI about its basic theory, reconstruction algorithms and experiment studies. Some technical issues and future research directions are discussed.",M1

In this study, the approach  Electric Properties Tomography  (EPT) is applied, which derives the patient's electric conductivity using a standard MR system. To this goal, the spatial transmit sensitivity distribution of the applied RF coil is measured. This sensitivity distribution represents the positive circularly polarized component of the magnetic field. It can be post-processed utilizing Faraday's and Ampere's law, yielding an estimation of the spatial distribution of the patient's electric conductivity. Thus, EPT does not apply externally mounted electrodes, currents, or RF probes. In this study, phantom experiments underline the principle feasibility of EPT. Furthermore, initial conductivity measurements in the brain allow distinguishing cerebro-spinal fluid from the surrounding grey and white matter.",M1
19964595,"Breathing detection with a portable impedance measurement system: first measurements.For monitoring the health status of individuals, detection of breathing and heart activity is important. From an electrical point of view, it is known that breathing and heart activity change the electrical impedance distribution in the human body over the time due to ventilation (high impedance) and blood shifts (low impedance). Thus, it is possible to detect both important vital parameters by measuring the impedance of the thorax or the region around lung and heart. For some measurement scenarios it is also essential to detect these parameters contactless. For instance, monitoring bus drivers health could help to limit accidents, but directly connected systems limit the drivers free moving space. One measurement technology for measuring the impedance changes in the chest without cables is the magnetic impedance <e>tomography</e> (MIT). This article describes a portable measurement system we developed for this scenario that allows to measure breathing contactless. Furthermore, first measurements with five volunteers were performed and analyzed.",M1
19964524,"Fluorescence molecular <e>tomography</e> with optimal radon transform based surface reconstruction.Full angle non-contact fluorescence molecular tomography allows acquiring large data sets from complete angles, and simplifies the experimental setups. Accurately extracting animal surface is important for this kind of imaging systems. However, in in-vivo experiments, mouse breath movements and mechanical errors will influence the surface reconstruction. An optimal radon transform based surface reconstruction method is proposed to handle these two factors. The proposed method uses a line searching method to minimize the mismatch between the reconstructed 3D surface and the projected silhouettes at different angles. Therefore, the proposed method generates the optimal 3D surface compared to other methods based on radon transform. Results show that the mean mismatch of 3D surface generated is less than two CCD pixels (0.154 mm) in in-vivo experiments. In-vivo fluorescence molecular tomography is also performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",M1

19913035,"Structural analysis of a metazoan nuclear pore complex reveals a fused concentric ring architecture.The sole gateway for molecular exchange between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This large supramolecular assembly mediates transport of cargo into and out of the nucleus and fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form an aqueous translocation channel. The NPC is composed of eight proteinaceous asymmetric units forming a pseudo-8-fold symmetric passage. Due to its shear size, complexity, and plastic nature, dissecting the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the NPC in its hydrated state is a formidable challenge. Toward this goal, we applied cryo-electron <e>tomography</e> to spread nuclear envelopes from Xenopus oocytes. To compensate for perturbations of the 8-fold symmetry of individual NPCs, we performed symmetry-independent asymmetric unit averaging of three-dimensional tomographic NPC volumes to eventually yield a refined model at 6.4 nm resolution. This approach revealed novel structural features, particularly in the spoke-ring complex and luminal domains. Fused concentric ring architecture of the spoke-ring complex was found along the translocation channel. Additionally, a comparison of the refined Xenopus model to that of its Dictyostelium homologue yielded similar pore diameters at the level of the three canonical rings, although the Xenopus NPC was found to be 30% taller than the Dictyostelium pore. This discrepancy is attributed primarily to the relatively low homology and different organization of some nucleoporins in the Dictyostelium genome as compared to that of vertebrates. Nevertheless, the experimental conditions impose a preferred axial orientation of the NPCs within spread Xenopus oocyte nuclear envelopes. This may at least in part explain the increased height of the reconstructed vertebrate NPCs compared to those obtained from tomographic reconstruction of intact Dictyostelium nuclei.",M1

The final results demonstrate the advantage of using the FIS compared to the performance of the iterative back projection image reconstruction technique.",M1
19895069,"An electrical impedance <e>tomography</e>-based approach to monitor in vitro sodium chloride dissolution from pharmaceutical tablets.An approach to monitor in vitro dissolution process from pharmaceutical tablets utilizing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is introduced. In the demonstration, a tablet containing sodium chloride (NaCl) was dissolution tested using tap water as a dissolution medium within an apparatus similar to the United States Pharmacopoeia dissolution apparatus II. During the process, the three-dimensional sodium chloride concentration distribution was monitored with EIT measurements as a function of time. For EIT measurements, an array of electrodes was attached on the boundary of the dissolution vessel, a set of alternating electric currents was injected through the electrodes, and the resulting voltages were measured. With these data and by applying mathematical algorithms, an approximation for the spatial/temporal concentration distribution inside the vessel was computed. It was found that the computed distributions were relatively homogeneous. A NaCl release curve was computed by integrating the concentration distribution over the vessel volume, and the final value of the curve matched well with the reference point based on the weight loss of the tablet. Finally, EIT monitoring is suggested to be used for research and product development purposes.",M1
19887310,"Artifact trapping during time reversal photoacoustic imaging for acoustically heterogeneous media.Several different reconstruction algorithms have been proposed for photoacoustic <e>tomography</e>, most of which presuppose that the acoustic properties of the medium are constant and homogeneous. In practice, there are often unknown spatial variations in the acoustic properties, and these algorithms give, at best, only approximate estimates of the true image. The question as to which approach is the most robust in these circumstances is therefore one of practical importance. Image reconstruction by  time reversal -using a numerical propagation model with a time-varying boundary condition corresponding to the measured data in reversed temporal order-has been shown to be less restrictive in its assumptions than most, and therefore a good candidate for a general and practically useful algorithm. Here, it is shown that such reconstruction algorithms can  trap  time reversed scattered waves, leading to artifacts within the image region. Two ways to mitigate this effect are proposed.",M1
19884066,"Effects of different imaging models on least-squares image reconstruction accuracy in photoacoustic <e>tomography</e>.In the classic formulation of photoacoustic tomography (PAT), two distinct descriptions of the imaging model have been employed for developing reconstruction algorithms. We demonstrate that the numerical and statistical properties of unweighted least-squares reconstruction algorithms associated with each imaging model are generally very different. Specifically, some PAT reconstruction algorithms, including many of the iterative algorithms previously explored, do not work directly with the raw measured pressure wavefields, but rather with an integrated data function that is obtained by temporally integrating the photoacoustic wavefield. The integration modifies the statistical distribution of the data, introducing statistical correlations among samples. This change is highly significant for iterative algorithms, many of which explicitly or implicitly seek to minimize a statistical cost function. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative reconstruction by least-squares minimization yields better resolution-noise tradeoffs when working with the raw pressure data than with the integrated data commonly employed. In addition, we demonstrate that the raw-data based approach is less sensitive to certain deterministic errors, such as dc offset errors.",M1
19879963,"Acute pancreatitis: computed <e>tomography</e> utilization and radiation exposure are related to severity but not patient age.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: A goal of radiologists is to use computed tomography (CT) imaging less frequently in younger patients because of radiation exposure. We evaluated abdominal CT use among patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis at a tertiary care hospital and compared estimated radiation doses with disease severity and patient age. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of numbers and types of CTs performed on patients with acute pancreatitis (1036 admissions, 869 patients; mean age, 50.8 y); 566 had 1081 abdominopelvic CTs performed from October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2006. Effective dose estimates for abdominopelvic CTs were used to estimate exposure. Disease severities were stratified using Balthazar CT grades and severity indexes. RESULTS: The mean number of abdominopelvic CTs per patient, per hospitalization, was 1.9 (range, 1-12); the mean number was 3.0 over the 5-year period (range, 1-19). During hospitalization, each patient was exposed to a mean estimated radiation dose of 31.03 +/- 26.4 mSv (range, 14.7-176.9 mSv). Patients with pancreatitis grades D or E (n = 233) compared with grades A through C (n = 333) had longer periods of hospitalization (mean, 23.3 vs 10.8 d; P &lt; .001), more days as an inpatient (mean, 2.54 vs 1.45 d; P &lt; .001), more total CT scans (mean, 4.02 vs 2.37; P &lt; .001), and higher total effective radiation doses (mean, 53.5 vs 35 mSv; P &lt; .0001). Linear regression revealed a relationship between dose and disease grade, but not patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of age, patients with severe acute pancreatitis undergo more abdominopelvic CTs as inpatients and outpatients and are exposed to higher doses of radiation compared with patients with less severe disease. Awareness of CT ordering patterns for patients with acute pancreatitis may aid in the development of alternate imaging strategies to reduce radiation exposure in this population, especially for younger patients.",M1

Eyes closed resting state EEG data were recorded in 16 elite karate athletes, 20 amateur karate athletes, and 25 non-athletes. The EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic <e>tomography</e> (LORETA). Statistical results showed that the amplitude of parietal and occipital alpha 1 sources was significantly higher in the elite karate athletes than in the non-athletes and karate amateur athletes. Similar results were observed in parietal and occipital delta sources as well as in occipital theta sources. Finally, a control confirmatory experiment showed that the amplitude of parietal and occipital delta and alpha 1 sources was stronger in 8 elite rhythmic gymnasts compared with 14 non-athletes. These results supported the hypothesis that cortical neural synchronization at the basis of eyes-closed resting state EEG rhythms is enhanced in elite athletes than in control subjects.",M1
19855179,"3D <e>tomography</e> reveals connections between the phagophore and endoplasmic reticulum.Autophagosomes have been reported to form in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In many cases, the phagophore membrane is observed between two cisternae of rough ER, but it is not known whether these two membranes are directly connected. To investigate the relationship of the phagophore membrane and the ER, we used electron microscopic tomography of serum and amino acid starved normal rat kidney cells. The cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde and reduced osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon. Dual axis tilt image series were acquired from two successive 250-nm sections. To analyze the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of phagophores and the associated rough ER, 3D tomograms were used to model the ER and phagophore membranes. The tomographic reconstructions revealed connections between the phagophore/autophagosome membrane and the closely located ER cisternae, especially with the ER located inside the autophagosome. The connections were typically formed by narrow extensions from the phagophore/autophagosome to the ER. This finding has potential implications on the origin of autophagosome membranes, and on the mechanism of phagophore membrane extension. In addition, we observed lipid droplets in very close contact with the phagophores/autophagosomes.",M1

METHODS: The ONHs of 146 African American children aged 6 to 17 years without ocular disease were imaged with the Heidelberg retinal tomograph II. Mean values for 11 ONH parameters were determined as was their relationship to age, gender, and refractive error. Interocular symmetry of the parameters was determined. RESULTS: The mean (+/-standard deviation) disc area, rim area, and cup area were 2.18 +/- 0.57 mm2, 1.63 +/- 0.40 mm2, and 0.52 +/- 0.37 mm2, respectively. The mean linear cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio was 0.45 +/- 0.15, and mean cup depth was 0.22 +/- 0.10 mm. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 0.26 +/- 0.07 mm. The ONH parameters were not related to age or refractive error. With the exception of the C/D area ratio and linear C/D ratio, which were greater in boys than in girls, ONH parameters were not related to gender. Most parameters were strongly correlated between the right and left eyes. The average interocular differences in disc area, cup area, rim area, linear C/D ratio, and mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were 0.09 +/- 0.31 mm2, 0.04 +/- 0.22 mm2, 0.06 +/- 0.40 mm2, 0.02 +/- 0.11, and 0.00 +/- 0.06 mm2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ONH parameters were not related to age and refractive error, and only C/D area ratio and linear C/D ratio were greater in boys than girls in a clinical sample of African American children. These measures of normative ONH parameters and range of interocular differences may be helpful in clinical pediatric eye care to facilitate identification of African American children with abnormal optic discs.",M1
19820264,"Spectrally resolved bioluminescence <e>tomography</e> with the third-order simplified spherical harmonics approximation.Bioluminescence imaging has been extensively applied to in vivo small animal imaging. Quantitative three-dimensional bioluminescent source information obtained by using bioluminescence tomography can directly and much more accurately reflect biological changes as opposed to planar bioluminescence imaging. Preliminary simulated and experimental reconstruction results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of bioluminescence tomography. However, the use of multiple approximations, particularly the diffusion approximation theory, affects the quality of in vivo small animal-based image reconstructions. In the development of new reconstruction algorithms, high-order approximation models of the radiative transfer equation and spectrally resolved data introduce new challenges to the reconstruction algorithm and speed. In this paper, an SP(3)-based (the third-order simplified spherical harmonics approximation) spectrally resolved reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The simple linear relationship between the unknown source distribution and the spectrally resolved data is established in this algorithm. A parallel version of this algorithm is realized, making BLT reconstruction feasible for the whole body of small animals especially for fine spatial domain discretization. In simulation validations, the proposed algorithm shows improved reconstruction quality compared with diffusion approximation-based methods when high absorption, superficial sources and detection modes are considered. In addition, comparisons between fine and coarse mesh-based BLT reconstructions show the effects of numerical errors in reconstruction image quality. Finally, BLT reconstructions using in vivo mouse experiments further demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the SP(3)-based reconstruction algorithm.",M1
19810480,"On the speckle-free nature of photoacoustic <e>tomography</e>.PURPOSE: A long-standing conundrum is why photoacoustic tomography (PAT) possesses the unique ability to produce images devoid of speckle artifacts while all other coherent imaging technologies do not. METHODS: In this paper, we explain the inherent mechanism that suppresses speckle in PAT, and the analysis was validated by simulations based on an experimental PAT system. RESULTS: We found that the speckle-free feature of PAT results directly from the optical absorption contrast. CONCLUSIONS: All optical absorbers expand on laser excitation, and therefore all initial photoacoustic pressure rises are positive, which engenders strong correlations among the photoacoustic waves from the absorbers. As a result, prominent boundaries always build up in photoacoustic images and suppress the interior speckle.",M1

DESIGN: Prospective observational cross-sectional case study. METHODS: This multicenter study included: 87 ocular hypertensives (OHT); 67 glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) patients; 75 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients; and 90 normals. All patients underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) HFA 30-2, Pulsar T30W, FDT N-30, HRT II, and GDx VCC. Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (AROCs) for discriminating between healthy and glaucomatous eyes and agreement among instruments were determined. RESULTS: The best parameters for Pulsar, FDT, HRT, and GDx were, respectively: loss variance square root; no. of areas with P&lt; 5%; Cup-Shape-Measure; and Nerve Fiber Indicator (NFI). In detecting POAG eyes, Pulsar (AROC, 0.90) appeared comparable with FDT (0.89) and significantly better than HRT (0.82) and GDx (0.79). For GON, Pulsar ability (0.74) was higher than GDx (0.69) and lower than FDT (0.80) and HRT (0.83). The agreement among instruments ranged from 0.12 to 0.56. Pulsar test duration was significantly shorter than SAP and FDT (P&lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Pulsar T30W test is a rapid and easy perimetric method, showing higher sensitivity than SAP in detecting early glaucomatous VF loss. Its diagnostic ability is good for detecting early perimetric POAG eyes and fair for GON eyes. Pulsar performance was comparable with FDT, HRT, and GDx, even if the agreement between instruments was poor to fair.",M1
19798751,"Two successive phases in the threat-related attentional response of anxious subjects: neural correlates.BACKGROUND: It is well known that highly anxious individuals are characterized by the allocation of a greater amount of attentional resources to threatening stimulation. However, neural data in relation to the time course of attentional biases in anxiety are still surprisingly scarce and preliminary. The present research explored attentional biases in anxious subjects (grouped according to their scores in trait and state forms of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) over time by using event-related potentials (ERPs) and through the application of source localization methodologies. METHODS: Participants (n=27) were asked to perform an indirect visual matching task in a cue-target paradigm. The targets consisted of three types of emotional pictures: positive arousing, negative arousing, and neutral. ERPs in response to target stimulation were submitted to temporal and spatial principal component analyses. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that negative targets elicited higher amplitudes than positive pictures in P200. Subsequently, greater amplitudes in response to positive than to negative pictures were observed in P500. Source analyses (standardized low resolution brain electro-magnetic <e>tomography</e>: sLORETA) indicated an involvement of visual association cortical areas (i.e., precuneus and cuneus) both in P200 and P500. CONCLUSIONS: The results might be interpreted in line with the orienting-avoidance hypothesis toward threatening events in anxious subjects. This attentional pattern was only manifested by individuals with high levels of both trait and state anxiety. Further investigation should be done in order to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying the attentional biases in anxiety and to apply this knowledge to the development of cognitive therapies.",M1

Human infection is often related to accidental inoculation through skin injuries during occupational exposure to pigs and pork. The disease may present as meningitis, bacteremia, and less commonly endocarditis, arthritis, or bronchopneumonia. METHODS: Case report and review of the literature. RESULTS: We report a case of bacteremia and severe sepsis caused by S. suis serotype 2 complicated by septic arthritis in a 56-year-old male with history of a prior contact with unprocessed pork. The causative agent was isolated from blood cultures and aspirated synovial fluid. The patient's condition improved after treatment with penicillin, but he was found subsequently to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, confirmed by computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) scan. The mycotic aneurysm was successfully repaired using an in situ graft reconstruction. Tissue samples analyzed using polymerase chain reaction identified S. suis serotype 2 as the causative organism. After completion of two weeks of parenteral antibiotics, an oral form of ciprofloxacin (0.25 g twice a day) was continued for one month. The patient was discharged from our institution after uncomplicated recovery. Clinical review, a CT scan, and inflammatory markers nine months after surgery revealed no evidence of infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mycotic aneurysm caused by S. suis, which may be an etiologic agent of mycotic aneurysms, especially when complicated by bacteremia in adults with a recent history of contact with pigs or unprocessed pork.",M1

In biomedical applications, the random walk model is frequently used as evolution model and, under this conditions, poor tracking ability of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is achieved. An analytically developed evolution model is not feasible at this moment. The paper investigates the identification of the evolution model in parallel to the EKF and updating the evolution model with certain periodicity. The evolution model transition matrix is identified using the history of the estimated resistivity distribution obtained by a sensitivity matrix based algorithm and a Newton-Raphson algorithm. To numerically identify the linear evolution model, the Ibrahim time-domain method is used. The investigation is performed by numerical simulations of a domain with time-varying resistivity and by experimental data collected from the boundary of a human chest during normal breathing. The obtained dynamic resistivity values lie within the expected values for the tissues of a human chest. The EKF results suggest that the tracking ability is significantly improved with this approach.",M1
19781602,"Phonological activation in chinese reading: an event-related potential study using low-resolution electromagnetic <e>tomography</e>.The aim of the present study was to examine the pattern of phonological activation during Chinese sentence reading. Terminal words in high cloze sentences were manipulated across six conditions defined by word frequency and ending types. The P200 was smaller for the congruent targets than for the unrelated control targets, while there were no differences between the homophonic and unrelated control targets. No frequency effect on the P200 was observed. More importantly, a reduced N400 to the homophonic words was observed independent of word frequency. Source analysis by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed that the highly activated areas for the P200 were located at bilateral superior frontal (BA 6) and occipital (BA 17, 18 and 19) areas, while the N400 was located at left medial frontal (BA 6) area. These findings suggest that phonology is activated automatically for both high- and low-frequency words during Chinese sentence reading, even when the task is not focused on pronunciation.",M1
19779216,"A comprehensive study of the most likely path formalism for proton-computed <e>tomography</e>.We investigate some generalizations of the most likely path formalism developed for proton-computed tomography. The stochastic path of a proton inside a homogeneous medium is replaced by a deterministic smooth path that maximizes the probability of the proton passing through the points on this curve, given measured entrance and exit parameters for each individual proton. We study various factors that influence this curve and the associated error envelopes. These factors are the influence of the energy loss, a logarithmic correction factor in the small angle Coulomb scattering and the importance of path length versus material thickness. We develop a method for further constraining the possible proton paths by including energy information in the derivation of the most likely path, utilizing an infinite-dimensional constrained functional analysis method. It is shown that while there is an additional uncertainty on the most likely path that is difficult to determine experimentally, the associated error envelopes are smaller, resulting in possibly slightly improved spatial resolution for proton-computed tomography.",M1
19774364,"Effect of closed endotracheal suction in high-frequency ventilated premature infants measured with electrical impedance <e>tomography</e>.OBJECTIVE: To determine the global and regional changes in lung volume during and after closed endotracheal tube (ETT) suction in high-frequency ventilated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Eleven non-muscle relaxed preterm infants with RDS ventilated with open lung high-frequency ventilation (HFV). INTERVENTIONS: Closed ETT suction. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Changes in global and regional lung volume were measured with electrical impedance tomography. ETT suction resulted in an acute loss of lung volume followed by spontaneous recovery with a median residual loss of 3.3% of the maximum volume loss. The median stabilization time was 8 s. At the regional level, the lung volume changes during and after ETT suction were heterogeneous in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Closed ETT suction causes an acute, transient and heterogeneous loss of lung volume in premature infants with RDS treated with open lung HFV.",M1
19770883,"Experimental bioluminescence <e>tomography</e> with fully parallel radiative-transfer-based reconstruction framework.Bioluminescence imaging is a very sensitive imaging modality, used in preclinical molecular imaging. However, in its planar projection form, it is non-quantitative and has poor spatial resolution. In contrast, bioluminescence tomography (BLT) promises to provide three dimensional quantitative source information. Currently, nearly all BLT reconstruction algorithms in use employ the diffusion approximation theory to determine light propagation in tissues. In this process, several approximations and assumptions that are made severely affect the reconstruction quality of BLT. It is therefore necessary to develop novel reconstruction methods using high-order approximation models to the radiative transfer equation (RTE) as well as more complex geometries for the whole-body of small animals. However, these methodologies introduce significant challenges not only in terms of reconstruction speed but also for the overall reconstruction strategy. In this paper, a novel fully-parallel reconstruction framework is proposed which uses a simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPN). Using this framework, a simple linear relationship between the unknown source distribution and the surface measured photon density can be established. The distributed storage and parallel operations of the finite element-based matrix make SPN-based spectrally resolved reconstruction feasible at the small animal whole body level. Performance optimization of the major steps of the framework remarkably improves reconstruction speed. Experimental reconstructions with mouse-shaped phantoms and real mice show the effectiveness and potential of this framework. This work constitutes an important advance towards developing more precise BLT reconstruction algorithms that utilize high-order approximations, particularly second-order self-adjoint forms to the RTE for in vivo small animal experiments.",M1

Our computer simulation shows that the sLORETA-based spatial filter can reconstruct the four current sources typically associated with the elicitation of the spinal cord evoked magnetic field (SCEF). The results from animal experiments show that significant changes in the latency and intensity of the reconstructed volume current arise near the location of the artificial incomplete conduction block. The results from the human SCEF show that the SCEF source imaging can visualize the dynamics of the volume currents and other nerve electrical activity propagating along the human spinal cord. These experimental results demonstrate the potential of SCEF source imaging as a future clinical tool for diagnosing cervical spinal cord disorders.",M1

METHODS: Scalp ictal EEG data in 22 seizure-free patients after temporal lobectomy with amygdalo-hippocampectomy were classified as follows: a regular 5-9Hz rhythm with a restricted temporal/subtemporal distribution (type 1, 11 patients), or an irregular 2-5Hz rhythm with a widespread fronto-temporal distribution (type 2, 11 patients). EEG data were fragmented into segments of 1.28s, both at ictal onset and at baseline. The LORETA solution of three frequency bands was compared between ictal and baseline using statistical non-parametric mapping (p&lt;0.01). RESULTS: The LORETA solution of 5-9Hz in type 2 had wider cortical activity in the ipsilateral fronto-temporal area, compared to type 1 with activation of the ipsilateral focal mesial and lateral temporal regions. The LORETA solution of 10-13Hz in both types showed increased activity in the fronto-temporal area, which was wider in type 2 than type 1. Increased cortical activity of &lt;5Hz was not observed in type 1, whereas increased cortical activity was observed in the bilateral anterior frontal area in type 2. CONCLUSIONS: The cortical source distribution in HS-MTLE may depend on scalp IID frequency. The neural generators of 5-13Hz may be important for the formation of the ictal onset zone in both ictal patterns. SIGNIFICANCE: Spatial distributions in HS-MTLE patients differ with scalp IID frequency.",M1
19726840,"Gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent for in vivo tumor imaging with photoacoustic <e>tomography</e>.Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a rapidly emerging non-invasive imaging technology that integrates the merits of high optical contrast with high ultrasound resolution. The ability to quantitatively and non-invasively image nanoparticles has important implications for the development of nanoparticles as in vivo cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents. In this study, the ability of systemically administered poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent for in vivo tumor imaging with PAT has been evaluated. We demonstrate that gold nanoparticles (20 and 50 nm) have high photoacoustic contrast as compared to mouse tissue ex vivo. Gold nanoparticles can be visualized in mice in vivo following subcutaneous administration using PAT. Following intravenous administration of PEGylated gold nanoparticles to tumor-bearing mice, accumulation of gold nanoparticles in tumors can be effectively imaged with PAT. With gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent, PAT has important potential applications in the image guided therapy of superficial tumors such as breast cancer, melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma.",M1

19719814,"Electrical impedance <e>tomography</e> and heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation in porcine acute lung injury.BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of pulmonary ventilation (V), perfusion (Q) and V/Q matching impairs gas exchange in an acute lung injury (ALI). This study investigated the feasibility of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to assess the V/Q distribution and matching during an endotoxinaemic ALI in pigs. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs (n=11, weight 30-36 kg) were studied during an infusion of endotoxin for 150 min. Impedance changes related to ventilation (Z(V)) and perfusion (Z(Q)) were monitored globally and bilaterally in four regions of interest (ROIs) of the EIT image. The distribution and ratio of Z(V) and Z(Q) were assessed. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, venous admixture, fractional alveolar dead space and functional residual capacity (FRC) were recorded, together with global and regional lung compliances and haemodynamic parameters. Values are mean+/-standard deviation (SD) and regression coefficients. RESULTS: Endotoxinaemia increased the heterogeneity of Z(Q) but not Z(V). Lung compliance progressively decreased with a ventral redistribution of Z(V). A concomitant dorsal redistribution of Z(Q) resulted in mismatch of global (from Z(V)/Z(Q) 1.1+/-0.1 to 0.83+/-0.3) and notably dorsal (from Z(V)/Z(Q) 0.86+/-0.4 to 0.51+/-0.3) V and Q. Changes in global Z(V)/Z(Q) correlated with changes in the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (r(2)=0.65, P&lt;0.05), venous admixture (r(2)=0.66, P&lt;0.05) and fractional alveolar dead space (r(2)=0.61, P&lt;0.05). Decreased end-expiratory Z(V) correlated with decreased FRC (r(2)=0.74, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EIT can be used to assess the heterogeneity of regional pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and V/Q matching during endotoxinaemic ALI, identifying pivotal pathophysiological changes.",M1
19706963,"Quantitative three-dimensional photoacoustic <e>tomography</e> of the finger joints: phantom studies in a spherical scanning geometry.In this paper, we present a series of phantom experiments that aim to systematically evaluate the possibility of quantitative three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging of the finger joints in a spherical scanning geometry. The 3D absorption coefficient images of the joint-mimicking phantoms are obtained using our finite-element-based photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithm coupled with the photon diffusion equation. The results show that a 1 mm thick 'cartilage' can be accurately differentiated from the 'bones' with a 1 MHz transducer. In addition, the absorption coefficient of the 'cartilage' can be effectively recovered when this optical property is varied from 0.015 to 0.04 mm(-1). The phantom images shown in this paper suggest that 3D photoacoustic tomography in a spherical scanning geometry has the potential to image a realistic human joint.",M1
19696720,"Mesoscopic fluorescence <e>tomography</e> for in-vivo imaging of developing Drosophila.Visualizing developing organ formation as well as progession and treatment of disease often heavily relies on the ability to optically interrogate molecular and functional changes in intact living organisms. Most existing optical imaging methods are inadequate for imaging at dimensions that lie between the penetration limits of modern optical microscopy (0.5-1mm) and the diffusion-imposed limits of optical macroscopy (&gt;1cm) [1]. Thus, many important model organisms, e.g. insects, animal embryos or small animal extremities, remain inaccessible for in-vivo optical imaging. Although there is increasing interest towards the development of nanometer-resolution optical imaging methods, there have not been many successful efforts in improving the imaging penetration depth. The ability to perform in-vivo imaging beyond microscopy limits is in fact met with the difficulties associated with photon scattering present in tissues. Recent efforts to image entire embryos for example [2,3] require special chemical treatment of the specimen, to clear them from scattering, a procedure that makes them suitable only for post-mortem imaging. These methods however evidence the need for imaging larger specimens than the ones usually allowed by two-photon or confocal microscopy, especially in developmental biology and in drug discovery. We have developed a new optical imaging technique named Mesoscopic Fluorescence Tomography [4], which appropriate for non-invasive in-vivo imaging at dimensions of 1mm-5mm. The method exchanges resolution for penetration depth, but offers unprecedented tomographic imaging performance and it has been developed to add time as a new dimension in developmental biology observations (and possibly other areas of biological research) by imparting the ability to image the evolution of fluorescence-tagged responses over time. As such it can accelerate studies of morphological or functional dependencies on gene mutations or external stimuli, and can importantly, capture the complete picture of development or tissue function by allowing longitudinal time-lapse visualization of the same, developing organism. The technique utilizes a modified laboratory microscope and multi-projection illumination to collect data at 360-degree projections. It applies the Fermi simplification to Fokker-Plank solution of the photon transport equation, combined with geometrical optics principles in order to build a realistic inversion scheme suitable for mesoscopic range. This allows in-vivo whole-body visualization of non-transparent three-dimensional structures in samples up to several millimeters in size. We have demonstrated the in-vivo performance of the technique by imaging three-dimensional structures of developing Drosophila tissues in-vivo and by following the morphogenesis of the wings in the opaque Drosophila pupae in real time over six consecutive hours.",M1

The core issue of BLT is to determine the distribution of internal bioluminescent sources from optical measurements on external surface. In this paper, a new algorithm is presented for BLT source reconstruction based on adaptive hp-finite element method. Using adaptive mesh refinement strategy and intelligent permissible source region, we can obtain more accurate information about the location and density of sources, with the robustness, stability and efficiency improved. Numerical simulations and physical experiment were both conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, where the optical data on phantom surface were obtained via Monte Carlo simulation and CCD camera detection, respectively. The results represent the merits and potential of our algorithm for BLT source reconstruction.",M1
19687213,"Optical imaging of molecular signatures in pulmonary inflammation.Biomedical imaging has become an important tool in the study of  -omics  fields by allowing the noninvasive visualization of functional and molecular events using in vivo staining and reporter gene approaches. This capacity can go beyond the understanding of the genetic basis and phenotype of such respiratory conditions as acute bronchitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma and investigate the development of disease and of therapeutic events longitudinally and in unperturbed environments. Herein, we show how the application of novel quantitative optical imaging methods, using transillumination and fluorescence molecular <e>tomography</e> (FMT), can allow visualization of pulmonary inflammation in small animals in vivo. The results confirm prior observations using a protease-sensitive probe.

As an alternative to conventional sonography that uses hand-held transducers, toroidal array probes that encircle the breast immersed in a water bath have been investigated for ultrasound tomography. In this paper, two sets of experiments performed with a prototype ultrasound scanner on a phantom and a human breast in vivo are used to investigate the effects of diffraction and coherence in ultrasound tomography. Reconstructions obtained with transmission diffraction tomography (TDT) are compared with conventional reflection imaging and computerized ultrasound tomography showing a substantial improvement. The in vivo tests demonstrate that TDT can image the complex boundary of a cancer mass and suggest that it can reveal the anatomy of milk ducts and Cooper's ligaments.",M1
19672959,"Regional ventilation distribution in non-sedated spontaneously breathing newborns and adults is not different.BACKGROUND: In adults, ventilation is preferentially distributed towards the dependent lung. A reversal of the adult pattern has been observed in infants using radionuclide ventilation scanning. But these results have been obtained in infants and children with lung disease. In this study we investigate whether healthy infants have a similar reverse pattern of ventilation distribution. STUDY DESIGN: Measurement of regional ventilation distribution in healthy newborn infants during non-REM sleep in comparison to adults. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy newborns and 13 adults were investigated with electrical impedance <e>tomography</e> (EIT) in supine and prone position. Regional ventilation distribution was assessed with profiles of relative impedance change. The phase lag between dependent and non-dependent ventilation was calculated as a measure of asynchronous ventilation. RESULTS: In newborns and adults the geometric center of ventilation was centrally located in the lung at 52.2 +/- 6.2% from anterior to posterior and at 50.5 +/- 14.7%, respectively. Using impedance profiles, ventilation was equally distributed to the dependent and non-dependent lung regions in newborns. Ventilation distribution in adults was similar. Phase lag characteristics of the impedance signal showed that infants had slower emptying of the dependent lung than adults. CONCLUSION: The speculated reverse pattern of regional ventilation distribution in healthy infants compared to adults could not be demonstrated. Gravity had little effect on ventilation distribution in both infants and adults measured in supine and prone position.",M1
19664702,"The cochlea in fetuses with neural tube defects.In this study different malformations of the cochlea could be demonstrated. Nevertheless, we could not delineate a distinct malformation of the inner ear, that can be linked to a neural tube defect. Neural tube defects are a frequent and heterogeneous group of malformations, ranging from the survivable spina bifida to fatal anencephaly. In multiple animal models an involvement of the vestibulocochlear system has been demonstrated. In this article human fetal temporal bones of neural tube defects were analysed in a multimodular work-up. The morphologic study was performed with light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation-based microcomputed <e>tomography</e>. Immunohistochemistry for different neuronal markers such as peripherin, beta-III-tubulin and vimentin helped to evaluate ontogenetic tissue development. Eight fetal temporal bones with neural tube defects and five control temporal bones were included into the morphologic study. The morphologic results of the neural tube defect temporal bones showed six regularly developed cochleas and two with only a single cochlear turn. Three of the neural tube defect temporal bones were further examined with immunohistochemical analysis. No differences in the staining pattern for peripherin, beta-III-tubulin and vimentin were detected.",M1
19655130,"Neural basis of postural instability identified by VTC and EEG.In this study, we investigated the neural basis of virtual time to contact (VTC) and the hypothesis that VTC provides predictive information for future postural instability. A novel approach to differentiate stable pre-falling and transition-to-instability stages within a single postural trial while a subject was performing a challenging single leg stance with eyes closed was developed. Specifically, we utilized wavelet transform and stage segmentation algorithms using VTC time series data set as an input. The VTC time series was time-locked with multichannel (n = 64) EEG signals to examine its underlying neural substrates. To identify the focal sources of neural substrates of VTC, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution <e>tomography</e> (LORETA) of multichannel EEG. There were two major findings: (1) a significant increase of VTC minimal values (along with enhanced variability of VTC) was observed during the transition-to-instability stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and falling; and (2) this VTC dynamics was associated with pronounced modulation of EEG predominantly within theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. The sources of this EEG modulation were identified at the cingulate cortex (ACC) and the junction of precuneus and parietal lobe, as well as at the occipital cortex. The findings support the hypothesis that the systematic increase of minimal values of VTC concomitant with modulation of EEG signals at the frontal-central and parietal-occipital areas serve collectively to predict the future instability in posture.",M1

We propose a slice-by-slice object-scatter extraction algorithm entirely based in real space in combination with ordinary z-stepping.

19652949,"Evaluation of an electrical impedance <e>tomography</e>-based Global Inhomogeneity Index for pulmonary ventilation distribution.PURPOSE: To evaluate the plausibility, stability, and interindividual comparability of the global inhomogeneity index (GI) based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: The lung area in an EIT image was identified by using the lung area estimation method, which mirrors the lung regions in the functional EIT image and subsequently subtracts the cardiac-related areas. The tidal EIT image, showing the difference in impedances between end-inspiration and end-expiration, was calculated and the variations in its pixel values within the predefined lung area were then used as an indicator of inhomogeneous ventilation (the GI index). Fifty patients were investigated including 40 patients tracheally intubated with double-lumen tubes (test group) and 10 patients under anesthesia without pulmonary disease (control group). Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mbar was applied in the test group during both two-lung ventilation (TLV) and subsequent one-lung ventilation (OLV). The patients of the control group were ventilated without PEEP. EIT data were recorded in both groups. RESULTS: A significantly lower GI value was found in the control group (0.40 +/- 0.05, P = 0.025 vs. TLV 0.74 +/- 0.47 and P &lt; 0.002 vs. OLV 1.51 +/- 1.45). A significant difference was also found in the test group between TLV and OLV (P &lt; 0.002). If GI was calculated only in the ventilated lung area during OLV (0.71 +/- 0.32), it did not significantly differ from the test group during TLV. CONCLUSIONS: The GI index quantifies the gas distribution in the lung with a single number and reveals good interpatient comparability.",M1
19649648,"Toward visualization of nanomachines in their native cellular environment.The cellular nanocosm is made up of numerous types of macromolecular complexes or biological nanomachines. These form functional modules that are organized into complex subcellular networks. Information on the ultra-structure of these nanomachines has mainly been obtained by analyzing isolated structures, using imaging techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, or single particle electron microscopy (EM). Yet there is a strong need to image biological complexes in a native state and within a cellular environment, in order to gain a better understanding of their functions. Emerging methods in EM are now making this goal reachable. Cryo-electron <e>tomography</e> bypasses the need for conventional fixatives, dehydration and stains, so that a close-to-native environment is retained. As this technique is approaching macromolecular resolution, it is possible to create maps of individual macromolecular complexes. X-ray and NMR data can be 'docked' or fitted into the lower resolution particle density maps to create a macromolecular atlas of the cell under normal and pathological conditions. The majority of cells, however, are too thick to be imaged in an intact state and therefore methods such as 'high pressure freezing' with 'freeze-substitution followed by room temperature plastic sectioning' or 'cryo-sectioning of unperturbed vitreous fully hydrated samples' have been introduced for electron tomography. Here, we review methodological considerations for visualizing nanomachines in a close-to-physiological, cellular context.

19647920,"In vivo breast sound-speed imaging with ultrasound <e>tomography</e>.We discuss a bent-ray ultrasound tomography algorithm with total-variation (TV) regularization. We have applied this algorithm to 61 in vivo breast datasets collected with our in-house clinical prototype for imaging sound-speed distributions in the breast. Our analysis showed that TV regularization could preserve sharper lesion edges than the classic Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, the image quality of our TV bent-ray sound-speed tomograms was superior to that of the straight-ray counterparts for all types of breasts within BI-RADS density categories 1 through 4. Our analysis showed that the improvements for average sharpness (in the unit of (m x s)(-1)) of lesion edges in our TV bent-ray tomograms are between 2.1 to 3.4-fold compared with the straight ray tomograms. Reconstructed sound-speed tomograms illustrated that our algorithm could successfully image fatty and glandular tissues within the breast. We calculated the mean sound-speed values for fatty tissue and breast parenchyma as 1422 +/- 9 m/s (mean +/- SD) and 1487 +/- 21 m/s, respectively. Based on 32 lesions in a cohort of 61 patients, we also found that the mean sound-speed for malignant breast lesions (1548 +/- 17 m/s) was higher, on average, than that of benign ones (1513 +/- 27 m/s) (one-sided p&lt;0.001). These results suggest that, clinically, sound-speed tomograms can be used to assess breast density (and therefore, breast cancer risk), as well as detect and help differentiate breast lesions. Finally, our sound-speed tomograms may also be a useful tool to monitor the clinical response of breast cancer patients to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.",M1
19641242,"In vivo imaging of irreversible electroporation by means of electrical impedance <e>tomography</e>.Electroporation, the increased permeability of cell membranes due to a large transmembrane voltage, is an important clinical tool. Both reversible and irreversible in vivo electroporation are used for clinical applications such as gene therapy and solid malignant tumor ablation, respectively. The primary advantage of in vivo electroporation is the ability to treat tissue in a local and minimally invasive fashion. The drawback is the current lack of control over the process. This paper is the first report of a new method for real-time three-dimensional imaging of an in vivo electroporation process. Using two needle electrodes for irreversible electroporation and a set of electrodes for reconstructing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) images of the treated tissue, we were able to demonstrate electroporation imaging in rodent livers. Histology analysis shows good correlation between the extent of tissue damage caused by irreversible electroporation and the EIT images. This new method may lead the way to real-time control over genetic treatment of diseases in tissue and tissue ablation.",M1
19640956,"Relation of body fat indexes to vitamin D status and deficiency among obese adolescents.BACKGROUND: Data on the relation between vitamin D status and body fat indexes in adolescence are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify factors associated with vitamin D status and deficiency in obese adolescents to further evaluate the relation of body fat indexes to vitamin D status and deficiency. DESIGN: Data from 58 obese adolescents were obtained. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was measured by computed <e>tomography</e>. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure total bone mineral content, bone mineral density, body fat mass (FM), and lean mass. Relative measures of body fat were calculated. Blood tests included measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, type I collagen C-telopeptide, hormones, and metabolic factors. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL. PTH elevation was defined as PTH &gt; 65 ng/mL. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age of the adolescents was 14.9 +/- 1.4 y; 38 (66%) were female, and 8 (14%) were black. The mean (+/-SD) body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 36 +/- 5, FM was 40.0 +/- 5.5%, and VAT was 12.4 +/- 4.3%. Seventeen of the adolescents were vitamin D deficient, but none had elevated PTH concentrations. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density were within 2 SDs of national standards. In a multivariate analysis, 25(OH)D decreased by 0.46 +/- 0.22 ng/mL per 1% increment in FM (beta +/- SE, P = 0.05), whereas PTH decreased by 0.78 +/- 0.29 pg/mL per 1% increment in VAT (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our results show for the first time that obese adolescents with 25(OH)D deficiency, but without elevated PTH concentrations, have a bone mass within the range of national standards (+/-2 SD). The findings provide initial evidence that the distribution of fat may be associated with vitamin D status, but this relation may be dependent on metabolic factors.

METHODS: Twenty-three eyes from 23 patients (11 men and 12 women, mean age 44.3 years) with SSOH were enrolled and 23 control subjects were matched for age and optic disc size. In addition to detailed ophthalmoscope examination and standard automated perimetry, OCT and HRT were performed for the quantitative assessment of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and optic nerve head. RESULTS: The OCT images showed that the eyes with SSOH had significantly thinner RNFL than the control subjects in all segments except for the papillomacular bundle area. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AROC) was greatest for the RNFL thickness of superonasal one o'clock segment (AROC = 0.991, p&lt;0.001) measured by the OCT, and for the rim area of superonasal segment (AROC = 0.837, p = 0.001) measured by the HRT. CONCLUSION: More generalised thinning of the RNFL, beyond the superior retina, was identified in the eyes with SSOH.

Our method relies on the differences in the spatial characteristics of the absorption coefficient and the optical energy density within the medium. By using sparse-representation based decomposition, we exploit these different characteristics to extract both the absorption coefficient and the photon density within the imaged object from the optoacoustic image. In contrast to previous methods, this algorithm is not based on the solution of theoretical light transport equations and it does not require explicit knowledge of the illumination geometry or the optical properties of the object and other unknown or loosely defined experimental parameters, leading to highly robust performance. The method was successfully examined with numerically and experimentally generated data and was found to be ideally suited for practical implementations in tomographic schemes of varying complexity, including multiprojection illumination systems and multispectral optoacoustic <e>tomography</e> (MSOT) studies of tissue biomarkers.",M1
19623089,"Source localization of error negativity: additional source for corrected errors.Error processing in corrected and uncorrected errors was studied while participants responded to a target surrounded by flankers. Error-related negativity (ERN/NE) was stronger and appeared earlier in corrected errors than in uncorrected errors. ERN neural sources for each error type were analyzed using low-resolution electromagnetic <e>tomography</e> method of source localization. For corrected errors, the ERN source was located at the anterior cingulate (BA 24) and the medial and superior frontal regions (presupplementary motor area, BA 6), whereas it was located at the anterior cingulate (BA 24) for uncorrected errors. It is suggested that the anterior cingulate is the main source of the ERN with the presupplementary motor area contributing to ERN initiation only if the correct response tendency is sufficiently active to allow for full execution of a correction response.",M1
19601783,"Dietary intake in HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy: relationships with body composition, visceral fat, lipid, glucose and adipokine metabolism.Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-infection is associated with lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, increased prevalence of disturbances in glucose tolerance and diabetes, hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. Whether dietary intake influences total body fat, visceral fat, insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and circulating inflammatory markers in HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy is unclear and the focus of this report. We examined the dietary intake of 106 male HIV-infected HAART-recipients with lipodystrophy, enrolled in a study of the effects of rosiglitazone. All subjects had normal glucose tolerance. Dietary intakes were determined at study entry using Food Frequency Questionnaires and examined cross-sectionally against body composition by dual-energy Xray absorptiometry, visceral obesity by computed <e>tomography</e>, fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin, leptin, insulin resistance (by HOMA). Energy underreporters were identified and excluded. After exclusion of underreporters (n = 22) we found no relationships between diet composition (% dietary fat, %carbohydrate) and BMI, %body fat and visceral adiposity (p&gt;0.3). Only modest relationships were found between BMI and fat subtypes: polyunsaturated fats (g/day) (r = 0.14, p = 0.007), monounsaturated fat (g/d) (r = 0.06, p = 0.001), saturated fat (g/d) (r = 0.02, p&lt;0.0001). Only saturated fat related to % total body fat (g/d: r = 0.08, p&lt;0.0001, %energy intake: r = 0.16, p&lt;0.0001). No nutrient related to visceral adiposity by CT. Dietary fat intake (expressed as a % of energy intake) was not related to total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin or HOMA-IR (p&gt;0.4). Fat subtype did not relate to fasting insulin, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, glucose, adiponectin. In conclusion, there are weak relationships between saturated fat intake and adiposity in HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy, using gold standard measures of body fat. There were no relationships between nutrient intake and visceral adiposity, any measure of glucose metabolism, insulin resistance or adipokines. Only interventional, prospective studies will determine whether any nutritional strategy can assist in ameliorating the metabolic complications associated with HIV lipodystrophy.",M1
19591596,"Prediction of complicated Clostridium difficile infection by pleural effusion and increased wall thickness on computed <e>tomography</e>.BACKGROUND: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is often used to evaluate complications in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but no study has correlated CT findings with the risk of developing a complicated CDI. Furthermore, the value of CT has not been evaluated since the emergence of the BI/NAP1/027 hypervirulent strain of C. difficile. We sought to describe and correlate abdominal CT findings with complicated CDI and to compare them before and after the emergence of the epidemic strain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all hospitalized patients 18 years or older who, from 1 January 1998 through 31 December 2006, underwent abdominal CT within 72 h of their first positive stool sample. RESULTS: Of 1189 patients with newly diagnosed CDI, 165 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Patients who underwent CT were younger, had higher peak white blood cell counts and serum creatinine levels, and were more likely to experience fever than those who did not undergo CT. No difference in CT findings was noted before and after the emergence of BI/NAP1/027 CDI. Pleural effusion (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-6.6), colonic wall thickness &gt;15 mm (AOR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.1-33.9), peak white blood cell count &gt; or =30 x 10(9) cells/L (AOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4-16.4), albumin level &lt;20 g/L (AOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.4-20.1), and immunosuppression (AOR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5-15.3) were independently associated with complicated CDI. CONCLUSIONS: In a selected sample of patients with CDI, CT provided prognostic information additional to what could be obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters. No change in CT characteristics was noted after the introduction of the BI/NAP1/027 strain in our center.",M1
19581258,"Visualization of multidimensional and multimodal tomographic medical imaging data, a case study.Multidimensional tomographic datasets contain physical properties defined over four-dimensional (e.g. spatial-temporal, spatial-spectral), five-dimensional (e.g. spatial-temporal-spectral) or even higher-dimensional domains. Multimodal tomographic datasets contain physical properties obtained with different imaging modalities. In medicine, four-dimensional data are widely used, five-dimensional data are emerging, and multimodal data are being used more often every day. Visualization is vital for medical diagnosis and surgical planning to interpret the information included in imaging data. Visualization of multidimensional and multimodal tomographic imaging data is still a challenging task. As a case study, our work focuses on the visualization of five-dimensional (spatial-temporal-spectral) brain electrical impedance <e>tomography</e> (EIT) data. In this paper, a task-based subset definition scheme is proposed: a task model named Cubic Task Explorer (CTE) is derived to support the visualization task exploration for medical imaging data, and a structured method for visualization system development called Task-based Multi-Dimensional Visualization (TMDV) is proposed. A prototype system named EIT5DVis is developed using the CTE model and TMDV method to visualize five-dimensional brain EIT data.",M1

19581253,"Microwave <e>tomography</e>: review of the progress towards clinical applications.Microwave tomography (MWT) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality with great potential for non-invasive assessment of functional and pathological conditions of soft tissues. This paper presents a review of research results obtained by the author and his colleagues and focuses on various potential clinical applications of MWT. Most clinical applications of MWT imaging have complicated, nonlinear, high dielectric contrast inverse problems of three-dimensional diffraction tomography. There is a very high dielectric contrast between bones and fatty areas compared with soft tissues. In most cases, the contrast between soft-tissue abnormalities (the target imaging areas) is less pronounced than between bone (fat) and soft tissue. This additionally complicates the imaging problem. In spite of the difficulties mentioned, it has been demonstrated that MWT is applicable for extremities imaging, breast cancer detection, diagnostics of lung cancer, brain imaging and cardiac imaging.",M1
19566333,"Selection of optimal wavelengths for spectral reconstruction in diffuse optical <e>tomography</e>.Using lasers with different wavelengths in diffuse optical tomography (spectral DOT) has the advantage that the concentrations of chromophores can be reconstructed quantitatively. In continuous wave spectral DOT, it is furthermore possible to distinguish between scattering and absorption. The choice of the laser wavelengths has a strong impact on how well the scattering parameter and chromophore concentrations can be determined. Current methods to optimize the set of wavelengths disregard the sensitivity of the reconstruction result to uncertainties in the absorption spectra of the chromophores. But since available absorption spectra show significant deviations, it seems to be necessary to take this into account. The wavelength optimization approach presented here is an extension to a method of Corlu et al. The original method optimizes the wavelength sets such that scattering parameters and chromophore concentrations can be separated optimally. We introduce an additional criterion that evaluates the dependence of reconstructed chromophore concentrations on deviations of the extinction coefficients. The wavelength sets found by the new approach are different from those determined with the original method. Reconstructions of simulated data show the effect of using various absorption spectra for reconstruction with different wavelength sets and illustrate the advantages of the new wavelength sets.",M1
19566314,"Compensation of optical heterogeneity-induced artifacts in fluorescence molecular <e>tomography</e>: theory and in vivo validation.We present a method for reduction of image artifacts induced by the optical heterogeneities of tissue in fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) through identification and compensation of image regions that evidence propagation of emission light through thin or low-absorption tunnels in tissue. The light tunneled as such contributes to the emission image as spurious components that might substantially overwhelm the desirable fluorescence emanating from the targeted lesions. The proposed method makes use of the strong spatial correlation between the emission and excitation images to estimate the tunneled components and yield a residual image that mainly consists of the signal due to the desirable fluorescence. This residual image is further refined using a coincidence mask constructed for each excitation-emission image pair. The coincidence mask is essentially a map of the  hot spots  that occur in both excitation and emission images, as such areas are often associated with tunneled emission. In vivo studies are performed on a human colon adenocarcinoma xenograft tumor model with subcutaneous tumors and a murine breast adenocarcinoma model with aggressive tumor cell metastasis and growth in the lungs. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the reconstructions achieved by the proposed method.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comparison of fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission <e>tomography</e> (FDG-PET) and computerised tomography (CT) included 62 patients (group 1), while that for comparison of FDG-PET and serum tumour markers included 26 patients (group 2). RESULTS: In group 1, FDG-PET had positive and negative predictive values of 81% and 80% respectively, compared to 73.7% and 71.4% for CT, respectively. Combined imaging showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In group 2, FDG-PET and CEA were both positive in 42.9%, and only CEA was falsely negative in all other cases. FDG-PET and TPA were both positive in 47.6%, and in 52.4% only FDG-PET was positive. NSE and SCC had 100% specificity; their sensitivity was 38% and 25%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FDG-PET diagnosis was improved by CT. Because the serum tumour markers were falsely negative in more than 50% and there were no falsely negative results for FDG-PET, combined imaging may allow reduction of cut-off values for conventional serum tumour markers.",M2
20592340,"Visualisation of tumour regression after local chemotherapy with magnetic nanoparticles - a pilot study.Magnetic drug targeting (MDT) is a new locoregional chemotherapy method that increases the drug dose in the tumour region, while simultaneously reducing the overall dose through the application of chemotherapeutic-bound superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which are focused by an external magnetic field to the desired body compartment. An important factor in this kind of therapy is the vascularisation of the targeted tumour. In this pilot study, the visualisation of the tumour-vascularisation before and after MDT was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a rabbit VX-2 tumour model, mitoxantrone bound to Fe(3)O(4)-nanoparticles was applied through the femoral artery close to the tumour. The visualisation of vascularisation and tumour size before and after MDT was performed using a biplane angiographic system (Siemens Axiom Artis dBA) to obtain conventional angiographic series with a standard iodine contrast agent. In addition, cross-sectional images were obtained with the new technique of flat panel detector computed <e>tomography</e> (FD-CT) called DYNA-CT. RESULTS: The tumours and the supplying vessels were clearly displayed by FD-CT before and after MDT. The tumours of the study group showed considerable size reductions and the angiography showed a drastic reduction of the tumour supporting vessels following MDT. CONCLUSION: MDT leads to significant tumour size reductions within several weeks after a single administration of chemotherapy. In this pilot study, FD-CT offered an excellent possibility to monitor the vascularisation and the size of the tumours before and after MDT.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study, 14 patients underwent clinically indicated percutaneous biopsy of abdominal masses (mean size, 3.3 cm; range, 1.2-5.0 cm) in the liver (n = 6), presacral soft tissue (n = 3), retroperitoneal lymph nodes (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), and pancreas (n = 1). PET/CT images obtained no more than 62 days (mean, 18.3 days) before the biopsy procedure were registered with intraprocedural CT images by using image registration software. The registered images were used to plan the procedure and help target the masses. RESULTS: The image registrations were technically successful in all but one patient, who had severe scoliosis. The remaining 13 biopsy procedures yielded diagnostic results, which were positive for malignancy in 10 cases and negative in three cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study, 24 patients underwent 64-section multi-detector row CT of the chest for evaluation of diffuse lung disease. Scanning parameters included a pitch of 0.984:1 and 120 kVp in thin-section mode, with 2496 views per rotation compared with 984 views acquired for normal mode. The 0.625-mm-thick images were reconstructed with filtered back projection, ASIR, and ASIR high-definition (ASIR-HD) kernels. Two thoracic radiologists independently assessed the filtered back projection, ASIR, and ASIR-HD images for small anatomic details (interlobular septa, centrilobular region, and small bronchi and bronchioles), abnormal findings (reticulation, tiny nodules, altered attenuation, bronchiectasis), image quality (graded by using a six-point scale, where 1 = excellent image quality, and 5 = interpretation impossible), image noise, and artifacts. Data were tabulated for statistical testing. RESULTS: For visualization of normal and pathologic structures, CT image series reconstructed with ASIR-HD were rated substantially better than those reconstructed with filtered back projection and ASIR (P &lt; .001). ASIR-HD images were superior to filtered back projection images in 15 of 24 (62%) patients for visualization of normal structures and in 24 of 24 (100%) patients for pathologic findings. ASIR-HD was superior to ASIR in three of 24 (12%) images for normal anatomic findings and in seven of 24 (29%) images for pathologic evaluation. None of the images in the three groups were rated as unacceptable for noise (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: ASIR-HD reconstruction results in superior visualization of subtle and tiny anatomic structures and lesions in diffuse lung disease compared with ASIR and filtered back projection reconstructions.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by a regional committee for medical research ethics, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Forty-seven patients with JIA (32 women, 15 men; mean age, 35 years) were examined, on average, 30 years after the initial diagnosis. The findings of TMJ imaging, including CT and MR imaging, were evaluated by three observers. Bone and disk abnormalities, joint effusion, bone marrow abnormalities, and contrast enhancement were analyzed. RESULTS: The TMJs were involved in 33 (70%) of the 47 patients with JIA, with bilateral involvement in 29 patients. Slight to moderate contrast enhancement was observed on the images obtained in 14 (42%) of the 33 patients with TMJ JIA abnormalities. All main joint components were abnormal in 28 of the 33 patients, mainly showing flat deformed condyles, wide flat fossae, and thin or perforated disks in the normal position, or absent disks. Condylar concavity or bifidity, and secondary osteoarthritis were found in approximately half of the abnormal joints.

20574095,"Detectability of urinary stones on virtual nonenhanced images generated at pyelographic-phase dual-energy CT.PURPOSE: To evaluate the detectability of urinary stones on virtual nonenhanced images generated at pyelographic-phase dual-energy computed <e>tomography</e> (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved. All included patients had previously consented to the use of their medical records for research. Sixty-two patients (38 men, 24 women; age range, 35-91 years) had undergone CT urography, which consisted of nonenhanced and pyelographic-phase dual-energy CT performed by using a dual-source scanner. Commercial software was used to create virtual nonenhanced images by suppressing the iodine signal from the pyelographic-phase dual-energy CT scans. Two radiologists, in consensus, evaluated the virtual nonenhanced images for the presence of stones. Sensitivity for detecting stones was calculated on a per-stone basis. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were also calculated on a per-renal unit (defined as the intrarenal collecting system and ureter of one kidney) basis. The true nonenhanced scan was considered the reference standard. A jackknife method was used because any patient may have multiple stones. RESULTS: Of 62 patients with 122 renal units, 21 patients with 25 renal units had a total of 43 stones (maximal transverse diameter range, 1-24 mm; median, 3 mm). The overall sensitivity for detecting stones was 63% (27 of 43 stones) per stone. Sensitivities were 29% (four of 14 stones) for 1-2-mm stones, 64% (nine of 14 stones) for 3-4-mm stones, 83% (five of six stones) for 5-6-mm stones, and 100% (nine of nine stones) for 7-mm or larger (7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 15, and 24 mm) stones. All three ureteral stones (3, 4, and 8 mm) were correctly identified. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting stones on a per-renal unit basis were 65% (17 of 26 renal units), 92% (88 of 96 renal units), and 86% (105 of 122 renal units), respectively. CONCLUSION: Virtual nonenhanced images generated at pyelographic-phase dual-energy CT enabled the detection of urinary stones with moderate accuracy. The detection of small (1-2-mm) stones was limited.",M2
20574093,"Assessment of hepatic steatosis in patients undergoing liver resection: comparison of US, CT, T1-weighted dual-echo MR imaging, and point-resolved 1H MR spectroscopy.PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography (US), computed <e>tomography</e> (CT), T1-weighted dual-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and point-resolved proton (hydrogen 1[(1)H]) MR spectroscopy in the assessment of hepatic steatosis in patients undergoing liver resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and patients gave written informed consent. US, CT, T1-weighted MR imaging, and (1)H MR spectroscopy were performed preoperatively in 46 patients. Imaging results were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient) with histopathologic analysis of results of intraoperative liver biopsies. To assess differences between groups, one-way analysis of variance was used. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each imaging modality by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with a histopathologic cut-off value of 5% macrovesicular steatosis. Differences in sensitivity and specificity were assessed by means of McNemar analysis. RESULTS: At histopathologic examination, 23 patients had no (0%-5%) macrovesicular steatosis, 11 had mild (5%-33%), nine had moderate (33%-66%), and three had severe (&gt;66%). MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopic measurements of hepatic fat had stronger correlation with histopathologic steatosis assessment (r = 0.85, P &lt; .001 and r = 0.86, P &lt; .001, respectively) than did US (r = 0.66, P &lt; .001) and CT (r = -0.55, P &lt; .001). Only T1-weighted MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy showed differences across steatosis grades: none versus mild (P = .001 for both), mild versus moderate (P &lt; .001 for both), and moderate versus severe (P = .04 and .01, respectively). Sensitivity of US, CT, T1-weighted MR imaging, and (1)H MR spectroscopy was 65% (13 of 20), 74% (17 of 23), 90% (19 of 21), and 91% (21 of 23), respectively, and specificity was 77% (17 of 23), 70% (14 of 20), 91% (20 of 22), and 87% (20 of 23), respectively. CONCLUSION: In contrast to US and CT, T1-weighted MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy strongly correlate with histopathologic steatosis assessment and are able to demonstrate differences across steatosis grades. T1-weighted dual-echo MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy had the best diagnostic accuracy in depicting hepatic steatosis.",M2
20574092,"Distinguishing hypervascular pseudolesions of the liver from hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging.PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine findings at gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in hypervascular pseudolesions that were observed at computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) during hepatic arteriography, with special focus on distinguishing these pseudolesions from hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institute ethics committee deemed study approval unnecessary. The study population comprised 80 patients (55 men, 25 women) with chronic liver disease who underwent CT during hepatic arteriography and arterial portography, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging, and follow-up dynamic contrast material-enhanced CT. The diagnosis of 104 pseudolesions and 123 HCCs was confirmed by means of histopathologic or multimodality evaluation. Two radiologists assessed the MR imaging findings of HCCs and pseudolesions in consensus, including the signal intensities (SIs) of the lesions on T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (DW), and contrast-enhanced hepatocyte-phase images. The findings of nodular pseudolesions and HCCs were compared with the Fisher exact test. Additionally, the hepatocyte-phase SI ratio (ratio of lesion SI to liver SI) for HCCs and pseudolesions was compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 62 wedge-shaped, 32 nodular, and 10 linear pseudolesions. On gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatocyte-phase MR images, 15% of pseudolesions (16 of 104) were hypointense compared with surrounding liver tissue. The mean hepatocyte-phase SI ratio of HCCs (0.65 +/- 0.14 [standard deviation]) was significantly lower (P &lt; .01) than that of the nodular pseudolesions (0.95 +/- 0.11). The optimal cutoff value of hepatocyte-phase SI ratio for distinguishing between HCC and nodular pseudolesion was 0.84. No nodular pseudolesions were visible on DW images. CONCLUSION: Gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatocyte-phase MR imaging and DW imaging could be used to distinguish hypervascular pseudolesions from hypervascular HCCs; a hepatocyte-phase SI ratio below 0.84 and visibility on DW images were findings specific for HCCs rather than pseudolesions.",M2
20574090,"Liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection: differentiating minimal from intermediate fibrosis with perfusion CT.PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the utility of perfusion computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) for differentiating minimal from intermediate fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained. Fifty-two patients with treatment-naïve HCV infection underwent perfusion CT and percutaneous liver biopsy on the same day. Portal vein, arterial, and total liver perfusion; mean transit time; and distribution volumes for the right and left liver lobes were measured. Liver samples were scored for fibrosis, and fibrosis area was determined. Differences in quantitative perfusion parameters between patients with minimal fibrosis (score of F1) and those with intermediate fibrosis (score of F2 or F3) were tested. RESULTS: In patients with intermediate fibrosis (F2 and F3) compared with those with minimal fibrosis (F1), the portal venous perfusion (87 mL min(-1) 100 mL(-1) +/- 27 [standard deviation] vs 138 mL min(-1) 100 mL(-1) +/- 112, P = .042) and total liver perfusion (107 mL min(-1) 100 mL(-1) +/- 31 vs 169 mL min(-1) 100 mL(-1) +/- 137, P = .02) were significantly decreased, and the mean transit time was significantly increased (16 seconds +/- 4 vs 13 seconds +/- 5, P = .025). At multivariate analysis, only the mean transit time was an independent factor (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.37; P = .030). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a mean transit time threshold of 13.4 seconds allowed discrimination between minimal and intermediate fibrosis with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 65%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that perfusion changes occur early during fibrosis in chronic HCV infection and can be detected with perfusion CT. Perfusion CT may help to discriminate minimal from intermediate fibrosis. Mean transit time appears to be the most promising perfusion parameter for differentiating between fibrosis stages, although the large amount of overlap in the measured parameters limits the clinical utility of this test at present.",M2
20574089,"Characterization and correction of beam-hardening artifacts during dynamic volume CT assessment of myocardial perfusion.PURPOSE: To fully characterize beam-hardening effects caused by iodinated contrast medium in the left ventricular (LV) cavity and aorta in the assessment of myocardial perfusion at computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) and to validate a beam-hardening artifact correction algorithm that considers fluid-filled vessels and chambers important sources of beam hardening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins University animal care and use committee approved all procedures. An anatomically correct LV and myocardial phantom to characterize beam-hardening artifacts was designed. Following validation in the phantom, the beam-hardening correction (BHC) algorithm was applied to 256-detector row dynamic volume CT images in a canine ischemia model (n = 5) during adenosine stress, and the effect of beam hardening was determined by comparing regional dynamic volume CT perfusion metrics (myocardial upslope normalized by maximum LV blood pool attenuation) with microsphere-derived myocardial blood flow (MBF). A paired Student t test was used to compare continuous variables from the same subject but under different conditions, while linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the slope and statistical significance of the relationship between CT-derived perfusion metrics and microsphere-derived MBF. RESULTS: Beam-hardening artifacts were successfully reproduced in phantom studies and were eliminated with the BHC algorithm. The correlation coefficient of CT-derived perfusion metrics and microsphere-derived MBF improved from 0.60 to 0.74 (P &gt; .05) following correction in the animal model. CONCLUSION: Beam-hardening artifacts confound dynamic volume CT assessment of myocardial perfusion. Application of the BHC algorithm is helpful for improving accuracy of myocardial perfusion at dynamic volume CT.",M2
20574087,"Diagnostic accuracy of multidetector CT in acute mesenteric ischemia: systematic review and meta-analysis.PURPOSE: To use meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of contrast agent-enhanced multidetector computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) in primary acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed search engine and five other electronic databases were searched for  mesenteric ischemia,   computed tomography,  and related terms in articles published between January 1996 and September 2009, without language restrictions. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched. Two reviewers independently selected six studies that reported 2 x 2 contingency data on the diagnostic accuracy of multidetector CT in primary AMI in at least 10 patients with disease and 10 patients without disease and that used surgery or clinical outcome as the reference standard. Study data were independently extracted by the two reviewers, and disagreement was resolved by consensus. The study quality was assessed by using items from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. The primary 2 x 2 count data were investigated with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Three studies were prospective, and three were retrospective. All studies were of high quality. The CT scanners used in the included studies had between four and 40 rows. The between-study heterogeneity was low to moderate. Overall, AMI was found in 142 of 619 studied cases. The meta-analysis showed a pooled sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval: 82.8%, 97.6%) and a pooled specificity of 95.9% (95% confidence interval: 91.2%, 98.2%). CONCLUSION: On the basis of a thorough clinical examination, contrast-enhanced multidetector CT allows the diagnosis of primary AMI with high sensitivity and specificity. Thus, it may be used as the first-line imaging method.",M2

20569766,"Conventional cancer screening versus PET/CT in dermatomyositis/polymyositis.OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of whole-body [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission <e>tomography</e>/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) for diagnosing occult malignant disease in patients with myositis compared with broad conventional cancer screening. METHODS: We prospectively studied 55 consecutive patients with a recent diagnosis of myositis in 3 teaching hospitals over a 3-year period by whole-body FDG-PET/CT and compared the results with those of conventional cancer screening, which included thoracoabdominal CT, mammography, gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and tumor marker analysis. Comparisons were made using predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 9 of 55 patients were diagnosed with paraneoplastic myositis. FDG uptake was positive in 7 patients (1 false-positive), negative in 44 patients (3 false-negative), and inconclusive in 4 patients. Positive and negative predictive values of FDG-PET/CT for the diagnosis of cancer were 85.7% and 93.8%, respectively. Conventional screening was cancer-positive in 9 patients (2 false-positive) and negative in the remaining 46 patients (2 false-negative). Positive and negative predictive values were 77.8% and 95.7%, respectively. The overall predictive value of broad conventional screening was the same as that of FDG-PET/CT (92.7 vs 92.7). CONCLUSION: The performance of FDG-PET/CT, a single imaging study, for diagnosing occult malignant disease in patients with myositis was comparable to that of broad conventional screening, which includes multiple tests.",M2
20569765,"Non-adherence to recommendations for further testing after outpatient CT and MRI.BACKGROUND: Nearly 1 in every 5 outpatient visits ends with a request for a diagnostic imaging test, and imaging reports often contain recommendations for further testing. Little is known about adherence to recommendations for further testing after outpatient computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study linking provincial administrative data to a cross-sectional audit of 23,691 outpatient CT and MRI scans performed in 2005 in Ontario, Canada. After excluding patients who died (n=1031), were hospitalized (n=3030), or visited an emergency department (n=3660) within 180 days of the index CT/MRI scan, 15,970 CT/MRI scans were included. The primary outcome was adherence to recommendations for further testing within 180 days of an index CT/MRI scan. RESULTS: Further testing was recommended in 2027 of 15,970 (12.7%) index CT/MRI scan reports and was recommended most frequently after CT chest scans (593 of 2276 [26.1%]). From the 2027 scans in which further testing was recommended, we identified 2102 individual recommendations for a specific type of follow-up test and found that just over one third (37.6%) of these recommendations were followed at 180 days. Adherence was lower (32.3%) when patients had a visit to the referring physician within 180 days of the index CT/MRI scan, compared with when they had no such visit (50.5%; P &lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists commonly recommend further testing after outpatient CT and MRI scanning. However, nearly two thirds of these recommendations are not followed. This suggests that substantial opportunities exist to improve the exchange of information between clinicians and radiologists and to advance the quality of outpatient care.",M2
20568383,"Development of pulmonary abnormalities in patients with common variable immunodeficiency: associations with clinical and immunologic factors.BACKGROUND: Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have low serum IgG, IgA, and/or IgM levels and recurrent airway infections. Radiologic pulmonary abnormalities and impaired function are common complications. It is unclear to what extent IgG replacement treatment prevents further pulmonary damage and how factors beside infections may contribute to progression of disease. OBJECTIVES: To study the development of pulmonary damage and determine how clinical and immunologic factors, such as serum IgG, may contribute to possible changes. METHODS: In a retrospective, longitudinal study of 54 patients with CVID already treated with immunoglobulins, we examined changes of lung function and findings on high-resolution computed <e>tomography</e> (HRCT), obtained at 2 time points (the date of the last pulmonary function measurement before April 2005 [T1] and the date of the measurement performed closest to 5 years earlier [T0]) 2 to 7 years apart and explored possible relations to clinical and immunologic factors such as levels of IgG, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha), and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in serum. RESULTS: Despite a mean (SD) serum IgG level of 7.6 (2.3) g/L for all the patients during the entire study period, lung function decreased from T0 to T1. The combination of a low serum IgA level and serum MBL was associated with the presence of bronchiectasis and lower lung function and with worsening of several HRCT abnormalities from T0 to T1. Increased serum levels of TNF-alpha were related to deterioration of gas diffusion. A mean serum IgG level less than 5 g/L between T0 and T1 was associated with worsening of linear and/or irregular opacities seen on HRCT. CONCLUSION: For a period of 4 years, lung function and HRCT deteriorated in CVID patients treated with immunoglobulins.",M2

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine individuals who visited an allergy and sinus center: 52 control subjects (septal deviation; mean age, 32.69 years) and 47 patients with CRS (mean age, 44.43 years). INTERVENTION: Cephalometry and computed <e>tomography</e> were performed in all the participants. In blinded tests, dentists investigated the dental status of both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maxillary sinus: bone thickness and volume on computed tomography; craniofacial anatomical features: linear and angular variables in lateral cephalometry; and dental evaluation: malocclusion class, teeth status, and alveolar bone height. RESULTS: Bony wall thickness of the maxillary sinus significantly increased in patients with CRS (P &lt; .001) but showed no relationship with maxillary sinus volume. Maxillary sinus volume significantly decreased in patients with CRS (P = .001). Age and alveolar bone height had a negative effect on maxillary sinus volume in both groups. Abnormal teeth had no relationship with maxillary sinus volume in both groups but showed a negative effect on alveolar bone height in the CRS group (P = .02). Class II malocclusion associated with anterior movement of the maxilla significantly increased in the CRS group (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of CRS, maxillary sinus volume decreased with older age and increased with alveolar bone loss. Regarding craniofacial anatomical features, CRS may have an effect on malocclusion in adults.",M2
20566911,"Endoscopic vidian neurectomy: the value of preoperative computed tomographic guidance.OBJECTIVE: To explore the vidian nerve anatomy by endoscopy and paranasal sinus computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) to elucidate the appropriate surgical approach based on preoperative CT images. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients underwent 106 endoscopic vidian neurectomies between January 9, 2006, and June 30, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Paranasal sinus CT had been performed in all patients 2 weeks before surgery. Preoperative surgical planning was based on CT images, which were compared with intraoperative endoscopic findings. Two endoscopic approaches were used for vidian nerve transection, and the success rates were recorded for each. RESULTS: The transsphenoidal approach was successful on 42 sides (39.6%), while the transnasal approach was successful on 91 sides (85.8%). Success rates for the transsphenoidal approach were 0.0%, 72.1% (31 of 43 sides), and 84.6% (11 of 13 sides) for canal corpus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Success rates for the transsphenoidal approach were 50.0% (28 of 56 sides), 51.9% (14 of 27 sides), 0.0%, and 0.0% for canal floor relationship types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The transsphenoidal approach was successful only in patients without an embedded canal and with a canal floor relationship type 1 or type 2. Presence of the septum and continuation of the canal bony structure also influenced the choice of surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: The vidian nerve can be precisely identified and microinvasively transected using endoscopy. Preoperative CT images delineate the vidian canal and enhance preoperative surgical planning.",M2
20564630,"Value of integrated positron emission <e>tomography</e> revised using a phantom study to evaluate malignancy grade of lung adenocarcinoma: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The malignant biological behavior of small-sized lung adenocarcinomas remains obscure, although understanding this feature is important for selecting appropriate treatment. In the current study, the authors evaluated malignancy grades of small adenocarcinomas using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in addition to high-resolution CT (HRCT) and pathological analysis in a multicenter setting. METHODS: A total of 201 patients with clinical T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma underwent PET/CT and HRCT followed by complete surgical resection. Associations between components of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) in specimens and maximum standardized uptake values (maxSUV) on PET/CT and ground-glass opacity (GGO) ratios and tumor disappearance rate (TDR) on HRCT were analyzed, as well as associations between these findings and pathological features of the tumors. Variations in maxSUV among institutions and the underestimations derived from small tumors, which are limitations of PET performed in multicenter studies, were adjusted using a phantom study. RESULTS: The maxSUV, BAC ratio, TDR, and GGO ratio (in that order) reflected the grade of tumor invasiveness and lymph node metastasis. The maxSUV and BAC ratio were found to be significant prognostic predictors derived from disease-free survival curves. Although the BAC ratio was found to be significantly associated with preoperative radiographic parameters, the maxSUV, GGO ratio, and TDR (all P &lt; .0001), the degree of correlation with maxSUV (correlation coefficient [R(2)] = 0.1699) was much weaker than that reported with the GGO ratio (R(2) = 0.5860) or TDR (R(2) = 0.5082). CONCLUSIONS: Phantom studies can overcome the difficulties of multicenter studies using PET. A higher maxSUV appears to reflect aggressive malignant behavior in clinical T1N0M0 adenocarcinomas, independent of BAC components. Preoperative PET/CT assessment in addition to HRCT could be used to construct hypotheses for a future clinical study of strategies for the treatment of patients with small lung adenocarcinoma.",M2

20557811,"Prospective clinical pilot trial in a single cohort group of rhPDGF in foot arthrodeses.BACKGROUND: Augment Bone Graft, a fully synthetic bone graft material composed of recombinant human PDGF and a calcium phosphate matrix (rhPDGF/TCP), has been considered as a possible alternative to autogenous bone graft. Before proceeding with randomized control studies comparing rhPDGF/TCP to autograft bone, a human trial to assess efficacy and safety was required. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study was a prospective, open-label, multi-center trial designed to evaluate rhPDGF in a calcium phosphate matrix (Augment Bone Graft). Sixty patients requiring hindfoot or midfoot fusion were prospectively followed for 36 weeks. All patients received 0.9 to 2.7 mg of rhPDGF at the fusion sites and returned for clinical and radiographic review at Day 7 to 14 and Weeks 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, and 36. Computerized <e>tomography</e> (CT) scans of the fusion site were obtained at the 6- and 12-week postoperative appointment, with an additional CT scan at 16 weeks if required. RESULTS: No patients suffered a serious adverse event caused by rhPDGF. CT scan evaluation at 12- to 16-week time periods revealed moderate or complete osseous bridging of 75% (44/59) at 36 weeks. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rhPDGF is a safe product and provides clinical/radiographic outcomes that justify the pursuit of randomized controlled studies comparing rhPDGF/TCP to autograft.",M2

METHODS: Clavicles were harvested from 14 donors (age range 14-56 years). Quasistatic axial compression tests were performed using a custom rig designed to replicate in situ boundary conditions. Prior to testing, high-resolution computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) scans were taken of each clavicle. From those images, finite element models were constructed. Factors varied parametrically included the density used to threshold cortical bone in the CT scans, the presence of trabecular bone, the mesh density, Young's modulus, the maximum stress, and the element type (shell vs. solid, triangular vs. quadrilateral surface elements). RESULTS: The experiments revealed significant variability in the peak force (2.41 +/- 0.72 kN) and displacement to peak force (4.9 +/- 1.1 mm), with age (p &lt; .05) and with some geometrical traits of the specimens. In the finite element models, the failure force and location were moderately dependent upon the Young's modulus. The fracture force was highly sensitive to the yield stress (80-110 MPa). CONCLUSION: Neither fracture location nor force was strongly dependent on mesh density as long as the element size was less than 5 x 5 mm(2). Both the fracture location and force were strongly dependent upon the threshold density used to define the thickness of the cortical shell.",M2

20539187,"Assessing the implementation of guidelines for the management of the potentially injured cervical spine in unconscious trauma patients in England.BACKGROUND: There are many complications involved in the immobilization of unconscious patients with potential cervical spine injuries. In February 2005, the Intensive Care Society (ICS), United Kingdom, produced consensus guidelines to evaluate spinal injuries in unconscious victims of blunt multiple injuries to address this important clinical problem. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to lead consultants of intensive care units in England enquiring about the management of the cervical spine in unconscious trauma patients. Data were collated, and the responses to open questions were grouped into themes. Responses were compared with published ICS guidelines. RESULTS: The response rate was 46% (91 of 199). Forty-four of 89 units had formal policies. Twenty-two of 44 of these units had adopted national guidelines. Common methods of immobilization were  collar &amp; head blocks  (59 of 83) and collar only (18 of 83). Thirty of the 70 were immobilized in a semirigid collar. Common X-ray combinations were combined lateral/anteroposterior/Odontoid views (18 of 64) and lateral and anteroposterior views (21 of 64). Fifty of 71 would perform computed <e>tomography</e> scans if images were unsatisfactory. Senior radiologist involvement in reporting was mentioned by 65 of 78. Immobilization was discontinued in the presence of normal X-ray studies and computed tomography scans by 44 of 83. CONCLUSION: A unit policy ensures that current recommendations are followed. Despite the ICS guidelines being published 4 years ago, over half of the individual intensive care units have no policy in place. A lack of adequate guidance for junior doctors can lead to steps in the process of clearance being omitted and potential injuries being missed. We recommend that the national organization do more to facilitate a wider dissemination of these guidelines.",M2
20539185,"Imaging utilization during explosive multiple casualty incidents.BACKGROUND: Emergency radiology is a vital tool in the evaluation of victims of explosive multiple casualty incidents (MCIs). Prior reports estimate that approximately 50% of explosive MCI patients required imaging, including 7% to 22% who required computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) studies. This report describes the contemporary utilization of emergency radiology during the evaluation of explosive MCI victims in a modern US military trauma hospital in Iraq. We hypothesized that a much higher number of patients received imaging than has been reported previously in the literature. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of records from 3 MCIs managed at the US Air Force Theater Hospital, Balad AB, Iraq between February and April 2008. All three incidents were the result of improvised explosive devices. RESULTS: Overall, 50 patients had a mean Injury Severity Score of 19 and a mortality of 8%. Ninety-two percent received imaging during their emergency department evaluation, including 90% who received CT, 70% who received X-rays, and 38% who received extended focused abdominal sonography for trauma ultrasound examinations. Overall, patients had a mean of 3.5 CTs and 1.9 X-rays during their initial assessment. Of the CTs, 93% were part of a trauma pan-scan, and 49% of the CT results were clinically significant. CONCLUSION: These results are significantly different from previous reports and indicate that victims of explosive MCIs will require more imaging, especially CT, than previously anticipated. These data will allow improved integration of radiology staffing and resource allocation into disaster management plans designed to prepare for future explosive MCIs.",M2

20535986,"[Significance of ipsilateral adrenalectomy in surgery for renal cell carcinoma]PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyze the incidence of involvement of ipsilateral adrenal gland from renal cell carcinoma and assess the actual significance of ipsilateral adrenalectomy at nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1981 to 2007, 588 patients were diagnosed as having renal cell carcinoma pathologically at our institution. Of those patients, we retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data in the 426 renal cell carcinoma patients who were eligible for evaluation. Of the 426 patients, 193 (AD group) and the remaining 233 (AS group) underwent radical or partial nephrectomy with or without adrenalectomy, respectively. RESULTS: Five patients (2.6%) of AD group had adrenal involvement and all of them presented T4 and/or M1 disease. The three patients presented direct involvement of adrenal gland, while metastasis in the remaining 2. All the 5 patients had disease progression after surgery and 4 of them died of disease. The remaining one patient, in whom interferon showed a remarkable response, has been alive with disease for 31 months. The ipsilateral adrenal gland was abnormal on preoperative computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) in 8 patients (1.8%), of whom, 4 had adrenal involvement. One of the five adrenal involvements was overlooked by CT. Thus, in this study, CT showed 80% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 99% negative predictive value and 50% positive predictive value. The 18 patients (7.7%) in AS group later developed nodal and/or visceral metastasis, while no solitary ipsilateral adrenal recurrence was observed in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Ipsilateral adrenal involvement from renal cell carcinoma is rare, especially after the adrenal-sparing surgery.

20531045,"18F-FDG PET/CT evaluation of lymphoma with renal involvement: comparison with renal carcinoma.OBJECTIVE: Lymphoma can arise at any anatomic site, but it is rare to find kidney involvement. The aim of this study was to assess the role of F-flourodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission <e>tomography</e> (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting lymphoma with renal involvement. Reports of such use of F-FDG PET/CT are limited. METHODS: Twelve lymphoma patients with renal involvement and 12 renal carcinoma patients were studied with F-FDG PET/CT. Intense F-FDG uptake, suggestive of positivity, was measured in mean standardized uptake values (standardized uptake values [SUV] mean). RESULTS: The results of PET/CT were validated by bone marrow, biopsy tissue and/or surgery. F-FDG PET/CT detected lymphoma with renal involvement lesions or renal carcinoma lesions in at least one site in the 24 patients. F-FDG uptake by the lymphoma lesions was much higher than the F-FDG uptake by the renal clear cell carcinomas (SUV mean 6.37 +/- 2.28 vs 2.58 +/- 0.62), and similar to that of renal cell carcinoma and renal collecting duct carcinoma (SUV mean 6.37 +/- 2.28 vs 6.27 +/- 1.15). There were dissimilar morphological changes in the homologous CT. Differing from renal cancer, lymphoma in the spleen, uterus, and bone marrow can easily be diagnosed by F-FDG PET/CT. CONCLUSION: The lesions of lymphoma with renal involvement, and especially those of primary renal lymphoma, are F-FDG avid. PET/CT appears to be useful in comparing these lesions with those of renal carcinoma, especially for primary renal lymphoma.",M2

However, these tumors are more aggressive with a tendency for local and metastatic recurrence, sometimes after a prolonged symptom-free interval. We report an unusual metastatic recurrence of an intracranial hemangiopericytoma, 8 years after surgery for the primary tumor and discuss the role of positron emission <e>tomography</e>/computed tomography in the follow-up of these patients.",M2
20527549,"The influence of initial outlines on manual segmentation.PURPOSE: Initial outlines are often presented as an aid to reduce the time-cost associated with manual segmentation and measurement of structures in medical images. This study evaluated the influence of initial outlines on manual segmentation intraobserver and interobserver precision. METHODS: Three observers independently outlined all pleural mesothelioma tumors present in five computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) sections in each of 30 patient scans. After a lapse of time, each observer was presented with the same series of CT sections with the outlines of each observer superimposed as initial outlines. Each observer created altered outlines by altering the initial outlines to reflect their perception of the tumor boundary. Altered outlines were compared to original outlines using the Jaccard similarity coefficient (J). Intraobserver and interobserver precision of observer outlines were calculated by applying linear mixed effects analysis of variance models to the J values. The percent of minor alterations (alterations that resulted in only slight changes in the initial outline) was also recorded. RESULTS: The average J value between pairs of observer original outlines was 0.371. The average J value between pairs of observer outlines when altered from an identical initial outline was 0.796, indicating increased interobserver precision. The average difference between J values of an observer's segmentation created by altering their own initial outline and when altering a different observer's initial outline was 0.476, indicating initial outlines strongly influence intraobserver precision. Observers made minor alterations on 74.5% of initial outlines with which they were presented. CONCLUSIONS: Intraobserver and interobserver precision were strongly dependent on the initial outline. These effects are likely due to the tendency of observers to make only minor corrections to initial outlines. This finding could impact observer study design, tumor growth assessment, computer-aided diagnosis system validation, and radiation therapy target volume definition when initial outlines are used as an observer aid.",M2
20527531,"Imaging performance of a hybrid x-ray computed <e>tomography</e>-fluorescence molecular tomography system using priors.PURPOSE: The performance is studied of two newly introduced and previously suggested methods that incorporate priors into inversion schemes associated with data from a recently developed hybrid x-ray computed tomography and fluorescence molecular tomography system, the latter based on CCD camera photon detection. The unique data set studied attains accurately registered data of high spatially sampled photon fields propagating through tissue along 360 degrees projections. METHODS: Approaches that incorporate structural prior information were included in the inverse problem by adding a penalty term to the minimization function utilized for image reconstructions. Results were compared as to their performance with simulated and experimental data from a lung inflammation animal model and against the inversions achieved when not using priors. RESULTS: The importance of using priors over stand-alone inversions is also showcased with high spatial sampling simulated and experimental data. The approach of optimal performance in resolving fluorescent biodistribution in small animals is also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of prior information from x-ray CT data in the reconstruction of the fluorescence biodistribution leads to improved agreement between the reconstruction and validation images for both simulated and experimental data.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHOD: MDCT cholangiographs of 50 patients with clinically suspected biliary tract obstruction were retrospectively reconstructed and reviewed. The causes of obstruction identified by MDCT were divided into three groups including calculus, benign stricture, and malignancy. Final diagnosis was based on pathological diagnosis or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or follow-up. The MDCT diagnosis and final diagnosis were compared RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative redictive value of MDCT cholangiography for detection of calculus, benign stricture, and malignancy were 91.7-100%, except for sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of benign stricture, which were 66.7% and 66.7% respectively. CONCLUSION: MDCT cholangiography is a fast, noninvasive technique that offers high diagnostic accuracy in evaluation of cause of biliary tract obstruction.",M2
20521756,"Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses.The increasing use of cross-sectional imaging has led to an increase in the incidental discovery of adrenal masses (adrenal incidentalomas). Although most of these lesions are benign, they often present a diagnostic dilemma. Before creating a management plan, the physician should determine if the lesion is benign or malignant and if the lesion is functioning or nonfunctioning. Incidentally discovered adrenal masses usually are benign adenomas; however, myelolipomas, cysts, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastases, and adrenocortical carcinomas are also possible. Unenhanced computed <e>tomography</e> and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging can characterize most adenomas because the lesions have high lipid content. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography can further characterize the adenomas because of the washout characteristics with iodinated intravenous contrast media. Fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography can be helpful in characterizing some lesions, and biopsy is rarely required. This article summarizes the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for the use of imaging modalities and biopsy to characterize incidentally discovered adrenal masses.",M2
20519925,"[A case of metastatic lung cancer with cavitation due to urothelial carcinoma]We report a rare case of lung cancer with cavitation that was caused by metastasis of urothelial carcinoma. A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with macrohematuria and general fatigue in September 2003. Computed <e>tomography</e> revealed a left ureter tumor, which was removed by left nephroureterectomy in October 2003. However, a part of the ureter could not be resected because of the adhesion that had occurred after a previous operation. The patient was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer, and she underwent sigmoidectomy and resection of the remaining part of the ureter in August 2004. Subsequently, transurethral resection was performed several times for bladder tumor. The pathological diagnosis in February 2005 was pT2. Cisplatin-based intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed because it was not possible to perform a cystectomy due to the poor performance status. In March 2006, computed tomography of the chest revealed a mass shadow with a cavity in the left lower lung field. This was diagnosed as primary or metastatic lung cancer and was treated by left lower lobectomy in November 2006. On the basis of the pathological findings, we diagnosed the mass as metastatic tumor secondary to the urothelial carcinoma.

20516318,"Nonanatomic tunnel position in traditional transtibial single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction evaluated by three-dimensional computed <e>tomography</e>.BACKGROUND: Transtibial drilling techniques are widely used for arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, most likely because they simplify femoral tunnel placement and reduce surgical time. Recently, however, there has been concern that this technique results in nonanatomically positioned bone tunnels, which may cause abnormal knee function. The purpose of this study was to use three-dimensional computed tomography models to visualize and quantify the positions of femoral and tibial tunnels in patients who underwent traditional transtibial single-bundle reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament and to compare these positions with reference data on anatomical tunnel positions. METHODS: Computed tomography scans were performed on thirty-two knees that had undergone transtibial single-bundle reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Three-dimensional computed tomography models were aligned into an anatomical coordinate system. Tibial tunnel aperture centers were measured in the anterior-to-posterior and medial-to-lateral directions on the tibial plateau. Femoral tunnel aperture centers were measured in anatomic posterior-to-anterior and proximal-to-distal directions and with the quadrant method. These measurements were compared with reference data on anatomical tunnel positions. RESULTS: Tibial tunnels were located at a mean (and standard deviation) of 48.0% +/- 5.5% of the anterior-to-posterior plateau depth and a mean of 47.8% +/- 2.4% of the medial-to-lateral plateau width. Femoral tunnels were measured at a mean of 54.3% +/- 8.3% in the anatomic posterior-to-anterior direction and at a mean of 41.1% +/- 10.3% in the proximal-to-distal direction. With the quadrant method, femoral tunnels were measured at a mean of 37.2% +/- 5.5% from the proximal condylar surface (parallel to the Blumensaat line) and at a mean of 11.3% +/- 6.6% from the notch roof (perpendicular to the Blumensaat line). Tibial tunnels were positioned medial to the anatomic posterolateral position (p &lt; 0.001). Femoral tunnels were positioned anterior to both anteromedial and posterolateral anatomic tunnel locations (p &lt; 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Transtibial anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction failed to accurately place femoral and tibial tunnels within the native anterior cruciate ligament insertion site. If anatomical graft placement is desired, transtibial techniques should be performed only after careful identification of the native insertions. If anatomical positioning of the femoral tunnel cannot be achieved, then an alternative approach may be indicated.",M2
20516317,"The location of femoral and tibial tunnels in anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction analyzed by three-dimensional computed <e>tomography</e> models.BACKGROUND: Characterization of the insertion site anatomy in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has recently received increased attention in the literature, coinciding with a growing interest in anatomic reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to visualize and quantify the position of anatomic anteromedial and posterolateral bone tunnels in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of novel methods applied to three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction images. METHODS: Careful arthroscopic dissection and anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament tunnel drilling were performed with use of topographical landmarks in eight cadaver knees. Computed tomography scans were performed on each knee, and three-dimensional models were created and aligned into an anatomic coordinate system. Tibial tunnel aperture centers were measured in the anterior-to-posterior and medial-to-lateral directions on the tibial plateau. The femoral tunnel aperture centers were measured in anatomic posterior-to-anterior and proximal-to-distal directions and with the quadrant method (relative to the femoral notch). RESULTS: The centers of the tunnel apertures for the anteromedial and posterolateral tunnels were located at a mean (and standard deviation) of 25% +/- 2.8% and 46.4% +/- 3.7%, respectively, of the anterior-to-posterior tibial plateau depth and at a mean of 50.5% +/- 4.2% and 52.4% +/- 2.5% of the medial-to-lateral tibial plateau width. On the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle in the anatomic posterior-to-anterior direction, the anteromedial and posterolateral tunnels were located at 23.1% +/- 6.1% and 15.3% +/- 4.8%, respectively. The proximal-to-distal locations were at 28.2% +/- 5.4% and 58.1 +/- 7.1%, respectively. With the quadrant method, anteromedial and posterolateral tunnels were measured at 21.7% +/- 2.5% and 35.1% +/- 3.5%, respectively, from the proximal condylar surface (parallel to the Blumensaat line), and at 33.2% +/- 5.6% and 55.3% +/- 5.3% from the notch roof (perpendicular to the Blumensaat line). Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high, with small standard errors of measurement.

20515577,"Incidental non-secreting adrenal masses in cancer patients: intra-individual comparison of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission <e>tomography</e>/computed tomography with computed tomography and shift magnetic resonance imaging.The ability of integrated (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) to distinguish between benign and malignant incidental non-secreting adrenal masses was evaluated in cancer patients. Results were compared with those of CT and shift magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 1832 cancer patients who had undergone FDG PET/CT scans were retrospectively evaluated. Visual interpretation, tumour maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), liver SUV(max) and tumour/liver SUV(max) ratios were correlated with the findings of CT, shift MRI and final diagnosis (based on biopsy or clinical/radiological follow-up). A total of 109 adrenal masses were found: 49 were malignant and 60 were benign on final diagnosis. A tumour/liver SUV(max) ratio threshold of 1.0 was more accurate in differentiating the tumour type than tumour SUV(max) or visual interpretation alone. Diagnostic accuracy of CT and shift MRI (92 - 97%) was similar to that for FDG PET/CT (94 - 97%). In conclusion, FDG PET/CT accurately characterizes adrenal tumours, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Use of 1.0 as the threshold for the tumour/liver SUV(max) ratio seems to be promising for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal masses in cancer patients.",M2
20515344,"A radiographic computed <e>tomography</e>-based study to determine the ideal entry point, trajectory, and length for safe fixation using C-2 pars interarticularis screws.OBJECT: Effective methods for fixation of the axis include C1-2 transarticular and C-2 pedicle screw placement. Both techniques pose a risk of vertebral artery (VA) injury in patients with narrow pedicles or an enlarged, high-riding VA. Pars screws at C-2 avoid the pedicle, but can cause VA injury with excessively long screws. Therefore, the authors evaluated various entry points and trajectories to determine ideal pars screw lengths that avoid breaching the transverse foramen. METHODS: Both pars were studied on 50 CT scans (100 total). Various pars lengths were assessed using 2 entry points and 3 trajectories (6 measurements). Entry point A was the superior one-fourth of the lateral mass. Entry point B was 3-mm rostral to the inferior aspect of the lateral mass. Using entry points A and B, Trajectory 1 was the minimum distance to the transverse foramen; Trajectory 2 was the maximum distance to the transverse foramen; and Trajectory 3 was the steepest angle to the pars/C-2 superior facet junction without transverse foramen breach. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 46 +/- 17 years, and 84% of the CT scans reviewed were obtained in men. There was no significant difference in right or left measurements. Entry point B demonstrated greater pars lengths for each trajectory compared with entry point A (p &lt; 0.0001). For both entry points, Trajectory 3 provided the greatest pars length. Using Trajectory 3 with entry point B, 84, 95, and 99% had a pars length that measured &gt;or= 18, 16, and 14 mm, respectively. Using Trajectory 3 with Entry point A, only 41, 64, and 87% had a pars length that measured &gt;or= 18, 16, and 14 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using an entry point 3-mm rostral to the inferior edge of the lateral mass and a trajectory directed toward the superior facet/pars junction, 99% of partes interarticularis in this study would tolerate a 14-mm screw without breach of the transverse foramen.",M2
20514599,"[Spondylodiscitis - an interdisciplinary challenge]HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 21-year-old man presented with severe lumbar back pain and progressive paraparesis with clinical signs of spondylitis. Laboratory findings revealed elevated infectious parameters. Because of a positive Mantoux-Test he had been treated with quadruple tuberculostatic drugs for eight weeks without prior identification of the causative pathogen. INVESTIGATIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a multisegmental spondylitis of the lumbar vertebrae (L3 - L5) with epidural empyema. Computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) of the abdomen confirmed large bilateral abscesses in the psoas muscles. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The findings supported the diagnosis of spondylitis. The antibiotic regimen was continued. CT-guided drainage was placed in both psoas muscles. Laminectoma of L3 - 5 and dorsal spondylodesis of L2 - S1 were performed immediately. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from the intraoperative biopsies and treated according to the drug sensitivity test. After further surgical debridment and corporectomy of L4 and L5 the infection was successfully treated. Ten weeks after admission the patient was transferred to a neurologic rehabilitation unit for mobilization.

A 2.5-year-old presented with otalgia, transient vertigo, and fluctuating facial palsy partially responsive to myringotomy with tube. Work-up for infectious and neoplastic processes was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone showed a very unusual, expansile, erosive appearance to the otic capsule, and magnetic resonance imaging of the temporal bone revealed soft tissue enhancement of the middle ear, mastoid, and inner ear. The patient's symptoms were transiently responsive to tympanomastoidectomy. Inner ear histopathology after labyrinthectomy revealed changes consistent with pseudotumor. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the inner ear is extremely rare but needs to be considered in cases of refractory otitis media with facial palsy, particularly when certain changes appear on CT of the temporal bone.",M2
20513040,"Is the width of the labyrinthine portion of the fallopian tube implicated in the pathophysiology of Bell's palsy?: a prospective clinical study using computed <e>tomography</e>.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying Bell's palsy remain obscure, despite the extensive relevant research. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have strongly indicated that facial nerve edema cannot be regarded as the sole etiologic factor, because it might persist long after full clinical recovery, or might be demonstrated in the clinically unaffected side or healthy controls. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a narrow facial canal might be implicated in the pathophysiology of Bell's palsy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. METHODS: A high-resolution computerized tomography of the temporal bone with 1-mm thick contiguous axial sections was performed in 25 patients with unilateral Bell's palsy. The width of the fallopian tube was measured at the meatal foramen and the middle part of its labyrinthine segment. RESULTS: When using paired Student t tests, the measured width of the affected ear was found significantly smaller than that of the unaffected side, both at the meatal foramen (P = .007) and at the middle part of the labyrinthine segment (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Bell's palsy seems to usually coincide with the narrower fallopian tube of the patient. This anatomical detail, supported by previous MRI studies, seems to indicate that an asymmetry between the right and left fallopian tube might be a necessary pathogenetic mechanism for the development of a facial nerve edema into Bell's palsy in the narrower fallopian canal. More studies on large healthy populations are needed before a notable facial canal asymmetry is linked to a higher risk for developing Bell's palsy.",M2
20510971,"Effects of aquatic resistance training on mobility limitation and lower-limb impairments after knee replacement.OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of aquatic resistance training on mobility, muscle power, and cross-sectional area. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research laboratory and hospital rehabilitation pool. PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample (N=50) of eligible women and men 55 to 75 years old 4 to 18 months after unilateral knee replacement with no contraindications who were willing to participate in the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve-week progressive aquatic resistance training (n=26) or no intervention (n=24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mobility limitation assessed by walking speed and stair ascending time, and self-reported physical functional difficulty, pain, and stiffness assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire. Knee extensor power and knee flexor power assessed isokinetically, and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) by computed <e>tomography</e>. RESULTS: Compared with the change in the control group, habitual walking speed increased by 9% (P=.005) and stair ascending time decreased by 15% (P=.006) in the aquatic training group. There was no significant difference between the groups in the WOMAC scores. The training increased knee extensor power by 32% (P&lt;.001) in the operated and 10% (P=.001) in the nonoperated leg, and knee flexor power by 48% (P=.003) in the operated and 8% (P=.002) in the nonoperated leg compared with controls. The mean increase in thigh muscle CSA of the operated leg was 3% (P=.018) and that of the nonoperated leg 2% (P=.019) after training compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive aquatic resistance training had favorable effects on mobility limitation by increasing walking speed and decreasing stair ascending time. In addition, training increased lower limb muscle power and muscle CSA. Resistance training in water is a feasible mode of rehabilitation that has wide-ranging positive effects on patients after knee replacement surgery.",M2

The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compare the cerebral macro- and microvascular architecture of rats in two different models of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion using an innovative quantitative micro- and nano-CT imaging technique. METHODS: 4h of middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed in rats using the macrosphere method or the suture technique. After contrast perfusion, brains were isolated and scanned en-bloc using micro-CT (8 mum)3 or nano-CT at 500 nm3 voxel size to generate 3D images of the cerebral vasculature. The arterial vascular volume fraction and gray scale attenuation was determined and the significance of differences in measurements was tested with analysis of variance [ANOVA]. RESULTS: Micro-CT provided quantitative information on vascular morphology. Micro- and nano-CT proved to visualize and differentiate vascular occlusion territories performed in both models of cerebral ischemia. The suture technique leads to a remarkable decrease in the intravascular volume fraction of the middle cerebral artery perfusion territory. Blocking the medial cerebral artery with macrospheres, the vascular volume fraction of the involved hemisphere decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001), independently of the number of macrospheres, and was comparable to the suture method. We established gray scale measurements by which focal cerebral ischemia could be radiographically categorized (p &lt; 0.001). Nano-CT imaging demonstrates collateral perfusion related to different occluded vessel territories after macrosphere perfusion. CONCLUSION: Micro- and Nano-CT imaging is feasible for analysis and differentiation of different models of focal cerebral ischemia in rats.",M2
20507789,"Preoperative staging of cancer of the pancreatic head: is there room for improvement?BACKGROUND: Despite advances in preoperative staging, cancer of the pancreatic head is frequently found to be unresectable at laparotomy. We sought to identify potential areas of improvement in preoperative staging. METHODS: We performed a retrospective institutional review of patients referred for resection of cancer of the pancreatic head over a 2-year period. The primary outcome was the rate of metastasis or unresectable disease found at laparotomy in patients who were booked for pancreaticoduodenectomy with curative intent. RESULTS: During the study period, 133 patients were referred with suspected cancer of the pancreatic head. All underwent preoperative computed <e>tomography</e> scanning. Twenty-four also underwent preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and 23 also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In total, 78 patients were deemed not to be candidates for surgery, leaving 55 patients with potentially resectable cancer who were scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy. Of these, 32 patients (58%) underwent successful resection with curative intent, and 23 patients (42%) were found to have metastatic or locally advanced disease not identified by preoperative staging. Reasons for nonresectability were metastases (9 patients, 16%), vascular involvement (12 patients, 22%) and mesentery involvement (2 patients, 4%). One patient had a diagnostic laparoscopy immediately before planned open exploration and was found to have peritoneal seeding precluding curative resection. Of the patients who underwent EUS, 14 were not surgical candidates because of locally advanced tumours. Ten patients were offered surgery with curative intent, and 5 patients (50%) were found have unresectable tumours (4 metastatic, 1 locally advanced). Of the patients who underwent MRI, 11 were offered surgery, and 5 (45%) had unresectable tumours (2 metastatic, 3 locally advanced disease). CONCLUSION: In our institution, preoperative staging for cancer of the pancreatic head misses a substantial number of metastatic and unresectable disease. There is clearly room for improvement, and newer technologies should be evaluated to enhance the detection of metastatic and locally advanced disease to prevent unnecessary laparotomy.",M2
20506681,"Uterine arteriovenous malformation diagnosed with multislice computed <e>tomography</e>: a case report.BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the uterus are extremely rare and occur either in congenital or acquired form. The most common clinical presentation is abnormal uterine bleeding, which may be aggravated by therapeutic curettage. CASE: A case of uterine AVM diagnosed by means of multislice computed tomography (CT). The 37-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department complaining of hypermenorrhea that had been occurring for the last 5 years. She had undergone multiple currettages for incomplete abortions in the past. Transabdominal ultrasonography demonstrated thickening of the wall of the uterine corpus with numerous cystic lesions. Dynamic CT and CT angiography were useful for detecting and characterizing the pathology in this case. Numerous anomalous blood vessels communicating with the right and left uterine arteries were found in the wall of the uterus and in the parametrium. Uterine and ovarian arteries were enlarged, with early filling of veins on CT angiography. Whole extent of the vascular abnormality was very well depicted by the CT images and CT angiography. The diagnosis of uterine AVMs was thus made noninvasively. CONCLUSION: This noninvasive technique elegantly demonstrates the uterine AVMs and should be performed to diagnose and to determine the true extent of the malformation, particularly when Doppler ultrasound is inconclusive.",M2
20505066,"Acute appendicitis: clinical outcome in patients with an initial false-positive CT diagnosis.PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical outcome in patients with a diagnosis of appendicitis at computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) in whom treatment is deemed unnecessary after clinical evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval, 2283 patients (856 men, 1427 women; mean age, 46 years; age range, 18-99 years) who underwent CT because they were suspected of having appendicitis between 2002 and 2007 were retrospectively identified. CT reports were reviewed, and the likelihood of appendicitis was assigned a score on a five-point scale: score 1, definitely absent; score 2, nonvisualized appendix with no secondary signs of inflammation; score 3, equivocal; score 4, probable; and score 5, definitely present. Diagnosis of appendicitis at CT was considered a false-positive result if the CT report was classified as probable or definite appendicitis but the patient was not treated within 4 days. Cases with false-positive results were reviewed by two readers blinded to patient outcome, supporting clinical data, and prospective scan interpretation, and a grade was assigned by using the same scale. Medical records were reviewed to determine outcomes. Descriptional statistics were used. RESULTS: Overall, 516 (23%) of 2283 patients had CT findings of probable or definite appendicitis. Thirteen (3%) of 516 patients did not receive immediate treatment for appendicitis. Of these, five (38%; 95% confidence interval: 18%, 65%) underwent later appendectomy with proved appendicitis after a mean interval of 118 days (range, 5-443 days). Seven (54%) of 13 patients never developed appendicitis across a mean follow-up of 583 days (range, 14-1460 days). One (8%) of 13 had a normal appendix at eventual surgery. CONCLUSION: Five of 13 patients with CT findings of appendicitis and reassuring clinical evaluation results in whom immediate treatment was deferred ultimately returned with appendicitis. In patients with CT results positive for appendicitis and benign or atypical clinical findings, a diagnosis of chronic or recurrent appendicitis may be considered.",M2
20501734,"Primary bone malignancy: effective treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term follow-up results of ultrasonographically (US)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation in patients with primary bone malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the ethics committee. Each patient or parent (if patient was younger than 18 years), signed an informed consent form before being selected and treated. From December 1997 to November 2004, 80 patients with a primary bone malignancy-60 with stage IIb disease and 20 with stage III disease (Enneking staging system)-were treated with US-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation. High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation combined with chemotherapy was performed in 62 patients with osteosarcoma, one patient with periosteal osteosarcoma, and three patients with Ewing sarcoma. The remaining 14 patients had chondrosarcoma, giant cell bone cancer, periosteal sarcoma, or an unknown malignancy and were treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation only. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed <e>tomography</e> (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were used to assess tumor response. Cumulative survival rates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation guided by real-time US was performed. Follow-up images demonstrated completely ablated malignant bone tumors in 69 patients and greater than 50% tumor ablation in the remaining 11 patients. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 89.8%, 72.3%, 60.5%, 50.5%, and 50.5%, respectively. Survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 93.3%, 82.4%, 75.0%, 63.7%, and 63.7%, respectively, in the patients with stage IIb cancer and 79.2%, 42.2%, 21.1%, 15.8%, and 15.8%, respectively, in those with stage III disease. Among the patients with stage IIb disease, long-term survival rates were substantially improved in the 30 patients who received the full treatment-that is, complete high-intensity focused ultrasound and full cycles of chemotherapy-compared with the survival rates for the 24 patients who did not finish the chemotherapy cycles and the six patients who underwent partial ablation only. Only five (7%) of the 69 patients who underwent complete ablation had local cancer recurrence during the follow-up period. Forty adverse events were recorded, with 14 patients requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: US-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of malignant bone tumors is feasible and effective and eventually may be a component of limb-sparing techniques for patients with these cancers.",M2
20501732,"Multidetector CT of the lung: image quality with garnet-based detectors.PURPOSE: To evaluate the image quality of both standard- and reduced-dose computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) by comparing multidetector CT with garnet-based detectors with multidetector CT with conventional detectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the internal ethics review board. Informed consent was obtained. Eleven cadaveric lungs inflated and fixed by using the Heitzman method were scanned by using both CT with garnet-based detectors and CT with conventional detectors. Tube current was 400 mA for standard-dose and 10 mA for reduced-dose CT, and voltage was 120 kVp. Either normal scan mode with 984 views (conventional and garnet-based detectors) or high-resolution mode with 2496 views was used. Image quality at conventional-detector CT and garnet-based-detector CT in all modes was graded by two independent observers with a five-point scale. The evaluation items included normal lung structures, subjective visual noise, and abnormal CT findings. Quantitative image noise measurements were calculated by measuring the standard deviations in a circular region of interest on each selected image. RESULTS: At standard-dose CT, image quality at CT with garnet-based detectors (high-resolution mode) was significantly improved (P &lt; .001, Tukey-Kramer). However, there was no significant difference between quantitative image noise measurements (P &gt; or = .24). At reduced-dose CT, only noise differed significantly, with both subjective visual noise and quantitative image noise measurements significantly greater at CT with garnet-based detectors (high-resolution mode) (P &lt; or = .01). There was no significant difference in image quality except for noise between conventional-detector CT and garnet-based-detector CT (P &gt; or = .06). CONCLUSION: The image quality of standard-dose garnet-based-detector CT (high-resolution) was significantly improved. Although highly reduced-dose garnet-based-detector CT (high-resolution mode) provided more image noise, overall image quality was not different between conventional-detector CT and garnet-based-detector CT.",M2
20501731,"Bronchial artery anatomy: preoperative 3D simulation with multidetector CT.PURPOSE: To preoperatively evaluate anatomic variations of the bronchial arteries by obtaining three-dimensional (3D) simulations with multidetector computed <e>tomography</e> (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Seventy-three consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent dynamic multidetector CT. The data were used to generate 3D simulations of the thoracic cavity. These images were then used to evaluate anatomic variations of the bilateral bronchial arteries and the mediastinal course in relation to the esophagus and trachea-bronchi. The preoperative CT findings were correlated with the thoracoscopic findings. RESULTS: CT depicted 118 right bronchial and 105 left bronchial arteries. The right bronchial arteries arose from the intercostal-bronchial trunk (IBT), thoracic aorta, common trunk of both bronchial arteries (CTB), and right subclavian artery in 61, 15, 38, and four cases, respectively, whereas the left bronchial arteries arose from the thoracic aorta, IBT, and CTB in 63, four, and 38 cases, respectively. The right bronchial arteries followed preferential courses through the mediastinum, depending on the parent artery: All 61 right bronchial arteries that arose from the IBT ran along the right side of the esophagus, dorsal to the trachea-main bronchi, whereas the majority of direct-origin and CTB-type right bronchial arteries and all left bronchial arteries ran along the left side of the esophagus. During right thoracoscopy, all bronchial arteries coursing along the right side of the esophagus were identified, whereas those coursing along the left side of the esophagus were frequently out of intraoperative view. Six small right bronchial arteries that were not detected at CT were discovered during surgery. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional simulation with multidetector CT yields precise preoperative information regarding the anatomy of the bronchial arteries and their variants.",M2
20501729,"A simple respiratory indicator for irradiation during voluntary breath holding: a one-touch device without electronic materials.PURPOSE: To evaluate the use, structural principles, operation, and acquired reproducibility of a respiratory monitoring device to be used for voluntary patient breath holding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation was performed of a respiratory monitoring device that enables determination of the respiratory level in a patient by measuring the movement of two contacts on the abdomen and chest wall. Neither metallic nor electronic materials are used in the mechanics for this device. The initial study group comprised 21 consecutive patients (15 men, six women; mean age, 75 years; range, 56-92 years) with lung or abdominal tumors who underwent examination with the device and computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) for three-dimensional reproducibility of lung base position during voluntary breath holding with or without use of the device. RESULTS: One patient with mild dementia was excluded; in most of the remaining 20 patients, high reproducibility of the breath-holding position was achieved in a short time with the device. In these 20 patients who were able to adapt to use of the device, three-dimensional mean maximum differences in lung base position during three random voluntary breath holds were 2.0 mm along the cranial-caudal axis, 1.5 mm along the anterior-posterior axis, and 1.2 mm along the right-left axis. The differences in all axes were significantly smaller with use of the respiratory monitoring device than without the device. CONCLUSION: The device demonstrates satisfactory reproducibility of voluntary patient breath holding easily and inexpensively and may offer a convenient device for easy use during irradiation with voluntary breath-holding conditions that require a small internal margin.",M2
20501716,"Collateral ventilation in a canine model with bronchial obstruction: assessment with xenon-enhanced dual-energy CT.PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of the use of xenon-enhanced dynamic dual-energy computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) for visualization and quantitative assessment of collateral ventilation in a canine model with bronchial obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. One segmental bronchus was occluded in nine dogs (weight range, 20-25 kg). Dynamic dual-energy CT scanning was performed by using dual-source CT during the wash-in-washout study of xenon inhalation via mechanical ventilation. Imaging parameters were 14 x 1.2-mm collimation, 40 mAs (effective) at 140 kV and 170 mAs (effective) at 80 kV, pitch of 0.45, and 0.33-second rotation time. By using dual-energy software, CT images and xenon maps were reconstructed. CT attenuation values were measured in the airways proximal to obstruction (AW(PROX)) and airways distal to obstruction (AW(DIST)) and at the parenchyma with patent airways (P(PATE)) and parenchyma with obstructed airways (P(OBST)). CT attenuation values on dynamic xenon maps were plotted with exponential function; ventilation parameters, including velocity of ventilation (K value), magnitude of ventilation (A value), and time of arrival (TOA), were calculated on the basis of the Kety model. RESULTS: In all animals, delayed and weaker xenon enhancement was identified at the airway and parenchyma distal to obstruction. For the A value, in the wash-in study, the differences between AW(PROX) and AW(DIST) and between P(PATE) and P(OBST) were significant (71.80 and 57.64, P = .05; 51.86 and 37.52 HU, P = .02). The K value of P(OBST) was lower than that of P(PATE) in the wash-in study (0.006 and 0 .010, P = .06). Mean and standard deviation for TOA were observed in the following increasing order: AW(PROX) ([3.50 +/- 7.70] x 10(-6) sec), P(PATE) (4.58 +/- 2.83), AW(DIST) (9.20 +/- 6.87), and P(OBST) (21.00 +/- 13.44). CONCLUSION: Collateral ventilation in a canine model with bronchial obstruction can be quantitatively assessed by using xenon-enhanced dynamic dual-energy CT.",M2
20498556,"Accuracy of peripheral quantitative computed <e>tomography</e> and magnetic resonance imaging in assessing cortical bone cross-sectional area: a cadaver study.OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing the cortical cross-sectional area (CCSA) at the level of the tibia. METHODS: Nine human whole-leg specimens were scanned with pQCT and MRI (T1-weighted and ultrashort echo-time [UTE] images) at 2 diaphyseal levels, 1 distal and the other 1 proximal. Subsequently, the bones were cut, and the CCSA was measured using digitized planimetry on the transverse sections. The correlation between CCSAs assessed via pQCT and MRI (T1 and UTE images) and assessed via planimetry, taken as a criterion standard, was evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation method. RESULTS: The mean (SD) CCSA with pQCT was 237.3 (54.3) mm2; T1-MRI, 228.8 (63.2) mm2; UTE-MRI, 178.5 (54.8) mm2; and planimetry, 250.17 (59.3) mm2. The CCSA measured with pQCT and T1-MRI was highly correlated with the planimetric CCSA (rho = 0.868 and rho = 0.880, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). The correlation involving UTE-MRI was somewhat weaker (rho = 0.664, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral quantitative computed tomography and MRI (T1-weighted images) are accurate for the assessment of the CCSA at the tibial shaft.",M2
20498551,"Comparison of computed <e>tomography</e> angiography with digital subtraction angiography in the assessment of clipped intracranial aneurysms.PURPOSE: To examine whether computed tomography angiography (CTA) is comparable to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in assessing clipped intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective collection of clipped aneurysms that had both CTA and DSA within 2 months of one another. Computed tomography angiograms were independently reviewed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists; rereviewed by one at least 4 months later. Each was classified as complete obliteration, neck remnant, or residual aneurysm. Parent vessel was classified as patent or occluded. Digital subtraction angiograms were reviewed in a similar manner by a third blinded neuroradiologist. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with 53 clipped aneurysms were collected. On DSA, 35 were completely obliterated, 10 neck remnants, and 8 residual aneurysms. The ability of CTA to detect residual aneurysms versus complete obliterations or neck remnants was excellent (mean sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 100%; positive predictive value [PPV], 100%; negative predictive value [NPV], 98%). The ability of CTA to detect neck remnants versus complete obliterations was poor (mean sensitivity, 20%; specificity, 99%; PPV, 83%; NPV, 81%). The CTAs were good at detecting parent vessel occlusion (mean sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 97%; PPV, 75%; NPV, 99%). Interrater and intrarater agreement was good to excellent for aneurysm and parent vessel assessment, with kappa values ranging from 0.6 to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography angiography has high sensitivity and specificity for residual aneurysm detection and parent vessel occlusion. It is not accurate in neck remnant detection, although these were small and of uncertain clinical significance. This suggests that CTA is useful for follow-up of clipped aneurysms. However, given the potential to miss neck remnants or small residual aneurysms, it is recommended to perform initial DSA and CTA to select cases in which CTA follow-up is appropriate.",M2
20498545,"Preoperative local staging of esophageal carcinoma using dual-phase contrast-enhanced imaging with multi-detector row computed <e>tomography</e>: value of the arterial phase images.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the accuracy of local extension (T-staging) of esophageal carcinoma could be improved with addition of arterial phase images by use of multi-detector row computed tomography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, and all the subjects provided informed consent. Dual-phase (the arterial and venous phases) contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed in 45 consecutive patients (39 men and 6 women; age range, 47-84 years) with 47 lesions of esophageal carcinoma who underwent surgical intervention. Two radiologists independently evaluated the T-staging of esophageal carcinoma on both phases. The T-staging on both the arterial and venous phase images was compared with the T-staging at histologic evaluation by means of a resected specimen (as the reference standard). Differences in the overall accuracy and sensitivity for the T-staging between the 2 phases were analyzed with the McNemar test. RESULTS: The analysis of the interobserver agreement for T-staging showed almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.85 on the arterial phase and kappa = 0.93 on the venous phase). The overall accuracy in the arterial phase was significantly better than that in the venous phase (68% vs 51%, P &lt; 0.01). The sensitivity values of the T-staging in the arterial phase were 0% in T1a, 71.4% in T1b, 12.5% in T2, 89.5% in T3, and 100% in T4. The sensitivity values in the venous phase were 0% in T1a, 14.3% in T1b, 0% in T2, 94.7% in T3, and 100% in T4. Statistical significance was apparent in the sensitivity of the T1b lesions. CONCLUSION: The arterial phase can improve the accuracy of T-staging of esophageal carcinomas, especially early-staged lesions.",M2
20498543,"Common variable immunodeficiency: computed <e>tomography</e> evaluation of bronchopulmonary changes including nodular lesions in 40 patients. Correlation with clinical and immunological data.BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, mainly sustained by encapsulated bacteria, that may cause irreversible changes in the lungs. METHODS: Forty patients with CVID were evaluated by computed tomography of the lung; 20 of these underwent computed tomographic follow-up in a 5-year period, during which immunoglobulin replacement therapy was regularly performed. RESULTS: Pulmonary changes were present in 65% of patients; bronchiectases were present in 65.38%. The incidence of pulmonary nodules was very high (38.46%) and correlated with splenomegaly (70%) and autoimmune phenomena (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the essential role of imaging, in particular computed tomography, in the identification and monitoring of pulmonary lesions in a large cohort of CVID patients, contributing at the same time to select patients more at risk to develop nodular lesions and potentially to use more appropriate therapeutic strategies.",M2
20498538,"Breath-hold 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy for intrahepatic lipid quantification at 3 Tesla.OBJECTIVE: To compare breath-hold 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) with respiratory-gated 1H-MRS and computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) for quantification of hepatic lipid content. METHODS: Twenty-three premenopausal women underwent breath-hold point-resolved single-voxel 1H-MRS of the liver followed by respiratory-gated 1H-MRS at 3 Tesla and CT slice through the liver. Interscan variability for 1H-MRS was assessed in 6 volunteers. Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman 95% limit of agreement, and concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between breath-hold and respiratory-gated 1H-MRS (r = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001; concordance correlation coefficient, 0.75). Using Bland-Altman analysis, all but 2 data points were within the limits of agreement. Both 1H-MRS techniques had low interscan variability. There was an inverse correlation of both 1H-MRS techniques with CT attenuation values of the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Breath-hold 1H-MRS is a reliable method to measure hepatic lipid content at 3 Tesla. Breath-hold 1H-MRS of the liver provides data that closely correlates with that obtained from longer-duration respiratory-gated technique.",M2
20498535,"Pattern and chronological change of iodized oil retention in radiofrequency ablation-induced vascular injury area: differentiation from iodized oil retention in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma on computed <e>tomography</e>.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pattern and the chronological change of iodized oil retention in a radiofrequency ablation (RFA)-induced vascular injury area as compared with that in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consents from all the patients and approval from the institutional review board were obtained. The computed tomographic scans of 226 patients who underwent both RFA and subsequent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for recurrence were retrospectively reviewed. The RFA-induced vascular injury area that did not have HCC recurrence in it were examined and assessed whether iodized oil was retained after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. We evaluated the incidence, the shape, and the duration of the iodized oil retention in the RFA-induced vascular injury area and compared them with those found in recurrent HCC from the same patient. The rate of misinterpretation was calculated. RESULTS: Of 59 RFA-induced vascular injury areas that were within the range of segmental embolization, 33 RFA-induced vascular injury areas (55.9%) in 31 patients retained iodized oil. The shapes of the iodized oil in the RFA-induced vascular injury area were diffuse-dense (n = 13), diffuse-faint (n = 8), nodular-dense (n = 8), or nodular-faint (n = 4). In 29 (93.5%) of 31 patients, at least one recurrent HCC retained iodized oil, and they were all nodular-dense in shape. The duration of the retention in RFA-induced vascular injury area (mean [SD], 3.3 [3.2] months) was significantly shorter than that in recurrent tumors (21.2 [12.5] months, P &lt; 0.001). In 21.2% (7/33) of the cases, the iodized oil density in the RFA-induced vascular injury area was clinically misinterpreted as recurrent HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The RFA-induced vascular injury area frequently retains iodized oil, which could mimic recurrent HCC. However, we determined that iodized oil in the RFA-induced vascular injury area differs from that in HCC in variety in shape and shorter duration of retention.",M2
20498534,"Acute ischemic cholecystitis after transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma: incidence and clinical outcome.PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and clinical outcome of acute ischemic cholecystitis after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this ethics board-approved study, a retrospective review of 355 TACE procedures performed in 246 patients during a 5-year period was performed. The review of postintervention computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) reports for findings indicative of acute cholecystitis identified 12 patients (4.9%). In these patients, all CT scans, laboratory results (white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase level, total bilirubin level), and clinical reports were analyzed to assess imaging findings and outcomes at the following time points: before TACE, within the first week after the procedure, as well as 1 and 6 months post-TACE. RESULTS: In 11 of 12 cases, the dominant finding on CT was new gallbladder wall thickening of up to 12 mm, which developed within 24 hours in 10 patients and within the first month after TACE in 1 patient. Gallbladder wall thickening persisted in 1 patient for at least 6 months. Eleven of 12 patients showed deposition of Lipiodol in the gallbladder wall. In 1 patient, the dominant finding on CT was pericholecystic stranding that resolved on follow-up CT after 1 month. None of the patients demonstrated gas in the gallbladder wall, significant pericholecystic fluid, abdominal or liver abscesses. Blood work results revealed transient increase in white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase level, and total bilirubin level, not different from that seen after TACE in patients without CT evidence of cholecystitis. Clinical reports documented transient right upper quadrant pain for a few days and up to 1 month in 1 case with eventual symptom relief. None of the cases required surgical or radiological intervention. All but 1 case demonstrated normal gallbladder wall thickness after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ischemic cholecystitis is not an uncommon complication after TACE. However, it is self-limiting and does not seem to require any intervention or surgery.",M2
20498533,"Multi-detector row computed tomographic appearance of celiac ganglia.OBJECTIVE: To assess the imaging features of celiac ganglia on multi-detector row computed <e>tomography</e> (MDCT). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 103 consecutive MDCT studies and recorded the frequency of visualization, location, morphologic feature, size, and enhancement pattern of the celiac ganglia. RESULTS: The left celiac ganglion was visualized more often than the right ganglion (89% vs 67%, P &lt; 0.0001). Both ganglia were identified at the level between the origins of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and anterior to the diaphragmatic crura. The ganglia were either multilobulated or discoid in shape. The mean long- and short-axis dimensions of the ganglia were larger on the left than right (left: 2.2 [0.4] and 0.4 [0.1] cm; right: 2.0 [0.4] and 0.3 [0.1] cm, respectively, P &lt; 0.005). The ganglia had the same CT attenuation as the adjacent adrenal glands on nonenhanced and portal venous-phase images in almost all cases and demonstrated higher attenuation than the adrenal glands in approximately two thirds of the cases on delayed scans. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac ganglia can be identified based on their characteristic locations and morphologic features on MDCT.",M2
20498532,"Deep infiltrating endometriosis: CT imaging evaluation.OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the feasibility of computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) in depicting deep-infiltrating endometriosis. MATERIALS: The study population included 54 patients (age: mean, 35.5 years; range, 23-48 years) with histologically confirmed ovarian endometriomas between January 2007 and July 2009. All the patients underwent preoperative CT imaging before laparotomy or laparoscopy. The CT images were evaluated for the presence of a tethered appearance of the rectum in the direction of the uterus, stranding of periuterine pelvic fat, thickening of the uterosacral ligament, and retroflexed uterus. Two radiologists performed a blinded and independent review for each CT finding. The sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and the accuracy of each CT finding and kappa statistics were determined. RESULTS: Deep-infiltrating endometriosis was confirmed after surgery and pathologic examination in 34 patients (63.0%). The most specific finding for the diagnosis of deep-infiltrating endometriosis was tethered appearance of rectum in the direction of the uterus (90.0%). The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy values of all the CT findings except that of retroflexed uterus were 56.9%, 70.0%, 78.1%, 60.4%, and 61.7%, respectively. The mean kappa value was 0.82 (range, 0.67-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomographic imaging may constitute another potential option as a complementary imaging modality for the evaluation of deep-infiltrating endometriosis.",M2

20495331,"[A patient with small intestinal cancer and extensive lymph node metastasis who responded to S-1]The patient was an 89-year-old male who consulted our hospital with a complaint of black stools. He had undergone gastrectomy and Roux-en Y reconstruction. Upper digestive tract endoscopy revealed a flat plate-like ulcer in the jejunum on the anal side of the gastrojejunostomy site. Biopsy findings suggested undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) showed cervical, mediastinal, and intraperitoneal lymph node swelling, suggesting metastasis. Extensive lymph node metastasis made curative resection impossible, and symptoms such as perforation/stenosis were absent. Therefore, surgery was not performed, and systemic hemotherapy with S-1 (80 mg/body/day) was administered. We repeated 2-week administration and 1-week discontinuation per course. After the end of the second course, upper digestive tract endoscopy revealed cicatrization of the ulcer, and CT showed a marked decrease in the lymph node size; a complete response (CR) was achieved. During the 7-month follow-up after the initial consultation (7 courses of S-1 therapy in all), there has been no exacerbation, and the quality of life (QOL) has been maintained.",M2

20494047,"Accuracy of 64-slice multidetector computed <e>tomography</e> for diseased coronary artery graft detection.BACKGROUND: Sixty-four-slice multidetector computed tomography (64-MDCT) has been shown to be a feasible modality for diagnosing coronary artery disease. We studied the accuracy of 64-MDCT in the detection of diseased grafts and also evaluated its limitations. METHODS: This study comprised 19 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and both invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and 64-MDCT. The 64-MDCT images were analyzed for bypass graft occlusion and significant stenosis (&gt;50%) of the anastomosis, and the results were compared with those of ICA. RESULTS: A total of 90 anastomoses, including 25 proximal anastomoses, were evaluated. Of 65 distal anastomoses, including 5 previously occluded grafts in redo cases, 12 distal anastomoses were identified by 64-MDCT as occluded. In comparison, only 10 grafts were identified as occluded by ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for patency were 100% (10 of 10), 96.5% (55 of 57), 83.3% (10 of 12), and 100% (55 of 55), respectively. The ICA patent grafts were evaluated with respect to stenosis. Invasive coronary angiography identified significant stenosis at only 1 site, whereas 64-MDCT showed significant stenosis at 6 sites. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for stenoses were 100% (1 of 1), 93.1% (67 of 72), 16.7% (1 of 6), and 100% (67 of 67), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although 64-MDCT demonstrated diagnostic accuracy in evaluating bypass grafts, limitations of this method include false positive results in cases of competitive flow between the graft and the native coronary artery.",M2
20493993,"Safe and effective minimally invasive approaches for small ground glass opacity.BACKGROUND: Popularized computed <e>tomography</e> physical check up results in an increasing number of patients with ground glass opacity (GCO) lesions of which management has not been established yet. METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2008, 738 patients underwent pulmonary resection for primary lung cancer, and 96 (13.0%) with resected GGO lesions were included in this study. Pure GGO lesions sized less than 10 mm are monitored until they grow bigger or develop a core. Three-port video-assisted thoracic lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection is indicated when the lesion diameter exceeds 15 mm or is invasive, and segmentectomy is indicated when the tumor diameter is 10 to 15 mm. Wedge resection is indicated when the tumor is peripherally located. RESULTS: There was no procedurally related mortality or morbidity. There were 9 papillary adenocarcinomas or invasive bronchioloalveolar carcinomas, 75 noninvasive bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas, 7 atypical adenomatous hyperplasias, and 5 organizing pneumonias. No local recurrence was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathologies are included in GGO lesions, and the video-assisted thoracic approach seems to be one of the best options in their management.",M2

Presented here is a review of the literature over the past 10 years and two new cases of unilateral bifid condyle. Computerized <e>tomography</e> is usually considered the test of choice for establishing the differential diagnosis, although in certain cases, its use seems questionable. The distinction between bifid condyle and condylar notch or cleft has been described in the literature, it is proposed a criteria for defining bifid condyle depending on the level of the two heads. It is suggested that further testing such as MRI or CT be carried out only in cases where the therapeutic approach involves an active treatment. It is proposed that bifid condyle is described as that which presents two condylar heads emerging from the neck of the condyle or further down.",M2

20488325,"Preliminary 3D computational analysis of the relationship between aortic displacement force and direction of endograft movement.OBJECTIVE: Endograft migration is usually described as a downward displacement of the endograft with respect to the renal arteries. However, change in endograft position is actually a complex process in three-dimensional (3D) space. Currently, there are no established techniques to define such positional changes over time. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the direction of aortic endograft movement as observed in follow-up computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) scans is related to the directional displacement force acting on the endograft. METHODS: We quantitated the 3D positional change over time of five abdominal endografts by determining the endograft centroid at baseline (postoperative scan) and on follow-up CT scans. The time interval between CT scans for the 5 patients ranged from 8 months to 8 years. We then used 3D image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to quantitate the pulsatile displacement force (in Newtons [N]) acting on the endografts in the postoperative configurations. Finally, we calculated a correlation metric between the direction of the displacement force vector and the endograft movement by computing the cosine of the angle of these two vectors. RESULTS: The average 3D movement of the endograft centroid was 18 mm (range, 9-29 mm) with greater movement in patients with longer follow-up times. In all cases, the movement of the endograft had significant components in all three spatial directions: Two of the endografts had the largest component of movement in the transverse direction, whereas three endografts had the largest component of movement in the axial direction. The magnitude and orientation of the endograft displacement force varied depending on aortic angulation and hemodynamic conditions. The average magnitude of displacement force for all endografts was 5.8 N (range, 3.7-9.5 N). The orientation of displacement force was in general perpendicular to the greatest curvature of the endograft. The average correlation metric, defined as the cosine of the angle between the displacement force and the endograft centroid movement, was 0.38 (range, 0.08-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Computational methods applied to patient-specific postoperative image data can be used to quantitate 3D displacement force and movement of endografts over time. It appears that endograft movement is related to the magnitude and direction of the displacement force acting on aortic endografts. These methods can be used to increase our understanding of clinical endograft migration.",M2
20486378,"[A review of diagnosis and causes of synovial cyst of the hip joint]OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and radiological characteristics of hip joint synovial cyst, and to study the main causes and the early economical effective ways for diagnosis. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with hip joint synovial cyst were studied in this research, including 16 males and 9 females aged from 14 to 76 with an average age of 52.8 years old (4 cases from clinical treatment from 1999 to 2007; 1 case searched with keyword  synovial cyst  and  hip  on CNKI form 1978 to 2002, 20 cases searched with keyword synovial cyst and hip on the Medline. The clinical manifestation of 25 cases were painless mass at medial of groin middle point and lower limb venous insufficiency. Synovial cysts of the hip joint were diagnosed by ultrasonography, computer <e>tomography</e> (CT) or nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI). All cases were analyzed retrospectively on the cause of a diseace, clinical features and radiological examinations. RESULTS: The possible causes of this disease included rheumatoid arthritis in 8 cases, osteoarthritis in 1, total hip replacement in 3, hip tramatic in 3, femoral head necrosis in 2 and unknown origin in 9. The main clinical features included painless groin mass in 9 cases; compression of the common femoral and external iliac veins (lead to outflow obstruction and leg swelling) in 7 cases; inguinal swelling in 5 cases; deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 3 cases; compression of artery in 1 case. The correct preoperative diagnosis were made by ultrasonography or combined with colour duplex Doppler ultrasonography (CDDS) in 13 cases; CDDS combined with CT in 8 cases; CDDS combined with CT and MRI in 2 cases; articular cavity visualization in 1 case; puncture herniography in 1 case. CONCLUSION: The hip joint synovial cyst is mainly caused by the chronic inflammation of the hip joint. As the disease is extremely rare and asymptomatically, precise diagnoses are difficult and and often delayed. More attentions should be paid because of its severe complications. CDDS is an economical effective way for early diagnosis.",M2
20486183,"Molecular diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome in a child with incomplete clinical disease phenotype.We report a 6-year-old female with congenital bone marrow failure, who was referred for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. An initial work-up in infancy had not revealed any consistent symptoms associated with an inherited syndrome. Computed <e>tomography</e> of her abdomen for gastrointestinal bleeding after transplantation incidentally revealed a fat-replaced pancreas and led to the molecular diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) in the absence of clinical exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. We conclude that SDS may escape the clinical consensus criteria for the disease. Increased awareness of unusual presentations may allow confirming the suspected diagnosis by molecular analysis and ensure optimal management.",M2
20485005,"Accuracy of routine nontargeted CT without colonography technique for the detection of large colorectal polyps and cancer.BACKGROUND: To assess the accuracy of routine contrast-enhanced computed <e>tomography</e> for the detection of large colorectal polyps and cancer. METHODS: The study group consisted of 100 patients who underwent abdominal computed tomography and optical colonoscopy evaluation before any treatment or intervention. Invasive colorectal carcinoma and large polyps (&gt;or=10mm) were found at colonoscopy in 29 and 16 patients, respectively. Computed tomography studies with oral and IV contrast were retrospectively reviewed as 5-mm thick sections in standard soft tissue windows by 3 readers. The readers scored each segment for polyp or cancer utilizing a 5-point scale for receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: By-patient sensitivity/specificity for cancer detection for each reader was 69.0%/88.7%, 65.5%/84.5%, and 82.8%/77.5%, respectively. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for cancer was 72.4%, 83.6%, and 80.3%, respectively. The empiric area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the readers ranged from 0.775 to 0.857. By-patient sensitivity for large polyps was poor with a pooled sensitivity of 14.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Standard computed tomography not tailored to colorectal investigation was moderately effective for detecting invasive cancers, but insensitive for large polyps. Unsuspected cancer should be a part of the standard search pattern for routine computed tomography interpretation, but more advanced colonography techniques are necessary for detecting large polyps.",M2
20484998,"Outpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis: rates and predictors of failure.PURPOSE: Many patients with acute diverticulitis can be managed as outpatients, but the success rate of this approach has not been thoroughly studied. We analyzed a large cohort of patients treated on an outpatient basis for an initial episode of acute diverticulitis to test our hypothesis that outpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis is highly effective. METHODS: We analyzed patients within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system (from 2006 to 2007) who were diagnosed with an initial episode of diverticulitis during an emergency room visit and subsequently discharged home. Each patient underwent a computed <e>tomography</e> (CT) scan for diagnosis or for confirmation of a diagnosis, and each radiologic report was evaluated regarding the presence of free fluid, phlegmon, perforation, and abscess. Treatment failure was defined as a return to the emergency room or an admission for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation. RESULTS: Our study included 693 patients, of whom 54% were women, the average age was 58.5 years, and 6% failed treatment. In multivariate analysis, women (odds ratio, 3.08 [95% CI, 1.31-7.28]) and patients with free fluid on CT scan (odds ratio, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.45-7.05]) were at significantly higher risk for treatment failure. Age, white blood cell count, Charlson score, and duration of antibiotics were not significant predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis, among a cohort of patients who were referred for outpatient treatment, we found that such treatment was effective for the vast majority (94%) of patients. Women and those with free fluid on CT scan appear to be at higher risk for treatment failure.",M2
20486985,"Use of multi-detector computed tomographic angiography in the diagnosis of a parapharyngeal aneurysm in a 6-week-old foal.Multidetector-row computed tomographic contrast angiography (MDCTA) is routinely employed to investigate vascular masses in human patients but, to date, the use of this technique to investigate an aneurysmal mass has not been reported in an equine case. The potential of MDCTA to investigate a right-sided parapharyngeal mass in a 6-week-old Thoroughbred foal was therefore investigated. A 4-slice helical computed <e>tomography</e> scanner was used on a superficial, firm, ovoid mass yielding arterial blood on fine needle aspiration. MDCTA enabled identification of the vessels involved thus assisting in forming a diagnosis based on the morphology of the lesion and aided surgical planning. Histology confirmed the presence of mural thrombus and calcification within the smooth muscle wall consistent with a true aneurysm. MDCTA provided additional information to conventional imaging in this case of vascular masses of the head and neck. The technique therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis and assist in the management of such lesions.",M2
20486529,"Advances in imaging of vertebral and spinal cord injury.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Imaging technology is an important part of the diagnosis and management of spinal trauma. Indications and findings in post-traumatic imaging of the vertebral column and spinal cord are reviewed. METHODS: An extensive literature review was performed on the imaging of vertebral and spinal cord injury. Relevant images from a Level I trauma center were included as examples. RESULTS: Imaging plays an important role in the evaluation of acute and chronic spinal injury. Spinal cord and soft-tissue injuries are best evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas spinal fractures are better characterized by computed <e>tomography</e> (CT). Vascular injuries can be evaluated using CT or MR angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging using CT and MRI is essential in the management of spinal cord injuries, both in the acute and in the chronic settings. MRI shows the status of ligamentous integrity and visualizes internal derangement of the spinal cord. Vascular compromise can be diagnosed by MR and CT angiography. Plain radiography now has a more limited, adjunctive role, and the need for higher risk myelography has been minimized.",M2
