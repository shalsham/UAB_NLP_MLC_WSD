20550073,"Developing a community-based stroke prevention intervention course in minority communities: the <e>DC</e> Angels Project.Despite advances in stroke treatment in the United States, stroke remains the third leading cause of death among Americans and the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. About 780,000 Americans will have a new or recurrent stroke this year. Each year, about 60,000 more women than men have a stroke. African Americans have almost twice the risk of first-ever strokes compared with Whites. Minority populations are less likely to know all stroke symptoms and far less likely to know all heart attack symptoms. There are many benefits of early treatment of stroke, yet most minorities do not get this treatment because they do not recognize the warning signs, risk factors, and prevention of stroke. The objective of this intervention course was to increase the students' knowledge and awareness of stroke, warning signs, risk factors, and prevention. Developing community-based stroke prevention intervention courses in minority communities is a good strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality and help to eliminate health disparities in minority communities.",M1
20508592,"Attitudes toward mental illness - 35 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2007.Negative attitudes about mental illness often underlie stigma, which can cause affected persons to deny symptoms; delay treatment; be excluded from employment, housing, or relationships; and interfere with recovery. Understanding attitudes toward mental illness at the state level could help target initiatives to reduce stigma, but state-level data are scant. To study such attitudes, CDC analyzed data from the District of Columbia (<e>DC</e>), Puerto Rico, and the 35 states participating in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (the most recent data available), which included two questions on attitudes toward mental illness. Most adults (88.6%) agreed with a statement that treatment can help persons with mental illness lead normal lives, but fewer (57.3%) agreed with a statement that people are generally caring and sympathetic to persons with mental illness. Responses to these questions differed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education level. Although most adults with mental health symptoms (77.6%) agreed that treatment can help persons with mental illness lead normal lives, fewer persons with symptoms (24.6%) believed that people are caring and sympathetic to persons with mental illness. This report provides the first state-specific estimates of these attitudes and provides a baseline for monitoring trends. Initiatives that can educate the public about how to support persons with mental illness and local programs and media support to decrease negative stereotypes of mental illness can reduce barriers for those seeking or receiving treatment for mental illness.",M1
20462260,"Scaling of economic benefits from green roof implementation in Washington, <e>DC</e>.Green roof technology is recognized for mitigating stormwater runoff and energy consumption. Methods to overcome the cost gap between green roofs and conventional roofs were recently quantified by incorporating air quality benefits. This study investigates the impact of scaling on these benefits at the city-wide scale using Washington, DC as a test bed because of the proposed targets in the 20-20-20 vision (20 million ft(2) by 2020) articulated by Casey Trees, a nonprofit organization. Building-specific stormwater benefits were analyzed assuming two proposed policy scenarios for stormwater fees ranging from 35 to 50% reduction for green roof implementation. Heat flux calculations were used to estimate building-specific energy savings for commercial buildings. To assess benefits at the city scale, stormwater infrastructure savings were based on operational savings and size reduction due to reduced stormwater volume generation. Scaled energy infrastructure benefits were calculated using two size reductions methods for air conditioners. Avoided carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide (NO(x)), and sulfur dioxide emissions were based on reductions in electricity and natural gas consumption. Lastly, experimental and fugacity-based estimates were used to quantify the NO(x) uptake by green roofs, which was translated to health benefits using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models. The results of the net present value (NPV) analysis showed that stormwater infrastructure benefits totaled $1.04 million (M), while fee-based stormwater benefits were $0.22-0.32 M/y. Energy savings were $0.87 M/y, while air conditioner resizing benefits were estimated at $0.02 to $0.04 M/y and avoided emissions benefits (based on current emission trading values) were $0.09 M-0.41 M/y. Over the lifetime of the green roof (40 years), the NPV is about 30-40% less than that of conventional roofs (not including green roof maintenance costs). These considerable benefits, in concert with current and emerging policy frameworks, may facilitate future adoption of this technology.",M1
20377112,"Pollen aeroallergens in the Washington, <e>DC</e>, metropolitan area: a 10-year volumetric survey (1998-2007).BACKGROUND: Local aeroallergen surveys identify and establish patterns of prevalence for tree, grass, and weed species that enable the clinician to more effectively select allergens for skin testing and therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine peak pollination periods, atmospheric concentrations, and year-to-year variation for identified tree, weed, and grass aeroallergens and examine the influence of selected meteorological parameters. METHODS: Atmospheric sampling for pollen aeroallergens was performed using a volumetric rotating-arm impaction sampler. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between daily counts and selected meteorological parameters. RESULTS: Previous findings for area trees, conducted at a different location, are corroborated. Predominant pollen types include Quercus, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Morus, Betulaceae, Acer, Platanus, Fraxinus, Poaceae, and Ambrosia. Early flowering weeds (Rumex and Typha) and Poaceae overlap with peak tree season in April. Biphasic seasons are noted for Poaceae and Ulmus. Tree pollen accounts for 91.2%, weeds 3.8%, and grasses 3.2% of total annual pollen yield. Variation in overall pollen production is evident from year to year. High production years for some species are low for others. Cyclic pollinating patterns for Alnus, Betulaceae, and Fagus were observed. Grass and weed pollen correlated positively with maximum temperature and dew point; however, the results for individual tree species were variable. CONCLUSION: The Washington, DC, metropolitan area is host to a variety of tree, weed, and grass species that produce copious amounts of pollen. Further investigation into year-to-year variation with respect to inherent cycling and meteorological influences is warranted.",M1
20236657,"High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among inner-city African American youth with asthma in Washington, <e>DC</e>.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency among urban African-American (AA) youth with asthma compared with control subjects without asthma. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at an urban pediatric medical center. Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency (&lt;30 ng/mL) and deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL) were assessed in urban self-reported AA patients, aged 6 to 20 years, with (n = 92) and without (n = 21) physician-diagnosed asthma. RESULTS: Blood samples were available for 85 (92%) cases. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were significantly greater among cases than control subjects (73/85 [86%] vs 4/21 [19%], adjusted odds ratio = 42 [95% confidence interval: 4.4 to 399] for insufficiency and 46/85 [54%] vs 1/21 [5%], adjusted odds ratio = 20 [95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 272] for deficiency). CONCLUSIONS: Most of this sample of urban AA youth with persistent asthma were vitamin D deficient or insufficient. Given the emerging associations between low vitamin D levels and asthma, strong consideration should be given to routine vitamin D testing in urban AA youth, particularly those with asthma.",M1

20184995,"Farmers' market use among African-American women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.This quasi-experimental pilot study explored farmers' market use among Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants and the effects of previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation on farmers' market use. African-American women who were pregnant and enrolling in WIC in Washington, <e>DC</e> (n=71), and Charlotte, NC (n=108), participated in the study. Surveys were completed in May and June 2007 measuring farmers' market use, barriers to farmers' market use, previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation, previous redemption of Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers, and dietary consumption. Women in Washington, DC, might have previously participated in the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, while women in Charlotte had no previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation. Analyses included descriptive, chi2 statistic, analysis of variance, and unadjusted and multiple logistic regression. Participants' average age was 24 years, average education was 12.2 years, and average daily fruit/vegetable consumption was 7.5 servings. Participants in Charlotte and Washington, DC, without previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation had similar farmers' market use rates (32.4% and 40%, respectively); those with previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation in Washington, DC, had higher farmers' market use rates (61%) (P=0.006). Previous participation in the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (odds ratio [OR]: 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57 to 6.93), previous redemption of Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers (OR: 4.96; CI: 2.15 to 11.45), and higher fruit/vegetable consumption (OR: 2.59; CI: 1.31 to 5.12) were associated with farmers' market use. Controlling for city, women who previously redeemed Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers were more likely to use a farmers' market (OR: 6.90; CI: 1.54 to 31.00). Commonly reported barriers were lack of farmers' markets close to home and lack of transportation to farmers' markets. Women who received and redeemed Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers were much more likely to purchase fruits/vegetables at farmers' markets. Future research to explore barriers and incentives for farmers' market use among WIC participants in urban and rural settings is warranted.",M1
20175687,"Natural history of colonization with gram-negative multidrug-resistant organisms among hospitalized patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the anatomic sites and natural history of colonization with gram-negative multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a 236-bed tertiary care center in Washington, <e>DC</e>. PATIENTS: Deployed subjects (ie, inpatients medically evacuated from Iraq or Afghanistan) or nondeployed subjects admitted to the same hospital. METHODS: Consenting patients had 6 anatomic sites cultured every 3 days for 2 weeks and then weekly. Gram-negative organisms resistant to 3 or more classes of antibiotics were considered MDROs. Isolates were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Clinical data, data on antibiotic use, and clinical culture results were collected. RESULTS: Of 60 deployed subjects, 14 (23%) were colonized with an MDRO at admission, and 13 (22%) had incident colonization during hospitalization. The groin was the most sensitive anatomic site for detecting MDRO colonization, and all but one subject remained colonized for the duration of their hospitalization. Sixty percent of subjects with incident Acinetobacter colonization and 25% of subjects with incident Klebsiella colonization had strains that were related to those isolated from other subjects. Of 60 nondeployed subjects, 5 (8%) were colonized with an MDRO at admission; all had recent healthcare contact, and 1 nondeployed subject had an isolate related to a strain recovered from a deployed subject. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization with gram-negative MDROs is common among patients with war-related trauma admitted to a military hospital and also occurs among nondeployed patients with recent healthcare contact. The groin is the most sensitive anatomic site for active surveillance, and spontaneous decolonization is rare.",M1
20159531," I feel your pain : a research study addressing perianesthesia health care providers' knowledge and attitudes toward pain.Patients' feedback about their perianesthesia experience at an acute care 609-bed teaching hospital in Washington, <e>DC</e>, indicated that pain management was an area in need of improvement. A nonexperimental descriptive study related to pain management was conducted in the perianesthesia areas to assess the knowledge and attitudes of health care providers. McCaffrey and Ferrell's 38-item self-report questionnaire was given to anesthesia providers, preoperative nurses, Phase I nurses, and Phase II nurses (N=138). Seventy-two participants responded, yielding a 52% response rate. Results showed a statistically significant difference between the scores of the anesthesia care providers and the preoperative area nurses and between the Phase I nurses and the preoperative nurses. No statistically significant differences were found between the anesthesia providers, and Phase I and Phase II nurses, indicating that at this hospital, nurses who provide postoperative care have similar knowledge and attitudes regarding pain as the anesthesia providers.",M1
20118386,"Obesity paradox and cardiorespiratory fitness in 12,417 male veterans aged 40 to 70 years.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness (fitness) on the obesity paradox in middle-aged men with known or suspected coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study consists of 12,417 men aged 40 to 70 years (44% African American) who were referred for exercise testing at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, <e>DC</e>, or Palo Alto, CA (between January 1, 1983, and June 30, 2007). Fitness was quantified as metabolic equivalents achieved during a maximal exercise test and was categorized for analysis as low, moderate, and high (defined as &lt;5, 5-10, and &gt;10 metabolic equivalents, respectively). Adiposity was defined by body mass index (BMI) according to standard clinical guidelines. Separate and combined associations of fitness and adiposity with all-cause mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards analyses. RESULTS: We recorded 2801 deaths during a mean+/-SD follow-up of 7.7+/-5.3 years. Multivariate hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality, with normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) used as the reference group, were 1.9 (1.5-2.3), 0.7 (0.7-0.8), 0.7 (0.6-0.7), and 1.0 (0.8-1.1) for BMIs of less than 18.5, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and 35.0 or more kg/m2, respectively. Compared with highly fit normal-weight men, underweight men with low fitness had the highest (4.5 [3.1-6.6]) and highly fit overweight men the lowest (0.4 [0.3-0.6]) mortality risk of any subgroup. Overweight and obese men with moderate fitness had mortality rates similar to those of the highly fit normal-weight reference group. CONCLUSION: Fitness altered the obesity paradox. Overweight and obese men had increased longevity only if they registered high fitness.",M1
20098984,"Surface water concentrations and loading budgets of pharmaceuticals and other domestic-use chemicals in an urban watershed (Washington, <e>DC</e>, USA).Pharmaceuticals and domestic-use chemicals (PDCs) are classes of emerging chemical contaminants thought to enter the aquatic environment primarily through wastewater treatment plant (WTP) discharges. The intent of this study was to quantify loadings of PDCs in an urban watershed. The watershed has two major branches but with wastewater discharge occurring in only one of the two major branches. Surface water from the Anacostia River (Washington, DC) was collected in base-flow and storm-flow regimes. Surface water was filtered to separate water and particles, and the PDCs were extracted from water with Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges and extracted from sediments using microwave-assisted extraction. The PDCs in the extracts were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the form of the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. The most frequently detected PDC with the highest concentration was bisphenol-A in both branches of the Anacostia River watershed and the least frequently detected PDC was diclofenac. The overall median concentrations for all measured PDCs in surface water ranged from nondetectable to 54.9 ng/l. Alternatively, in the collected WTPs samples, naproxen was observed, with the highest concentration and the median concentrations in WTP effluent ranging from nondetectable to 276 ng/l. Estimates of PDC loadings for February 2006 from WTP effluent showed that &lt;2% of the downstream load in the NE Branch was derived from WTP discharge. PDC sources other than WTP effluent appear to influence surface water concentrations in the urban Anacostia River watershed.",M1
20042311,"A computer simulation of employee vaccination to mitigate an influenza epidemic.BACKGROUND: Better understanding the possible effects of vaccinating employees is important and can help policymakers and businesses plan vaccine distribution and administration logistics, especially with the current H1N1 influenza vaccine in short supply. PURPOSE: This article aims to determine the effects of varying vaccine coverage, compliance, administration rates, prioritization, and timing among employees during an influenza pandemic. METHODS: As part of the H1N1 influenza planning efforts of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study network, an agent-based computer simulation model was developed for the Washington <e>DC</e> metropolitan region, encompassing five metropolitan statistical areas. Each simulation run involved introducing 100 infectious individuals to initiate a 1.3 reproductive-rate (R(0)) epidemic, consistent with H1N1 parameters to date. Another set of scenarios represented a R(0)=1.6 epidemic. RESULTS: An unmitigated epidemic resulted in substantial productivity losses (a mean of $112.6 million for a serologic 15% attack rate and $193.8 million for a serologic 25% attack rate), even with the relatively low estimated mortality impact of H1N1. Although vaccinating Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-defined priority groups resulted in the largest savings, vaccinating all remaining workers captured additional savings and, in fact, reduced healthcare workers' and critical infrastructure workers' chances of infection. Moreover, although employee vaccination compliance affected the epidemic, once 20% compliance was achieved, additional increases in compliance provided less incremental benefit. Even though a vast majority of the workplaces in the DC metropolitan region had fewer than 100 employees, focusing on vaccinating only those in larger firms (&gt; or =100 employees) was just as effective in mitigating the epidemic as trying to vaccinate employees in all workplaces. CONCLUSIONS: Timely vaccination of at least 20% of the large-company workforce can play an important role in epidemic mitigation.",M1
19933734,"Spatial accessibility to providers and vaccination compliance among children with medicaid.OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between spatial accessibility to pediatric immunization providers and vaccination compliance in a low-income, urban population of children. METHODS: In 2007, we accessed the Washington, <e>DC</e>, Immunization Information System (IIS) to collect data on the immunization statuses and residential addresses of children who were aged 19 to 35 months and had Medicaid insurance. In addition, we calculated each child's spatial accessibility to pediatric vaccination providers by assessing the provider-to-population ratio at each residential address. Spatial accessibility was divided into tertiles (low, medium, and high) of access. The relationship between spatial accessibility to providers and vaccination compliance was examined by using logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, type of vaccination provider, and enrollment in child care status. RESULTS: Overall for our cohort of 4195 children, 80.5% of the children were up-to-date with vaccinations. Vaccination coverage ranged from 61.6% to 100% (median: 79.2%) among different neighborhoods. Having the highest level of access to pediatric vaccination providers was associated with 36% higher odds of being up-to-date as compared with having the lowest level of access. The middle tertile of access was associated with 25% higher odds of being up-to-date. CONCLUSIONS: Within our low-income, urban population, children with higher spatial accessibility to pediatric vaccination providers were more likely to be up-to-date with vaccinations. This association may guide future studies and efforts to ensure adequate immunization coverage for children regardless of where they live.",M1
19932932,"How does violence exposure affect the psychological health and parenting of young African-American mothers?Urban, minority, adolescent mothers are particularly vulnerable to violence exposure, which may increase their children's developmental risk through maternal depression and negative parenting. The current study tests a conceptual model of the effects of community and contextual violence exposure on the mental health and parenting of young, African-American mothers living in Washington, <e>DC</e>. A path analysis revealed significant direct effects of witnessed and experienced violence on mothers' depressive symptoms and general aggression. Experiences of discrimination were also associated with increased depressive symptoms. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of mothers' violence exposure on disciplinary practices through depression and aggression. These findings highlight the range of violence young African-American mothers are exposed to and how these experiences affect their mental health, particularly depressive symptoms, and thus disciplinary practices.",M1
19914669,"Creation and piloting of a new hospital capacity assessment tool in a major urban area.OBJECTIVES: Crowded hospital emergency departments (EDs) can undermine the ability of a region's safety net to provide safe, timely care. However, data to measure hospital capacity community-wide is generally unavailable. This study aimed to assess hospital crowding, capacity and patient flow in an urban community using the newly developed hospital capacity assessment tool (HCAT). STUDY DESIGN: A survey of the eight acute care hospitals in the District of Columbia (<e>DC</e>) with active EDs. METHODS: Existing emergency care assessment tools were reviewed. Eighteen of the 57 questions on the HCAT were adapted from existing hospital surveys, while the remaining 39 questions were constructed de novo for use in this assessment. Hospitals were provided with paper and electronic versions of the HCAT. RESULTS: All eight DC hospitals completed the HCAT; however, three hospitals were unable to answer many of the questions due to a lack of regular data collection. The HCAT data shows throughput times in DC hospitals that are substantially longer than national averages. CONCLUSIONS: The HCAT is a promising tool for evaluating community-wide emergency care. Findings from the HCAT allowed for the introduction of new ED performance data into the local decision-making process.",M1
19839670,"Examining the impact of parental risk on family functioning among homeless and housed families.The present study used data from 132 families that were homeless and a comparison group of 434 housed families in order to compare family functioning across the two groups. Family functioning was assessed by family support workers when the families sought help from one of seven family service agencies in Washington, <e>DC</e>. Multiple regression models showed that there were few differences between homeless and housed families; a difference that did emerge showed that homeless families fared better than housed families in terms of children's developmental stimulation. However, when considering the compounding effects of additional family risk factors, adverse effects of homelessness were observed. As compared with housed families, homeless families with a history of parental mental illness had limited access to support networks and poorer interactions with their children. Poor financial and living conditions were observed among homeless families with histories of substance use. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.",M1
19805714,"Impact of individual values on adherence to emergency contraception practice guidelines among pediatric residents: implications for training.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of individual, system, and interpersonal factors on emergency contraception practices. We hypothesized that abortion attitudes and attitudes toward teen sex would be significant individual factors influencing emergency contraception practices. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, anonymous Internet survey. SETTING: Four pediatric residency programs in the Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, <e>DC</e>, metropolitan area during April to June 2007. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-one pediatric residents completed the survey. MAIN EXPOSURE: Abortion attitudes were assessed by participants' level of agreement with abortion in 7 scenarios. Attitudes toward teen sex were assessed by participants' level of agreement with 5 statements about the acceptability of teens having sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergency contraceptive counseling behavior was assessed by reported frequency of including emergency contraception in routine contraceptive counseling. Intention to prescribe emergency contraception was assessed by reported likelihood of prescribing in 5 scenarios. RESULTS: When controlling for demographics and other predictors, residents with less favorable abortion attitudes were more likely to have the lowest intention to prescribe emergency contraception. Residents with more positive attitudes toward teen sex and who had a preceptor encourage emergency contraception prescription were more likely to include emergency contraception in routine contraceptive counseling most/all the time and to have the highest intention to prescribe. CONCLUSION: Efforts to challenge and affect attitudes toward teen sex and to prompt residents to prescribe emergency contraception in clinical settings may be needed to encourage more proactive emergency contraceptive practice in accordance with national practice guidelines.",M1

19744693,"PCB dechlorination enhancement in Anacostia River sediment microcosms.In situ treatment of PCB contaminated sediments via microbial dechlorination is a promising alternative to dredging, which may be reserved for only the most contaminated areas. Reductive dechlorination of low levels of weathered PCB mixtures typical of urban environments may occur at slow rates. Here, we report that biostimulation and bioaugmentation enhanced dechlorination of low concentration (2.1 mg PCBs/kg dry weight) historical PCBs in microcosms prepared with Anacostia River, Washington, <e>DC</e>, sediment. Treatments included electron donors butyrate, lactate, propionate and acetate (1 mM each); alternate halogenated electron acceptors (haloprimers) tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB, 25 microM), pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB, 25 microM), or 2,3,4,5,6-PCB (PCB116, 2.0 microM); and/or bioaugmentation with a culture containing Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 (3 x 10(6)cells/mL). Dechlorination rates were enhanced in microcosms receiving bioaugmentation, PCNB and PCNB plus bioaugmentation, compared to other treatments. Microcosm subcultures generated after 415 days and spiked with PCB116 showed sustained capacity for dechlorination of PCB116 in PCNB, PCNB plus bioaugmentation, and TeCB treatments, relative to other treatments. Analysis of Chloroflexi 16S rRNA genes showed that TeCB and PCNB increased native Dehalococcoides spp. from the Pinellas subgroup; however this increase was correlated to enhanced dechlorination of low concentration weathered PCBs only in PCNB-amended microcosms. D. ethenogenes strain 195 was detected only in bioaugmented microcosms and decreased over 281 days. Bioaugmentation with D. ethenogenes strain 195 increased PCB dechlorination rates initially, but enhanced capacity for dechlorination of a model congener, PCB116, after 415 days occurred only in microcosms with enhanced native Dehalococcoides spp.",M1
19730381,"Effects of the 2002 sniper attacks on the homeless population in Washington, <e>DC</e>.OBJECTIVE: Despite the prevalence of homelessness, this population has rarely been included in disaster and terrorism planning. To better understand the mental health needs of the homeless during a terrorist event and to highlight the need to address methodological limitations in research in this area, we examined responses to the October 2002 Washington, DC, sniper attacks. METHODS: We interviewed 151 homeless individuals 1 year after the Washington, DC, sniper attacks. RESULTS: The majority (92.7%) was aware of the sniper events; 84.1% stayed informed through the media and 72.7% had someone to turn to for emotional support. Almost half (44%) reported identification with victims and 41% increased substance use during the attacks. More than half (61.7%) felt extremely frightened or terrified and 57.6% reported high perceived threat. Females, nonwhites, and participants with less than a high school education experienced greater threat. Women, nonwhites, and younger (&lt;43 years old) participants were more likely to have decreased more activities and 32.7% increased confidence in local law enforcement; however, 32.7% became less confident. CONCLUSIONS: During a terrorist attack the homeless population may be difficult to reach or reluctant to comply with public health programs. Addressing barriers to health care in vulnerable groups is critical to effective public health disaster response.",M1
19679498,"Depressive symptoms and birth outcomes among pregnant teenagers.STUDY OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined the effects of maternal depressive symptoms among adolescent women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of depressive symptoms on birth outcomes of infants born to adolescent mothers. DESIGN: The medical records of pregnant adolescent patients were examined. Information about maternal depressive symptoms and birth outcomes was collected. SETTING: Data were collected at Washington Hospital Center, a nonprofit, community-based hospital that serves residents throughout the Washington, <e>DC</e> area. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 294 African-American and Latina adolescent mothers. Mean age was 16.2 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.4). Based on self-reports of depressive symptoms, adolescents were categorized by the following: no reported symptoms, depressive symptoms without SI/SA (suicidal ideation or attempt), and depressive symptoms with SI/SA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery. RESULTS: Over one-quarter of pregnant adolescents in this study reported symptoms of depression. Adolescents reporting depressive symptoms with SI/SA delivered babies that weighed 239.5 grams (98.3% confidence interval [CI] 3.9 to 475.1) less than babies born to mothers reporting depressive symptoms without SI/SA. There was no association between reported symptoms and gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that compared to nonpregnant teens and adults, pregnant teens may have an increased risk for depression. Additionally, pregnant adolescents with suicidal ideation are at greater risk for delivering infants of lower birth weight compared with teens reporting depressive symptoms without SI/SA and teens reporting no symptoms. This study supports the need for early screening and treatment of depression for young pregnant women.",M1

The main theme of the meeting was  Factors that Influence Brain and Behavioral Development: Implications for Prevention and Intervention.  Two keynote speakers, Dr. Stephen Suomi and Dr. Carl Keen addressed how early environment and nutrition may influence outcome after prenatal alcohol exposure. The final keynote speaker, Kathy Mitchell, addressed issues regarding the relationship between scientists and the families with children with FASD. Members of the FASDSG provided updates on new findings through brief (FASt) data reports and national agency representatives provided updates of activities and funding priorities. Presentations were also made by recipients of the Student Research Merit award and Rosett award.",M1
19470720,"Laypersons' responses to the communication of uncertainty regarding cancer risk estimates.OBJECTIVE: To explore laypersons' responses to the communication of uncertainty associated with individualized cancer risk estimates and to identify reasons for individual differences in these responses. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted using focus groups. Participants were informed about a new colorectal cancer risk prediction model, and presented with hypothetical individualized risk estimates using presentation formats varying in expressed uncertainty (range v. point estimate). Semistructured interviews explored participants' responses to this information. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Eight focus groups were conducted with 48 adults aged 50 to 74 residing in 2 major US metropolitan areas, Chicago, IL and Washington, <e>DC</e>. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants with a high school or greater education, some familiarity with information technology, and no personal or immediate family history of cancer. RESULTS: Participants identified several sources of uncertainty regarding cancer risk estimates, including missing data, limitations in accuracy and source credibility, and conflicting information. In comparing presentation formats, most participants reported greater worry and perceived risk with the range than with the point estimate, consistent with the phenomenon of  ambiguity aversion.'' However, others reported the opposite effect or else indifference between formats. Reasons suggested by participants' responses included individual differences in optimism and motivations to reduce feelings of vulnerability and personal lack of control. Perceptions of source credibility and risk mutability emerged as potential mediating factors. CONCLUSIONS: Laypersons' responses to the communication of uncertainty regarding cancer risk estimates differ, and include both heightened and diminished risk perceptions. These differences may be attributable to personality, cognitive, and motivational factors.",M1
19465154,"No association between gastric fundic gland polyps and gastrointestinal neoplasia in a study of over 100,000 patients.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Fundic gland polyps (FGPs), the most common type of gastric polyps, have been associated with prolonged proton pump inhibitor therapy and an increased risk of colon cancer. The presence of FGPs has been inversely correlated with Helicobacter pylori infection. We evaluated the prevalence of H pylori-associated gastritis, colonic polyps, and carcinomas in subjects with and without FGPs. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from community-based endoscopy centers in 36 states (plus Washington <e>DC</e> and Puerto Rico) on patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy between April 2007 and March 2008. Of the 103,385 patients who underwent EGD during this time period, gastric biopsy samples were collected from 78,801 and colonic biopsies from 26,017. Slides of samples from Helicobacter-infected FGPs and FGPs with dysplasia were reviewed. RESULTS: FGPs were detected in 6081 patients (67.8% women). Helicobacter infection was present in less than 0.5% patients with FGPs and 13.0% of those without FGPs (odds ratio [OR], 29.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.4-41.4; P &lt; .0001). Colonic adenomas were detected in 42.3% of women with FGPs and 33.8% of those without (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.26-1.63; P &lt; .001); there was no significant difference in colonic adenomas between men with and without FGPs. CONCLUSIONS: Women had a higher prevalence of FGPs. FGPs were associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, gastric heterotopia, hyperplastic colonic polyps (only in men), and colonic adenomas (only in women, especially those over 60 years of age). The presence of FGPs was inversely correlated with H pylori infection, active gastritis, and gastric neoplasia.",M1
19444616,"Mixed method approaches to understanding cancer-related dietary risk reduction among public housing residents.Improving diet is one important pathway for addressing cancer disparities. We conducted mixed-method analyses of 468 24-h dietary recalls from 156 African-American women residents of Washington <e>DC</e> public housing to better understand dietary patterns. Recalls were rated for five cancer-related preventive characteristics (adequate fruits/vegetables, moderate fat, moderate calories, no alcohol, and adequate Healthy Eating Index score), combined as a scale. Bivariate and multivariate analyses identified psychosocial and dietary characteristics associated with scale scores. Qualitative analyses of dietary records identified contextual aspects of food patterns within and across score groups. Sixty-one percent of respondents met zero or one dietary goal; alcohol abstention was most common (64%). Only 12% achieve either three (6%), four (4%), or all five (&lt;1%) goals; five fruit and vegetable servings were least common (15%). The underlying scalar structure of responses suggests that fruit and vegetable consumption is seldom achieved in this population without other scale components. Poorer scores were associated with younger age, depressive symptoms, stressful life events, smoking, and food-purchasing practices. Qualitative analyses identified eight themes related to differences between dietary patterns. Findings reinforce the value of nonreductionist approaches to cancer-related nutrition intervention.",M1
19428072,"Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men screened for prostate cancer.OBJECTIVES: The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) is a widely used scale for the screening and diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED). Our objective was to incorporate the SHIM into our prostate cancer screening program to estimate the prevalence of ED among men screened for prostate cancer. METHODS: During September 2006, men younger than 75 years of age living in the Washington, <e>DC</e> area were invited to participate in the George Washington University Prostate Cancer Screening Program. The SHIM questionnaire was administered to all participants. Information regarding primary care physician use, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use, serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and digital rectal examination findings was also obtained. Those who registered SHIM scores of 17 or less or who were taking a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor were considered to have ED. RESULTS: Overall, 333 men attended the program. Of the 328 men, 123 (37.5%) met our definition of ED; 30 (9%) were using a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and 93 (28%) had an SHIM score of 17 or less. Univariate analysis suggested a significant difference in the prevalence of ED between African-American men and non-African-American men, with 25% and 41%, respectively, found to have a SHIM score of 17 or less (P &lt; .01); however, this difference was not significant once we controlled for age (P &gt; .05). Among our participants, 33% lacked a primary care physician. Of these, 22% had a SHIM score of 17 or less. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that ED increases in a nonlinear fashion with age, consistent with the findings of previous reports. Of greater concern, however, given the strong association between ED and cardiovascular disease, was the number of those with ED who lacked a primary care physician.",M1

The racist assumptions beneath this programme led most physicians at the institution to expect little more than deference, dependence and common labour from their black patients, preventing them from comprehending the impact of substandard and racially-segregated care. Black men and women were acutely aware of the injustices they faced. When they rejected elements of the hospital's medical regimen, these patients were also rejecting a social vision that consigned them to the margins of US civic life.",M1
19394738,"Time perspective and socioeconomic status: a link to socioeconomic disparities in health?Time perspective is a measure of the degree to which one's thinking is motivated by considerations of the future, present, or past. Time perspective has been proposed as a potential mediator of socioeconomic disparities in health because it has been associated with health behaviors and is presumed to vary with socioeconomic status. In this cross-sectional community-based survey of respondents recruited from hair salons and barber shops in a suburb of Washington <e>DC</e>, we examined the association between time perspective and both education level and occupation. We asked participants (N=525) to complete a questionnaire that included three subscales (future, present-fatalistic, and present-hedonistic) of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory. Participants with more formal education and those with professional occupations had higher scores on the future time perspective subscale, and lower scores on the present-fatalistic subscale, than participants with less formal education or a non-professional occupation. Present-fatalistic scores were also higher among participants whose parents had less formal education. Present-hedonistic scores were not associated with either education level or professional occupation. Time perspective scores were not independently associated with the likelihood of obesity, smoking, or exercise. In this community sample, future time perspective was associated with current socioeconomic status, and past-fatalistic time perspective was associated with both current and childhood socioeconomic status.",M1

A survey conducted at the first international symposium devoted to clinical magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound.OBJECTIVE: To see if clinicians' impressions were influenced by expert opinion on patient selection criteria that influence magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) leiomyoma treatment. DESIGN: Survey-based study. SETTING: First international symposium devoted to MRgFUS,  MRgFUS 2008,  October 6-7, 2008, Washington, <e>DC</e>. INTERVENTION(S): Questionnaires on fibroid treatment were distributed to attending practitioners before and after the symposium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Selection criteria, which could be considered to be limitations to focused ultrasound therapy, were assessed on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1, which indicated no impediment to therapy, to 10, which represented an absolute contraindication to therapy. RESULT(S): A total of 12 paired pre- and post-symposium questionnaires were analyzed. Mild adenomyosis, heavy bleeding, and bulk complaint were viewed as least likely to be an impediment to therapy both before and after the symposium. The presence of severe adenomyosis and five or more fibroids showed significant increases in mean rankings as contraindications to therapy following the symposium. Significant adverse events not previously reported were elicited by the survey. CONCLUSION(S): Expert opinion on patient selection criteria for MRgFUS is a useful resource for practitioner education.",M1

As an organization that exists to serve the homeless and impoverished of Washington, DC, So Others Might Eat (SOME) works diligently to address this disparity. SOME's clients are primarily African Americans who often face obstacles to HIV care because of low socioeconomic status, mistrust of the medical establishment, and fear of being identified as HIV positive. We relate the lessons we learned at SOME's medical clinic while trying to better address the needs of our clients living with HIV/AIDS. Chief among those lessons was the need to shift from considering our patients  noncompliant  with their HIV-related care to recognizing they had needs we were not addressing.",M1
19350944,"Elevated blood lead in young children due to lead-contaminated drinking water: Washington, <e>DC</e>, 2001-2004.Incidence of EBL (blood lead &gt; or =10 microg/dL) for children aged &lt; or = 1.3 years in Washington, DC increased more than 4 times comparing 2001-2003 when lead in water was high versus 2000 when lead in water was low. The incidence of EBL was highly correlated (R2 = 0.81) to 90th percentile lead in water lead levels (WLLs) from 2000 to 2007 for children aged &lt; or = 1.3 years. The risk of exposure to high water lead levels varied markedly in different neighborhoods of the city. For children aged &lt; or =30 months there were not strong correlations between WLLs and EBL, when analyzed for the city as a whole. However, the incidence of EBL increased 2.4 times in high-risk neighborhoods, increased 1.12 times in moderate-risk neighborhoods, and decreased in low-risk neighborhoods comparing 2003 to 2000. The incidence of EBL for children aged &lt; or =30 months also deviated from national trends in a manner that was highly correlated with 90th percentile lead in water levels from 2000 to 2007 (R2 = 0.83) in the high-risk neighborhoods.

Military personnel enrolled in the Army Substance Abuse Program at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, <e>DC</e>, received a comprehensive assessment that included a panel of direct and indirect biomarkers. A total of 80 records were reviewed to assess biomarker results. Higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores correlated with higher gamma glutamyltransferase levels. All subjects tested negative on the initial breathalyzer. All subjects completed an initial ethyl glucuronide and approximately one-third received a positive report. A second positive ethyl glucuronide did correlate with a positive third and fourth result. Military personnel deployed to an area of combat operations reported tobacco use more frequently than military personnel not assigned to an area of combat operations. A broad range of assessment tools, including traditional interviews, standardized questionnaires, indirect, and direct biomarkers, provide clinicians the techniques to screen alcohol use disorders.

19251881,"Marital status as contingency for the effects of neighborhood disorder on older adults' mental health.OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether the effects of neighborhood disorder on changes in levels of depression differ between the married and nonmarried, and whether these differences are because the married are less likely to experience a decrease in mastery due to neighborhood disorder. METHODS: Data are derived from a longitudinal study of adults aged 65 and older in the Washington, <e>DC</e>, metropolitan area over a 2-year period (2001-2003). RESULTS: Neighborhood disorder is positively related to change in depression and negatively related to change in mastery, but only for the nonmarried. Differences between the married and nonmarried in changes in mastery explain differences in effects of neighborhood disorder on change in depression. CONCLUSION: This research contributes to the study of aging and health by demonstrating that neighborhood conditions continue to affect mental health well into late life by shaping older adults' mastery, but a social connection to a marital partner helps mitigate these effects.",M1

19197672,"Creating a geospatial database of risks and resources to explore urban adolescent substance use.This article illustrates the methodology of creating a comprehensive geospatial database in order to systematically understand the social ecology of risk and protection for urban youth. The challenges and future opportunities involved with this complex work were reviewed, and specific examples were provided to guide researchers. Data were collected from a Washington, <e>DC</e> adolescent substance abuse treatment sample to construct a geospatial database to evaluate urban youths' social environmental risk and resources. A geographic information systems (GIS) approach was adopted to integrate a large array of variables at different levels of geography. For example, risk factors included proximity to crime hotspots, and other known potential establishments with negative influence (such as liquor stores). We also used GIS to assess the subjects' accessibility to protective resources such as public libraries, recreational, parks, and police stations. Unique to our method was the collecting and mapping of each teen's activity locations (places they typically frequent). These data form  risk and protection exposure  estimates for each teen. Finally, we illustrated the specific methods for creating a dynamic geospatial database for urban youth and present future analytical approaches and challenges with these type of data.",M1
19197599,"Self-management of injection-related wounds among injecting drug users.Injection-related wounds are an important complication of injection drug use. This study describes behaviors related to self-management of injection-related wounds and identifies factors associated with behaviors that may increase the potential for harm. We conducted interviews with 101 injecting drug users in Washington, <e>DC</e>. A total of 82 (81.2%) injecting drug users reported ever having an injection-related wound, and of these 93.9% reported self-management of their wounds. The most commonly reported behaviors were cleaning and applying ointment to wounds; however, several participants engaged in behaviors determined to be more potentially harmful, including acquiring antibiotics without prescriptions and manipulating their wounds. In multivariate analysis, injecting drug users who had ever injected amphetamines were more likely to engage in potentially harmful self-management behaviors (adjusted odds ratio = 4.38; 95% confidence interval = 1.15-16.64). Self-management of injection-related wounds is common and certain behaviors may increase the potential for harm. Further research is needed to best focus efforts to improve wound care for injecting drug users.",M1
19196898,"Exercise capacity and all-cause mortality in African American and Caucasian men with type 2 diabetes.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between exercise capacity and mortality in African Americans and Caucasians with type 2 diabetes and to explore racial differences regarding this relationship. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: African American (n = 1,703; aged 60 +/- 10 years) and Caucasian (n = 1,445; aged 62 +/- 10 years) men with type 2 diabetes completed a maximal exercise test between 1986 and 2007 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, <e>DC</e>, and Palo Alto, California. Three fitness categories were established (low-, moderate-, and high-fit) based on peak METs achieved. Subjects were followed for all-cause mortality for 7.3 +/- 4.7 years. RESULTS: The adjusted mortality risk was 23% higher in African Americans than in Caucasians (hazard ratio 1.23 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]). A graded reduction in mortality risk was noted with increased exercise capacity for both races. There was a significant interaction between race and METs (P &lt; 0.001) and among race and fitness categories (P &lt; 0.001). The association was stronger for Caucasians. Each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity yielded a 19% lower risk for Caucasians and 14% for African Americans (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the risk was 43% lower (0.57 [0.44-0.73]) for moderate-fit and 67% lower (0.33 [0.22-0.48]) for high-fit Caucasians. The comparable reductions in African Americans were 34% (0.66 [0.55-0.80]) and 46% (0.54 [0.39-0.73]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise capacity is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in African American and Caucasian men with type 2 diabetes. The exercise capacity-related reduction in mortality appears to be stronger and more graded for Caucasians than for African Americans.",M1
19187882,"Impact of a home-based primary care program in an urban Veterans Affairs medical center.OBJECTIVES: Describe how an interdisciplinary home-based primary care program (HBPC) affected hospital and emergency department (ED) use in an urban Veterans Affairs medical center. DESIGN: A retrospective review. SETTING: HBPC of the Washington, <e>DC</e>, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC-DC). PARTICIPANTS: All HBPC patients enrolled for at least 6 months during the period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline demographic variables (such as age, gender, race, living arrangement, community services used), major medical diagnoses, functional measures (MMSE, ADL, IADL, Braden), advance directives, episodes of ED, and hospital use for the 6-month period before and after HBPC enrollment from the VAMC-DC and discharge status (obtained from electronic medical records). RESULTS: A total of 183 patients were enrolled in HBPC for at least 6 months during the 24-month study period. Ninety-five percent were male with a mean age of 73.6 years (range 36 to 95). Most were African American (71%) and lived with a caregiver (65%). The average number of comorbidities was 6 per patient. At the end of the 2-year study period, 45% remained active in HBPC and 17% had died. Using paired score analysis t tests, patients enrolled in HBPC for 6 months had 43.7% fewer hospital admissions (P = .001) and spent 49.9% fewer days in the hospital (P = .001). The 18.5% reduction in ED visits was not statistically significant (P = .2632). CONCLUSIONS: Use of HBPC for 6 months for frail chronically ill patients in an urban VAMC may be associated with fewer hospital admissions resulting in reduced total hospital days, but no significant change in ED use.",M1
19183091,"Language use and the receipt of cancer screening recommendations by immigrant Chinese American women.BACKGROUND: Cancer screening rates are low among Chinese American women, a mostly immigrant minority population. This is possibly because they do not receive cancer screening recommendations from their physicians. The objective of this study was to determine if the rate at which physicians recommend cancer screening to older Chinese American women differs according to the language used during visits. METHODS: Data for the cross-sectional study were collected from a telephone survey of older Chinese American women residing in the Washington, <e>DC</e>, area. A total of 507 asymptomatic Chinese American women aged &gt; or =50 who had a regular physician participated in this study. The main outcome was women's self-reported perception of having received a recommendation from their physician for mammography, Pap tests, or colorectal cancer screening in the past 2 years. The main independent variable was the language used during visits (English vs. Chinese). Patient age, educational level, employment status, cultural views, physician specialty, physician gender, and length of relationship with the physician were included in the multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Chinese women who communicated with their physicians in English were 1.71 (95% CI 1.00-2.96) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.00-3.00) times more likely to report having received mammography and colorectal cancer screening recommendations, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Physicians in family medicine or general practice were 2.11 (95% CI 1.31-3.40) and 1.70 (95% CI 1.06-2.48) times more likely to recommend cancer screening than those in other specialties. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese American women who conversed with their physicians in Chinese were less likely to perceive receiving cancer screening recommendations. Future research is needed to identify physician-specific knowledge, attitude, and cultural barriers to recommending cancer screening.",M1
19171789,"Exercise capacity and mortality in hypertensive men with and without additional risk factors.We assessed the association between exercise capacity and mortality in hypertensive men with and without additional cardiovascular risk factors. A cohort of 4631 hypertensive veterans, who successfully completed a graded exercise test at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, <e>DC</e>, and Palo Alto, California, was followed for 7.7+/-5.4 years (35,629 person-years) for all-cause mortality. Fitness categories were established based on peak metabolic equivalent (MET) levels achieved. In each fitness category, we defined individuals with and without additional cardiovascular risk factors. Exercise capacity was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. The adjusted mortality risk was 13% lower for every 1-MET increase in exercise capacity. Compared with the very low fit (&lt; or =5.0 MET), the adjusted risk was 34% lower for those achieving 5.1 to 7.0 MET (low fit; hazard ratio: 0.66; CI: 0.58 to 0.76; P&lt;0.001), 59% lower for the moderate fit (7.1 to 10.0 MET; hazard ratio: 0.41; CI: 0.35 to 0.50; P&lt;0.001), and 71% lower for the high-fit category (&gt;10.0 MET; hazard ratio: 0.29; CI: 0.21 to 0.40; P&lt;0.001). Within the very-low-fit category, mortality risk was 47% higher for those with additional risk factors compared with individuals with no risk factors. This risk was eliminated for those in the next fitness category (5.1 to 7.0 MET) and was progressively reduced for the moderate and high-fit categories regardless of the presence or absence of additional risk factors. In conclusion, exercise capacity was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in hypertensive men. The increased risk imposed by low fitness and additional cardiovascular risk factors was eliminated by relatively small increases in exercise capacity and declined progressively with higher exercise capacity.",M1

19073528,"Early readmission of low-risk patients after coronary surgery.BACKGROUND: Early readmission after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an expensive adverse outcome. Although the perioperative experience of high-risk CABG patients has been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to low-risk CABG patients. The primary goal of this study was to identify the preoperative characteristics and to define risk predictors of readmission and preventive factors for readmission in low-risk isolated-CABG patients. METHODS: We identified 2157 patients who underwent CABG between January 2000 and December 2005 at Washington Hospital Center, Washington, <e>DC</e>, and defined as low risk patients who had a Parsonnet bedside risk score lower than the 25th percentile. Patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after surgery were compared with those who were not rehospitalized during this period. RESULTS: The overall readmission rate for this study cohort was 6.3%. Compared with non-readmitted patients, early-readmitted patients were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (27.94% versus 20.88%, P = .05) and less likely to have hypertension (42.65% versus 51.36%, P = .05). Blood product transfusion (P &lt; .01), postoperative length of intensive care unit stay (P = .01), and length of hospital stay (P = .05) were all significantly increased in the readmitted patients. The use of beta-blockers (P = .03) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = .04) was significantly lower at discharge in this group of patients; however, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated diabetes (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.42) to be the only independent predictor of early readmission. CONCLUSIONS: For low-risk CABG patients, diabetes mellitus is the risk predictor of early readmission. Early discharge was not associated with early readmission.",M1

18677547,"The occurrence of glyphosate, atrazine, and other pesticides in vernal pools and adjacent streams in Washington, <e>DC</e>, Maryland, Iowa, and Wyoming, 2005-2006.Vernal pools are sensitive environments that provide critical habitat for many species, including amphibians. These small water bodies are not always protected by pesticide label requirements for no-spray buffer zones, and the occurrence of pesticides in them is poorly documented. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of glyphosate, its primary degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid, and additional pesticides in vernal pools and adjacent flowing waters. Most sampling sites were chosen to be in areas where glyphosate was being used either in production agriculture or for nonindigenous plant control. The four site locations were in otherwise protected areas (e.g., in a National Park). When possible, water samples were collected both before and after glyphosate application in 2005 and 2006. Twenty-eight pesticides or pesticide degradation products were detected in the study, and as many as 11 were identified in individual samples. Atrazine was detected most frequently and concentrations exceeded the freshwater aquatic life standard of 1.8 micrograms per liter (microg/l) in samples from Rands Ditch and Browns Ditch in DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge. Glyphosate was measured at the highest concentration (328 microg/l) in a sample from Riley Spring Pond in Rock Creek National Park. This concentration exceeded the freshwater aquatic life standard for glyphosate of 65 microg/l. Aminomethylphosphonic acid, triclopyr, and nicosulfuron also were detected at concentrations greater than 3.0 microg/l.",M1
18677546,"Using the Sediment Quality Triad to characterize baseline conditions in the Anacostia River, Washington, <e>DC</e>, USA.The Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) consists of complementary measures of sediment chemistry, benthic community structure, and sediment toxicity. We applied the SQT at 20 stations in the tidal portion of the Anacostia River from Bladensburg, MD to Washington, DC to establish a baseline of conditions to evaluate the effects of management actions. Sediment toxicity was assessed using 10-day survival and growth tests with the freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca and the midge, Chironomus dilutus. Triplicate grabs were taken at each station for benthic community analysis and the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was used to interpret the data. Only one station, #92, exhibited toxicity related to sediment contamination. Sediments from this station significantly inhibited growth of both test species, had the highest concentrations of contaminants, and had a degraded benthic community, indicated by a B-IBI of less than 3. Additional sediment from this station was tested and sediment toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) procedures tentatively characterized organic compounds as the cause of toxicity. Overall, forty percent of the stations were classified as degraded by the B-IBI. However, qualitative and quantitative comparisons with sediment quality benchmarks indicated no clear relationship between benthic community health and contaminant concentrations. This study provides a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of management actions in the Anacostia River.",M1

18585639,"Proceedings of the AMDA Assisted Living Consensus Conference, Washington, <e>DC</e> October 24, 2006.OBJECTIVES: Assisted living (AL) residents are older and frailer than the patient population industry first envisioned they would be. As a result, these individuals require stronger medical care by the industry. It is believed that there is inadequate clinical guidance, systems, and protocols for these clinically complex residents. The AMDA-led Assisted Living Consensus Conference was organized to discuss the scope of this problem and conclude with steps to address those problems. PARTICIPANTS: This article is an edited review of the presentations and discussions held by the attendees, consisting of medical experts and assisted living representatives including consumer advocate groups, together with physicians, practitioners, and nurses caring for frail elders within the long-term care continuum. This conference was held in Washington, DC, on October 26, 2006. RECOMMENDATIONS: There are a growing number of AL residents who are frail and have multiple chronic conditions. Effective ways to address these issues and protect the safety and quality of life for these individuals are needed. While AL has moved from a hospitality model to a model that includes significant medical components, there is a need to further flesh out and standardize these components in AL. Identification of specific projects in each area were discussed at the conference, such as the development of standard assessment tools and clinical protocols to improve the clinical care residents receive in this setting. VALIDATION: All of the prevalidating opinions were summarized and are included in this article.",M1

18569148,"Medicaid patient asthma-related acute care visits and their associations with ozone and particulates in Washington, <e>DC</e>, from 1994-2005.The primary objective of this ecologic and contextual study is to determine statistically significant short-term associations between air quality (daily ozone and particulate concentrations) and Medicaid patient general acute care daily visits for asthma exacerbations over 11 years for Washington, DC residents, and to identify regions and populations that may experience increased asthma exacerbations related to air quality. After removing long-term trends and day-of-week effects in the Medicaid data, Poisson regression was applied to daily time series data. Significant associations were found between asthma-related general acute care visits and ozone concentrations. Significant associations with both ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were observed for 5- to 12-year-olds. While poor air quality was closely associated with asthma exacerbations observed in acute care visits in areas where Medicaid enrollment was high, the strongest associations between asthma-related visits and air quality were not always for the areas with the highest Medicaid enrollment.",M1
18551099,"Electronic record linkage to identify deaths among persons with AIDS--District of Columbia, 2000-2005.An estimated 1 million persons in the United States are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); approximately 500,000 persons with AIDS have died since 1981. In 2005, the District of Columbia (<e>DC</e>) had an estimated adult AIDS prevalence rate of 2%, one of the highest AIDS prevalence rates in the United States. Accurate death ascertainment is an important part of HIV/AIDS surveillance. Manual methods can substantially underestimate deaths by missing death certificates that do not mention HIV infection or deaths of residents that occur in other states. CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) recommend performing electronic record linkages to ascertain deaths annually as part of routine HIV/AIDS surveillance activities. In 2007, to identify all deaths that occurred during 2000-2005 among persons with AIDS who resided or received their diagnosis in DC, the HIV/AIDS Administration of the DC Department of Health, with assistance from CDC, performed an electronic record linkage. This report summarizes the results of that linkage, which determined that 54% of deaths among persons with AIDS had not been reported previously to the DC HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). The results indicated that electronic record linkage for death ascertainment is necessary to more accurately estimate the prevalence of persons living with HIV/AIDS.",M1
18506573,"Recruiting Latino women in the U.S. and women in Mexico in postpartum depression prevention research.The negative consequences of untreated depression on the health and well-being of women and their children are well-documented, underscoring the need to develop effective interventions to prevent the onset of major depression during the perinatal period. This article describes recruitment data from two randomized controlled trials of preventive interventions for postpartum depression: one conducted with immigrant Latinas in Washington, <e>DC</e>, United States, and the other with women in Mexico City, Mexico. In both countries, pregnant women met a priori eligibility criteria and were randomized into an 8-week theory-based group intervention. Two hundred and seventeen Latinas in the U.S. and 377 women born and raised in Mexico were enrolled in their respective countries. The recruitment rates (i.e., the number of participants who met eligibility criteria, consented, and randomized into the study) were 70% in the U.S. and in Mexico.

Associations among injuries, PTSD, and postconcussive symptoms were explored. In February 2005, a postal survey was sent to Iraq/Afghanistan veterans who had left combat theaters by September 2004 and lived in Maryland; Washington, <e>DC</e>; northern Virginia; and eastern West Virginia. Immediate neurologic symptoms postinjury were used to identify mild TBI. Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed by using Poisson regression. About 12% of 2,235 respondents reported a history consistent with mild TBI, and 11% screened positive for PTSD. Mild TBI history was common among veterans injured by bullets/shrapnel, blasts, motor vehicle crashes, air/water transport, and falls. Factors associated with PTSD included reporting multiple injury mechanisms (prevalence ratio = 3.71 for three or more mechanisms, 95% confidence interval: 2.23, 6.19) and combat mild TBI (prevalence ratio = 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.72, 3.28). The strongest factor associated with postconcussive symptoms was PTSD, even after overlapping symptoms were removed from the PTSD score (prevalence ratio = 3.79, 95% confidence interval: 2.57, 5.59).",M1
18393063,"Polychlorinated biphenyls in stormwater runoff entering the tidal Anacostia River, Washington, <e>DC</e>, through small urban catchments and combined sewer outfalls.To investigate the loadings, solid-water partitioning, transport dynamics, and sources of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in urban stormwater runoff entering into the lower tidal Anacostia River, which flows south of Washington, DC, USA, storm and base flow samples were collected in six branches. Stormwater runoff contained elevated levels of PCBs (9.82 to 211 ng/L) higher than base flow by up to 80-fold. The present study suggests that input of PCBs from Lower Beaverdam Creek is likely to be greater than those from the two major branches (Northeast and Northwest Branches) that were believed as primary source areas. PCBs in storm flow were significantly enriched in the particle phase, which accounted for more than 90% of the total PCBs. Particles were the primary vector transporting PCBs into the Anacostia River, suggesting that removal of particles in stormwater runoff using best management practices (BMPs) such as post treatment system likely decrease PCBs significantly. PCB congener patterns found in stormwater samples clearly explain stormwater runoff is a major transport pathway adding substantial amount of PCBs to the tidal Anacostia River.",M1
18374244,"Fear of walking outdoors. A multilevel ecologic analysis of crime and disorder.BACKGROUND: Although a number of studies have tested ecologic models that postulate relationships among social networks, the built environment, and active living, few neighborhood-based studies have considered the role of crime and violence. This study investigates the degree to which individual-level demographic characteristics and neighborhood-level physical and social characteristics are associated with increased fear of crime. METHODS: Data were analyzed in 2007 from a 2005 survey of 901 randomly selected individuals living in 55 neighborhoods in Washington <e>DC</e>. Multilevel ordered logit regression was used to examine associations between individual-level and neighborhood-level characteristics and how often fear of crime prevents a respondent from walking outdoors. RESULTS: Age and female gender were associated with an increase in fear; the percentage of a resident's life spent in the same neighborhood was associated with a decrease in fear. Results of cross-level interactions showed that at the neighborhood level, women were more fearful than men in neighborhoods without violence, but that the difference in fear between men and women shrinks as neighborhood violence increases. Collective efficacy was found to increase fear among black respondents and had no effect on fear among nonblack respondents. CONCLUSIONS: If the study of neighborhoods and active living is to progress and contribute to both etiologic understanding and policy formation, it is essential that theoretical and empirical models consider the impact of violence and fear on walking. Efforts to increase active living in urban neighborhoods that do not account for the impact of crime and fear may fall short of their intended outcomes.",M1

We hypothesized that calculated FT values could substitute for measured values; compared FT results reported by Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, <e>DC</e>, with results reported by the Seattle Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Seattle, WA, for 3 patient groups; and evaluated the calculated FT values by gold-standard measurements. Groups 1 and 2 included samples from 54 patients evaluated in Seattle and 94 evaluated at a primary care clinic in Alaska whose samples were analyzed in Seattle, respectively, whose care resulted in ordering an FT measurement. Group 3 included samples from 64 patients evaluated in endocrine WRAMC clinics. Calculated FT values between the 2 facilities demonstrated a strong correlation (R2 = 0.98) for all 212 patients. In a comparison of calculated FT values with measured levels, group 3 had an R2 = 0.93; however, samples with FT values less than 50 pg/mL had a poorer correlation (R2 = 0.45). Calculated FT values may accurately reflect and be substituted in the clinical setting for gold-standard values when levels are more than 50 pg/mL.",M1

17965627,"Epigenetics and Neural developmental disorders: Washington <e>DC</e>, September 18 and 19, 2006.Neural developmental disorders, such as autism, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome manifest during early postnatal neural development. Although the genes responsible for some of these disorders have been identified, how the mutations of these genes affect neural development is currently unclear. Emerging evidence suggest that these disorders share common underlying defects in neuronal morphology, synaptic connectivity and brain plasticity. In particular, alterations in dendritic branching and spine morphology play a central role in the pathophysiology of most mental retardation disorders, suggesting that common pathways regulating neuronal function may be affected. Epigenetic modulations, mediated by DNA methylation, RNA-associated silencing, and histone modification, can serve as an intermediate process that imprints dynamic environmental experiences on the  fixed  genome, resulting in stable alterations in phenotypes. Disturbance in epigenetic regulations can lead to inappropriate expression or silencing of genes, causing an array of multi-system disorders and neoplasias. Rett syndrome, the most common form of mental retardation in young girls, is due to l mutation of MECP2, encoding a methylated DNA binding protein that translates DNA methylation into gene repression. Angelman syndrome is due to faulty genomic imprinting or maternal mutations in UBE3A. Fragile X Syndrome, in most cases, results from the hypermethylation of FMR1 promoter, hence the loss of expression of functional FMRP protein. Autism, with its complex etiology, may have strong epigenetic link. Together, these observations strongly suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play a critical role in brain development and etiology of related disorders. This report summarizes the scientific discussions and major conclusions from a recent conference that aimed to gain insight into the common molecular pathways affected among these disorders and discover potential therapeutic targets that have been missed by looking at one disorder at a time.",M1
17822526,"Recruitment and retention of low-income minority women in a behavioral intervention to reduce smoking, depression, and intimate partner violence during pregnancy.BACKGROUND: Researchers have frequently encountered difficulties in the recruitment and retention of minorities resulting in their under-representation in clinical trials. This report describes the successful strategies of recruitment and retention of African Americans and Latinos in a randomized clinical trial to reduce smoking, depression and intimate partner violence during pregnancy. Socio-demographic characteristics and risk profiles of retained vs. non-retained women and lost to follow-up vs. dropped-out women are presented. In addition, subgroups of pregnant women who are less (more) likely to be retained are identified. METHODS: Pregnant African American women and Latinas who were Washington, <e>DC</e> residents, aged 18 years or more, and of 28 weeks gestational age or less were recruited at six prenatal care clinics. Potentially eligible women were screened for socio-demographic eligibility and the presence of the selected behavioral and psychological risks using an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview. Eligible women who consented to participate completed a baseline telephone evaluation after which they were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the intervention or the usual care group. RESULTS: Of the 1,398 eligible women, 1,191 (85%) agreed to participate in the study. Of the 1,191 women agreeing to participate, 1,070 completed the baseline evaluation and were enrolled in the study and randomized, for a recruitment rate of 90%. Of those enrolled, 1,044 were African American women. A total of 849 women completed the study, for a retention rate of 79%. Five percent dropped out and 12% were lost-to-follow up. Women retained in the study and those not retained were not statistically different with regard to socio-demographic characteristics and the targeted risks. Retention strategies included financial and other incentives, regular updates of contact information which was tracked and monitored by a computerized data management system available to all project staff, and attention to cultural competence with implementation of study procedures by appropriately selected, trained, and supervised staff. Single, less educated, alcohol and drug users, non-working, and non-WIC women represent minority women with expected low retention rates. CONCLUSION: We conclude that with targeted recruitment and retention strategies, minority women will participate at high rates in behavioral clinical trials. We also found that women who drop out are different from women who are lost to follow-up, and require different strategies to optimize their completion of the study.",M1

17682242,"The influence of culture and cancer worry on colon cancer screening among older Chinese-American women.OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the hypothesis that adherence to colon cancer screening guidelines among Chinese women was associated with Eastern cultural views and anxiety about developing colon cancer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from a community-based longitudinal study were used to examine the hypothesis of this study. Measures of sociodemographics, medical access factors, cultural views of health care, cancer worry, and practices of colon cancer screening were administered by a computer assisted telephone interview. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and thirty-three Chinese-American women from Metropolitan Washington, <e>DC</e> age 50 years and older and without a history of colon cancer completed the telephone interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adherence to utilization of either fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within a year, sigmoidoscopy within five years, or colonoscopy within 10 years was used to define two outcome categories: current screeners and noncurrent screeners. RESULTS: Controlling for covariates, this study found that: 1) women with more Eastern cultural views were less likely to be current screeners; 2) women who thought about the chance of getting colon cancer had approximately three-fold greater odds of being current screeners than women who never thought about colon cancer; and 3) women receiving physician recommendation for colon cancer screening had more than three-fold increased odds of being current screeners than those who had not received a recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the lack of physician recommendation, older Chinese women face cultural and psychological barriers to obtaining timely colon cancer screening. These barriers may be reduced through culturally sensitive intervention studies.",M1

We sought to identify affordable employment benefit packages that might ameliorate these socioeconomic factors and would be consonant with employees' priorities. METHODS: Working in groups (n = 53), low-income employees (n = 408; 62% women, 65% Black) from the Washington, <e>DC</e>, and Baltimore, Md, metropolitan area, participated in a computerized exercise in which they expressed their preference for employment benefit packages intended to address socioeconomic determinants of health. The hypothetical costs of these benefits reflected those of the average US benefit package available to low-income employees. Questionnaires ascertained sociodemographic information and attitudes. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to examine benefit choices. RESULTS: Groups chose offered benefits in the following descending rank order: health care, retirement, vacation, disability pay, training, job flexibility, family time, dependent care, monetary advice, anxiety assistance, wellness, housing assistance, and nutrition programs. Participants varied in their personal choices, but 78% expressed willingness to abide by their groups' choices.

The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of physical injuries due to maltreatment among adolescents aged 10-19 years. Subjects came from seven hospitals/trauma centres in Washington <e>DC</e> that were involved in the Washington DC Initiative to Reduce Infant Mortality and Prevention of Childhood Injuries Study. From 1996-1998, information was gathered about all injuries to adolescents aged 10-19 years that resulted in a visit to a participating emergency department. This paper focuses on the subset 178 adolescents aged 10-19 years who presented with physical injuries due to maltreatment. It was found that 55% of victims of abuse were female. Abuse victims were more likely to be female than those with unintentional injury. The most common injuries were contusions to the extremities (29%). Mothers were the most common perpetrators (48%). A total of 64% of victims were assaulted with an object/weapon and the most common object used was a belt. There are some similarities and some important differences between patterns of maltreatment in adolescents vs. younger children. Increased awareness of maltreatment among older children is a critical step in increasing and improving screening and prevention practices among health-care professionals.",M1
17583272,"The life-course origins of mastery among older people.In this article, we aim to identify the sources of mastery--the understanding that individuals hold about their ability to control the circumstances of their lives. The sample for our inquiry was drawn from the Medicare beneficiary files of people 65 and older living in Washington, <e>DC</e>, and two adjoining Maryland counties. We find that past circumstances, particularly those reflecting status attainment and early exposure to intractable hardships, converge with stressors experienced in late life to influence elders' level of mastery. The impact of past conditions, however, does not necessarily directly affect the current mastery of older people. Instead, the effect of prior experiences on current mastery is mediated by what we refer to as life-course mastery: one's belief that one has directed and managed the trajectories that connect one's past to the present. Our analyses show that life-course mastery largely serves as the mediating channel through which individuals connect their past to their present.",M1
17562105,"Conceptual models as hypotheses in monitoring urban landscapes.Many problems and challenges of ecosystem management currently are driven by the rapid pace and spatial extent of landscape change. Parks and reserves within areas of high human population density are especially challenged to meet the recreational needs of local populations and to preserve valued environmental resources. The complex problem of managing multiple objectives and multiple resources requires an enormous quantity of information, and conceptual models have been proposed as tools for organizing and interpreting this information. Academics generally prefer a bottom-up approach to model construction that emphasizes ecologic theory and process, whereas managers often use a top-down approach that takes advantage of existing information to address more pragmatic objectives. The authors propose a formal process for developing, applying, and testing conceptual models to be used in landscape monitoring that reconciles these seemingly opposing perspectives. The four-step process embraces the role of hypothesis testing in the development of models and evaluation of their utility. An example application of the process to a network of national parks in and around Washington, <e>DC</e> illustrates the ability of the approach to systematically identify monitoring data that would both advance ecologic theory and inform management decisions.",M1
17520055,"Elevated lead in drinking water in Washington, <e>DC</e>, 2003-2004: the public health response.BACKGROUND: In 2003, residents of the District of Columbia (DC) experienced an abrupt rise in lead levels in drinking water, which followed a change in water-disinfection treatment in 2001 and which was attributed to consequent changes in water chemistry and corrosivity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the public health implications of the exceedance, the DC Department of Health expanded the scope of its monitoring programs for blood lead levels in children. METHODS: From 3 February 2004 to 31 July 2004, 6,834 DC residents were screened to determine their blood lead levels. RESULTS: Children from 6 months to 6 years of age constituted 2,342 of those tested; 65 had blood lead levels &gt; 10 microg/dL (the  level of concern  defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the highest with a level of 68 microg/dL. Investigation of their homes identified environmental sources of lead exposure other than tap water as the source, when the source was identified. Most of the children with elevated blood lead levels (n = 46; 70.8%) lived in homes without lead drinking-water service lines, which is the principal source of lead in drinking water in older cities. Although residents of houses with lead service lines had higher blood lead levels on average than those in houses that did not, this relationship is confounded. Older houses that retain lead service lines usually have not been rehabilitated and are more likely to be associated with other sources of exposure, particularly lead paint. None of 96 pregnant women tested showed blood lead levels &gt; 10 microg/dL, but two nursing mothers had blood lead levels &gt; 10 microg/dL. Among two data sets of 107 and 71 children for whom paired blood and water lead levels could be obtained, there was no correlation (r(2) = -0.03142 for the 107). CONCLUSIONS: The expanded screening program developed in response to increased lead levels in water uncovered the true dimensions of a continuing problem with sources of lead in homes, specifically lead paint. This study cannot be used to correlate lead in drinking water with blood lead levels directly because it is based on an ecologic rather than individualized exposure assessment; the protocol for measuring lead was based on regulatory requirements rather than estimating individual intake; numerous interventions were introduced to mitigate the effect; exposure from drinking water is confounded with other sources of lead in older houses; and the period of potential exposure was limited and variable.",M1
17497524,"Longer-term effects of Washington, <e>DC</e>, law on drivers' hand-held cell phone use.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the substantial short-term declines in drivers' use of hand-held phones achieved in the District of Columbia (DC) were sustained 1 year after a ban. METHODS: Drivers' daytime hand-held cell phone use was observed in DC and nearby areas of Virginia and Maryland, states without bans. Observations were conducted several months before the ban, shortly after, and 1 year later. The number of vehicles observed in all three surveys combined was 51,945 in DC, 36,796 in Maryland, and 43,033 in Virginia. RESULTS: The rate of talking on hand-held phones declined significantly from 6.1 percent before the law to 3.5 percent shortly after; when measured 1 year later, use was 4.0 percent, still significantly lower than baseline. Based on increases in rates of talking on hand-held phones in Maryland and Virginia, longer-term phone use in DC was estimated to be 53 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. Declines in DC were identified for drivers of vehicles registered in all three jurisdictions. CONCLUSIONS: In DC, there was an initial decline of about 50 percent in drivers talking on hand-held cell phones following a ban, and this decline was sustained about 1 year later. After a similar ban in New York, there was an initial decline in phone use comparable with the initial decline in DC, but the decline a year after the New York ban took full effect was only about 21 percent and not statistically significant. The potential difference in sustained effectiveness for the DC ban may reflect tougher enforcement in DC. Even if full compliance with hand-held phone bans can be achieved, the risks from drivers' use of hands-free phones will remain.",M1
17439537,"Low-income minority mothers' reports of infant health care utilisation compared with medical records.This study aimed to investigate mothers' reporting of the nature, location, frequency and content of health care visits for their infants, as compared with data abstracted from the infants' medical records. It was part of a community-based parenting intervention designed to improve preventive health care utilisation among minority mothers in Washington, <e>DC</e>. Mothers &gt;or=18 years old with newborn infants and with poor or no prenatal care were enrolled in the study. A total of 160 mother-infant dyads completed the 12-month study. Mothers were interviewed when the infants were 4, 8 and 12 months old, and were asked to recall infant visits to all health care providers. Medical records from identified providers were used for verification. The number and type of immunisations given, types of providers visited, and reason for the visits were compared. Only about a quarter of mothers agreed with their infants' medical records on the number of specific immunisations received. The mothers reported fewer polio (1.8 vs. 2.1, P = 0.006), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP) (1.8 vs. 2.2, P = 0.002), and Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB) (1.3 vs. 2.1, P &lt; 0.0001) immunisations than were recorded. Similarly, about a quarter of the mothers were unaware of any polio, DTP or hepatitis B immunisations given, as documented in the medical records, and 38% did not know that their infant was immunised for HiB. Nearly half of the mothers recalled more infant doctors' visits than were recorded in the medical records (4.1 vs. 3.6 visits, P = 0.017). The mothers generally disagreed with the providers about the reason for a particular visit and reported fewer sick-baby visits (1.5 vs. 3.3, P &lt; 0.0001) than the providers recorded. Mothers' reports and medical records matched in only 19% of the cases. In 47%, mothers under-reported and in 34% over-reported the total number of visits. The strongest agreement between mothers' reports and medical records was in the case of emergency room visits (63%). In conclusion, in this population, mothers' reporting did not match that of providers with respect to specific information: the number of immunisations, the location where services were provided, and the classification of sick- vs. well-baby visits. Future studies that evaluate health care utilisation data should take these discrepancies into consideration in their selection of information source, and in their interpretation of the data.",M1
17376237,"Pediatric patient asthma-related emergency department visits and admissions in Washington, <e>DC</e>, from 2001-2004, and associations with air quality, socio-economic status and age group.BACKGROUND: The District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health, under a grant from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, established an Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. As part of this program, the goals of this contextual pilot study are to quantify short-term associations between daily pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and admissions for asthma exacerbations with ozone and particulate concentrations, and broader associations with socio-economic status and age group. METHODS: Data included daily counts of de-identified asthma-related pediatric ED visits for DC residents and daily ozone and particulate concentrations during 2001-2004. Daily temperature, mold, and pollen measurements were also obtained. After a cubic spline was applied to control for long-term seasonal trends in the ED data, a Poisson regression analysis was applied to the time series of daily counts for selected age groups. RESULTS: Associations between pediatric asthma ED visits and outdoor ozone concentrations were significant and strongest for the 5-12 year-old age group, for which a 0.01-ppm increase in ozone concentration indicated a mean 3.2% increase in daily ED visits and a mean 8.3% increase in daily ED admissions. However, the 1-4 yr old age group had the highest rate of asthma-related ED visits. For 1-17 yr olds, the rates of both asthma-related ED visits and admissions increased logarithmically with the percentage of children living below the poverty threshold, slowing when this percentage exceeded 30%. CONCLUSION: Significant associations were found between ozone concentrations and asthma-related ED visits, especially for 5-12 year olds. The result that the most significant ozone associations were not seen in the age group (1-4 yrs) with the highest rate of asthma-related ED visits may be related to the clinical difficulty in accurately diagnosing asthma among this age group. We observed real increases in relative risk of asthma ED visits for children living in higher poverty zip codes versus other zip codes, as well as similar logarithmic relationships for visits and admissions, which implies ED over-utilization may not be a factor. These results could suggest designs for future epidemiological studies that include more information on individual exposures and other risk factors.",M1
17371515,"Dissatisfaction with body size among low-income, postpartum black women.OBJECTIVE: To explore the body size perceptions of low-income, postpartum Black women. DESIGN: Prospective, exploratory survey using a culturally sensitive figure rating scale, to assess body size perceptions. SETTING: Four inner city clinics in Washington, <e>DC</e>. Participants: Low-income, postpartum Black women (N= 105). METHOD: A validated, culturally sensitive figure rating scale was used to assess perception of current, typical, healthy, and preferred body sizes of participants. Derived scores were used to assess other body image measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures were mean scores of perceived sizes and derived scores representing body size satisfaction, adherence to typical size, and health ideal size. RESULTS: Over 75% of subjects exhibited dissatisfaction with current body size. The perceived size for the typical (reference) woman was larger and not representative of the perceived healthy or preferred sizes of the sample. No difference between preferred and healthy sizes was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of the participants were dissatisfied with their current body size and over half desired weight loss. The lack of difference between preferred and healthy body sizes suggests desire for a body size that meets both cultural standards of attractiveness and personal standards of health. Nursing opportunity for engaging in anticipatory interventions is highlighted.",M1

17284565,"Functional limitations and changes in levels of depression among older adults: a multiple-hierarchy stratification perspective.OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of functional limitations on changes in levels of depression over time. A multiple-hierarchy stratification perspective framed the analyses of potential stratification-based contingencies of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. METHODS: We derived data from a longitudinal study of adults aged 65 and older in the Washington, <e>DC</e>, metropolitan area over a 3-year period (2001-2003). We used ordinary least squares regression models in order to assess the focal associations across a set of social status interaction terms. RESULTS: Changes in functional limitations were associated with changes in depression, but the patterns depended on interactions among race, gender, and socioeconomic status. DISCUSSION: These observations contribute to research by blending ideas from double and triple jeopardy and differential vulnerability perspectives. Although analyses of multiple contingencies create analytical challenges, this complexity is needed to accurately specify the mental health effects of functional limitations.",M1
17283739,"A large-sample survey of first- and second-year medical student attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine in the curriculum and in practice.PURPOSE: To assess attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its place in the medical school curriculum and medical practice among preclinical students at Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSOM), Washington, <e>DC</e>. METHOD: Two-hundred sixty-six first-year (n=111) and second-year (n=155) medical students rated their attitudes toward CAM and 15 CAM modalities in terms of personal use, inclusion in the curriculum, and use/utility in clinical practice. RESULTS: Nearly all (91%) students agreed that  CAM includes ideas and methods from which Western medicine could benefit ; more than 85% agreed that  knowledge about CAM is important to me as a student/future practicing health professional ; and more than 75% felt that CAM should be included in the curriculum. Among all students, the most frequently indicated level of desired training was  sufficient to advise patients about use,  for 11 of the 15 modalities. The greatest level of training was wanted for acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplements. The descriptions of CAM in future clinical practice that occurred most frequently were endorsement, referral, or provision of acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, nutritional supplements, prayer, and meditation. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in and enthusiasm about CAM modalities was high in this sample; personal experience was much less prevalent. Students were in favor of CAM training in the curriculum to the extent that they could provide advice to patients; the largest proportions of the sample planned to endorse, refer patients for, or provide 8 of the 15 modalities surveyed in their future practice.",M1
17222915,"Mood-worsening with high-pollen-counts and seasonality: a preliminary report.BACKGROUND: Because aeroallergens produce inflammation in the respiratory airways, and inflammation triggers depression in vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that mood sensitivity to pollen, the most seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with a greater seasonality of mood. Since pollen is absent during winter, we specifically predicted that mood sensitivity to tree pollen will predict non-winter SAD but not winter SAD. METHODS: A convenience sample of African and African American college students who lived in the Washington <e>DC</e> metropolitan area for at least the past 3 years completed the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), from which the Global Seasonality Score (GSS) was calculated, a diagnosis of cumulative SAD (syndromal or subsyndromal SAD) was derived, a seasonal pattern (winter vs non-winter) identified, and self-reported mood changes during high pollen counts obtained. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare GSS between participants with vs without mood worsening during high pollen counts. The capability of mood worsening with high pollen counts, gender, ethnicity, and age to predict non-winter SAD was analyzed with logistic regressions. RESULTS: GSS was greater (z=5.232, p&lt;0.001) in those who reported mood worsening with high pollen counts. Mood sensitivity to pollen predicted non-winter SAD (p=0.017), but not winter SAD. LIMITATIONS: The SPAQ is not a definitive tool to assess seasonality, and self-reported mood worsening with high pollen counts relies on recollection. No direct measures of depression scores or pollen counts were collected. The non-winter SAD concept has not been previously established. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, which should be considered preliminary in light of its limitations, suggests that self-reported mood-worsening with high pollen count is associated with a greater seasonality of mood, and predicts SAD of non-winter type.",M1
17169928,"The impact of professionally conducted cultural programs on the physical health, mental health, and social functioning of older adults.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of professionally conducted community-based cultural programs on the physical health, mental health, and social activities of individuals aged 65 and older. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in the study were 166 healthy, ambulatory older adults from the Washington, <e>DC</e>, area. We assigned them to either an intervention (chorale) or comparison (usual activity) group and assessed them at baseline and after 12 months. RESULTS: Results obtained from utilizing established assessment questionnaires and self-reported measures, controlling for any baseline differences, revealed positive findings for the effectiveness of the intervention such that the intervention group reported a higher overall rating of physical health, fewer doctor visits, less medication use, fewer instances of falls, and fewer other health problems than the comparison group. The intervention group also evidenced better morale and less loneliness than the comparison group. In terms of activity level, the comparison group evidenced a significant decline in total number of activities, whereas the intervention group reported a trend toward increased activity. IMPLICATIONS: The positive impact of participatory art programs for older adults in this study on overall health, doctor visits, medication use, falls, loneliness, morale, and activities reflects important health promotion and prevention effects and a reduction of risk factors driving the need for long-term care.",M1
17138466,"Treatment perceptions and attitudes of older human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults.OBJECTIVE: To apply the Health Belief Model (HBM) in assessing the association of health beliefs, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, alternative therapy use, and sexual risk behaviors in relation to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a group of older HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A convenience sample of 100 older (50 years and above) HIV-infected patients in 2 Washington, <e>DC</e>, clinics was enrolled. A cross-sectional methodology used structured interviews to investigate the association among antiretroviral adherence, use of alternative therapies, treatment perceptions, and risk behaviors. Student t tests were conducted to examine significant relationships between HBM perceptions and demographic characteristics. Logistic regressions were conducted to assess likelihood of antiretroviral and alternative therapy use. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were black and had a high school education. Although participants believed that HIV was a severe disease, they did not perceive themselves to be susceptible to early progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Participants believed that antiretrovirals were beneficial, and they were not particularly burdened by perceived costs of antiretrovirals. The perceived costs (or barriers) of antiretrovirals were inversely associated with CD4 count (r=-0.25, P=.01) and positively associated with viral load (r=0.33, P &lt; .01). Overall 21% of patients in this population indicated use of alternative therapies. Patients who tended to have a higher perception of severity of HIV and a higher perceived burden in using antiretrovirals were more likely to use alternative therapy. There was no difference in HBM perceptions among antiretroviral users and nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the benefits of taking antiretrovirals were clear to most patients, and the same patients did not view access to antiretrovirals as a significant barrier to treatment. Many patients, although aware of the severity of HIV disease, were not seeking modifications to sexual behavior. Furthermore, the actual medication-taking behavior of these patients resulted in significant impacts to their clinical status. Study results can be applied in the development of specific interventions that are intended to decrease HIV transmission among older adults and to improve medication-taking behavior among those who are already infected with HIV.",M1
17116609,"Parent and teacher mental health ratings of children using primary-care services: interrater agreement and implications for mental health screening.OBJECTIVE: To examine interrater agreement when screening for child mental health problems during primary-care visits. METHODS: Children aged 5 to 10 (n = 227) and one of their parents were systematically recruited from the waiting rooms of 15 primary-care sites located in Baltimore, Md; Washington, <e>DC</e>; and rural New York from 2002 to 2005. The parent and teacher of the child completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to measure the child's emotions, behaviors, and functional impairment. RESULTS: Parents and teachers identified a similar proportion of children as having high symptoms (25% vs 23%) and high impairment (27% vs 32%) but rarely agreed in their assessments of specific children. Parent ratings alone missed 52% of children rated by teachers as having both high symptoms and high impairment (kappa = 0.15). Only 6% of these discrepant visits were for mental health problems, making it unlikely that teacher reports would have been solicited. CONCLUSIONS: Parent reports failed to detect half of school-aged children considered to be seriously disturbed by their teachers. Efforts to improve detection of mental health problems by using screening tools in primary care may require algorithms that help providers judge when to solicit teacher reports and how to interpret conflicting information from parents and teachers.",M1
17090618,"Association of physical activity with development of uterine leiomyoma.The relation between physical activity and uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) has received little study, but exercise is protective for breast cancer, another hormonally mediated tumor. Participants in this study were randomly selected members of a health plan based in Washington, <e>DC</e>, aged 35-49 years (734 African Americans, 455 Whites) enrolled between 1996 and 1999. Fibroid status was based on ultrasound screening. Physical activity was based on detailed interview questions. Logistic regression with adjustment for body mass index and other risk factors showed that women in the highest category of physical activity were significantly less likely to have fibroids (odds ratio = 0.6, 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 0.9 for the highest vs. the lowest category (equivalent to approximately &gt; or =7 hours/week vs &lt;2 hours/week)). There was a dose-response pattern; a significant trend was seen for both African-American and White women. A multistate Bayesian analysis indicated that exercise was associated with tumor onset more strongly than with tumor growth. When data for women who reported major fibroid-related symptoms were excluded, results remained essentially unchanged, suggesting that the observed association could not be attributed to reverse causation (fibroids preventing exercise). The authors concluded that regular exercise might help women prevent fibroids.",M1
17089709,"Bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in field-contaminated Anacostia River (Washington, <e>DC</e>) sediment.Sediment-water partitioning behavior and bioavailability of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene) were measured in field-contaminated sediment collected from moderately polluted regions of the Anacostia River (Washington, DC, U.S.A.). Much of the sediment PAH burden was resistant to desorption: Effective partition coefficients were 2- to 10-fold greater than expected from literature values, and more than 80% of PAHs remained sorbed after treatment of the sediment with a nonionic polymeric adsorbent (Amberlite XAD-2) for 20 h. Bioaccumulation, elimination, and assimilation of each PAH in the deposit-feeding tubificid oligochaete Ilyodrilus templetoni were measured and compared with the equivalent measurements from laboratory-inoculated sediment. Ilyodrilus templetoni effectively accessed the desorption-resistant fraction of these organic contaminants, as exhibited by high single-gut passage assimilation efficiencies (ASEs) of the five PAHs (60% &lt; ASE &lt; 90%). However, steady-state accumulations of PAHs by I. templetoni were very low and consistent with low pore-water concentrations. The present results suggest that steady-state accumulation of PAHs is controlled by pore-water concentrations and is not necessarily related to route of uptake or assimilation efficiencies.",M1
17061751,"Validation of physical activity instruments: Black Women's Health Study.PURPOSE: Few studies have reported on the validity of physical activity measures in African Americans. The present study was designed to determine the validity of a self-administered physical activity questionnaire (PAQ) that was used in a large prospective study of African American women in the United States against an accelerometer (actigraph), an objective assessment of movement, and a seven-day activity diary. METHODS: The study was conducted among 101 women enrolled in the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) cohort who resided in the Washington, <e>DC</e>, metropolitan area, representing 11.2% (101/900) of this sample. Physical activity levels were obtained from the parent BWHS PAQ (eg, 1997 and 1999) and repeated in the present study. This information entailed hours per week of participation in walking for exercise, hours per week of moderate activity (eg, housework, gardening, and bowling), and hours per week of strenuous activity (eg, basketball, swimming, running, and aerobics) during the previous year. The participants were required to wear actigraphs for seven days and then record their physical activities in their diaries (seven-day physical activity diary) during this time. The diaries were used to record the amount and pattern of daily energy expenditure. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were seen between the BWHS PAQ and the actigraph for total activity, r=.28; walking, r=.26; and vigorous activity, r=.40, P&lt;.001. For the seven-day physical activity diary, the BWHS PAQ also demonstrated significant correlations for total (r=0.42, P&lt;.01); moderate (r=.26, P&lt;.05); and vigorous activities (r=.41, P&lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: The BWHS PAQ is a useful measure of physical activity in the BWHS cohort and thus has utility in prospective epidemiologic research.",M1
17018826,"Exploring the ethics of clinical research in an urban community.OBJECTIVES: We consulted with representatives of an urban community in Washington, <e>DC</e>, about the ethics of clinical research involving residents of the community with limited access to health care. METHODS: A semistructured community consultation was conducted with core members of the Health Partnership Program of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Three research case examples were discussed; questions and probes (a predetermined question or series of questions used to further investigate or follow-up a response) guided the discussion. RESULTS: The community representatives who took part in the consultation were supportive of research and appreciated the opportunity to be heard. They noted the importance of respecting the circumstances, values, needs, and welfare of research participants; supported widely representative recruitment strategies; and cited the positive benefits of providing care or treatment to participants. Monitoring participants' welfare and ensuring care at a study's end were emphasized. Trust was a central theme; participants suggested several trust-enhancing strategies, including full disclosure of information and the involvement of advocates, physicians, and trusted church members. CONCLUSIONS: Several important strategies emerged for conducting ethical research in urban communities whose residents have limited access to health care.",M1
17003138,"Primary care physicians' perceptions of the effect of insurance status on clinical decision making.PURPOSE: Americans who do not have health insurance receive fewer health services and have poorer health status than those who have insurance. To better understand this disparity, in this study we characterize primary care physician's perceptions of what effect, if any, patients' insurance status has on their clinical decision making during office visits. METHODS: Twenty-five physician members of CAPRICORN, a primary care practice-based research network in metropolitan Washington, <e>DC</e>, completed a brief paper-card survey instrument immediately after each patient encounter during 2 half-day office sessions. Participants saw patients in their usual manner and were given no additional information about their patients or their insurance. RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of participating physicians reported making at least 1 change in clinical management as a result of a patient's insurance status. They reported altering their management during 99 of 409 patient encounters (24.2%). There was a significant difference in the percentage of visits that involved a change in management for privately insured, publicly insured, and uninsured patients (18.7%, 29.5%, and 43.5% respectively, P = .01). Physicians reported discussing insurance issues with patients during 62.6% of visits during which they made a change in management based on insurance status. CONCLUSION: Physicians incorporate their patients' insurance status into their clinical decision making and acknowledge they frequently alter their clinical management as a result. Additional research is needed to understand the effect of these changes on patient health and to assist both physicians and patients in enhancing the quality of care delivered within the constraints of the current insurance system.",M1

16982649,"Evaluation of a nutrition education intervention for women residents of Washington, <e>DC</e>, public housing communities.We designed, implemented and evaluated an educational intervention to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among urban African-American women. Women aged 20-50 years (n=212) from 11 public housing communities participated in seven 90-min classes with a professional nutritionist. Our prospective pre- and post-test design, with 4-month follow-up, assessed the relationship between attendance and dietary change, using three 24-hour recalls per time point. Mean change in average daily dietary values for fruits and vegetables, calories and percent calories from fat (post-test versus pre-test, follow-up versus pre-test) was compared by class attendance, to evaluate the impact of class attendance on dietary change. Attendance varied from zero (35%) to five to seven classes (42%). Baseline dietary recalls showed average daily consumption of 3.05 servings of fruits and vegetables, 2416 calories and 35.8% calories from fat. No improvements in fruit and vegetable consumption, but statistically significant decreases in total calories and percent calories from fat, were seen at both endpoints. Women attending five to seven classes had the greatest dietary improvements, averaging, at post-test and follow-up, respectively, 246.2 and 324.5 fewer calories and 3.08 and 2.97% fewer calories from fat. Results suggest that, for some residents of low-resource communities, small group interventions are popular, effective vehicles for nutrition education.",M1
16979457,"Psychological responses to the sniper attacks: Washington <e>DC</e> area, October 2002.BACKGROUND: This study assessed the psychological and behavioral responses of residents of the Washington DC metropolitan area to the October 2002 sniper shootings, as well as the association between measures of exposure to the shootings and elevated traumatic stress symptoms. METHODS: Random-digit-dial telephone survey of 1205 adults living in Washington DC and two surrounding counties during the shootings, conducted May 2003. Main outcome measures included self-reports regarding traumatic stress symptoms, perceptions of safety, behavioral responses, and exposures to incidents. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of residents reported going to public spaces such as parks and shopping centers less than usual, and 5.5% reported missing at least 1 day of work because of the sniper attacks. Women who reported living within 5 miles of any shooting incident were significantly more likely to report elevated traumatic stress symptoms-consistent with a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder-than women who reported living farther from incidents (odds ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.9-9.3). Among men, there was no significant association between reported residential proximity and elevated traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the substantial behavioral and psychological impact that traumatic events such as these sniper shootings can have on communities. They support the importance of clinicians and community leaders addressing psychological functioning in the setting of such events that threaten a population. The results further suggest that women who report residing closest to such incidents are at greatest risk for experiencing elevated symptoms of traumatic stress, and perhaps warrant special attention.",M1

METHOD: In August 2004, we visited 29 of 33 (88%) of the McDonald's outlets in Washington, <e>DC</e> and visually inspected the premises, as well as asked cashiers or restaurant managers whether they had nutrition information available in the restaurant. RESULTS: In Washington, DC, 59% of McDonald's outlets provided in-store nutrition information for the majority of their standard menu items. In 62% of the restaurants, it was necessary to ask two or more employees in order to obtain a copy of that information. CONCLUSION: We found that even at the largest chain restaurant in the country, nutrition information at the point of decision-making is often difficult to find or completely absent.",M1

16889237,"Chemical phosphorus removal to extremely low levels: experience of two plants in the Washington, <e>DC</e> area.Chemical phosphorus removal using metal (iron and aluminium) salts is frequently used to control effluent soluble phosphorus levels in wastewater treatment plants. In the Washington DC area effluent phosphorus requirements are extremely stringent to protect the Chesapeake Bay. Full-scale data from two plants in the area were analysed to establish phosphate behaviour in the presence of iron. Titration experiments and mathematical modelling were performed to determine the role of ferric phosphate and hydroxide precipitation and other mechanisms that may potentially be involved in phosphorus removal. Iron addition is described in the model using a chemical equilibrium approach extended with surface charges and adsorption. The model verifies key observations from full-scale data: (a) extremely low orthophosphate levels can be achieved over a wide range of pH values, (b) a mixture of ferric phosphate and ferric hydroxide precipitate is forming with the hydroxide acting as sorbent, (c) molar ratios of Fe/P (iron dosed to phosphate removed) vary widely (1.0-3.9) based on the technology used and residual phosphate levels. The model will be a useful tool for engineers to optimise preliminary, simultaneous and tertiary P removal, both for design and plant operation.",M1
20178313,"Structural characterization of formaldehyde-induced cross-links between amino acids and deoxynucleosides and their oligomers.Exposure to formaldehyde results in the formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) as a primary genotoxic effect. Although DPCs are biologically important and eight amino acids have been reported to form stable adducts with formaldehyde, the structures of these cross-links have not yet been elucidated. We have characterized formaldehyde-induced cross-links of Lys, Cys, His, and Trp with dG, dA, and <e>dC</e>. dT formed no cross-links, nor did Arg, Gln, Tyr, or Asn. Reaction of formaldehyde with Lys and dG gave the highest yield of cross-linked products, followed by reaction with Cys and dG. Yields from the other coupling reactions were lower by a factor of 10 or more. Detailed structural examination by NMR and mass spectrometry established that the cross-links between amino acids and single nucleosides involve a formaldehyde-derived methylene bridge. Lys yielded two additional products with dG in which the linking structure is a 1,N(2)-fused triazino ring. The Lys cross-linked products were unstable at ambient temperature. Reactions between the reactive N(alpha)-Boc-protected amino acids and the trinucleotides d(T(1)B(2)T(3)) where B(2) is the target base G, A, or C and reactions between dG, dA and dC and 8-mer peptides containing a single reactive target residue at position 5 yielded cross-linked products with structures inferred from high resolution mass spectrometry and fragmentation patterns that are consistent with those between N(alpha)-Boc-protected amino acids and single nucleotides rigorously determined by NMR studies. These structures will provide a basis for investigation of the characteristics and properties of DPCs formed in vivo and will be helpful in identifying biomarkers for the evaluation of formaldehyde exposure both at the site of contact and at distant sites.",M2
19997099,"Pre-treatment with chemotherapy can enhance the antigenicity and immunogenicity of tumours by promoting adaptive immune responses.BACKGROUND: Some cancer patients are immuno-compromised, and it has been long felt that immune-intervention is not compatible with standard chemotherapies. However, increasing evidence suggests that standard chemotherapy drugs may stimulate beneficial changes in both the immune system and tumour. METHODS: We have assessed the expression of human leucocyte antigen class 1 (HLA1) on tumour cells before and after chemotherapy agents (cyclophosphamide, oxaliplatin or gemcitabine). In addition, we show that chemotherapy-stressed tumour cells may release cytokines that enhance the interactions between dendritic cells (<e>DCs</e>) and T cells into growth media. RESULTS: Here we report that some chemotherapy agents can increase HLA1 expression in tumour cells, even when expression is low. Increases were associated with killing by cytotoxic T cells, which were negated by HLA1-blockade. Furthermore, T-cell function, as indicated by increased proliferation, was enhanced as supernatants derived from tumours treated with chemotherapy augmented DC-maturation and function. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that a facet of immune surveillance can be restored by appropriate chemotherapy agents. Also, tumours exposed to some chemotherapy may secrete cytokines that can mature DCs, which ultimately enhances T-cell responses.",M2
19906761,"Randomized phase III trial comparing docetaxel plus epirubicin versus docetaxel plus capecitabine as first-line treatment in women with advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare docetaxel plus epirubicin versus docetaxel plus capecitabine combinations as front-line treatment in women with advanced breast cancer (ABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with ABC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) (DE) on day 1 or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus capecitabine 950 mg/m(2) orally twice daily on days 1-14 (<e>DC</e>) in 21-day cycles. Previous anthracycline-based (neo)-adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if completed &gt;1 year before enrollment. The primary objective of the study was to compare time to disease progression (TTP). RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six women were treated on each arm and median TTP was 10.6 versus 11.0 months (P = 0.7), for DE and DC, respectively. According to RECIST criteria we observed 15 (11%) versus 11 (8%) complete responses and 55 (40%) versus 61 (45%) partial responses (P = 0.8), with DE and DC, respectively. Severe toxicity included grade 3-4 neutropenia (57% versus 46%; P = 0.07), febrile neutropenia (11% versus 8%; P = 0.4), hand-foot syndrome (0% versus 4%; P = 0.02), grade 2-3 anemia (20% versus 7%; P = 0.001) and asthenia (12% versus 6%; P = 0.09) with DE and DC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The DE and DC regimens have similar efficacy but different toxicity. Either regimen can be used as front-line treatment of ABC.",M2
19797418,"Regular dose of gemcitabine induces an increase in CD14+ monocytes and CD11c+ dendritic cells in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy and immunotherapy often seem to contradict each other. However, recent reports suggested that the anticancer effects in some chemotherapeutic agents were concerned with immune response. This study was designed to evaluate the immunological reaction by gemcitabine for future clinical trial of combination therapy with gemcitabine and cancer vaccines. METHODS: We evaluated several immunological parameters in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who received a conventional dose of gemcitabine for 2 months. Twenty-eight patients with metastasis or locally advanced tumor, including 18 gemcitabine-naïve and 10 with a history of preceding gemcitabine treatment, were enrolled in this study. The patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. We monitored the kinetics of lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (<e>DC</e>), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-multimer conjugated with CMV or WT1 peptide, and intracellular cytokine production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 by flow cytometry. The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was also analyzed. RESULTS: The absolute number and percentage of CD14(+) monocytes and CD11c(+) (myeloid) DC increased with gemcitabine treatment (P = 0.033 and P = 0.021). The percentage of CD123(+) (plasmacytoid) DC also increased (P = 0.034), whereas no significant change was observed in other immune parameters, including multimer, intracellular cytokine production and TCR repertoire. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that gemcitabine treatment induced the proliferation of CD14(+) monocytes and CD11c(+) DC could support combination therapy with gemcitabine and specific immunotherapy such as peptide vaccination against pancreatic cancers.",M2
19501556,"Determination of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in genomic DNA using high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection.The formation of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-MedC) following methylation of the C-5 position of cytosine in genomic DNA provides an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation. We describe the development of a method using HPLC-ultraviolet (UV) detection for the accurate determination of 5-MedC in DNA. Genomic DNA was obtained from HeLa cells and rat liver tissue using an optimised anion-exchange column DNA extraction procedure incorporating a ribonuclease incubation step to remove any potential interference from RNA. Following extraction the DNA samples were enzymatically hydrolysed to 2'-deoxynucleosides using a combination of an endo-exonuclease plus 5'-exonuclease together with a 3'-nucleotidase. The hydrolysed DNA samples (10 microg on column) were analysed using narrow-bore reverse phase HPLC-UV detection. The level of 5-MedC in the DNA samples was expressed as a percentage of the level of 2'-deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) determined from calibration lines constructed using authentic standards for 5-MedC and dC. The percentage 5-MedC level determined for commercially available calf thymus DNA was 6.26%, for HeLa cell DNA was 3.02% and for rat liver DNA was 3.55%.",M2
19424589,"Impact of surgery and chemotherapy on cellular immunity in pancreatic carcinoma patients in view of an integration of standard cancer treatment with immunotherapy.As surgery and chemotherapy may act as adjuvants providing antitumor immunity benefits, we ran phenotypical and functional immunomonitoring in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and advanced metastatic disease receiving combined treatment (cisplatin, gemcitabine, 5-FU). Blood was taken before/one month after resection; before/during chemotherapy. Controls were age- and gender-matched. Circulating lymphocyte, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (MDC and PDC) subsets were examined by flow cytometry; functional activity by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) for <e>DC</e> allostimulation, through 4-h 51Cr-release assay for Natural Killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated-killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity; ELISA for spontaneous/activated cytokine release by PBMC and T cells. Significant differences occurred in several parameters between pretreatment patient and control values: fewer CD8+ cells and increased apoptosis-prone CD3+/CD95+ lymphocytes, higher frequency of MDC, reduced allostimulatory activity by ex vivo-generated DC, depressed LAK activity, elevated IL-10 and IL-12p40 production; impaired IL-12p70 and IFN-gamma production by stimulated PBMC and T cells. Only IL-12p70 level was correlated with survival. One month after radical, but not palliative surgery, the percentage of T-lymphocytes coexpressing CD3/CD95 decreased significantly, the stimulatory capacity of DC increased, and LPS-induced IL-12p70 release by PBMC rose concomitantly with the anti-CD3 stimulated-IFN-gamma production by T cells. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, one and/or two combined drug cycles increased percentage of CD4+ cells and LAK cell cytotoxicity and decreased PDC frequency and spontaneous/LPS-stimulated IL-10 by PBMC. Results suggest immunological changes induced by surgical resection/combined chemotherapy indicate specific precisely-timed windows of opportunity for introducing immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer, possibly improving survival in this highly lethal disease.",M2
19276867,"A combination therapy of gemcitabine with immunotherapy for patients with inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.OBJECTIVES: Dendritic cell (<e>DC</e>) therapy frequently induces a measurable immune response. However clinical responses are seen in a minority of patients, presumably due to insufficient expansion of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of eradicating tumor cells. To increase therapeutic efficacy of DC-based vaccination, we have undertaken the first clinical trial involving a combination therapy of gemcitabine (GEM) with immunotherapy for patients with inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients (n = 5) received the treatment course, which consisted of intravenous GEM administration at 1000 mg/m (day 1) and the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle injection of OK432-pulsed DCs into a tumor, followed by intravenous infusion of lymphokine-activated killer cells stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (CD3-LAKs) (day 4), at 2-week intervals. RESULTS: No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed during the study period. Three of the 5 patients demonstrated effective responses to this clinical trial; 1 had partial remission and 2 had long stable disease more than 6 months. In the patient with partial remission, it has been shown that DC-based vaccination combined with GEM administration induces tumor antigen-specific CTLs. CONCLUSION: This combined therapy was considered to be synergistically effective and may have a role in the therapy of pancreatic cancer for inducing tumor antigen-specific CTLs.",M2
19254547,"DNA hairpins containing the cytidine analog pyrrolo-<e>dC</e>: structural, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic studies.Structures formed by single-strand DNA have become increasingly interesting because of their roles in a number of biological processes, particularly transcription and its regulation. Of particular importance is the fact that antitumor drugs such as Actinomycin D can selectively bind DNA hairpins over fully paired, double-strand DNA. A new fluorescent base analog, pyrrolo-deoxycytidine (PdC), can now be routinely incorporated into single-strand DNA. The fluorescence of PdC is particularly useful for studying the formation of single-strand DNA in regions of double-strand DNA. The fluorescence is quenched when PdC is paired with a complementary guanine residue, and thus is greatly enhanced upon formation of single-strand DNA. Hence, any process that results in melting or opening of DNA strands produces an increase in the fluorescence intensity of this base analog. In this study we measured the structural effects of incorporating PdC into DNA hairpins, and the effect of this incorporation on the binding of the hairpins by a fluorescent analog of the drug Actinomycin D. Two hairpin DNAs were used: one with PdC in the stem (basepaired) and one with PdC in the loop (unpaired). The thermal stability, 7-aminoactinomycin D binding, and three-dimensional structures of PdC incorporated into these DNA hairpins were all quite similar as compared to the hairpins containing an unmodified dC residue. Fluorescence lifetime measurements indicate that two lifetimes are present in PdC, and that the increase in fluorescence of the unpaired PdC residue compared to the basepaired PdC is due to an increase in the contribution of the longer lifetime to the average fluorescence lifetime. Our data indicate that PdC can be used effectively to differentiate paired and unpaired bases in DNA hairpin secondary structures, and should be similarly applicable for related structures such as cruciforms and quadruplexes. Further, our data indicate that PdC can act as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor for the fluorescent drug 7-aminoactinomycin D.",M2
19223332,"Solution structure of DNA containing alpha-OH-PdG: the mutagenic adduct produced by acrolein.Acrolein is a cell metabolic product and a main component of cigarette smoke. Its reaction with DNA produces two guanine lesions gamma-OH-PdG, a major adduct that is nonmutagenic in mammalian cells, and the positional isomer alpha-OH-PdG. We describe here the solution structure of a short DNA duplex containing a single alpha-OH-PdG lesion, as determined by solution NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The spectroscopic data show a mostly regular right-handed helix, locally perturbed at its center by the presence of the lesion. All undamaged residues of the duplex are in anti orientation, forming standard Watson-Crick base-pair alignments. Duplication of proton signals near the damaged site differentiates two enantiomeric duplexes, thus establishing the exocyclic nature of the lesion. At the lesion site, alpha-OH-PdG rotates to a syn conformation, pairing to its counter cytosine residue that is protonated at pH 5.9. Three-dimensional models produced by restrained molecular dynamics simulations show different hydrogen-bonding patterns between the lesion and its cytosine partner and identify further stabilization of alpha-OH-PdG in a syn conformation by intra-residue hydrogen bonds. We compare the alpha-OH-PdG.<e>dC</e> duplex structure with that of duplexes containing the analogous lesion propano-dG and discuss the implications of our findings for the mutagenic bypass of acrolein lesions.",M2

METHODS: Thirty-two patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer were treated with a docetaxel and capecitabine combination regimen. All patients received oral administration of capecitabine at a dose of 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily, within 30 min after meal on D1 to D14, and intravenous infusion of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) on D1. The regimen was repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 126 cycles of DC regimen were administered in the 32 cases, with a median of 4 cycles. The overall response rate was 46.9%. Among the 32 patients, there were complete response in 1, partial response in 14, stable disease in 11 and progressive disease in 6 cases. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5.6 months. The one-year survival rate was 56.3%. The effective cases in different metastatic organs were: 8 cases in the lung, 6 cases in the liver, 3 cases in the soft tissue and 3 cases in the lymph nodes. The common adverse reactions were myelosuppression, hand-foot syndrome, nausea and vomiting. Neutropenia was observed in 84.4% of the patients. Two patients developed degree IV myelosuppression. CONCLUSION: The combination chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel plus capecitabine is well-tolerated and effective for anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer.",M2
19167340,"High-performance capillary electrophoretic method for the quantification of global DNA methylation: application to methotrexate-resistant cells.Global DNA hypomethylation in tumor tissue is a common characteristic in a variety of malignancies such as breast, colon, oral, lung, and blood cancers. A rapid and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of global DNA methylation in cells. Five substances--2'-deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>), 5-methyl 2'-deoxycytidine (mdC), 2'-deoxyadenosine (dA), 2'-deoxythymidine (dT), and 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG)--were completely separated by high-performance capillary electrophoresis in 10 min. Intraday coefficient of variation was less than 1%, and interday coefficient of variation was less than 2%. The minimal detection limit was 1 microM. Acquired drug resistance to methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most serious problems in cancer chemotherapy. Under optimal conditions, we analyzed global DNA methylation levels in A549 and A549/MTX cells, and only 10(5) cells are needed to obtain reliable results. The percentage of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-mC) was 4.80+/-0.52% in A549 cells, and this decreased to 4.20+/-0.44% in A549/MTX cells. It was considered as statistically significant. This demonstrated that the mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to MTX might be concerned with DNA methylation.",M2
19159229,"Extending thymidine kinase activity to the catalytic repertoire of human deoxycytidine kinase.Salvage of nucleosides in the cytosol of human cells is carried out by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1). Whereas TK1 is only responsible for thymidine phosphorylation, dCK is capable of converting <e>dC</e>, dA, and dG into their monophosphate forms. Using structural data on dCK, we predicted that select mutations at the active site would, in addition to making the enzyme faster, expand the catalytic repertoire of dCK to include thymidine. Specifically, we hypothesized that steric repulsion between the methyl group of the thymine base and Arg104 is the main factor preventing the phosphorylation of thymidine by wild-type dCK. Here we present kinetic data on several dCK variants where Arg104 has been replaced by select residues, all performed in combination with the mutation of Asp133 to an alanine. We show that several hydrophobic residues at position 104 endow dCK with thymidine kinase activity. Depending on the exact nature of the mutations, the enzyme's substrate preference is modified. The R104M-D133A double mutant is a pyrimidine-specific enzyme due to large K(m) values with purines. The crystal structure of the double mutant R104M-D133A in complex with the L-form of thymidine supplies a structural explanation for the ability of this variant to phosphorylate thymidine and thymidine analogs. The replacement of Arg104 by a smaller residue allows L-dT to bind deeper into the active site, making space for the C5-methyl group of the thymine base. The unique catalytic properties of several of the mutants make them good candidates for suicide-gene/protein-therapy applications.",M2
18549406,"Detection of endogenous DNA adducts, O-carboxymethyl-2'-deoxyguanosine and 3-ethanesulfonic acid-2'-deoxycytidine, in the rat stomach after duodenal reflux.The endogenous DNA adducts O(6)-carboxymethyl-deoxyguanosine (O(6)-CM-dG) and 3-ethanesulfonic acid-deoxycytidine (3-ESA-<e>dC</e>) are produced from N-nitroso bile acid conjugates, such as N-nitrosoglycocholic acid (NO-GCA) and N-nitrosotaurocholic acid (NO-TCA), respectively. Formation of these DNA adducts in vivo was here analyzed by 32P-postlabeling in the glandular stomach of rats subjected to duodenal content reflux surgery. In this model, all duodenal contents, including bile acid conjugates, flow back from the jejunum into the gastric corpus. The levels of O(6)-CM-dG found at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery were 40.9 +/- 9.4 and 56.3 +/- 3.2 per 10(8) nucleotides, respectively, whereas the sham operation groups had values of 5.8 +/- 2.3 and 5.9 +/- 0.5 per 10(8) nucleotides. Moreover, adduct spots corresponding to 3-ESA-dC were detected in both duodenal reflux and sham operation groups and levels in the duodenal reflux groups were around four-fold elevated at 11.2 +/- 1.0 and 8.9 +/- 1.0 per 10(8) nucleotides after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. When the duodenal reflux animals were treated with a nitrite trapping agent, thiazolidine- 4-carboxylic acid (thioproline, TPRO), the levels of O(6)-CM-dG and 3-ESA-dC were reduced to the same levels as in the sham operation animals. These observations suggest that NO-TCA and NO-GCA are formed by nitrosation of glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively, and these nitroso compounds produce DNA adducts in the glandular stomach of rats subjected to duodenal content reflux surgery.",M2
18377927,"Structural basis for substrate promiscuity of dCK.Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is an essential nucleoside kinase critical for the production of nucleotide precursors for DNA synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the initial conversion of the nucleosides deoxyadenosine (dA), deoxyguanosine (dG), and deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) into their monophosphate forms, with subsequent phosphorylation to the triphosphate forms performed by additional enzymes. Several nucleoside analog prodrugs are dependent on dCK for their pharmacological activation, and even nucleosides of the non-physiological L-chirality are phosphorylated by dCK. In addition to accepting dC and purine nucleosides (and their analogs) as phosphoryl acceptors, dCK can utilize either ATP or UTP as phosphoryl donors. To unravel the structural basis for substrate promiscuity of dCK at both the nucleoside acceptor and nucleotide donor sites, we solved the crystal structures of the enzyme as ternary complexes with the two enantiomeric forms of dA (D-dA, or L-dA), with either UDP or ADP bound to the donor site. The complexes with UDP revealed an open state of dCK in which the nucleoside, either D-dA or L-dA, is surprisingly bound in a manner not consistent with catalysis. In contrast, the complexes with ADP, with either D-dA or L-dA, adopted a closed and catalytically competent conformation. The differential states adopted by dCK in response to the nature of the nucleotide were also detected by tryptophan fluorescence experiments. Thus, we are in the unique position to observe differential effects at the acceptor site due to the nature of the nucleotide at the donor site, allowing us to rationalize the different kinetic properties observed with UTP to those with ATP.",M2
18258203,"Mimicking phosphorylation of Ser-74 on human deoxycytidine kinase selectively increases catalytic activity for <e>dC</e> and dC analogues.Intracellular phosphorylation of dCK on Ser-74 results in increased nucleoside kinase activity. We mimicked this phosphorylation by a Ser-74-Glu mutation in bacterially produced dCK and investigated kinetic parameters using various nucleoside substrates. The S74E mutation increases the k(cat) values 11-fold for dC, and 3-fold for the anti-cancer analogues dFdC and AraC. In contrast, the rate is decreased for the purine substrates. In HEK293 cells, we found that by comparing transiently transfected dCK(S74E)-GFP and wild-type dCK-GFP, mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser-74 has no effect on cellular localisation. We note that phosphorylation may represent a mechanism to enhance the catalytic activity of the relatively slow dCK enzyme.",M2
18220540,"Post-SELEX chemical optimization of a trypanosome-specific RNA aptamer.African trypanosomes are the causative agent of sleeping sickness. The therapeutics used to control and treat the disease are very ineffective and thus, the development of improved drugs is urgently needed. Recently, new strategies for the design of novel trypanocidals have been put forward. Among them are techniques that rely on parasite-specific RNA aptamers. One approach involves the aptamer-directed transport of lytic compounds to the lysosome of the parasite. The aptamer has been termed 2-16 RNA and here we report the optimization of the RNA for its applications in vivo. To convert aptamer 2-16 into a serum-stable reagent 2'-deoxy-2'-F- and/or 2'-deoxy-2'-NH(2)-uridine- and cytidine-substituted RNAs were generated. While 2'-NH(2)-<e>dC</e>/dU-modified RNAs were RNase-resistant, they were functionally inactive. By contrast, 2'-F-dC/dU-substituted 2-16 RNA retained its ability to bind to live trypanosomes (K(d)=45 nM) and was routed to the lysosome identically to unmodified RNA. 2'-F-dC/dU-substituted 2-16 RNA is thermostable (T(m)=75 degrees C) and has a serum half-life of 3.4 days. Furthermore, aptamer 2-16 was site-specifically PEGylated to increase its serum retention time. Conjugation with PEG polymers &lt; or = 10 kDa only marginally impacted the binding characteristics of the RNA, while the addition of higher molecular mass PEG molecules resulted in non-functional aptamers. Together, the data provide optimized conjugation chemistries for the large-scale production of substituted aptamer 2-16 preparations with improved in vivo functionality.",M2
18157934,"High-performance liquid chromatography determination of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxycytidine, and other deoxynucleosides and nucleosides in DNA digests.This work has undertaken liquid chromatographic separation of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides. Two different columns with three mobile phases (A, deionized water; B, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4.0); C, methanol) and slightly different gradient programs were used. The elution order was as follows: cytidine (C), 2'-deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>), uridine (U), 5-methyl-2'-cytidine (5mC), 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC), guanosine (G), deoxyguanosine (dG), 2'-deoxythymidine (dT), adenosine (A), and 2'-deoxyadenine (dA). Using a Luna C18 Phenomenex column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), the separation was performed at 40 degrees C with a total flow rate of 1 ml/min and a run time of 10 min. The second column was an Agilent C18 (50 x 3 mm, 1.8 microm), for which the run time was 4.5 min with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (25 degrees C). In application to the DNA digests from human THP-1 cells, the quantification of C, dC, U, 5mC, 5mdC, G, dG, and A was performed. The percentages of global methylation were evaluated based on the 5mdC and dC concentrations (c(5mdC) / [c(5mdC)+c(dC)], where c is concentration in microg/ml) and compared with those calculated from the respective peak areas (A(5mdC) / [A(5mdC)+A(dC)], where A is peak area at 254 nm). For peak area measurements, excellent agreement was obtained with the results reported previously in the same cell line. In the quantitative approach, the results of DNA methylation were higher but consistent with the previous data obtained using mass spectrometric detection. Comparing the analytical features of the two procedures, the use of a smaller column could be recommended because it provides efficient separation (capacity factors in the range of 1.29-10.66), a short run time, and feasibility of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside quantification in real-world samples and because it also minimizes the use of reagents.",M2

The modified cytosine base showed a basicity similar to that of cytosine (pKa 4.2).

17980502,"Role of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of vater.PURPOSE: The role of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in the treatment of ampullary cancers remains undefined. We retrospectively compared treatment outcomes in patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy alone versus those who received additional adjuvant CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1990 and January 2006, 54 of 96 patients with ampullary adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy also received adjuvant CRT. The median preoperative radiation dose was 45 Gy (range, 30-50.4 Gy) and median postoperative dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-55.8 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy included primarily 5-fluorouracil (52%) and capecitabine (43%). Median follow-up was 31 months. Univariate and multivariate statistical methodologies were used to determine significant prognostic factors for local control (LC), distant control (<e>DC</e>), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Actuarial 5-year LC, DC, and OS were 77%, 69%, and 64%, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, gender, race/ethnicity, tumor grade, use of adjuvant treatment, and sequencing of adjuvant therapy were not significantly associated with LC, DC, or OS. However, on univariate analysis, T3/T4 tumor stage was prognostic for poorer LC and OS (p = 0.02 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively); node-positive disease was prognostic for poorer LC (p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, T3/T4 tumor stage was independently prognostic for decreased OS (p = 0.002). Among these patients (n = 34), those who received adjuvant CRT had a trend toward improved OS (median, 35.2 vs. 16.5 months; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Ampullary cancers have a distinctly better treatment outcome than pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Higher primary tumor stage (T3/T4), an independent adverse risk factor for poorer treatment outcomes, may warrant the addition of adjuvant CRT to pancreaticoduodenectomy.",M2
17949223,"Electron attachment induced proton transfer in a DNA nucleoside pair: 2'-deoxyguanosine-2'-deoxycytidine.To elucidate electron attachment induced damage in the DNA double helix, electron attachment to the 2'-deoxyribonucleoside pair dG:<e>dC</e> has been studied with the reliably calibrated B3LYP/DZP++ theoretical approach. The exploration of the potential energy surface of the neutral and anionic dG:dC pairs predicts a positive electron affinity for dG:dC [0.83 eV for adiabatic electron affinity (EAad) and 0.16 eV for vertical electron affinity (VEA)]. The substantial increases in the electron affinity of dG:dC (by 0.50 eV for EAad and 0.23 eV for VEA) compared to those of the dC nucleoside suggest that electron attachment to DNA double helices should be energetically favored with respect to the single strands. Most importantly, electron attachment to the dC moiety in the dG:dC pair is found to be able to trigger the proton transfer in the dG:dC- pair, surprisingly resulting in the lower energy distonic anionic complex d(G-H)-:d(C+H).. The negative charge for the latter system is located on the base of dC in the dG:dC- pair, while it is transferred to d(G-H) in d(G-H)-:d(C+H)., accompanied by the proton transfer from N1(dG) to N3(dC). The low energy barrier (2.4 kcal/mol) for proton transfer from dG to dC- suggests that the distonic d(G-H)-:d(C+H). pair should be one of the important intermediates in the process of electron attachment to DNA double helices. The formation of the neutral nucleoside radical d(C+H). is predicted to be the direct result of electron attachment to the DNA double helices. Since the neutral radical d(C+H). nucleotide is the key element in the formation of this DNA lesion, electron attachment might be one of the important factors that trigger the formation of abasic sites in DNA double helices.",M2
17671218,"A combination of chemoimmunotherapies can efficiently break self-tolerance and induce antitumor immunity in a tolerogenic murine tumor model.Her-2/neu is a well-characterized tumor-associated antigen overexpressed in human carcinomas such as breast cancer. Because Her-2/neu is a self-antigen with poor immunogenicity due to immunologic tolerance, active immunotherapy targeting Her-2/neu should incorporate methods to overcome immunologic tolerance to self-proteins. In this study, we developed a tolerogenic tumor model in mice using mouse Her-2/neu as self-antigen and investigated whether genetic vaccination with DNA plasmid and/or adenoviral vector expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of syngeneic mouse Her-2/neu or xenogenic human Her-2/neu could induce mouse Her-2/neu-specific CTL responses. Interestingly, adenoviral vectors expressing xenogenic human Her-2/neu (AdhHM) proved capable of breaking immune tolerance and of thereby inducing self-reactive CTL and antibodies, but not to the degree required to induce therapeutic antitumor immunity. In attempting to generate therapeutic antitumor immunity against established tumors, we adopted several approaches. Treatment with agonistic anti-glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related receptor (GITR) antibody plus AdhHM immunization significantly increased self-reactive CTL responses, and alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer)-loaded dendritic cells (<e>DC</e>) transduced with AdhHM were shown to break self-tolerance in a tolerogenic murine tumor model. Furthermore, gemcitabine treatment together with either AdhHM plus agonistic anti-GITR antibody administration or alphaGalCer-loaded DC transduced with AdhHM showed potent therapeutic antitumor immunity and perfect protection against preexisting tumors. Gemcitabine treatment attenuated the tumor-suppressive environment by eliminating CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells. When combined with immunotherapies, gemcitabine offers a promising strategy for the Ag-specific treatment of human cancer.",M2

Following DC therapy, patients had core breast biopsies, and if residual disease was present, received four cycles of standard dose-dense doxorubin and cyclophosphamide (AC). RESULTS: The pCR rate was 26.9% (95% confidence interval, 11.6-47.8). Up-regulation of TP expression was not observed by either quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) or immunohistochemistry. Radiology-directed core biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy accurately predicted pathologic response in 88% (95% confidence interval, 69.8-97.6) of the cases. Neither level of TP expression nor TP up-regulation correlated with pCR. Significant toxicity resulted in therapy discontinuation in 3 of 26 patients. CONCLUSIONS: DC chemotherapy exhibited a similar pCR rate compared with standard taxane regimens, with increased toxicity. TP expression was not up-regulated after docetaxel and did not correlate with therapeutic response. Core breast biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy accurately predicted pathologic response.",M2

For this, phosphoramidite building blocks of 2'-deoxy-5-propynylcytidine () were prepared using acetyl, benzoyl or N,N-di-n-butylaminomethylidene protecting groups. The formation of the i-motif assemblies incorporating 2'-deoxy-5-propynylcytidine residues was confirmed by temperature-dependent CD- and UV-spectra as well as by ion-exchange chromatography. The low pK(a)-value of nucleoside (pK(a) = 3.3) compared to <e>dC</e> (pK(a) = 4.5) required strong acidic conditions for i-motif formation. Branched oligonucleotide residues with strands in a parallel orientation lead to a strong stabilization of the i-motif allowing aggregation even at non-optimal pH conditions (pH = 5).

17530837,"Nonenantioselectivity property of human deoxycytidine kinase explained by structures of the enzyme in complex with L- and D-nucleosides.Biological molecules are predominantly enantioselective. Yet currently two nucleoside analogue prodrugs (3TC and FTC) with opposite chirality compared to physiological nucleosides are clinically approved for the treatment of HIV infections. These prodrugs require conversion to their triphosphorylated forms to achieve pharmacological activity. The first step in the activation of these agents is catalyzed by human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). This enzyme possesses the ability to phosphorylate nucleosides of the unnatural L-chirality. To understand the molecular basis for the nonenantioselectivity of dCK, we solved the crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with the L-enantiomer and of its physiological substrate deoxycytidine and with the L-nucleoside analogue FTC. These were compared to a structure solved with D-<e>dC</e>. Our results highlight structural adjustments imposed on the L-nucleosides and properties of the enzyme endowing it with the ability to phosphorylate substrates with nonphysiological chirality. This work reveals the molecular basis for the activation of L-nucleosides by dCK.",M2
17430662,"[Efficacy of docetaxel combined capecitabine on metastatic breast cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Few treatment options are available for metastatic breast cancer with resistance to both anthracycline-and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. Docetaxel combined capecitabine (<e>DC</e> regimen) is approved as a new active regimen for metastatic breast cancer. This study was to explore the efficacy of DC regimen on metastatic breast cancer, and evaluate its safety. METHODS: A total of 31 metastatic breast cancer patients received DC regimen during each 3-week chemotherapy cycle. All patients received oral administration of capecitabine (1250 mg/m(2)) twice daily, within 30 min after meal on day 1 to Day 14, and infusion of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) on the first day of each 3-week cycle. All patients received prophylactic therapy with oral dexamethasone (8 mg) twice daily on 3 successive days. RESULTS: A total of 116 cycles of DC regimen were administered, with a median of 3.7 cycles. The objective response rate was 41.9%, with a complete remission (CR) rate of 9.6%. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, hand-foot syndrome, and stomatitis. The median follow-up was 10.8 months (range 2-23 months). Two patients were died of tumor progression. CONCLUSION: The combination of docetaxel and capecitabine provides a well-tolerated and active chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer.",M2
17412369,"Lipid peroxidation-derived etheno-DNA adducts in human atherosclerotic lesions.Atherosclerosis and cancer are characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and share common risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dietary habits and ageing. Growth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerotic plaques may result from DNA damage, caused either by exogenous mutagens or by agents endogenously generated due to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major LPO product, binds covalently to cellular DNA to form the exocyclic etheno-DNA-base adducts, 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenine (varepsilondA) and 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytosine (varepsilondC). By applying an ultrasensitive (32)P-postlabeling-immunoaffinity method, varepsilondA and varepsilondC were quantified in abdominal aorta SMCs from 13 atherosclerotic patients and 3 non-smoking subjects without atherosclerotic lesions. The levels of etheno-adducts ranged for varepsilondA from 2.3 to 39.6/10(8)dA and for varepsilondC from 10.7 to 157.7/10(8)<e>dC</e>, with a high correlation between varepsilondA and varepsilondC (r=0.84, P=0.0001). Etheno-adduct levels were higher in atherosclerotic smokers than in ex-smokers for both varepsilondA (means 15.2 versus 7.3, P=0.06) and varepsilondC (71.9 versus 51.6, not significant). varepsilondC levels were higher in either ex-smokers (P=0.03) or smokers (P=0.07) than in non-smokers. There was a poor correlation between either varepsilondA or varepsilondC and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, whereas significant positive correlations were detected with the levels of several postlabeled bulky aromatic DNA adducts. In conclusion, two different types of DNA damage may be involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression: (i) bulky aromatic compounds, to which aorta SMCs are chronically exposed in smokers, can either covalently bind to DNA, induce redox-cycling via quinone intermediates and/or activate local chronic inflammatory processes in the arterial wall; ii) this in turn leads to a self perpetuating generation of reactive oxygen species, LPO-products and increasing DNA-damage, as documented by the presence of high levels of miscoding etheno-DNA adducts in human aorta SMCs.",M2
17409898,"Docetaxel in combination with either cisplatin or gemcitabine in unresectable non-small cell lung carcinoma: a randomized phase II study by the Japan Lung Cancer Cooperative Clinical Study Group.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether cisplatin-free chemotherapy (docetaxel and gemcitabine [DG]) provides a comparable alternative to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (docetaxel and cisplatin [<e>DC</e>]) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 133) with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive DG (docetaxel 60 mg/m, day 8 + gemcitabine 800 mg/m, days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks; n = 65) or DC (docetaxel 60 mg/m, day 1 + cisplatin 80 mg/m, day 1, every 3 weeks; n = 68). The primary end point of the study was overall response rate. No prophylactic use of human recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor was allowed. RESULTS: The planned patient number was 150. However, an unexpectedly high incidence of grade 3 interstitial lung disease (11.1%) was identified in the DG arm, so the study was closed early. The overall response rates of the DG and DC arms were 27% and 23.5%, respectively, which demonstrated that the DG treatment was not inferior to the DC arm. Gastrointestinal toxicities were less frequent in the DG arm than in DC arm. Interstitial lung disease was exclusively observed in seven of 63 patients in the DG arm (11.1%). Median survival and 1-year survival rate were comparable between the two arms (median survival, DG 13.7 months versus DC 11.4 months; 1-year survival, DG 56.6% versus DC 47.7%). CONCLUSION: The DG regimen has a response rate and survival rate comparable to those of the DC regimen and can therefore be considered from an efficacy point of view to be comparable. However, the DG regimen may have induced pulmonary toxicity in 11% of the patients exposed and therefore should be used cautiously among patients with advanced NSCLC.",M2
17395611,"Dendritic cell-based vaccination combined with gemcitabine increases survival in a murine pancreatic carcinoma model.BACKGROUND: Tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be activated in vivo by vaccination with dendritic cells (<e>DCs</e>). However, clinical responses to DC-based vaccination have only been observed in a minority of patients with solid cancer. Combination with other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy may overcome immunoresistance of cancer cells. It has been shown previously that gemcitabine sensitises human pancreatic carcinoma cells against CTL-mediated lysis. Here, a murine pancreatic carcinoma model was used to investigate whether combination with gemcitabine increases therapeutic efficacy of DC-based vaccination. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived DCs from C57BL/6 mice were loaded with UV-irradiated, syngeneic Panc02 carcinoma cells and were administered subcutaneously. For prophylactic vaccination, mice were vaccinated three times at weekly intervals prior to tumour challenge with Panc02 cells. Therapeutic vaccination was started when tumours formed a palpable nodule. Gemcitabine was administered intraperitoneally twice weekly. RESULTS: Prophylactic DC-based vaccination completely prevented subcutaneous and orthotopic tumour development and induced immunological memory as well as tumour antigen-specific CTLs. In the subcutaneous tumour model, therapeutic DC-based vaccination was equally effective as gemcitabine (14% vs 17% survival at day 58 after tumour challenge; controls, 0%). Combination of the two strategies significantly increased survival of tumour-bearing mice (50% at day 58 after tumour challenge). DC-based vaccination also prevented death from pulmonary metastatisation after intravenous injection of Panc02 cells. CONCLUSION: DC-based immunotherapy may not only be successfully combined with gemcitabine for the treatment of advanced pancreatic carcinoma, but may also be effective in preventing local recurrence or metastatisation in tumour-free patients.",M2

The enzyme was synthesized with the use of a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system, given a lethal effect of its expression in E.coli cells, and was purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme showed high activity with single-stranded (ss) DNA and denatured dC-substituted T4 genomic double-stranded (ds) DNA but exhibited no activity with dsDNA, ssRNA or denatured T4 genomic dsDNA containing glucosylated deoxyhydroxymethylcytidine. Characterization of Endo IV activity revealed that the enzyme catalyzed specific endonucleolytic cleavage of the 5' phosphodiester bond of dC in ssDNA with an efficiency markedly dependent on the surrounding nucleotide sequence. The enzyme preferentially targeted 5'-dTdCdA-3' but tolerated various combinations of individual nucleotides flanking this trinucleotide sequence. These results suggest that Endo IV preferentially recognizes short nucleotide sequences containing 5'-dTdCdA-3', which likely accounts for the limited digestion of ssDNA by the enzyme and may be responsible in part for the indispensability of a deficiency in denB for stable synthesis of dC-substituted T4 genomic DNA.",M2

Among the three adducts, H-epsilondC is formed in the greatest abundance in in vitro reactions, and it has been detected in the C57BL/6JAPC(min) mouse model of colorectal cancer. To establish the genotoxic properties of this adduct, a site-specifically modified oligonucleotide was synthesized and incorporated into a shuttle vector. The modified vector was replicated in Escherichia coli and human cells. Analysis of the progeny plasmid has revealed that H-epsilondC strongly blocks DNA synthesis and markedly miscodes in both hosts. The miscoding frequency was 40-50% in bacteria and more than 90% in three human cell lines (xeroderma pigmentosum A and variant cells, and DNA repair wild-type cells). There was a drastic difference in coding events in these two hosts: dG and dC were almost exclusively inserted opposite the lesion in E. coli, while dA and dT were the preferential choices in human cells. These results indicate that this endogenous DNA adduct is very genotoxic to both organisms.",M2
16918236,"Formation of 1,4-dioxo-2-butene-derived adducts of 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxycytidine in oxidized DNA.Oxidation of deoxyribose in DNA produces a variety of electrophilic residues that are capable of reacting with nucleobases to form adducts such as M(1)dG, the pyrimidopurinone adduct of dG. We now report that deoxyribose oxidation in DNA leads to the formation of oxadiazabicyclo(3.3.0)octaimine adducts of <e>dC</e> and dA. We previously demonstrated that these adducts arise in reactions of nucleosides and DNA with trans-1,4-dioxo-2-butene, the beta-elimination product of the 2-phosphoryl-1,4-dioxobutane residue arising from 5'-oxidation of deoxyribose in DNA, and with cis-1,4-dioxo-2-butene, a metabolite of furan. Treatment of DNA with enediyne antibiotics capable of oxidizing the 5'-position of deoxyribose (calicheamicin and neocarzinostatin) led to a concentration-dependent formation of oxadiazabicyclo(3.3.0)octaimine adducts of dC and dA, while the antibiotic bleomycin, which is capable of performing only 4-oxidation of deoxyribose, did not give rise to the adducts. The nonspecific DNA oxidant, gamma-radiation, also produced the adducts that represented approximately 0.1% of the 2-phosphoryl-1,4-dioxobutane residues formed during the irradiation. These results suggest that the oxadiazabicyclo(3.3.0)octaimine adducts of dC and dA could represent endogenous DNA lesions arising from oxidative stresses that also give rise to other DNA adducts.",M2

Multi-stage MS (MSn) results showed that protonated cytosine, its 5-hydroxyl- and 5-hydroxymethyl-substituted derivatives, but not its 5-formyl-substituted analog, could undergo Dimroth-like rearrangement in the gas-phase. The elimination of HNCO was one of the major fragmentation pathways observed for the protonated ions of all dC derivatives except for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which underwent this loss only after a H2O molecule had been eliminated. In addition, the protonated cytosine and 5-hydroxycytosine can undergo a facile elimination of NH3 molecule. This loss, however, was not observed for protonated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and their uracil analogs. Taken together, our study demonstrated that modifications could alter markedly the CAD patterns of the protonated pyrimidine bases. The results from this study provided a basis for the identifications of other modified pyrimidine bases/nucleosides by tandem mass spectrometry.",M2

In this indication, a Phase II trial was conducted investigating a docetaxel-capecitabine combination. METHODS: Forty-six patients presenting with documented HRPC were enrolled in the study. The treatment regimen consisted of docetaxel (D) at a dose of 35 mg /m2/week (intravenously, 3 consecutive weeks) plus oral capecitabine (C) at a dose of 625 mg/m2 twice daily (Days 5-18) every 28 days for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was the biological response defined as a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level &gt; or =50%. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, safety, and quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty of 44 assessable patients (68.2%) achieved a biological response, 14 of whom (31.8%) normalized their PSA value. The median overall survival time was 17.7 months (95% confidence interval, 15.8 to not reached). Four treatment cycles were completed by 87% of the patients. Hematologic toxicity was mild. The main Grade 3-4 toxicities were cutaneous toxicity (13.1%) and changes in nails (6.5%). Physical functioning and role scales were higher before treatment (P = .02 and P = .003, respectively), fatigue and diarrhea were more frequent during and after treatment (P = .0003 and P = .03, respectively), and pain was lower during and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated the high efficacy of the <e>DC</e> combination in patients with HRPC, and the associated good tolerability.

16619589,"Salvage treatment with single-agent capecitabine in patients with heavily pretreated advanced colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Refractory and/or relapsing advanced colorectal cancer (ACRC) requires frequent and prolonged hospitalisations, with a negative impact on the patients' quality of life (QoL). The aim of this single-centre, phase II study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine (C) as salvage therapy in patients (pts) with ACRC, heavily pretreated with various chemotherapeutic regimens, as well as radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 28 pts were enrolled, with the following characteristics: 16 male and 12 female, median age 60 years (36-70) and median ECOG PS 1 (0-2). All pts had previously received at least 2 regimens of standard chemotherapy, including 5-FU/leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in various combinations, while 8 pts had been offered radiotherapy. Four pts had already been treated with C. The treatment was administered at home and consisted of C at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14, every 3 weeks, until disease progression (PD) and for a maximum of 9 cycles. Since grade (G) 3 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed among the first 7 pts, a daily dose of 2 g/m2 was adopted in the subsequent enrolment. RESULTS: The disease control (<e>DC</e>) rate was 53% (95% CI: 33.8%-72.5%): partial response in 2 pts and disease stabilization in 13 pts. Three out of 4 pts previously exposed to C showed stable disease. A significant symptom improvement was demonstrated in all 4pts with non-measurable baseline disease. The median time to progression was 4 months (range: 2-7). Nine pts had PD while on treatment. The median overall survival times for pts with DC and PD were 6 months and 3 months, respectively. Various types of G3 haematological toxicity were observed in 4/28 pts, G3 hand-foot syndrome in 6/28 pts and G3 GI toxicity in 8/28 pts. Nevertheless, the patients' QoL and the regimen's safety profile were satisfactorily preserved. CONCLUSION: Despite its methodological limitations, our trial suggests that salvage treatment of heavily pretreated ACRC with single-agent C may be considered a safe and cost-effective alternative to best supportive care.",M2

16568960,"Role of the guanine N1 imino proton in the migration and reaction of radical cations in DNA oligomers.Oxidation of a guanine nucleobase to its radical cation in DNA oligomers causes an increase in the acidity of the N1 imino proton that may lead to its spontaneous transfer to N3 of the paired cytosine. This proton transfer is suspected of playing an important role in long-distance radical cation hopping in DNA and the decisive product-determining role in the reaction of the radical cation with H2O or O2. We prepared and investigated DNA oligomers in which certain deoxycytidines are replaced by 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidines (F5dC). The pKa of F5C was determined to be 1.7 units below that of <e>dC</e>, which causes proton transfer from the guanine radical cation to be thermodynamically unfavorable. Photoinitiated one-electron oxidation of the DNA by UV irradiation of a covalently attached anthraquinone derivative introduces a radical cation that hops throughout the oligomer and is trapped selectively at GG steps. The introduction of F5dC does not affect the efficiency of charge hopping, but it significantly reduces the amount of reaction at the GG sites, as revealed by subsequent reaction with formamidopyrimidine glycosylase. These findings suggest that transfer of the guanine radical cation N1 proton to cytosine does not play a significant role in long-range charge transfer, but this process does influence the reactions with H2O and/or O2.",M2

Using 200 microL of plasma and BOND ELUT-C18 Varian columns, the solid phase extraction (SPE) method results in a clean baseline and high extraction efficiencies (100% for emtricitabine and 98.6% for tenofovir).

Combination with other treatment modalities, such as radiation or pharmacologic anticancer agents, may reduce tumor cell resistance against immune responses. The authors tested whether treatment with gemcitabine or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors increases the sensitivity of pancreatic carcinoma cells to CTL-mediated killing. Monocyte-derived DCs of HLA-A2+ donors were loaded with lysate from the HLA-A2+ pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc-1 and co-cultured with autologous CD3+ T cells. ELISPOT and cytotoxicity assays performed after two rounds of in vitro stimulation confirmed induction of a tumor-specific CTL response. Changes in the magnitude and the effector mechanism of the CTL response were analyzed after treatment of Panc-1 cells with gemcitabine and COX-2 inhibitors. Compared with gemcitabine, COX-2 inhibitors more effectively sensitized Panc-1 cells to CTL-mediated killing and showed less inhibition of T-cell activation by DCs in vitro. Using anti-CD95 blocking antibody, the authors showed that the increase in CTL-mediated tumor cell killing observed after treatment with COX-2 inhibitors is dependent on CD95/CD95 ligand interaction. Increased apoptosis of Panc-1 cells treated with COX-2 inhibitor was also observed after incubation with agonistic anti-CD95 antibody. Sensitization of cancer cells to CD95-dependent killing by CTLs represents a novel mechanism of action for COX-2 inhibitors and provides a rationale for their concomitant use with immunotherapeutic strategies such as DC-based vaccination.",M2
15942716,"Upregulation of BNIP3 by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to hypoxia-mediated cell death.BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer cells often show resistance to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis, but the molecular mechanism underlying that resistance remains unknown. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to examine the role of epigenetic gene alteration in the resistance to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis among pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of five genes associated with hypoxia-mediated apoptosis (PUMA, Caspase-8 [CASP8], APAF-1, BNIP3, and BNIP3L) in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis, using lysates from cells incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The methylation status of the genes was determined using bisulfite-PCR and sequencing. The percentages of cells that were apoptotic were determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Under normoxic conditions, the expression of the BNIP3 gene varied among the 12 pancreatic cancer cell lines tested, with 50% of them showing no BNIP3 expression at all, whereas expression of the other four genes was readily detected in all 12 cell lines. DNA methylation of BNIP3's CpG island in the region around the transcription start site of the gene was closely associated with its silencing. The expression of BNIP3 was restored by the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-<e>dC</e>), as was the hypoxia-mediated pancreatic cancer cell death. CONCLUSIONS: BNIP3 expression is silenced in some pancreatic cancer cells by the methylation of its CpG island. Demethylation of BNIP3, using a methyltransferase inhibitor, restores the gene's expression and induces hypoxia-mediated cell death. BNIP3 may thus be a useful target for new therapies aimed at treating pancreatic cancer.",M2

15656644,"Glycosidic bond cleavage of pyrimidine nucleosides by low-energy electrons: a theoretical rationale.DNA damage by attachment of low-energy secondary electrons is a very interesting and important mechanism. Electron capture and subsequent base release are thought to be the elementary steps of this mechanism. The process of the N1-glycosidic bond breaking of anion radicals of pyrimidine nucleosides, specifically the 2'-deoxyribothymidine (dT) and 2'-deoxyribocytidine (<e>dC</e>) anions, has been investigated theoretically at the B3LYP/DZP++ level of theory. The release of nucleobases by the attachment of low-energy electrons depends on the formation of a stable anion radical of the nucleoside. The lower bond-breaking activation energy and the higher vertical electron detachment energy for dT enables the heterolytic cleavage of the N1-glycosidic bond. However, with the higher bond-breaking activation energy and the lower vertical electron detachment energy for dC, the release of cytosine might be impractical when the incident electrons have high kinetic energy. Furthermore, the release of cytosine would have a quantum yield much lower than that of dT when the incident electrons have lower kinetic energy. This study also demonstrates the importance of the proton at O5' of 2'-deoxyribose in the base release process. Extending this investigation from dT to dC advances the insight into the mechanism of the N1-glycosidic bond-breaking process. The information from this extensive investigation should be valuable for further experimental studies of cytosine release in irradiated DNA.",M2
15651812,"Size-expanded analogues of dG and <e>dC</e>: synthesis and pairing properties in DNA.We describe the completion of the set of four benzo-fused expanded DNA (xDNA) nucleoside analogues. We previously reported the development of benzo-fused analogues of dA and dT and their inclusion in an exceptionally stable new four-base genetic system, termed xDNA, in which the base pairs were expanded in size. Here we describe the preparation and properties of the second half of this nucleotide set: namely, the previously unknown dxC and dxG nucleosides. The dxC analogue was prepared from the previously reported dxT nucleoside in three steps and 57% yield. The large-sized deoxyguanosine analogue was prepared from an intermediate in the synthesis of dxA, yielding dxG in 14 steps overall (2.4%). Suitably protected versions of the deoxynucleosides were prepared for oligonucleotide synthesis following standard procedures, and they were readily incorporated into DNA by automated synthesizer.  Dangling-end  measurements revealed that the benzo-fused homologues stack considerably more strongly on neighboring DNA sequences than do their natural counterparts. Base pairing experiments with xC or xG bases showed that they pair selectively with their Watson-Crick partners, but with mild destabilization, due apparently to their larger size. Overall, the data suggest that the fluorescent xG and xC bases may be useful probes of steric effects in the study of biological nucleotide recognition mechanisms. In addition, the completion of the xDNA nucleoside set makes it possible in the future to construct full four-base xDNA strands that can target any sequence of natural DNA and RNA.",M2

15531653,"Futile short-patch DNA base excision repair of adenine:8-oxoguanine mispair.8-oxo-7, 8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), one of the representative oxidative DNA lesions, frequently mispairs with the incoming dAMP during mammalian DNA replication. Mispaired dA is removed by post-replicative base excision repair (BER) initiated by adenine DNA glycosylase, MYH, creating an apurinic (AP) site. The subsequent mechanism ensuring a <e>dC</e>:8-oxo-dG pair, a substrate for 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), remains to be elucidated. At the nucleotide insertion step, none of the mammalian DNA polymerases examined exclusively inserted dC opposite 8-oxo-dG that was located in a gap. AP endonuclease 1, which possesses 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease activity and potentially serves as a proofreader, did not discriminate dA from dC that was located opposite 8-oxo-dG. However, human DNA ligases I and III joined 3'-dA terminus much more efficiently than 3'-dC terminus when paired to 8-oxo-dG. In reconstituted short-patch BER, repair products contained only dA opposite 8-oxo-dG. These results indicate that human DNA ligases discriminate dC from dA and that MYH-initiated short-patch BER is futile and hence this BER must proceed to long-patch repair, even if it is initiated as short-patch repair, through strand displacement synthesis from the ligation-resistant dC terminus to generate the OGG1 substrate, dC:8-oxo-dG pair.",M2
15366941,"Translesion synthesis past equine estrogen-derived 2'-deoxycytidine DNA adducts by human DNA polymerases eta and kappa.Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), composed of equilenin, is associated with increased risk of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. Several diastereoisomers of unique <e>dC</e> and dA DNA adducts were derived from 4-hydroxyequilenin (4-OHEN), a metabolite of equilenin, and have been detected in women receiving ERT. To explore the miscoding property of 4-OHEN-dC adduct, site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides (Pk-1, Pk-2, Pk-3, and Pk-4) containing a single diastereoisomer of 4-OHEN-dC were prepared by a postsynthetic method. Among them, major 4-OHEN-dC-modified oligodeoxynucleotides (Pk-3 and Pk-4) were used to prepare the templates for primer extension reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerase (pol) alpha, pol eta, and pol kappa. Primer extension was retarded one base prior to the lesion and opposite the lesion; stronger blockage was observed with pol alpha, while with human pol eta or pol kappa, a fraction of the primers was extended past the lesion. Steady-state kinetic studies showed that both pol kappa and pol eta inserted dCMP and dAMP opposite the 4-OHEN-dC and extended past the lesion. Never or less-frequently, dGMP, the correct base, was inserted opposite the lesion. The relative bypass frequency past the 4-OHEN-dC lesion with pol eta was at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than that for pol kappa, as observed for primer extension reactions. The bypass frequency past the dA.4-OHEN-dC adduct in Pk-4 was 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than that past the adduct in Pk-3. Thus, 4-OHEN-dC is a highly miscoding lesion capable of generating C --&gt; T transitions and C --&gt; G transversions. The miscoding frequency and specificity of 4-OHEN-dC were strikingly influenced by the adduct stereochemistry and DNA polymerase used.",M2
15339173,"O-selectivity and utility of phosphorylation mediated by phosphite triester intermediates in the N-unprotected phosphoramidite method.Previously, O-selective phosphorylation on polymer supports in the N-unprotected phosphoramidite method could not be carried out because the amino groups of dA and <e>dC</e> have high reactivity toward tervalent phosphorus(III)-type phosphitylating reagents. In this paper, we developed a new coupling strategy named the  activated phosphite method  in which the phosphitylation is mediated by phosphite triester intermediates 1. Application of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as the promoter to the solid-phase synthesis resulted in excellent O-selectivity of more than 99.7%. This O-selectivity was explained by the frontier molecular orbital interactions between the reactive intermediates and the nucleophiles such as the amino or hydroxyl groups of nucleosides. Furthermore, longer oligonucleotides were synthesized not only by a manual operation but also by a DNA synthesizer. The utility of our new method was demonstrated by the successful synthesis of a base-labile modified oligodeoxyribonucleotide having 4-N-acetyldeoxycytidine residues. Finally, DNA 20-mers containing dA or dC could be synthesized in good yields by use of a combined reagent of 6-trifluoromethyl-1-hydroxybenzotriazole and benzimidazolium triflate.",M2
15297882,"Structural basis for the dual coding potential of 8-oxoguanosine by a high-fidelity DNA polymerase.Accurate DNA replication involves polymerases with high nucleotide selectivity and proofreading activity. We show here why both fidelity mechanisms fail when normally accurate T7 DNA polymerase bypasses the common oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8oG). The crystal structure of the polymerase with 8oG templating <e>dC</e> insertion shows that the O8 oxygen is tolerated by strong kinking of the DNA template. A model of a corresponding structure with dATP predicts steric and electrostatic clashes that would reduce but not eliminate insertion of dA. The structure of a postinsertional complex shows 8oG(syn).dA (anti) in a Hoogsteen-like base pair at the 3' terminus, and polymerase interactions with the minor groove surface of the mismatch that mimic those with undamaged, matched base pairs. This explains why translesion synthesis is permitted without proofreading of an 8oG.dA mismatch, thus providing insight into the high mutagenic potential of 8oG.",M2
14980698,"2'-deoxycytidine in free nucleosides and double-stranded DNA as the major target of lipid peroxidation products.Lipid peroxidation generates a variety of reactive products that covalently modify DNA, yielding several types of adducts with nucleobases. In the present study, we characterized the modification of nucleobases during peroxidation of linoleate and found that 2'-deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) could be a major target of the modification by lipid peroxidation reactions. Upon incubation with oxidized linoleate, dC and 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) were significantly modified among four 2'-deoxynucleosides. The major product in dG/linoleate was identical to the 2-oxo-heptyl-substituted 1,N(2)-etheno-dG that had been previously identified as a 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE)-dG adduct. On the basis of spectroscopic and chemical characterization, we identified the major product in dC/linoleate as the 2-oxo-heptyl-substituted 3,N(4)-etheno-dC. The same adduct was also produced upon reaction of dC with ONE, suggesting that ONE might represent the major reactive species that modifies DNA during lipid peroxidation. Indeed, this proposition was supported by the observation that ONE was far more reactive with dC and dG than other genotoxic aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. More strikingly, we found that, in contrast to the similar reactivity of ONE toward free nucleobases (dC and dG), ONE preferentially reacted with dC residues in double-stranded DNA. These results suggest that ONE and other 4-oxo-2-alkenals may possess by far the strongest electrophilic potential vs. dC and that the formation of 4-oxo-2-alkenal-adducted dC may thus serve as one mechanism for oxidative damage to DNA in vivo.",M2

12878311,"Protonation of deoxycytidine residues in dC4 tetraloops: UV spectrophotometric study of dC10 and d(A14C4T14).It is shown that component analysis could be applied to study the UV difference spectra of cytidine oligomers and hairpin oligonucleotides with cytidines in the loop region in order to account for the melting and titration results in terms of cytidine stacking and protonation. Upon acid titration, the <e>dC</e>(10) oligomer undergoes cooperative conformational transition at pH 6.3 accompanied by protonation and formation of the i-structure with half of the residues protonated. The stability of the hemiprotonated structure increases with decreasing pH, the i-structure persisting still in the region of pH&lt;pK of cytidine. An UV difference spectrum that reflects the stacking/unstacking of hemiprotonated cytidine residues was acquired from the melting and titration experiments of the dC(10) oligomer and used to describe the behavior of the dC(4) loop of the hairpin oligonucleotide d(A(14)C(4)T(14)). It is shown that upon titration, the 50% level of protonation of the deoxycytidine tetraloop is attained at pH 5.0. Simultaneously, the stacking interactions of cytidine residues reach the maximum at this pH with two residues stacked, and thereafter decline again. Only marginal stabilization of the oligomer hairpin (DeltaT(m)=1.5 degrees C) is found to accompany the formation of this single hemiprotonated dC.dC(+) base pair. We propose that at pH 5 the cytidines of the dC(4) loop form a hemiprotonated dC.dC(+) pair stacked with the last dA.dT base pair of the hairpin stem.",M2

The exocyclic adduct 3,N(4)-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>), positioned opposite deoxyguanosine in the B-form duplex of the dodecanucleotide d(CGCGAATTepsilonCGCG), has been crystallographically characterized at 1.8A resolution. This self-complementary oligomer crystallizes in space group P3(2)12, containing a single strand in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was solved by isomorphous replacement with the corresponding unmodified dodecamer structure. Exposure of both structures to identical crystal packing forces allows a detailed investigation of the influence of the exocyclic base adduct on the overall helical structure and local geometry. Structural changes are limited to the epsilon C:G and adjacent T:A and G:C base-pairs. The standard Watson-Crick base-pairing scheme, retained in the T:A and G:C base-pairs, is blocked by the etheno bridge in the epsilon C:G pair. In its place, a hydrogen bond involving O2 of epsilon C and N1 of G is present. Comparison with an epsilon dC-containing NMR structure confirms the general conformation reported for epsilon C:G, including the hydrogen bonding features. Superposition with the crystal structure of a DNA duplex containing a T:G wobble pair shows similar structural changes imposed by both mismatches. Evaluation of the hydration shell of the duplex with bond valence calculations reveals two sodium ions in the crystal.",M2
12651944,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates deoxycytidine on single-stranded DNA but requires the action of RNase.The expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is prerequisite to a  trifecta  of key molecular events in B cells: class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in humans and mice and gene conversion in chickens. Although this critically important enzyme shares common sequence motifs with apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, and exhibits deaminase activity on free deoxycytidine in solution, it has not been shown to act on either RNA or DNA. Recent mutagenesis data in Escherichia coli suggest that AID may deaminate <e>dC</e> on DNA, but its putative biochemical activities on either DNA or RNA remained a mystery. Here, we show that AID catalyzes deamination of dC residues on single-stranded DNA in vitro but not on double-stranded DNA, RNA-DNA hybrids, or RNA. Remarkably, it has no measurable deaminase activity on single-stranded DNA unless pretreated with RNase to remove inhibitory RNA bound to AID. AID catalyzes dC --&gt; dU deamination activity most avidly on double-stranded DNA substrates containing a small  transcription-like  single-stranded DNA bubble, suggesting a targeting mechanism for this enigmatic enzyme during somatic hypermutation.",M2
12594238,"Novel monoclonal antibody recognition of oxidative DNA damage adduct, deoxycytidine-glyoxal.Glyoxal, a reactive aldehyde, is a decomposition product of lipid hydroperoxides, oxidative deoxyribose breakdown, or autoxidation of sugars, such as glucose. It readily forms DNA adducts, generating potential carcinogens such as glyoxalated deoxycytidine (gdC). A major drawback in assessing gdC formation in cellular DNA has been methodologic sensitivity. We have developed an mAb that specifically recognizes gdC. Balb/c mice were immunized with DNA, oxidatively modified by UVC/hydrogen peroxide in the presence of endogenous metal ions. Although UVC is not normally considered an oxidizing agent, a UVC/hydrogen peroxide combination may lead to glyoxalated bases arising from hydroxyl radical damage to deoxyribose. This damaging system was used to induce numerous oxidative lesions including glyoxal DNA modifications, from which resulted a number of clones. Clone F3/9/H2/G5 showed increased reactivity toward glyoxal-modified DNA greater than that of the immunizing antigen. ELISA unequivocally showed Ab recognition toward gdC, which was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the derivatized adduct after formic acid hydrolysis to the modified base. Binding of Ab F3/9 with glyoxalated and untreated oligomers containing deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, thymidine, and deoxyadenosine assessed by ELISA produced significant recognition (p &gt; 0.0001) of glyoxal-modified deoxycytidine greater than that of untreated oligomer. Additionally, inhibition ELISA studies using the glyoxalated and native deoxycytidine oligomer showed increased recognition for gdC with more than a 5-fold difference in IC(50) values. DNA modified with increasing levels of iron (II)/EDTA produced a dose-dependent increase in Ab F3/9 binding. This was reduced in the presence of catalase or aminoguanidine. We have validated the potential of gdC as a marker of oxidative DNA damage and showed negligible cross-reactivity with 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine or malondialdehyde-modified DNA as well as its utility in immunocytochemistry. Formation of the gdC adduct may involve intermediate structures; however, our results strongly suggest Ab F3/9 has major specificity for the predominant product, 5-hydroxyacetyl-<e>dC</e>.",M2
12590605,"Factors that contribute to efficient catalytic activity of a small Ca2+-dependent deoxyribozyme in relation to its RNA cleavage function.Recently, we found a small Ca(2+)-dependent deoxyribozyme (unmodified), d(GCCTGGCAG(1)G(2)C(3)T(4)A(5)C(6)A(7)A(8)C(9)G(10)A(11)GTCCCT), with cleavage activity for its RNA substrate, r(AGGGACA downward arrow UGCCAGGC) ( downward arrow denotes the RNA cleavage site), in the presence of Ca(2+) and developed a functional SPR sensor chip with this deoxyribozyme [Okumoto, Y., Ohmichi, T., and Sugimoto, N. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 2769-2773]. In the study presented here, to clarify the factors contributing to the efficient catalytic activity of the unmodified deoxyribozyme, RNA cleavage reactions were carried out using 24 mutant deoxyribozymes containing one unnatural DNA nucleotide, such as dI (2'-deoxyinosine), 7-deaza-dG, 2-aminopurine, 7-deaza-dA, 2-amino-dA, dm(5)C (5-methyl-2'-deoxycytosine), or d(P)C (5-propynyl-2'-deoxycytosine). The K(m) values (Michaelis constants) with the mutants that lacked N7 and O6 of G(1) and O6 of G(2) were 4.5 and 6.6 times that of the unmodified one, respectively. The k(cat) value (cleavage rate constant) with the mutants that lacked O6 of G(10) was 0.025 times that of the unmodified one. The results of UV melting curves, SPR kinetics, and CD spectra supported the quantitative idea that the catalytic activity of the unmodified form was achieved using Ca(2+). On the basis of these results, a preliminary model for two G(1) x A(8) and G(2) x A(7) mismatched base pairs such as G(anti) x A(anti) formed in the catalytic loop is proposed. The factor of 10 increase in the k(cat)/K(m) value of the mutant deoxyribozyme, which has C(9) substituted with d(P)C, suggests that the base stacking interaction between the substituted propynyl group in <e>dC</e> and the nearest-neighbor base grew stronger. Thus, substituting d(P)C for dC in the catalytic loop would be one of the best ways to increase the catalytic activity of the deoxyribozyme.",M2
12507931,"Comparison of multiple DNA adduct types in tumor adjacent human lung tissue: effect of cigarette smoking.Cigarette smokers inhale a broad range of carcinogens derived from tobacco and its pyrolysis products, including free radicals, which induce oxidative stress and subsequent lipid peroxidation (LPO). Miscoding carcinogen-DNA adducts are formed by cigarette smoke constituents and are thought to initiate lung carcinogenesis. The presence of various types of DNA damage was therefore analyzed in tumor adjacent uninvolved lung tissues of 13 smoking and 11 non-smoking operated lung cancer patients. O(4)-ethylthymidine (O(4)etT), 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine ( epsilon dA) and 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytidine ( epsilon <e>dC</e>) were determined by immuno-enriched (32)P-postlabeling. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts were measured as diagonal radioactive zones after nuclease P1 enriched (32)P-postlabeling. Mean O(4)etT and PAH-DNA adduct levels were higher in lung DNA of smokers than of non-smokers (O(4)etT/10(8) thymidine: 3.8 versus 1.6, P &lt; 0.01; PAH-DNA adducts/10(8) nucleotides: 11.2 versus 2.2, P &lt; 0.01). Pulmonary etheno-DNA adduct levels did not differ between smokers and non-smokers, but large inter-individual variations were observed (80- and 250-fold differences for epsilon dA and epsilon dC, respectively). As all smokers (except one) refrained from smoking at least for 1 week before surgery, our results demonstrate the persistence of O(4)etT and PAH-DNA adducts in human lung. A positive correlation obtained between O(4)etT and PAH-DNA adducts (R = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01) suggests that both adducts are formed from cigarette smoke as the main exposure source. We conclude that in addition to the DNA adducts derived from PAH and tobacco-specific nitrosamines, miscoding O(4)etT lesions are formed by cigarette smoke that contribute to the increased genomic instability and increased lung cancer risk in smokers.",M2

The intracellular metabolisms of L-dT and L-dC were investigated in HepG2 cells and primary cultured human hepatocytes. L-dT and L-dC were extensively phosphorylated in both cell types, with the 5'-triphosphate derivative being the predominant metabolite. In HepG2 cells, the 5'-triphosphate levels were 27.7 +/- 12.1 and 72.4 +/- 1.8 pmol/10(6) cells for L-dT and L-dC, respectively. In primary human hepatocytes, the 5'-triphosphate levels were 16.5 +/- 9.8 and 90.1 +/- 36.4 pmol/10(6) cells for L-dT and L-dC, respectively. Furthermore, a choline derivative of L-dCDP was detected at concentrations of 15.8 +/- 1.8 and 25.6 +/- 0.1 pmol/10(6) cells in human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells, respectively. In HepG2 cells exposed to L-dC, the 5'-monophosphate and 5'-triphosphate derivatives of beta-L-2'-deoxyuridine (L-dUMP and L-dUTP, respectively) were also observed, reaching intracellular concentrations of 6.7 +/- 0.4 and 18.2 +/- 1.0 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively. In human hepatocytes, L-dUMP and L-dUTP were detected at concentrations of 5.7 +/- 2.4 and 43.5 +/- 26.8 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively. It is likely that deamination of L-dCMP by deoxycytidylate deaminase leads to the formation of L-dUMP, as the parent compound, L-dC, was not a substrate for deoxycytidine deaminase. The intracellular half-lives of L-dTTP, L-dCTP, and L-dUTP were at least 15 h, with intracellular concentrations of each metabolite remaining above their respective 50% inhibitory concentrations for the woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA polymerase for as long as 24 h after removal of the drug from cell cultures. Exposure of HepG2 cells to L-dT in combination with L-dC led to concentrations of the activated metabolites similar to those achieved with either agent alone. These results suggest that the potent anti-HBV activities of L-dT and L-dC are associated with their extensive phosphorylation.",M2
11994423,"DNA double-strand breaks: prior to but not sufficient in targeting hypermutation.The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, both of which are associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). As AID is capable of deaminating deoxy-cytidine (<e>dC</e>) to deoxy-uracil (dU), it might induce nicks (single strand DNA breaks) and also DNA DSBs via a U-DNA glycosylase-mediated base excision repair pathway ('DNA-substrate model'). Alternatively, AID functions like its closest homologue Apobec1 as a catalytic subunit of a RNA editing holoenzyme ('RNA-substrate model'). Although rearranged Vlambda genes are preferred targets of SHM we found that germinal center (GC) B cells of AID-proficient and -deficient Vlambda1-expressing GC B cells display a similar frequency, distribution, and sequence preference of DSBs in rearranged and also in germline Vlambda1 genes.

Patients were randomized to receive either the DC or the DG combination. They were stratified according to age, performance status (PS) and stage of disease. Three hundred seventeen patients entered the study. Of them, 162 received the DC regimen and 155 the DG regimen. There were no differences in the patients' characteristics between the two study arms. Preliminary analysis included 132 evaluable patients in the DC arm and 114 in the DG arm. Three complete responses (CR) (2.3%) and 39 partial responses (PR) (30%) were documented in the DC arm (response rate (RR) 32.3%; 95% CI 23.87-39.76%), whereas 1 CR (0.9%) and 38 PR (33%) were documented in the DG arm (RR: 33.9%; 95% CI 25.5-42.92%). No differences in the RR, response duration, time to tumor progression, overall survival and 1-year survival were observed between the two groups. Regarding toxicity, there were no significant differences in grade 3-4 anaemia and thrombocytopenia between the two arms. However, grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 40 patients (33%) treated with the DC regimen and in 31 patients (22%) treated with the DG regimen (P=0.01). Twenty-four (16%) patients in the DC arm and 20 (14%) in the DG arm developed febrile neutropenia. There was one death due to sepsis in each arm. Non-haematological toxicity was mild and equal in the two arms, with the exception of grade 3-4 nausea and diarrhoea, which were more frequent in the DC arm. In conclusion, preliminary results showed that the DG regimen was as effective as the DC regimen. The toxicity profile of the DG combination was relatively milder. Hence, cisplatin cannot be considered longer as a mandatory component of chemotherapy against NSCLC.",M2
11697326,"Five-chlorodeoxycytidine, a tumor-selective enzyme-driven radiosensitizer, effectively controls five advanced human tumors in nude mice.PURPOSE: The study's goals were as follows: (1) to extend our past findings with rodent tumors to human tumors in nude mice, (2) to determine if the drug protocol could be simplified so that only CldC and one modulator, tetrahydrouridine (H4U), would be sufficient to obtain efficacy, (3) to determine the levels of deoxycytidine kinase and dCMP deaminase in human tumors, compared to adjacent normal tissue, and (4) to determine the effect of CldC on normal tissue radiation damage to the cervical spinal cord of nude mice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The five human tumors used were as follows: prostate tumors, PC-3 and H-1579; glioblastoma, SF-295; breast tumor, GI-101; and lung tumor, H-165. The duration of treatment was 3-5 weeks, with drugs administered on Days 1-4 and radiation on Days 3-5 of each week. The biomodulators of CldC were N-(Phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), an inhibitor of aspartyl transcarbamoylase, 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC), resulting in tumor-directed inhibition of thymidylate synthetase, and H4U, an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase. The total dose of focused irradiation of the tumors was usually 45 Gy in 12 fractions. RESULTS: Marked radiosensitization was obtained with CldC and the three modulators. The average days in tumor regrowth delay for X-ray compared to drugs plus X-ray, respectively, were: PC-3 prostate, 42-97; H-1579 prostate, 29-115; glioblastoma, 5-51; breast, 50-80; lung, 32-123. Comparative studies with PC-3 and H-1579 using CldC coadministered with H4U, showed that both PALA and FdC are dispensable, and the protocol can be simplified with equal and possibly heightened efficacy. For example, PC-3 with X-ray and (1) no drugs, (2) CldC plus the three modulators, (3) a high dose of CldC, and (4) escalating doses of CldC resulted in 0/10, 3/9, 5/10, and 6/9 cures, respectively. The tumor regrowth delay data followed a similar pattern. After treating mice only 11/2 weeks with CldC + H4U, 92% of the PC-3 tumor cells were found to possess CldU in their DNA. The great majority of head-and-neck tumors from patient material had markedly higher levels of <e>dC</e> kinase and dCMP deaminase than found in adjacent normal tissue. Physiologic and histologic studies showed that CldC + H4U combined with X-ray, focused on the cervical spinal cord, did not result in damage to that tissue. CONCLUSIONS: 5-CldC coadministered with only H4U is an effective radiosensitizer of human tumors. Ninety-two percent of PC-3 tumor cells have been shown to take up ClUra derived from CldC in their DNA after only 11/2 weeks and 2 weeks of bolus i.p. injections. Enzymatic alterations that make tumors successful have been exploited for a therapeutic advantage. The great electronegativity, coupled with the relatively small Van der Waal radius of the Cl atom, may result in CldC's possessing the dual advantageous properties of FdC on one hand and BrdU and IdU on the other hand. These advantages include autoenhancing the incorporation of CldUTP into DNA by not only overrunning but also inhibiting the formation of competing TTP pools in tumors. A clinical trial is about to begin, with head-and-neck tumors as a first target of CldC radiosensitization.",M2
11601999,"C5-(1-propynyl)-2'-deoxy-pyrimidines enhance mismatch penalties of DNA:RNA duplex formation.UV melting experiments show that C5-(1-propynyl)ation of seven pyrimidines to give a fully propynylated oligodeoxynucleotide (PrODN) heptamer increases the thermodynamic stability of six Watson-Crick paired DNA:RNA duplexes by 8.2 kcal/mol, on average, at 37 degrees C. About 2.5 kcal/mol of this enhancement is due to long-range cooperativity between the propynylated pyrimidines, Y(p)'s. On average, penalties for dU(p):rG, <e>dC</e>(p):rA, dU(p):rC, and dC(p):rC mismatches are enhanced by 2.9 kcal/mol in PrODN:RNA duplexes over those in unmodified duplexes. This results in penalties as large as 10 kcal/mol for a single mismatch. Removing a single propyne two base pairs away from a mismatch in a PrODN:RNA duplex eliminates the enhancement in specificity. Evidently, enhanced specificity is directly linked to long-range cooperativity between Y(p)'s. In most cases, the enhanced specificity is larger for internal than for terminal mismatches. PrODN:RNA duplexes are destabilized by full phosphorothioate backbone substitution to give S-PrODN:RNA duplexes. The S-PrODN:RNA duplexes retain enhanced mismatch penalties, however. These results provide insight for utilizing long-range cooperativity and enhanced specificity to improve nucleic acid based probe and drug design.",M2
11327781,"Fluorescence characterization of the transcription bubble in elongation complexes of T7 RNA polymerase.The various kinetic and thermodynamic models for transcription elongation all require an understanding of the nature of the melted bubble which moves with the RNA polymerase active site. Is the general nature of the bubble system-dependent or are there common energetic requirements which constrain a bubble in any RNA polymerases? T7 RNA polymerase is one of the simplest RNA polymerases and is the system for which we have the highest-resolution structural information. However, there is no high-resolution information available for a stable elongation complex. In order to directly map melted regions of the DNA in a functionally paused elongation complex, we have introduced fluorescent probes site-specifically into the DNA. Like 2-aminopurine, which substitutes for adenine bases, the fluorescence intensity of the new probe, pyrrolo-<e>dC</e>, which substitutes for cytosine bases, is sensitive to its environment. Specifically, the fluorescence is quenched in duplex DNA relative to its fluorescence in single-stranded DNA, such that the probe provides direct information on local melting of the DNA. Placement of this new probe at specific positions in the non-template strand shows clearly that the elongation bubble extends about eight bases upstream of the pause site, while 2-aminopurine probes show that the elongation bubble extends only about one nucleotide downstream of the last base incorporated. The positioning of the active site very close to the downstream edge of the bubble is consistent with previous studies and with similar studies of the promoter-bound, pre-initiation complex. The results show clearly that the RNA:DNA hybrid can be no more than eight nucleotides in length, and characterization of different paused species suggests preliminarily that these dimensions are not sequence or position dependent. Finally, the results confirm that the ternary complex is not stable with short lengths of transcript, but persists for a substantial time when paused in the middle or at the (runoff) end of duplex DNA.",M2
11199982,"Quantitative analysis of etheno-2'-deoxycytidine DNA adducts using on-line immunoaffinity chromatography coupled with LC/ES-MS/MS detection.Etheno DNA adducts, including 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (etheno-<e>dC</e>), are promutagenic lesions present in normal animal and human tissues. These DNA adducts are believed to be important in the etiology of cancer. Existing methods for quantifying etheno-dC use 32p. postlabeling. Although highly sensitive, postlabeling requires the use of an energetic radioisotope and considerable time and effort. The new methodology reported here permits automated quantification of trace levels of etheno-dC in crude DNA hydrolysates on the order of 5 adducts in 10(8) normal nucleotides from 100-microg samples of DNA. This was accomplished by using on-line immunoaffinity chromatography, a reverse-phase LC separation on graphitized carbon, tandem mass spectrometric detection, and an isotopically labeled internal standard. The automated procedures permitted analysis of 4 DNA hydrolysates/hr. The sensitivity using immunoaffinity cleanup was approximately 100-fold greater than that observed when using a silica-based trapping system. The validated method was applied to the analysis of etheno-dC in commercial calf thymus DNA, untreated mouse liver, and untreated rat liver DNA. The demonstrated level of performance suggests future applicability of this method in studies of cancer in humans and experimental animals.",M2
10677286,"Solution structure of an 11-mer duplex containing the 3, N(4)-ethenocytosine adduct opposite 2'-deoxycytidine: implications for the recognition of exocyclic lesions by DNA glycosylases.Lipid peroxidation products, as well as the metabolic products of vinyl chloride, react with cellular DNA producing the mutagenic adduct 3,N(4)-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (epsilondC), along with several other exocyclic derivatives. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics simulations were used to establish the solution structure of an 11-mer duplex containing an epsilondC.<e>dC</e> base-pair at its center. The NMR data suggested a regular right-handed helical structure having all residues in the anti orientation around the glycosydic torsion angle and Watson-Crick alignments for all canonical base-pairs of the duplex. Restrained molecular dynamics generated a three-dimensional model in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic data. The (epsilondC. dC)-duplex structure is a regular right-handed helix with a slight bend at the lesion site and no severe distortions of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The epsilondC adduct and its partner dC were displaced towards opposite grooves of the helix, resulting in a lesion-containing base-pair that was highly sheared but stabilized to some degree by the formation of a single hydrogen bond. Such a sheared base-pair alignment at the lesion site was previously observed for epsilondC.dG and epsilondC.T duplexes, and was also present in the crystal structures of duplexes containing dG.T and dG. U mismatches. These observations suggest the existence of a substrate structural motif that may be recognized by specific DNA glycosylases during the process of base excision repair.",M2
10673748,"2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine induces apoptosis through the Fas/Fas ligand pathway in human leukemia cell line MOLT-4.The mechanism of apoptosis induced by 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2CdA) in human leukemia cell line MOLT-4 was investigated. 2CdA induced increases of 3'-OH ends of genomic DNA, ladder-like DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer membrane, which are apoptotic characteristics. These apoptotic phenomena induced by 2CdA were inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX; a protein synthesis inhibitor), deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>; a substrate of deoxycytidine kinase), acetyl Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp aldehyde (Ac-IETD-CHO; a caspase-8 inhibitor) and acetyl Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO; a caspase-3 inhibitor). The protein synthesis-dependent expression of Fas and Fas ligand (Fas-L) was detected by treatment with 2CdA. The proteolytic processing of procaspases-8 and -3 to produce active fragments, caspases-8 (p18) and -3 (p17), respectively, was observed after treatment with 2CdA, and suppressed by cycloheximide. Increases in the activities of caspases-8 and -3 were observed after 2CdA treatment. Their activation was also dependent on protein synthesis. These results indicated that 2CdA-induced apoptosis was triggered by phosphorylation of 2CdA followed by the protein synthesis-dependent expression of Fas and Fas-L and activation of caspases-8 and -3.",M2
10626220,"Thermal destabilization of DNA oligonucleotide duplexes by exocyclic adducts on adenine or cytosine depends on both the base and the size of adduct.Numerous carcinogens or their bifunctional metabolites modify DNA bases by forming additional exocyclic rings on the base moiety. These modifications form exocyclic rings between N1 and N6 of dA, N3 and N4 of <e>dC</e> or N1 and N2 of dG, as well as the N2 and N3 of dG. This study focuses on the reaction products of dA and dC with chloroacetaldehyde, bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea and para-benzoquinone, which form etheno, ethano and para-benzoquinone derivatives, respectively. The three dC adducts and three dA adducts were each incorporated site-specifically into 25-nucleotide-long deoxyoligonucleotides. All duplexes with a single modified dA or dC adduct opposite the normal complement showed decreased thermal stability, as compared with the unmodified control duplex. The destabilizations ranges from -2 degrees C to -13 degrees C, depending on saturation, the size of the adduct and the nature of the base. Energy-minimized molecular models of the duplexes illustrate various degrees of distortions by the adducts, the para-benzoquinone adducts showing the greatest distortion.",M2
10626209,"Detection of 1,N6-etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine and 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine occurring endogenously in DNA.1,N6-Etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine (epsilon dA) and 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>) are DNA adducts formed by a number of genotoxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride. They are also formed endogenously in tissue DNA, probably from a reactive metabolite of lipid peroxidation. Both the qualitative and quantitative detection of endogenous adducts is important in order to place adduct formation by chemicals such as vinyl chloride in the context of this natural background level. Methods with sufficient sensitivity are therefore being developed to measure the natural background of epsilon dA and epsilon dC adducts. We have developed a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-32P-postlabelling method to measure epsilon dA and epsilon dC at alkylation frequencies of 1 adduct in 10(7)-10(8) nucleotides in 10-microgram samples of DNA. In HPLC-32P-postlabelling analysis of liver DNA from control Wistar rats, epsilon dA and epsilon dC were determined at levels of 1 adduct in 8.1 x 10(7) and 1 adduct in 1.8 x 10(7) nucleotides, respectively. The levels of epsilon dA and epsilon dC measured in liver DNA of animals exposed orally to five daily doses of 50 mg/kg body weight vinyl chloride were found by this method to be 1 adduct in 2.9 x 10(7) and 1 adduct in 1.4 x 10(7) nucleotides, respectively. In contrast, in a direct labelling study, radiolabelled epsilon dA and epsilon dC were not detected in liver DNA of rats exposed for 6 h by nose-only inhalation to [1,2-14C]vinyl chloride at up to 45 ppm v/v. Immunochemical procedures are also being developed for recognizing etheno adducts. Thus, a monoclonal antibody raised to protein conjugates of epsilon dC showed high selectivity in the recognition of this DNA adduct. When the antibody was immobilized on a solid support and used in an immunoenrichment procedure to purify epsilon dC from a large excess of normal nucleotides, one epsilon dC adduct from about 10(8) normal nucleotides could be resolved. Coupling the immunoaffinity enrichment procedure with capillary zone electrophoresis permitted the detection of approximately one epsilon dC adduct in 3 x 10(6) nucleotides.",M2
10626208,"Lipid peroxidation-induced etheno-DNA adducts in humans.Increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are implicated at various stages of carcinogenic processes. Recent studies have shown that reactive hydroxyalkenals derived from lipid peroxidation form the promutagenic exocyclic etheno DNA adducts 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (epsilon dA) and 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>). A highly selective and sensitive immunoaffinity 32P-postlabelling method has been developed to detect epsilon dA and epsilon dC, with a detection limit of about 5 adducts per 10(10) parent nucleotides, which permitted their measurement in small amounts of human DNA. Background levels of epsilon dA and epsilon dC were detected in normal human tissue DNA, apparently as a result of lipid peroxidation under normal physiological conditions. High levels of epsilon dA and epsilon dC were found in the liver DNA of cancer-prone patients with Wilson disease or primary haemochromatosis. High dietary intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are readily oxidized to form enals, increased the epsilon dA and epsilon dC levels in DNA from leukocytes of women. An immunoaffinity-high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence method has been developed to measure epsilon dA in human urine. Etheno DNA adducts can now be used as biomarkers to investigate the potential role of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in human cancers associated with certain lifestyles or chronic infections and to verify whether the levels of these adducts can be reduced by chemopreventive regimens.",M2
10572172,"3,N(4)-ethano-2'-deoxycytidine: chemistry of incorporation into oligomeric DNA and reassessment of miscoding potential.3,N(4)-Ethano-2'-deoxycytidine (ethano-<e>dC</e>) may be incorporated successfully into synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides by omitting the capping procedure used in the automated DNA synthetic protocols immediately after inserting the lesion and in all iterations thereafter. Ethano-dC is sensitive to acetic anhydride found in the capping reagent, and multiple oligomeric products are formed. These products were identified by examining the reaction of ethano-dC with the capping reagent, and several acetylated, ring-opened products were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry and collision induced dissociation experiments on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. A scheme for the formation of the acetylated products is proposed. In addition, the mutagenic profile of ethano-dC was re-examined and compared to that for etheno-dC. Ethano-dC is principally a blocking lesion; however, when encountered by the exo(-)Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, dAMP (22%), TMP (16%), dGMP (5.3%) and dCMP (1.2%) were all incorporated opposite ethano-dC, along with an oligomer containing a one-base deletion (0.6%).",M2
10536146,"Formation of 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine from 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in duplex DNA by Fenton-type reactions and gamma-irradiation.5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Me-<e>dC</e>) is formed by the enzymatic methylation of dC, primarily in CpG sequences in DNA, and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. In the present study, 5-Me-dC and double-stranded DNA fragments containing 5-Me-dC were either gamma-irradiated or aerobically treated with Fenton-type reagents, Fe(II)-EDTA, Fe(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid, Fe(III)-EDTA-H(2)O(2)-catechol or ascorbic acid-H(2)O(2) under neutral conditions. The formation of 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-CHO-dC) was observed upon treatment of both 5-Me-dC and DNA fragments containing 5-Me-dC. The yields of 5-CHO-dC from 5-Me-dC and those of 5-formyl-2'-deoxyuridine from dT were comparable. These results suggest that 5-Me-dC in DNA is as susceptible to oxidation as dT in cells, and raise the possibility that 5-CHO-dC may contribute to the high mutagenic rate observed in CpG sequences in genomic DNA.",M2
9886560,"Etheno adducts in spleen DNA of SJL mice stimulated to overproduce nitric oxide.In order to investigate specific DNA damage caused by nitric oxide (NO) induced lipid peroxidation, levels of promutagenic etheno adducts 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (epsilondA) and 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine (epsilondC) were measured in spleen DNA of SJL mice induced to produce high levels of NO by injection of RcsX (pre-B-cell lymphoma) cells. epsilondA and epsilondC levels were quantified by an ultrasensitive immunoaffinity-32P-post-labeling method. Spleen DNA of control mice (n = 5) had background levels of 9.2+/-5.4 epsilondA adducts per 10(9) dA and 13.1+/-5.7 epsilondC adducts per 10(9) <e>dC</e>. In RcsX cell-injected mice (n = 7), levels of these adducts were elevated approximately 6-fold, i.e. 53.9+/-39.4 epsilondA per 10(9) dA and 83.5+/-57.8 epsilondC per 10(9) dC (P &lt; 0.05). Mice injected with RcsX cells and also treated with NG-methyl-L-arginine (NMA), an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (n = 6), had significantly reduced levels (P &lt; 0.05) of both epsilondA and epsilondC (13.5+/-5.7 epsilondA per 10(9) dA and 28.2+/-15.7 epsilondC per 10(9) dC). These findings constitute the first available evidence of formation of etheno adducts associated with NO overproduction in vivo. The adducts were presumably formed from lipid peroxidation products such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), generated via oxidation of lipids by peroxynitrite. The results suggest that etheno-DNA adducts, among other types of damage, may contribute to the etiology of cancers associated with chronic infection/inflammation in which NO is overproduced.",M2
9744543,"DNA modifications by the mutagen glyoxal: adduction to G and C, deamination of C and GC and GA cross-linking.The mutagen glyoxal was reacted with DNA or deoxynucleosides under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) in vitro and the products were analyzed by HPLC coupled with a photodiode array UV detector. The efficient formation of a cyclic glyoxal-dG adduct (dG+) was observed in DNA, as well as with dG. The monomeric dG + was gradually decomposed to dG at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C (t1/2 14.8 h). However, the dG+ formed in single- and double-stranded DNA was rather stable under physiological conditions and the half-lives were 19 and 40 times longer respectively than that of the monomer (t1/2 285 and 595 h respectively). By reaction of glyoxal with deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>), the deamination products deoxyuridine and 5-hydroxyacetyl-dC (dC+) were formed. Under the same conditions, 5-methyl-dC was deaminated to dT at a higher rate. Deoxyuridine was also formed in DNA by glyoxal treatment. When glyoxal was reacted with various combinations of deoxynucleosides for a prolonged period, dG-glyoxal-dC (GgC), dG-glyoxal-dA (GgA), dG-glyoxal-dG (GgG) and dC-glyoxal-dC (CgC) cross-links were detected, although structures were not assigned unequivocally. Among these, the former two, the GC and GA cross-links, were detected in glyoxal-treated DNA. The yields of these products in DNA were in the following order; dG+ &gt; dU &gt; GgA &gt; GgC &gt; dC+. These DNA modifications may be relevant to glyoxal-induced mutations at GC pairs.",M2
9744526,"Differential cleavage of oligonucleotides containing the benzene-derived adduct, 1,N6-benzetheno-dA, by the major human AP endonuclease HAP1 and Escherichia coli exonuclease III and endonuclease IV.We report here that the newly synthesized DNA adduct, 1,N6-benzetheno-dA (pBQ-dA), in defined oligonucleotides [Chenna and Singer, Chem. Res. Toxicol., 8, 865-874], is a substrate for the major human AP endonuclease, HAP1, and the Escherichia coli AP endonucleases, exonuclease III and endonuclease IV. The mechanism of cleavage is identical to that reported previously for 3,N4-benzetheno-<e>dC</e> (pBQ-dC) and leads to a phosphodiester bond cleavage 5' to the adduct. There are, however, significant differences in the rate of cleavage of this adduct by these enzymes. The two bacterial AP endonucleases are both much more efficient than the human repair enzyme. In addition, using two random oligodeoxynucleotide sequences containing a single pBQ-dA, exonuclease III and endonuclease IV are similarly active, while HAP1 shows a distinct sequence preference of approximately 10-fold in efficiency of cleavage. The repair of this adduct by the three recombinant enzymes is further confirmed by using both active site mutant HAP1 proteins and by E.coli mutant strains lacking exonuclease III and/ or endonuclease IV. This sequence-dependent repair of pBQ-dA by HAP1 may play an important role in modulating benzene-induced carcinogenesis.",M2

Using the 981 cm-1 marker of Na2SO4 as an internal standard, Raman frequencies and scattering cross sections were evaluated for all prominent UVRR bands at each excitation wavelength. The results show that UVRR cross sections of both the nucleosides and amino acids are strongly dependent on excitation wavelength and constitute sensitive and selective probes of the residues. The results provide a library of UVRR marker bands for structural analysis of DNA viruses and other nucleoprotein assemblies.",M2
9425029,"Solution structure of the aminofluorene [AF]-external conformer of the anti-[AF]-C8-dG adduct opposite <e>dC</e> in a DNA duplex.The Escherichia coli genome contains a C-G1-G2-C-G3-C-C NarI hot spot sequence for -2 deletion mutations at G3 by aromatic amine carcinogens 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and 2-aminofluorene (AF) that form covalent adducts at the C8-position of the guanine ring. Each of the three guanines are positioned in different sequence contexts (C-G1-G, G-G2-C, and C-G3-C) which provides an opportunity to investigate the potential sequence dependent interconversion between AF-intercalated and AF-external conformers of the [AF]dG adduct positioned opposite dC within the NarI sequence at the duplex level. We have prepared and purified DNA duplexes containing the [AF]dG adduct positioned in C-[AF]G-G, G-[AF]G-C, and C-[AF]G-C NarI sequence contexts and observe the ratio of AF-intercalated to AF-external conformers to be 30:70, 10:90, and 50:50, respectively. We have applied a combined NMR-molecular mechanics approach to define the structure of the AF-external conformer in the G-[AF]G-C NarI sequence context where it is the predominant conformation (90%) in solution. The modified guanine of the [AF]dG adduct aligns through Watson-Crick pairing with its partner cytosine and is stacked into the helix between flanking Watson-Crick dG.dC base pairs. The AF-external conformer with its anti-[AF]dG residue causes minimal perturbations in the DNA duplex at and adjacent to the lesion site with the covalently linked fluorenyl ring readily accommodated in the major groove and tilted toward the 5'-end of the modified strand of the helix. This paper on the structure of the AF-external conformer with an anti-[AF]dG adduct together with the preceding paper in this issue on the structure of the AF-intercalated conformer with a syn-[AF]dG adduct defines for the first time the capacity of the mutagenic [AF]dG lesion to adopt interconverting syn and antialignments with the equilibrium shifting between the conformers depending on nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor sequences. Perhaps, recognition of the [AF]dG lesion by the repair machinery would be able to discriminate between the AF-intercalated conformer with its base displacement-fluorenyl ring insertion perturbation of the helix and the AF-external conformer where the DNA helix is essentially unperturbed at the lesion site and the fluorenyl ring is positioned with directionality in the major groove.",M2
9425028,"Solution structure of the aminofluorene [AF]-intercalated conformer of the syn-[AF]-C8-dG adduct opposite <e>dC</e> in a DNA duplex.We report below on a conformational equilibrium between AF-intercalated and AF-external states in slow exchange for the [AF]dG lesion positioned opposite dC in the d(C-[AF]G-C).d(G-C-G) sequence context. The slow exchange between states is attributed to interconversion between syn glycosidic torsion angle in the AF-intercalated and anti torsion angle in AF-external conformers of the [AF]dG opposite dC containing duplex. The present paper describes an NMR-molecular mechanics study that defines the solution structure of the AF-intercalated conformer for the case of [AF]dG adduct positioned opposite dC in the d(C-[AF]G-C).d(G-C-G) sequence context. The structure is of the base displacement-intercalation type where the aminofluorene ring is intercalated into the helix between intact Watson-Crick dG.dC base pairs, which results in a displacement of the modified guanine ring into the major groove where it stacks with the major groove edge of its 5'-flanking cytosine in the adduct duplex. The conformational equilibrium between AF-intercalated conformer (approximately 70%) with a syn alignment and AF-external conformer (approximately 30%) with an anti alignment for the [AF]dG adduct positioned opposite dC in the d(C-[AF]G-C).d(G-C-G) sequence context can be contrasted with our earlier demonstration that the population is 100% for the AP-intercalated conformer with a synalignment at the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminopyrene ([AP]dG) adduct site positioned opposite dC in the same sequence context [Mao, B., Vyas, R. R., Hingerty, B. E., Broyde, S., Basu, A. K., and Patel, D. J. (1996) Biochemistry, 35, 12659-12670]. This shift in population may reflect the much larger size of the pyrenyl ring of the [AP]dG adduct compared to the fluorenyl ring of the [AF]dG adduct which in turn might provide for a greater overlap of the aromatic amine with the flanking base pairs in the intercalated conformer of the former adduct in DNA.",M2
9337075,"Lamivudine (3TC) phosphorylation and drug interactions in vitro.Lamivudine (2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine; 3TC) is a dideoxynucleoside analogue that inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We are currently investigating the intracellular metabolism of 3TC to its active triphosphate (3TCTP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a monocytic cell line (U937). Optimal phosphorylation of 3TC was achieved after incubation for 24 hr, with 3TC diphosphate (3TCDP) the predominant metabolite formed, in both cell types investigated. Further studies in PBMCs followed preincubation with the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) for 72 hr. This enabled greater detection of phosphates, compared to resting cells. A 3TC concentration of 1 microM was chosen for future interaction studies, allowing good detection of 3TC and phosphates on radiochromatograms whilst being similar to the plasma level found in clinical studies (i.e. 3 microM). With a shift in treatment to combination therapy, it is essential that potential interactions between nucleoside analogues are investigated at the phosphorylation level, as this could affect antiviral activity. Both deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) significantly inhibited 3TC phosphorylation (e.g. at dC 100 microM, no 3TCTP was detected in PBMCs; P &lt; 0.001, whereas 66% of control 3TCTP production was observed in U937 cells; P &lt; 0.01). Zidovudine (ZDV) caused a small but significant reduction of 3TC phosphate production in both PBMCs and U937 cells. However, this may be due to toxicity or an effect on endogenous dCTP pools. Neither 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) or 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (d4T) significantly inhibited 3TC phosphorylation. These results suggest it would be better to coadminister two nucleoside analogues with different activation pathways.",M2

Two different crystal forms of the duplex were obtained and both belong to the rhombohedral space group, R3. Crystal form I has hexagonal unit cell dimensions, a = b = 40.82 A and c = 66.09 A and diffracts to 1.58 A resolution, while crystal form II has a = b = 47.11 A and c = 59.86 A, diffracting only to 2.50 A resolution. Both structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using different starting models. In spite of the large differences in the cell dimensions the overall structures in both crystals are similar. Instead of the expected blunt-end duplex with four consecutive G x U pairs, the slippage of the strands resulted in two different tandem G x U/U x G wobble pairs involving two of the central and two of the 5' overhang bases, still yielding a total of four wobble pairs. These tandem wobble pairs are flanked by two Watson-Crick pairs. The A-type duplexes stack in the familiar head-to-tail fashion forming a pseudocontinuous helix. The wobble pairs of the present motif II (G x U/U x G) structure stack with a low twist angle of 25.3 degrees in contrast to that of motif I (U x G/G x U), 38.1 degrees. The four wobble pairs are characteristically heavily hydrated in both the grooves accounting for their stability.",M2
9080452,"Cytosine arabinoside is neurotoxic to chick embryo spinal cord motoneurons in culture.Cytosine arabinoside (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, AraC) is a commonly used antimitotic agent that kills proliferating cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis. We report that AraC is toxic to cultured chick embryo spinal cord motoneurons (MTNs) in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of about 2 microM. Interestingly, this type of MTN death is specific, resembles that occurring upon muscle extract (MEX) trophic deprivation regarding its morphological and temporal characteristics, and has apoptotic features, as judged by observation of nuclear morphology. The death of AraC-treated MTNs can be blocked by 2'-deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>), a pyrimidine metabolite AraC is structurally related to. Overall, these findings suggest that dC may participate in a pathway, different from inhibition of DNA synthesis, that is necessary for cultured MTNs to respond to the trophic activities present in MEX.",M2
8942665,"Miscoding properties of 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine in reactions catalyzed by mammalian DNA polymerases.We have investigated the miscoding properties of the exocyclic DNA adduct, 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>), using an experimental system designed to detect and quantify base substitutions and deletions generated by primer extension in reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and delta. Oligodeoxynucleotides modified site-specifically with epsilon dC were used as DNA templates for this study. Pol alpha catalyzed incorporation of dTMP and dAMP opposite epsilon dC, accompanied by lesser amounts of dCMP and dGMP and some two-base deletions. Pol beta promoted incorporation of dCMP and dAMP, along with small amounts of one-base and two-base deletions. Pol delta catalyzed incorporation of dTMP and lesser amounts of dAMP and dGMP. The frequency of nucleotide insertion opposite epsilon dC and of chain extension from the 3'-primer terminus in reactions catalyzed by pol alpha and pol beta was established by steady-state kinetic analysis. Results of this study were consistent with those obtained in primer extension experiments. The miscoding properties of epsilon dC determined in vitro are consistent with observations of epsilon dC--&gt;A transversions and epsilon dC--&gt;T transitions in site-specific mutagenesis experiments in mammalian cells (Moriya et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 11899). We conclude from this study that DNA polymerases may differ significantly in their miscoding potential and that in vitro analysis can be used to predict mutagenic specificity of exocyclic DNA adducts in mammalian cells.",M2
8841109,"Solution conformation of the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-1-aminopyrene ([AP]dG) adduct opposite <e>dC</e> in a DNA duplex.Combined NMR-molecular mechanics computational studies were undertaken on the C8-deoxyguanosine adduct formed by the carcinogen 1-nitropyrene embedded in the d(C5-[AP]G6-C7).d(G16-C17-G18) sequence context in a 11-mer duplex, with dC opposite the modified deoxyguanosine. The exchangeable and nonexchangeable protons of the aminopyrene moiety and the nucleic acid were assigned following analysis of two-dimensional NMR data sets in H2O and D2O solution. There was a general broadening of several proton resonances for the three nucleotide d(G16-C17-G18) segment positioned opposite the [AP]dG6 lesion site resulting in weaker NOEs involving these protons in the adduct duplex. The solution conformation of the [AP]dG.dC 11-mer duplex has been determined by incorporating intramolecular and intermolecular proton-proton distances defined by upper and lower bounds deduced from NOESY spectra as restraints in molecular mechanics computations in torsion angle space. The aminopyrene ring of [AP]dG6 is intercalated into the DNA helix between intact Watson-Crick dC5.dG18 and dC7.dG16 base pairs. The modified deoxyguanosine ring of [AP]dG6 is displaced into the major groove and stacks with the major groove edge of dC5 in the adduct duplex. Both carbon and proton chemical shift data for the sugar resonances of the modified deoxyguanosine residue are consistent with a syn glycosidic torsion angle for the [AP]dG6 residue. The dC17 base on the partner strand is displaced from the center of the helix toward the major groove as a consequence of the aminopyrene ring intercalation into the helix. This base-displaced intercalative structure of the [AP]dG.dC 11-mer duplex exhibits several unusually shifted proton resonances which can be accounted for by the ring current contributions of the deoxyguanosinyl and pyrenyl rings of the [AP]dG6 adduct. In summary, intercalation of the aminopyrene moiety is accompanied by displacement of both [AP]dG6 and the partner dC17 into the major groove in the [AP]dG.dC 11-mer duplex.",M2
8784204,"1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine, a DNA adduct highly mutagenic in mammalian cells.1,N6-Ethenodeoxyadenosine (epsilon dA) is one of four exocyclic DNA adducts produced by chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, reactive metabolites of vinyl chloride, a human carcinogen. epsilon dA has also been detected in DNA of the liver of humans and untreated animals, suggesting its formation from endogenous sources. The mutagenic potential of epsilon dA was studied using a single-stranded shuttle vector system in several E. coli strains and in simian kidney cells (COS7). This vector system enables quantitative analysis of translesional synthesis past a site-specifically placed DNA adduct in both hosts owing to the lack of the complementary strand. In experiments with five strains of E. coli, a very limited number of targeted mutations (one epsilon dA--&gt;T, one epsilon dA--&gt;<e>dC</e>, and two epsilon dA--&gt;single base deletion) were observed among 756 transformants in hosts preirradiated with UV; no targeted mutations were observed among 563 transformants in nonirradiated hosts. These results indicate that nonmutagenic base pairings of epsilon dA:T are the almost exclusive events in E. coli. In COS7 cells, the frequency of targeted mutations was 70%, consisting of epsilon dA--&gt;dG (63%), epsilon dA--&gt;T (6%), and epsilon dA--&gt;dC (1%), indicating that the insertion of dCMP opposite the adduct is predominant. When compared with the results for 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine (epsilon dC), which was studied previously in the same system [Moriya et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 11899-11903], the results of this study indicate that the intrinsic mutagenic potency of epsilon dA is comparable to that of epsilon dC in mammalian cells.",M2
8702887,"Oxidative damage to DNA constituents by iron-mediated fenton reactions. The deoxycytidine family.Damage by iron-mediated Fenton reactions under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to deoxycytidine, deoxycytidine-5'-monophosphate, d-CpC, d-CpCpC, and dCMP residues in DNA resulted in at least 26 distinguishable products. Of these, 24 were identified by high performance liquid chromatography retention times, radiolabeling, UV absorption spectra, chemical synthesis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and/or NMR. The nature of the products was qualitatively similar for each substrate except for d-CpC (and possibly d-CpCpC) under anaerobic conditions for which 5-hydroxy-deoxycytidine was uniquely present and 1-carbamoyl-1-carboxy-4-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythropentofuranosyl) glycinamide was uniquely absent. Damage to <e>dC</e>, d-CpC, and d-CpCpC but not to dCMP or DNA was largely quenched by ethanol, indicating that iron is strongly associated only with dCMP and DNA. The presence of oxygen had little effect with dC or dCMP but had quantitative and qualitative effects with d-CpC and a significantly quantitative but not a qualitative effect with DNA. NADH could drive the Fenton reaction to cause damage to the dC family in vitro, consistent with a previous proposal that NADH was the reducing agent for the Fenton reaction in vivo (Imlay, J.A., and Linn, S. (1988) Science 240, 1302-1309). Finally, the damage spectrum of the dC family by the Fenton reaction is compared with that by ionizing radiation and chemical mechanisms leading to the formation of the 24 identified products are proposed.",M2
8761431,"Detection of 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine by immunoaffinity/32P-postlabelling in liver and lung DNA of mice treated with ethyl carbamate (urethane) or its metabolites.The capacity of the chemical carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC, urethane) and its metabolites vinyl carbamate (VC) and vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCO) to form ethenobases was studied in liver and lung DNA of 12-day-old and adult CD-1, B6C3F1, C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice. Following single and multiple doses of EC, VC or VCO, the formation of 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (epsilon dA) and 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>) was quantified by an immunoaffinity chromatography/32P-postlabelling technique. Both etheno adducts were detected in untreated control DNA samples from liver and lung in the range of 2-15 adducts/10(9) parent nucleotides. Following five repeated injections of 250 or 280 nmol/g body wt VC to adult mice, 51, 57 and 78 epsilon dA/10(9) dA and 28, 42 and 42 epsilon dC/10(9) dC (means of duplicate analyses) were detected in liver DNA of CD-1, C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice respectively. In lung DNA of these VC-treated mice, the levels were 87, 49 and 58 (epsilon dA/10(9) dA) and 64, 39 and 43 (epsilon dC/10(9) dC) respectively. Under similar dose regimens, lower levels of etheno adducts were detected in B6C3F1 mice. Etheno-DNA adducts were also formed in liver and lung upon treatment with EC in adult mice, but at 3-fold lower levels as compared with VC. In 12-day-old C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice, 2- to 3-fold higher etheno adduct levels were detected in liver DNA, when compared with adults, upon a single treatment with 250 nmol/g body wt VC, suggesting that young animals are more susceptible to adduct formation. Combined analysis of adduct formation in adult CD-1, C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice at the higher dose showed a statistically significant increase in etheno adduct formation in the order EC &gt; VC. The results demonstrate that EC and its activated intermediates bind to liver and lung DNA to form epsilon dA and epsilon dC, and the differences in DNA binding further support the hypothesis that metabolic activation of EC to VC is involved. Preliminary data also suggest that background levels of epsilon dA and epsilon dC in DNA are affected by the type of diet given to the animals.",M2
8692683,"G/C-modified oligodeoxynucleotides with selective complementarity: synthesis and hybridization properties.Modified oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) that have unique hybridization properties were designed and synthesized for the first time. These ODNs, called selective binding complementary ODNs (SBC ODNs), are unable to form stable hybrids with each other, yet are able to form stable, sequence specific hybrids with complementary unmodified strands of nucleic acid. To make SBC ODNs, deoxyguanosine (dG) and deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) were substituted with deoxyinosine (dI) and 3-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrrolo-[2,3-d]-pyrimidine-2-(3H)-one (dP), respectively. The hybridization properties of several otherwise identical complementary ODNs containing one or both of these nucleoside analogs were studied by both UV monitored thermal denaturation and non-denaturing PAGE. The data showed that while dI and dP did form base pairs with dC and dG, respectively, dI did not form a stable base pair with dP. A self-complementary ODN uniformly substituted with dI and dP acquired single-stranded character and was able to strand invade the end of a duplex DNA better than an unsubstituted ODN. This observation implies that SBC ODNs should effectively hybridize to hairpins present in single-stranded DNA or RNA.",M2
8640812,"Copper-dependent formation of miscoding etheno-DNA adducts in the liver of Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats developing hereditary hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Formation of etheno-DNA adducts in the liver was investigated in Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, a Long Evans strain with hereditary abnormal copper metabolism, which develop spontaneous hepatitis and later hepatocellular carcinoma. Using an ultrasensitive immunoaffinity/32P-postlabeling assay (J. Nair et al., Carcinogenesis, 16: 613-617, 1995), the etheno adducts 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (epsilon dA) and 3,N4-ethenodeoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>) were measured in the liver of 7-, 18-, 30-, and 87-week-old LEC rats. Levels were highest in the liver of 18-week old rats 85 +/- 17 (epsilon dA) and 85 +/- 30 (epsilon dC) adducts per 10(9) parent nucleotides, and the increase in the levels of etheno adducts was age dependent. Age-matched Long Evans agouti rats, a tumor-free sibling line of LEC rats, had much lower levels of both etheno adducts. Etheno adduct levels in LEC rats were well correlated with the hepatic copper levels, and peak adduct levels coincided with the age of commencement of fulminant hepatitis. Our results demonstrate for the first time a copper- and age-dependent formation of highly miscoding etheno-DNA adducts in the liver of LEC rats. These adducts are formed from lipid peroxidation products (F. El-Ghissassi et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol., 8: 273-283, 1995) and thus could arise in the liver of LEC rats from oxygen radicals generated by copper-catalyzed Fenton-type reactions. Etheno-DNA adducts along with other oxidative DNA base damages may thus be involved in liver carcinogenesis in LEC rats.",M2
8788210,"Lipid peroxidation induced by bolesatine, a toxin of Boletus satanas: implication in m5dC variation in Vero cells related to inhibition of cell growth.Bolesatine, a glycoprotein from Boletus satanas Lenz, has previously been shown to be mitogenic in rat and human lymphocytes at very low concentrations, whereas higher concentrations inhibited protein synthesis in vitro and in several in vivo systems. The low concentrations (1-10 ng/ml) of bolesatine were shown to activate protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro (cell-free system) and in Vero cells. In the same time, Vero cells significantly proliferated when incubated with bolesatine concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ng/ml; the DNA synthesis increased by 27-59% as referred to the control, and InsP3 release increased in a concentration-dependent manner, up to 142%. At higher concentrations, 1-10 micrograms in cell-free systems, bolesatine inhibits protein synthesis by hydrolyzing the nucleoside triphosphates GTP and ATP. In the present work, the implication of other toxic mechanisms, such as lipid peroxidation and active radical production, was investigated in relation to inhibition of cell growth, whereas possible modifications of the ratio m5dC/<e>dC</e>+m5dC were determined in order to correlate with the biphasic action of bolesatine in Vero cells. Low concentrations of bolesatine up to 10 ng/ml do not increase malonaldehyde (MDA) production, while they induce hypomethylation (5.2% as compared to 7.1%). Higher concentrations (above 20 ng/ml) increase MDA production, from 58 ng/mg of cellular proteins to 113 ng/mg at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, for example, and induce hypermethylation in Vero cell DNA. It is concluded that low concentrations of bolesatine that are proliferative induce hypomethylation, which could be one of the pathways whereby bolesatine induces cell proliferation. Higher concentrations which enhance lipid peroxidation also induce hypermethylation. These mechanisms could be at least partly implicated in the pathway whereby bolesatine induces cell death.",M2
7492736,"Large scale synthesis of p-benzoquinone-2'-deoxycytidine and p-benzoquinone-2'-deoxyadenosine adducts and their site-specific incorporation into DNA oligonucleotides.Benzene is a carcinogen in rodents and a cause of bone marrow toxicity and leukemia in humans. p-Benzoquinone (p-BQ) is one of the stable metabolites of benzene, as well as of a number of drugs and other chemicals. 2'-Deoxycytidine (<e>dC</e>) and 2'-deoxyadenosine (dA) were allowed to react with p-BQ in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and 4.5. The yields were considerably higher at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.4, as indicated by HPLC analysis. The desired products were isolated by column chromatography on silica gel or cellulose. Identification was done by FAB-MS, 1H NMR, and UV spectroscopy. The reaction of p-BQ with dC and dA at pH 4.5 produced the exocyclic compounds 3-hydroxy-1,N4-benzetheno-2'-deoxycytidine (p-BQ-dC), and 9-hydroxy-1,N6-benzetheno-2'-deoxyadenosine (p-BQ-dA), respectively, in a large scale and high yield. These adducts have been previously made in a microgram scale as the 3'-phosphate for 32P-postlabeling studies of their incidence in DNA. The p-BQ-dC and p-BQ-dA adducts have, in addition to the two hydroxyl groups of deoxyribose, one newly formed hydroxyl group at the C-3 or C-9 of the exocyclic base of each product respectively. Incorporation of these adducts into oligonucleotides as the phosphoramidite requires the protection of all three hydroxyl groups in these compounds. The exocyclic hydroxyl on the base has been successfully protected by acylation after protecting the 5'- and the 3'-hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety with a 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl group and a cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite group, respectively. For the first time, to our knowledge, the fully protected phosphoramidites of p-BQ-dC and p-BQ-dA were prepared and incorporated site-specifically into a series of oligonucleotides. The coupling efficiency was very high (&gt; 98%). However, deprotection of the DNA oligomers with ammonia produced only 50% of the desired oligomers containing the adduct. In contrast, when 10% of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in methanol at room temperature was used, only the desired oligomers were detected by HPLC. Thus, by deprotecting the oligomers with methoxide ions (DBU/methanol) and avoiding the use of ammonia, a high yield of modified DNA was obtained. After purification of these oligomers by HPLC, they were hydrolyzed enzymatically and analyzed by HPLC, which confirmed the base composition and the incorporation of the adducts. The mass spectroscopic analysis of the DNA oligomers was confirmed by electrospray MS. These oligomers are now under investigation for their biochemical properties.",M2
7703360,"Miscoding by the exocyclic and related DNA adducts 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine, 3,N4-ethano-2'-deoxycytidine, and 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine.3,N4-Etheno-2'-deoxycytidine, 3-(hydroxyethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, and 3,N4-ethano-2'-deoxy-cytidine are found in DNA of cells treated with either vinyl chloride or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-nitrosourea. These exocyclic and related DNA adducts were incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides, which were then used as templates for primer extension in reactions catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The miscoding potential of each lesion was determined quantitatively. DNA primers were readily extended on an epsilon <e>dC</e>-modified template; dAMP and dTMP were incorporated opposite the lesion. With high concentrations of DNA polymerase, small amounts of fully extended reaction products containing dAMP and dGMP or one-base and two-base deletions opposite ethano-dC were formed. Primer extension was blocked partially on templates containing 3-(hydroxyethyl)-dU; dAMP and smaller amounts of dTMP and dCMP were incorporated. The frequencies of nucleotide insertion opposite each of the three lesions and the frequencies of chain extension from the 3'-primer terminus, determined by kinetic analysis, were consistent with results of experiments utilizing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We conclude from these studies that epsilon dC, ethano-dC, and 3-(hydroxyethyl)-U are potentially miscoding lesions; only epsilon dC facilitates translesional synthesis.",M2
7991554,"Mutagenic potency of exocyclic DNA adducts: marked differences between Escherichia coli and simian kidney cells.A single-stranded shuttle vector containing a single 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine (epsilon <e>dC</e>) or 1,N2-(1,3-propano)-2'- deoxyguanosine (PdG) DNA adduct was used to investigate translesional DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli and simian kidney (COS) cells. The presence of either exocyclic adduct was associated with reduced numbers of transformants. In E. coli, this inhibitory effect could be overcome partially by irradiating cells with UV light before transformation. Translesional synthesis past both exocyclic lesions was accompanied by targeted mutations. For PdG, the primary mutagenic events observed in both hosts were PdG--&gt;T transversions; in preirradiated E. coli, PdG--&gt;A transitions were also observed. The targeted mutation frequency for single-stranded DNA that contained PdG was 100% in nonirradiated E. coli, 68% in preirradiated cells, and 8% in COS cells. In contrast, the targeted mutation frequency for single-stranded DNA that contained epsilon dC was 2% in nonirradiated E. coli, 32% in preirradiated cells, and 81% in COS cells. The primary mutations generated by epsilon dC in both E. coli and COS cells were epsilon dC--&gt;A and epsilon dC--&gt;T base substitutions. These observations appear to reflect the variable specificity of DNA replication complexes in incorporating bases opposite certain adducts. We conclude that DNA synthesis past the same DNA adduct can have strikingly different consequences in bacteria and mammalian cells, underscoring the importance of establishing the intrinsic mutagenic potential of DNA adducts in mammalian cells.",M2

Synthesis of the oligodeoxynucleoside methylphosphonates required only a small change in oxidation solution from standard DNA synthesis. The increased lability of the t-BPA group over the standard benzoyl and isobutyryl protection permitted the use of milder basic deprotection conditions. Deprotection of the nucleoside bases and release from support was best accomplished by a short treatment with ammonia saturated methanol. This procedure resulted in minimal backgone degradation with no base modifications.

7651830,"UV spectroscopic identification and thermodynamic analysis of protonated third strand deoxycytidine residues at neutrality in the triplex d(C(+)-T)6:[d(A-G)6.d(C-T)6]; evidence for a proton switch.Near-UV difference spectral analysis of the triplex formed from d(C-T)6 and d(A-G)6.d(C-T)6 in neutral and acidic solution shows that the third strand <e>dC</e> residues are protonated at pH 7.0, far above their intrinsic pKa. Additional support for ion-dipole interactions between the third strand dC residues and the G.C target base pairs comes from reduced positive dependence of triplet stability on ionic strength below 0.9 M Na+, inverse dependence above 0.9 M Na+ and strong positive dependence on hydrogen ion concentration. Molecular modeling (AMBER) of C:G.C and C+:G.C base triplets with the third strand base bound in the Hoogsteen geometry shows that only the C+:G.C triplet is energetically feasible. van't Hoff analysis of the melting of the triplex and target duplex shows that between pH 5.0 and 8.5 in 0.15 M NaCl/0.005 M MgCl2 the enthalpy of melting (delta H degree obs) varies from 5.7 to 6.6 kcal.mol-1 for the duplex in a duplex mixture and from 7.3 to 9.7 kcal.mol-1 for third strand dissociation in the triplex mixture. We have extended the condensation-screening theory of Manning to pH-dependent third strand binding. In this development we explicitly include the H+ contribution to the electrostatic free energy and obtain [formula: see text]. The number of protons released in the dissociation of the third strand from the target duplex at pH 7.0, delta n2, is thereby calculated to be 5.5, in good agreement with approximately six third strand dc residues per mole of triplex. This work shows that when third strand binding requires protonated residues that would otherwise be neutral, triplex formation and dissociation are mediated by proton uptake and release, i.e., a proton switch. As a by-product of this study, we have found that at low pH the Watson-Crick duplex d(A-G)6.d(C-T)6 undergoes a transition to a parallel Hoogsteen duplex d(A-G)6.d(C(+)-T)6.",M2

In order to investigate the occurrence and persistence of these adducts in rodents exposed to such DNA-damaging agents, an ultra-sensitive detection method has been developed. It is based on immunoaffinity purification of the etheno adducts and subsequent 32P-postlabelling followed by separation as 5'-monophosphates on polyethyleneimine-cellulose-coated thin-layer plates. Normal nucleotides in the DNA samples were quantitated by HPLC. Optimal conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA are described: deoxyuridine 3'-monophosphate was used as internal standard to correct for labelling efficiency of the etheno adducts. The method had a detection limit of 25 amol of epsilon dA and epsilon dC for a 50 micrograms DNA sample. Using this technique, analysis of liver DNA from humans with unknown exposure revealed the presence of epsilon dA and epsilon dC residues in the range of 0-27 adducts per 10(9) parent bases. Liver DNA obtained from untreated mice and rats was also shown to contain similar low but variable levels of these etheno adducts. In vitro studies indicated that these promutagenic DNA lesions could arise from endogenously formed lipid peroxidation products.",M2
