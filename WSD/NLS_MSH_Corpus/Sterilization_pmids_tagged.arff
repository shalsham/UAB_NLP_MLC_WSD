20183484,"<e>Sterilization</e> of companion animals: exploring the attitudes and behaviors of Latino students in south Texas.A sample of 131 Latino students attending a university in south Texas near the United States-Mexico border completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding their companion animals (pets). Compared with dog caregivers (owners) (n = 106), cat caregivers (n = 25) were significantly more likely to favor early spay/neuter of pets and to report that the primary benefit received from their own pet was relational (for example, companionship) rather than functional (for example, sense of safety). The rate of sterilization was significantly higher for cats (60%) than for dogs (26.4%). Sterilization rates were significantly higher for cats whose owners favored early spay/neuter and had accurate knowledge about sterilization of female cats and dogs. Sterilization rates were significantly higher for dogs whose owners had a veterinarian, favored early spay/neuter, and valued relational benefits of guardianship more than functional benefits. Approximately 41% of owners whose pets were not sterilized reported that they wanted puppies or kittens, and 25% reported that the cost of the procedure was the primary barrier. Sterilization programs must include both education about the benefits of sterilization and low-cost spay/neuter services.",M1
20160560,"Quinacrine <e>sterilization</e> and gynecologic cancers: a case-control study in northern Vietnam.BACKGROUND: Over 100,000 women worldwide have been sterilized by insertion of quinacrine into the uterus to induce tubal scarring. Concern has been expressed about possible carcinogenicity, and specifically the risk of uterine cancer. METHODS: From 2001 through 2006, we conducted a population-based, case-control study of gynecologic cancers in 12 provinces in northern Vietnam, where relatively large numbers of women had received quinacrine. Cases of incident cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancer were identified at provincial hospitals or at referral hospitals in Hanoi. For each case, 3 age- and residence-matched controls were randomly selected from the population registries of the case's home community. RESULTS: The prevalence of quinacrine exposure was 1.2% among cases and 1.1% among controls. For cervical cancer, analysis of 606 cases (9 exposed) and their 1774 matched controls (18 exposed) produced an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval = 0.59-3.48) (adjusted for several covariates including human papillomavirus risk score). For ovarian cancer, based on 262 cases (3 exposed) and 755 controls (8 exposed) and adjusted for age and number of years of ovulation, the odds ratio was 1.26 (0.21-5.45). For uterine cancer, none of the cases-including 23 cases of leiomyosarcoma-was exposed to quinacrine. The 95% confidence interval, based on 161 cases (none exposed) and 470 controls (7 exposed) and adjusted only for age, was 0-1.85. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of a relationship between quinacrine sterilization and gynecologic cancer.",M1
20027030,"Paracervical block efficacy in office hysteroscopic <e>sterilization</e>: a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of paracervical block compared with saline for pain relief during office hysteroscopic sterilization. METHODS: This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled study of women desiring hysteroscopic sterilization. A paracervical block of 1% lidocaine or normal saline was administered before office hysteroscopic sterilization. Patients and investigators were blinded to assignments. A pre hoc power analysis determined that 40 women would be required per arm to detect a difference of 0.9 cm on a visual analog scale. Pain was recorded on a visual analog scale at multiple procedure time points. Individualized standardized pain scores were constructed by weighted reporting of objective and subjective sensation. RESULTS: A total of 103 consecutive women were eligible, and 80 women were randomized, with 40 per group. Thirty-seven (93%) in each group had successful placement. The lidocaine group showed significantly lower pain scores for tenaculum placement (mean+/-standard deviation: 0.97+/-1.28 compared with 3.00+/-2.41, P&lt;.001) traversing the external cervical os (1.46+/-1.71 compared with 3.77+/-2.68, P&lt;.001) and internal os (1.79+/-2.11 compared with 4.10+/-2.77, P&lt;.001). There was no significant observed difference with device placement in tubal ostium (3.15+/-2.69 compared with 3.74+/-2.73, P=.33). Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated a relationship of pain to procedural time (P=.047) and to group assignment (P&lt;.01). CONCLUSION: Paracervical block with 1% lidocaine provides effective pain relief for cervical manipulations during office hysteroscopic sterilization, but does not reduce the pain associated with upper uterine/tubal manipulation when placing the devices.

20025632,"Transcervical hysteroscopic <e>sterilization</e> using cyanoacrylate: a long-term experimental study on sheep.AIM: We investigated the transcervical hysteroscopy application of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in the uterine tube lumen of a non-rodent animals (sheep) with fallopian tube dimensions similar those in humans. METHODS: Standard hysteroscopic procedures were performed on female Texel sheep (n = 26). The right and left ostia were identified. For each ewe, a urethral catheter (5Fr) was used for the delivery of 0.5 mL of saline or an equal volume of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate into the uterine tube. Following the procedure, ewes were housed with males of proven fertility for 90 days (equivalent to 5.5 estrous cycles). Postmortem (dye and burst pressure) and in vivo (hysterosalpingogram) testing for tube patency were both performed 90 days and 180 days following the procedure. RESULTS: All animals receiving the saline treatment became pregnant. Gross inspection of uterine tubes following n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate treatment revealed no visceral adhesions or fibrosis. However, postmortem testing revealed total obstruction within the fallopian tubes. This was confirmed by hysterosalpingogram, in that iodine contrast did not escape into the abdominal cavity. CONCLUSION: The cyanoacrylate promoted a reliable fallopian tube obstruction without fibrosis in an animal model exhibiting a similar tube diameter to that found in women. The technique can be evaluated for efficacy in vivo using hysterosalpingography.",M1
20004277,"Cancer risk after <e>sterilization</e> with transcervical quinacrine: updated findings from a Chilean cohort.BACKGROUND: Dating back to the 1970s, thousands of women worldwide have voluntarily been sterilized with transcervical insertion of quinacrine pellets. The safety and efficacy of the technology are still being assessed today; in particular, better estimates on the incidence of human cancers are now feasible. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 1492 women in Santiago and Valdivia, Chile, who received transcervical quinacrine pellets for contraceptive sterilization between 1977 and 1989. We periodically interviewed women with the last interviews in 2006-2007 and reviewed their medical records. We calculated age and site-specific incidence of invasive cancers and compared the observed cases to the number of expected cases based on data from the Cali, Colombia, cancer registry, gathered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. RESULTS: During 23,894 person-years of follow-up, 41 invasive cancers were identified, including 16 new cases that had occurred since the previous analysis. Ten cases of cervical cancer were observed, compared with 12.1 expected. Since the initial study's confirmation of a single case of leiomyosarcoma, no other uterine cancers have been diagnosed. We would expect 2.0 uterine cancers during this number of observed women-years. One case of ovarian cancer was diagnosed, compared with 3.1 expected. CONCLUSION: Rates of cancer among women exposed to intrauterine quinacrine are similar to population-based rates.",M1
19947030,"Failed female <e>sterilization</e>: a review of pathogenesis and subsequent contraceptive options.OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature, outline the pathogenesis of failed sterilization and discuss the currently available contraceptive options once sterilization fails. STUDY DESIGN: Publications from January 1966 to October 2008 and indexed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database were reviewed. Medical search heading words sterilization, sterilization failure, sterilization methods and contraception were used to identify relevant articles. In addition, references were obtained through cross-referencing the bibliography cited in each work. RESULTS: Available evidence suggests that sterilization fails in 0.13-1.3% of sterilization procedures and of these, 15-33% will be ectopic pregnancies. Tubal recanalization and cornual and tuboperitoneal fistula formation are the main causes; their occurrence can be reduced by proper training and use of appropriate sterilization techniques. Following sterilization failure, hysterosalpingography can provide valuable information about the patency of the fallopian tubes. CONCLUSION: Tubal sterilization is highly effective but can fail. There is a paucity of information in the literature as to what is best or most appropriate for patients when sterilization fails. Patients should be counseled at the outset about the contraceptive options that are available should sterilization fail.",M1
19819445,"Subserosal misplacement of Essure device manifested by late-onset acute pelvic pain.OBJECTIVE: To increase awareness of the potential to present with late-onset acute pelvic pain secondary to subserosal misplacement of an Essure device (Conceptus Inc., Mountain View, CA). DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): A 30-year-old woman who was seen with severe left lower quadrant pain 4 months after elective <e>sterilization</e> with an Essure device placed under local anesthesia. Mild to moderate resistance was encountered in the placement of the device in the left fallopian tube. INTERVENTION(S): Hysterosalpingogram showing patency of the left fallopian tube and operative laparoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Laparoscopic removal of the Essure device with left salpingectomy. RESULT(S): The patient was free of pain and was discharged home the same day of the laparoscopic procedure. CONCLUSION(S): This report reinforces the need to consider a misplaced Essure device in the differential diagnosis of late-onset acute pelvic pain in women who had difficult placement of the device.",M1
19805018,"Male perceptions on female <e>sterilization</e>: a community-based study in rural Central India.CONTEXT: Use of modern contraceptive methods has increased fourfold in India since the 1970s, characterized by a predominance of female sterilization. There has been considerable investigation about women's choice of female sterilization, but little from the male perspective. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted among 58 men currently married to women aged 15-45, followed by a cross-sectional survey among 793 men currently married to same-aged women. Bivariate analysis was used for the survey data, and content analysis was used for the qualitative data. RESULTS: Men's primary source of reproductive health information was mass media, although they expressed interest in getting information through discussion with knowledgeable sources. Men understood family planning and contraception to be two separate issues: Men viewed  family planning  as synonymous with female sterilization, whereas they saw  contraception  as referring to spacing methods, knowledge of which was limited. Thirty-four percent of men reported that their wives had been sterilized; 79% of men who did not rely on any permanent method said they wanted their wives to be sterilized. In focus group discussions, most men reported themselves as their family's sole decision maker about reproductive health; however, only one-third of survey respondents did so. CONCLUSION: Men are interested in acquiring family planning information, but lack knowledge about available information sources, which hampers their ability to make informed family planning choices. Family planning service providers and program planners need to be aware of males' knowledge and perceptions pertaining to family planning, and make appropriate modifications to communication strategies.",M1
19579351,"<e>Sterilization</e> in Alberta, 1928 to 1972: gender matters.Alberta, Canada, passed a Sexual Sterilization Act in 1928 and up until its repeal in 1972, over 2,800 people were sterilized. Women were overrepresented in the number of sterilizations performed. This paper explores how changing understandings of eugenics led to a subtle transformation which resulted in a  two-pronged  system that targeted mentally defective men, often a danger to society, and mentally normal but morally abnormal women who consented to sterilization. The end result was success for the movement in terms of the types and numbers of people sterilized, and in the longevity of the program.",M1
19531317,"[Canine population dynamics: the potential effect of <e>sterilization</e> campaigns]OBJECTIVE: To analyze, through mathematical modeling, the potential ability of sterilization campaigns to reduce the population density of pet dogs. METHODS: Mathematical models were constructed to simulate the canine population dynamics and project the results of control strategies based on several sterilization rates. RESULTS: Even at high sterilization rates (for example, 0.80 year(-1)), it would take approximately 5 years to reduce density by 20%. Even so, other sources of population growth, such as the importing of dogs from other geographic areas, could outweigh the effects of a sterilization program. CONCLUSIONS: A program's effectiveness is contingent upon not only on the sterilization rate, but also the rate of population growth. Sterilization campaigns may potentially reduce population density, but this reduction may not be immediately evident.",M1
19448911,"Access to surgical <e>sterilization</e> through the National Health System, Ribeirão Preto, Southeastern Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the profile of individuals who were unable to obtain the surgical contraception procedure, and associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ribeirão Preto (Southeastern Brazil) in 2004, on 230 individuals who were unable to obtain sterilization surgery through the National Health System between 1999 and 2004. A questionnaire on sociodemographic information, use of contraceptive methods, aspects of sterilization and desire to undergo sterilization in the future was applied. The variables of sex, age, religion, per capita income, marital status and schooling level were compared between the total number of individuals who were unable to obtain this procedure and 297 individuals who were sterilized. RESULTS: Among the 230 interviewees, 21.3% were men and 78.7% were women. Most of them were married, white and Catholic and had had at least four years of schooling. The median monthly per capita income was R$ 140.00. Twenty-three of them (10%) had hopes of undergoing the operation. The remaining 207 were classified in two groups: 71% had decided to postpone the operation and 29% had faced obstacles in relation to gaining access to sterilization. The latter group was associated with being female, young and black. After logistic regression, being black was the only factor that remained associated with inability to obtain sterilization. Comparison with individuals who were able to obtain the procedure showed that being female, older, evangelical and single were associated with inability to obtain sterilization, while higher income and schooling levels favored access. CONCLUSIONS: Few of the individuals studied had not had access to sterilization. Most had postponed the procedure and a smaller proportion had encountered institutional obstacles. Blacks encountered more barriers than whites did.",M1
19438163,"Placement of a permanent birth control device at a university medical center.OBJECTIVE: To determine the Essure placement failure rate and analyze factors associated with failure in an urban, nonstudy population at a university medical center. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted of women who underwent attempted Essure hysteroscopic <e>sterilization</e> at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) from January 1, 2003, to June 30, 2007. RESULTS: There were 316 Essure procedures attempted at the DMC from January 2003 through June 2007. Of the 316 attempted procedures, there were 22 device placement failures and 3 documented post-Essure pregnancies. Of the 22 placement failures, 11 were attributed to difficulty visualizing the tubal ostia. Other causes of failure included device malfunction, uterine perforation, tubal perforation, expulsion of the device, tubal spasm, tubal ostia too large for the device and unspecified. Difficulty visualizing the ostia (p &lt; 0.001) and a longer procedure time (p = 0.008) were significantly associated with failure. CONCLUSION: The rate of successful placement of the Essure permanent birth control device at the DMC is 92.1%, with a post-Essure pregnancy rate of 0.95%. The majority of placement failures may be attributed to difficulty visualizing the tubal ostia.",M1
19412802,"Hysteroscopic female <e>sterilization</e> with Essure in an outpatient setting.The aim of this study is to evaluate the short and long-term results of hysteroscopic sterilization in an outpatient setting. Sixty-one women underwent hysteroscopic sterilization. At follow-up, all of the women were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning possible pregnancy, bleeding patterns, side-effects, or need for further therapy after sterilization. Technical feasibility, complications, patient satisfaction, and tubal occlusion based on X-ray or ultrasound were measured. Fifty-eight (95%) women were sterilized according to this method. Successful bilateral device placement was achieved in 52 women (85%) during the first attempt and in six (9.8%) during the second. A total of 50 (81.9%) women submitted completed outcome questionnaires. The mean follow-up period was 23 (range 7-67) months. No pregnancies were reported. All questionnaire respondents expressed overall satisfaction with the procedure. To conclude, Essure sterilization is a safe effective method for female sterilization that is feasible in the outpatient setting.",M1
19410494,"[Essure implants for tubal sterilisation in France]OBJECTIVES: Law no. 2001-588 of 4 July 2001 liberalised the practice of tubal sterilisation in France, at the same time as a new hysteroscopic method of female <e>sterilization</e> appeared. The growth of this method has been spurred by the reduced need for analgesia, absence of incision and scar, reduced duration of hospitalization and diminution of costs. The aim of this study was to analyse the use of the Essure procedure in France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre study covered seven French facilities from January 2004 through June 2006. This study included 1061 attempted placements of the Essure micro-insert, marketed by Conceptus SAS (France). RESULTS: The first placement attempt was successful in 992 cases (94.4%). The success rate for second attempts was 59% (n = 23). Mean VAS was 3,23 +/- 0.19. Ninety-three percent of patients undergoing Essure placement were satisfied or very satisfied. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Tubal sterilisation with Essure micro-inserts is a reliable and reproducible method that requires a short period of training. In the future, the hysteroscopic pathway will replace the laparoscopic route.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twenty-five patients had routine radiologic and transvaginal 3D ultrasound (Voluson 730 Expert) 3 months after placement of Essure micro-insert. RESULTS: Twenty-one 3D acquisitions were realized. In all cases, the micro-insert are easily visualized. Ideally, the echogenic micro-insert appears in the cornuale portion of the fallopian tube. The relationship between the micro insert and the uterine cavity is well documented. CONCLUSION: Easy-to-use, good reproducibility, absence of radiation, make the 3D ultrasound an interesting alternative for the 3-month check. The coronal view gives a directly exploitable document for the surgeon.",M1
19394863,"Contraceptive choices of women 35-44 years of age: findings from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system.PURPOSE: With an estimated 3.1 million unintended pregnancies in the United States each year, patterns of contraceptive use have significant public health importance. Little literature has focused on these patterns in women over age 35. METHODS: Using data from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we conducted a population-based analysis of 22,890 women between the ages of 35-44 years who completed information on family planning. Lifestyle, demographic, and medical history covariates were assessed and multinomial logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Female <e>sterilization</e> was the most popular contraceptive method among women aged 35-44 years (28.5%). Relative to non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women were less likely to use effective methods of contraception such as male sterilization (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.46; and OR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.16, respectively) and oral contraceptives (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.73; and OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.57, respectively) after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although fecundity is reduced in women of this age group, increased rates of maternal and fetal complications make unintended pregnancies riskier. This study demonstrates opportunities for targeted counseling and increased awareness of the diversity of contraceptive choices for older women.",M1

The study adopted a qualitative approach in four municipalities (counties), where semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 health professionals and health services managers involved in the provision of surgical sterilization. The interviewees identified difficulties in scheduling visits at Outpatient Family Clinics or Reference Centers (APF/CR), and the number of available surgeries in the accredited hospitals was insufficient. They emphasized the lack of physical infrastructure and human resources for conducting family planning activities in the primary health units as well as in the APF/CR.They also criticized the legal criteria for authorizing surgical sterilization, and mentioned adaptations to make them more appropriate to the each municipality's situation. According to the health services managers and professionals, despite the efforts, meeting the demand for surgical sterilization in the Campinas Metropolitan Area was jeopardized by its centralization in the APF/CR, which in practice had to cover the gap in family planning activities in each municipality's primary care units.",M1

Responses to the falling birth rate in Norway, c. 1900-1940.This paper focuses on initiatives to improve infant health, as they developed in Norway especially during the interwar period. Falling birth rates were felt as a menace to the survival of the nation and specific initiatives were taken to oppose it. But crises engendered by the reduction in fertility strengthened opportunities for introducing policies to help the fewer children born survive and grow up to become healthy citizens. Legislation supporting mothers started in 1892 increased in the interwar years including economic features.

INTERVENTION(S): The patient underwent hysteroscopic placement of Essure microinserts, which was complicated by inability to confirm intraluminal placement of the left implant by hysteroscopic visualization. A CT scan performed that day confirmed intraluminal placement and ruled out intraperitoneal placement of the insert. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Confirmation of correct insert placement. RESULT(S): A CT scan confirmed the placement of the Essure insert within the fallopian tube lumen and excluded perforation into the peritoneal cavity. CONCLUSION(S): Computed tomography is a reliable way to determine whether Essure microinserts are properly placed when this cannot be determined by hysteroscopic visualization. Follow-up hysterosalpingography continues to be required to confirm tissue ingrowth at 3 months' time.",M1

METHODS: This study used national, cross-sectional data collected by the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Our analysis included women aged 18-44 years who had heterosexual intercourse within the past 12 months, who were not actively seeking to get pregnant, and who had not undergone surgical sterilization. The primary outcome was receipt of family planning services within the past 12 months. Specific services we examined were (1) provision of or prescription for a method of birth control, (2) checkup related to using birth control, (3) counseling about sterilization, and (4) counseling about birth control. RESULTS: Although we found no racial/ethnic differences in the overall use of family planning services, there were racial/ethnic differences in the specific type of service received. Hispanic and black women were more likely than white women to receive counseling for birth control (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 1.8, and adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7, respectively). Hispanic women were more likely than white women to report having been counseled about sterilization (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0, 2.3). CONCLUSIONS: Minority women were more likely to receive counseling about sterilization and other birth control methods. However, there were no differences in access to family planning services by race or ethnicity. Future studies are needed to examine the quality and content of contraceptive counseling received by minority compared with nonminority women.",M1
18973884,"Quinacrine <e>sterilization</e> for human immunodeficiency virus-positive women.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of nonsurgical quinacrine sterilization for HIV-positive (HIV+) women. DESIGN: An open trial of quinacrine sterilization was carried out in women infected with HIV and women who were HIV negative (HIV-). Comparison of the results with the two groups provided an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of quinacrine sterilization for HIV+ women. SETTING: University Medical School outpatient services. PATIENT(S): A total of 258 women who desired sterilization were offered quinacrine sterilization as a means of limiting family size. Sixty-four were HIV+, and 194 were HIV-. Women who were HIV+ had CD4 counts &gt;200 and were otherwise healthy. INTERVENTION(S): A modified Copper T intrauterine device inserter was used to place 252 mg of quinacrine, divided into seven pellets (36 mg each) into the uterine cavity. Three insertions of this formulation were performed, 1 month apart. Viral load and CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes were measured both before and after quinacrine sterilization and at follow-up visits. Pregnancies and adverse events were recorded carefully. A decrement life table was made to statistically analyze results. RESULT(S) AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): No serious adverse event occurred in any patient in this study. Adverse effects related to quinacrine sterilization were abdominal cramping, vulvar itching, nausea, and vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding was the only short-term side effect noted to occur more frequently in HIV-infected women after quinacrine sterilization. Among HIV+ women, 35.9% had complaints of increased bleeding, whereas only 8.2% of those who were HIV- had such complaints, which probably were insertion related. Viral load and the CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte measures displayed no statistically significant difference after quinacrine sterilization. CONCLUSION(S): Quinacrine sterilization is a safe method for the sterilization of HIV-infected women and has no short-term effect on the pathology of the disease.",M1
18930195,"Clinical factors determining pregnancy outcome after microsurgical tubal reanastomosis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pregnancy rates after tubal microsurgical anastomosis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Private tertiary care center. PATIENT(S): Two hundred sixty-one women undergoing tubal microsurgical anastomosis. INTERVENTION(S): Tubal anastomoses were performed by minilaparotomy using microsurgical principles and approximating proximal and distal tubal ends in a two-layer technique with 8-0 ethylon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy outcome was analyzed for the technique of <e>sterilization</e>, location of anastomosis, tubal length, age, and semen parameters. RESULT(S): After exclusion of 89 patients lost to follow-up (34%) and 8 who did not attempt to conceive, 164 of the 261 patients were analyzed.The overall intrauterine pregnancy rate was 72.5%, with a miscarriage rate of 18% and a tubal pregnancy rate of 7.7%. Related to age, the cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rate was, respectively, 81%, 67%, 50%, and 12.5% for patients &lt;36, 36-40, 40-43, and &gt;43 years. Mean time to pregnancy was respectively 6.9, 6.2, and 12.7 months, respectively, for patients aged &lt;36, 36-39, and 40-43 years According to the type of sterilization, intrauterine pregnancies occurred in 72% after ring sterilization, 78% after clip sterilization, 68% after coagulation, and 67% after Pomeroy sterilization. Intrauterine pregnancies and ectopic pregnancies, respectively, occurred in 80% and 3.4% in the isthmo-isthmic, 63% and 18% in the isthmo-ampullar, 75% and 8.3% in the isthmo-cornual, 100% and 0% in the ampullo-ampullar, and 60% and 0% in the ampullo-cornual anastomosis groups. Tubal length after anastomosis did not influence the pregnancy rate. In case of fertile sperm, the pregnancy rate was found to be 80%, and it decreased to 50% in case of subfertile semen.

18847579,"Why are rates of <e>sterilization</e> in decline? A pilot study designed to explore reasons for declining female sterilization in Scotland.BACKGROUND: In the last decade, female sterilization had been in decline throughout the UK. It is not clear whether fewer women are requesting sterilization or whether the universal enthusiasm for long-acting reversible methods is leading health professionals to discourage women from being sterilized. Since correct and consistent use of alternative, reversible contraceptive methods depends somewhat on their acceptability, it is important to determine whether women are being refused sterilization or whether they are freely choosing other methods. This study aims to explore whether female sterilization is being widely considered as a contraceptive method, the reasons for choosing or rejecting it, and whether women are being discouraged by health professionals from being sterilized. STUDY DESIGN: A self-completed questionnaire survey among 205 women aged 30 to 50 years who felt that their family was complete attending a family planning clinic in Scotland. RESULTS: Of the 203 women included in the study, 151 (74.4%) had heard of female sterilization, 90 had discussed it with someone (60%) and 87 (58%) had considered it as a contraceptive option. Of the 56 women who consulted their family doctor about sterilization, almost half (27; 48%) were not referred to a hospital and fewer than one (17, 30.4%) in three of them was eventually sterilized or had arrangements in place to get it done. Free-text comments from the women revealed a variety of reasons for not choosing female sterilization and suggested that some women are being deterred from sterilization. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that some women are being actively encouraged by health professionals to use long-acting reversible contraceptive methods and discouraged from choosing sterilization. However, other women recognize for themselves the wisdom of keeping their fertility options open.",M1
18829011,"Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), its receptor, and macrophages in the perifollicular stroma during the human ovulatory process.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression and localization of the macrophage-specific chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), and macrophages (CD68) in the perifollicular stroma of different phases of the human ovulatory process and its relation to macrophage influx. DESIGN: Experimental study on patient-controlled material. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty-eight women planned to undergo laparoscopic <e>sterilization</e>. INTERVENTION(S): Surgery was performed at either of four distinct ovulatory phases, and a biopsy sample was obtained from the perifollicular stroma of the ovulatory follicle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used for measurements of MCP-1, CCR2, and macrophages. RESULT(S): The messenger RNA levels of MCP-1 in the perifollicular stroma increased from the preovulatory to the late ovulatory phase and declined during the postovulatory phase. A higher density of macrophages was found in the preovulatory and early ovulatory phases compared with late and postovulatory phases. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and CCR2 were present in the stroma. Protein expression of CD68 and CCR2 were identified in the four ovulatory phases. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates an upregulation of MCP-1 in the stroma compartment around the human follicle during the ovulatory process, and a high density of macrophages was found at earlier phases. Thus, inflammation-like reactions are integral in the ovulatory process and may be targeted to stimulate or inhibit this process.",M1

18573050,"Female <e>sterilization</e>.There has been considerable development and implementation of new contraceptive methods over the last 15 years. However, sterilization has remained the most widely used method around the world. Ideally, the procedure should be safe, have a high efficacy, be readily accessible, and be personally and culturally acceptable. The cost for each procedure would be low and the method would be simple, quick, easily learned and be able to be performed in an outpatient setting without general anesthesia. A transuterine method of female sterilization has long been the ideal for the gynecologist. The Essure system fulfils many of the criteria, and is the first one to be approved by the US FDA. However, there is still a need for further research to find a device with the success rate of the Essure but without its irreversibility.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study of 2735 women who had quinacrine insertions between 1989 and 1993 compared to 1623 women who received an intrauterine device (IUD). RESULTS: Cumulative follow-up times for the quinacrine and IUD cohorts were 28,697 and 17,382 person-years, respectively, and losses to follow-up were 6% and 7%, respectively. Quinacrine users had a higher incidence of ectopic pregnancy compared to IUD users (risk ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.54); the risks of cancer, hysterectomy, pelvic/gynecologic surgery and death were similar in the two groups. Two quinacrine insertions appeared to lower the risk of ectopic pregnancy to that of surgical tubal occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Use of quinacrine in this cohort appeared to have minimal health risks. Other research, including preclinical studies, needs to be considered in an overall evaluation of whether the combination of safety and efficacy provide a basis for quinacrine's approval by appropriate regulatory agencies.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study of 1335 women who received two quinacrine insertions between 1989 and 1993. RESULTS: About 90% of the study population participated in the last round of interviews. Cumulative follow-up time for this cohort was 14,294 person-years. The 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative pregnancy probabilities for quinacrine were 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4-4.3), 10.0% (95% CI, 8.4-11.6) and 12.1% (95% CI, 10.4-13.9), respectively. Pregnancy estimates with quinacrine in this cohort were higher than that reported from US-based research on surgical tubal sterilization and higher than results of quinacrine sterilization in Chile. Quinacrine effectiveness was better among older women. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of quinacrine in Vietnam was lower than other forms of sterilization.

This procedure has been available since 2003 in both Europe and North America. We present our experience of the first 12 cases of the procedure performed in Israel. METHODS: Women who have completed their family planning were offered to consider Essure as their permanent contraception. The procedure was performed without anesthesia by the vaginoscopic technique at the hospital's outpatient clinic. Patients completed a questionnaire and were discharged immediately following the procedure. A follow-up checkup was completed after three months including three dimensional sonography, abdominal X-ray and occasional hysterosalpingogram. RESULTS: Twelve patients participated in the pilot group at Hadassah. The average age was 40 years (34-45) and the average number of children was 5 (4-8). The average time for the procedure was under 8 minutes. Periostial adhesions required adhesiolysis prior to insertion of the device in one patient. All patients resumed their normal activity on the same day. Our patient satisfaction survey revealed that the procedure was associated with high satisfaction levels. Sonographic and radiographic studies confirmed the good placement of the device. DISCUSSION: The Essure procedure was well tolerated by patients. The limitation is probably going to be the price of Essure, as this procedure is not covered by the 'health basket' in Israel.",M1
18239065,"German science and black racism--roots of the Nazi Holocaust.The Nazi's cornerstone precept of  racial hygiene  gave birth to their policy of  racial cleansing  that led to the murders of millions. It was developed by German physicians and scientists in the late 19th century and is rooted in the period's Social Darwinism that placed blacks at the bottom of the racial ladder. This program was first manifested in the near-extermination of the African Herero people during the German colonial period. After WWI, the fear among the German populace that occupying African troops and their Afro-German children would lead to  bastardization  of the German people formed a unifying racial principle that the Nazis exploited.

A retrospective multicenter survey]OBJECTIVE: To assess the satisfaction and recovery of women undergoing sterilization with a permanent birth control device (Essure micro-insert). PATIENTS AND METHODS: French multicenter survey carried out in 12 public and private hospitals. One thousand and thirty-two patients undergoing permanent hysteroscopic sterilization (Essure micro-insert) between 2002 and 2006 were enrolled. An anonymous satisfaction questionnaire was sent to all patients. Demographic data as well as the level of tolerance and acceptability of the procedure were analyzed. Seven hundred and two (68%) patients responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of all procedures were done without anaesthesia, and 55% under local or general anaesthesia or neuroleptanalgesia. Mean age was 42 years. Sterilization was a personal decision in 62% of cases. Only one out of three women (33%) was informed of the law of sterilization's legalization. Patients came to know about this procedure by their gynecologist (74%), or by media (14%). Eighty-four percent of patients considered the level of tolerance during the procedure from no pain to moderate pain. The method without anesthaesia is described painless in 24% of cases when the surgeon has done more than 50 procedures versus 11% when he has done less than 50 (P = 0.012). Seventy-seven percent of patients were appreciative of following the procedure on the monitor screen. Patients returned to everyday life within 24 h in 90% of cases, whereas 24 h return to work was attained in 75%. The procedure without general anesthesia offered a quicker return to work (80% within 24 h) than the procedure carried out with general anesthesia (59%, P &lt; 0.05). The memory of the procedure was described as  very good  to  acceptable  in 96% of cases. Most of the patients (98%) would recommend this procedure to their friends. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results of this national survey confirm that hysteroscopic sterilization is associated with good overall satisfaction, because it is a fast, easy and safe method of permanent sterilization with good levels of tolerance and immediate recovery. The technique without anaesthesia is now recommended. Its tolerance is improved with surgeon's experience.",M1
18165410,"<e>Sterilization</e>.Worldwide, sterilization (tubal sterilization and vasectomy) is used by more people than any other method of contraception. All techniques of tubal sterilization in widespread use in the United States have low risks of surgical complications. Although tubal sterilization is highly effective, the risk of pregnancy varies by age and method of occlusion. Pregnancies can occur many years after the procedure, and when they do, the risk of ectopic gestation is high. There is now strong evidence against the existence of a post-tubal ligation syndrome of menstrual abnormalities. Although women who have undergone tubal sterilization are more likely than other women to undergo hysterectomy subsequently, there is no known biologic basis for this relationship. Although sterilization is intended to be permanent, expressions of regret and requests for reversal are not uncommon and are much more likely to occur among women sterilized at young ages. Tubal sterilization has little or no effect on sexual function for most women. Vasectomy is less likely than tubal sterilization to result in serious complications. Minor complications, however, are not uncommon. Vasectomy does not increase the risk of heart disease, and available evidence argues against an increase in the risk of prostate cancer, testicular cancer, or overall mortality. Whether a postvasectomy pain syndrome exists remains controversial. Although the long-term effectiveness of vasectomy is less well-studied than that for tubal sterilization, it seems likely to be at least as effective. Intrauterine devices and progestin implants are long-acting, highly effective alternatives to sterilization.",M1

To what extent? Who in the end was responsible? Sterilization practices targeted underprivileged people first. The mentally retarded and women were their first victims. Operations were very frequently determined by other people's manipulative or coercive influences. Should the blame be put on the Social-Democrats in power throughout the period (except in Finland and Estonia)? Apart from Denmark, perhaps, local physicians and local services, more than governments, seemed to have strongly supported sterilization practices. Teetotalers and feminists shared responsibilities. How can one explain that eugenics finally declined? Based on a sound application of the Hardy-Weinberg law, the science of the eugenicists was correct. Was it politics? But uncovering of the Nazi crimes had only a very small impact on eugenics. Some authors underline the fact that the Nordic scientific institutions were particularly suited to liberal values.

We examine women's feelings and attitudes regarding a canceled or postponed procedure over time. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted structured, in-depth baseline interviews with 34 postpartum women with unfulfilled sterilization requests in a university hospital setting. Follow-up phone interviews were conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. RESULTS: Reasons for unfulfilled sterilization requests included last-minute misgivings, maternal medical complications, lack of a valid Medicaid consent form, fear of the procedure and provider influence. Sense of autonomy regarding sterilization decision making and ability to obtain interval sterilization or initiate and/or successfully use reversible contraception influenced subsequent attitudes regarding an unfulfilled request. CONCLUSIONS: Sterilization counseling should include comprehensive information regarding the surgical procedure and associated risks and the development of a backup contraceptive plan, with particular emphasis on increasing contraceptive self-efficacy and autonomy in sterilization decision making.",M1

METHODS: This study was based on the data from the Korea National Fertility Survey carried out in the year 2000 by the Korea Institute of Health and Social Affairs. The subjects of the analysis were 4,604 women and their husbands who were in their first marriage, in the age group of 15-49 years. The data were analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Consistent with the findings of previous studies, the woman's age and the number of total children increased the likelihood of sterilization. In addition, the year of marriage had a strong positive association with sterilization. Interestingly, the number of surviving sons tended to increase the likelihood of sterilization, whereas the woman's education level and age at the time of marriage showed a negative association with sterilization. Religion, place of residence, son preference, and the husband's education level, age and type of occupation were not significant determinants of sterilization. CONCLUSIONS: The sex of previous children and lower level of education are distinct determinants of sterilization among women in South Korea.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the new copayment system on female sterilization epidemiology. METHODS: We retrieved data on all female sterilizations 1999-2005 (N = 23 1333) from the Norwegian Patient Register, an administrative register to which it is mandatory for all hospitals to report. Sterilizations with diagnostic codes indicative of vaginal delivery, caesarean section, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and termination of pregnancy were analyzed separately. All other sterilizations were defined as  interval sterilization . RESULTS: An abrupt fall in female sterilization was observed after the raise in copayment. Age-adjusted incidence rates dropped from 6.3-6.8 per 1000 women in 1999-2001 to 2.2-2.3 per 1000 women during 2002-2005. Interval sterilizations dropped to 25% of the previous level after the rise in copayment while sterilizations in conjunction with caesarean section and postpartum sterilization remained constant.

Baseline owned dog population structure as well as the annual number of births, adoptions, abandonments, and purchases were estimated based on regional managed kennel data in addition to a telephone questionnaire administered to members of the local population. Age- and gender-dependent death rates were based on domestic dog life tables. The model predicts that at the current female dog sterilization rate of 30%, the owned dog population will most probably continue to increase. After 20 years, a mean annual increase of 2.6% (median: 2.5%, 95% CI: -3.2% to 8.8%) is projected assuming that the average age at sterilization is 3 years. A sterilization rate of at least 55% is estimated to be needed to halt population growth if the current age structure for female dog sterilization is maintained. However, if the province of Teramo were to focus on sterilizing female dogs less than 1 year of age, the required sterilization rate to arrest population growth could be reduced to as low as 26%.",M1

As a concept subject to interpretation, a broad conception of medical necessity could enable an ample use of the therapeutic exception and a liberal use of both surgeries. The practice of therapeutic sterilization has been generalized in Costa Rica and has become the legitimate way to distribute contraceptive sterilization. In contrast, therapeutic abortion is very rarely practiced. The analysis carried out proposes that it is the difference in social acceptance of abortion and sterilization that explains the different use that doctors, as gatekeepers of social morality, make of medical necessity.",M1

Women requesting sterilization should be encouraged to discuss their decision and associated issues with their husbands or other appropriate intimate partners. The physician who objects to a patient's request for sterilization solely as a matter of conscience has the obligation to inform the patient that sterilization services may be available elsewhere and should refer the patient to another caregiver. The presence of mental capacity does not, in itself, justify either sterilization or its denial.

METHODS: Sterilization was performed 45 days after a single bilateral intratesticular injection of calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) at the doses of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg per testis per kg body weight. RESULTS: Histomorphological measures of testes showed total necrosis of testicular tissue at 45 days after an injection of either 10 or 15 or 20 mg CaCl(2) along with fibrosis and hyalinization in seminiferous tubules and interstitial spaces. Infiltration of leucocytes was also observed with the 10- or 15-mg dose. Disintegration of germ cell arrangement in seminiferous tubules and washing out of germ cells from the tubules were noted with the 5-mg dose. Relative organ weight, epididymal sperm count, plasma and intratesticular concentrations of testosterone, testicular activities of Delta(5),3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Delta(5),3beta-HSD), 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and testicular contents of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulphide (GSSG) and the ratio of GSH/GSSG, all were declined in each of the calcium chloride treated groups in comparison to the control group. Increases occurred in testicular malondialdehyde (MDA) and plasma concentrations of LH and FSH with each of the treatments by comparison with the control group. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, fasting blood sugar level, blood urea nitrogen as well as packed cell volume (PCV) and total plasma protein were recorded to monitor the changes in chronic stress in the experimental animals. Changes in these parameters were not significant. CONCLUSION: An intratesticular injection of CaCl(2) at specified doses could be a suitable method of sterilization in preference to surgical castration of dogs.",M1

The majority of gynecologists also think that voluntary sterilization should become available in Serbia. Most of them consider therapeutic and eugenic reasons as appropriate for surgical sterilization. However, gynecologists lack current knowledge about this contraceptive method, and would not accept to use voluntary sterilization themselves.

(ii) Efficacy of a hysteroscopically placed micro-insert device: no pregnancies were observed in patients with bilateral tube obstruction diagnosed by hysterosalpingography at 3 or at 6 months after placement (placement rate: 87-89%). (iii) Safety of tubal ligation, electrocoagulation, clips or rings: (a) By approach: There was no difference in the incidence of major complications between laparoscopy and minilaparotomy but there were significantly fewer minor complications with laparoscopy than with minilaparotomy. There were significantly more major complications with culdoscopy than with minilaparotomy and significantly more minor complications than with laparoscopy. (b) By operative technique: major and minor complications were significantly more common with the Pomeroy technique than with electrocoagulation; the difference could be due to the approach used. No data were available on fimbriectomy. (iv) Safety of a hysteroscopically placed micro-insert device: there were 11 cases of myometrial or tubal perforation among 734 patients (with device displacement into the peritoneal cavity in 3 cases). RESULTS (MALE STERILIZATION): (i) Efficacy: efficacy varied from 84% to 100% depending on the approach and the mode of vas deferens obstruction. There was no significant difference in efficacy according to approach (transcutaneous or scrotal). However, no conclusion could be drawn on the comparative efficacy of the occlusion techniques used from published data. (ii) Safety: the rate of postoperative complications was low, below 10% in most series. Complications were benign and only rarely necessitated surgical revision. CONCLUSION: The advantage of sterilization methods is that they lack any permanent contraindication. They should be presented as being generally irreversible. Fimbriectomy is not recommended for female sterilization. Laparoscopy is the preferred approach. Sterilization by hysteroscopic placement of a micro-insert device should be restricted to cases presenting a risk on laparoscopy; the technique should be re-assessed in 2006. The two approaches used for male sterilization are technically similar and do not seem to differ in efficacy. The Public Health Code states that  Fallopian tube or deferens duct ligation for contraceptive purposes is not allowed in minors  and that ligation  cannot be performed unless the adult involved has given his/her informed and motivated consent, expressed after taking into consideration clear, complete information on the consequences of the procedure . A waiting period of four months must follow the moment the decision to sterilize is taken and consent is given. An informed consent form must be signed. Sterilization in young or nulliparous women should be proposed with the greatest prudence and with many reservations.",M1
16922243,"Dynamics of hybridization and introgression in red wolves and coyotes.Hybridization and introgression are significant causes of endangerment in many taxa and are considered the greatest biological threats to the reintroduced population of red wolves (Canis rufus) in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Little is known, however, about these processes in red wolves and coyotes (C. latrans). We used individual-based simulations to examine the process of hybridization and introgression between these species. Under the range of circumstances we considered, red wolves in colonizing and established populations were quickly extirpated, persisted near the carrying capacity, or had intermediate outcomes. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the probabilities of quasi extinction and persistence of red wolves near the carrying capacity were most affected by the strength of two reproductive barriers: red wolf challenges and assortative mating between red wolves and coyotes. Because model parameters for these barriers may be difficult to estimate, we also sought to identify other predictors of red wolf population fate. The proportion of pure red wolves in the population was a strong predictor of the future probabilities of red wolf quasi extinction and persistence. Finally, we examined whether <e>sterilization</e> can be effective in minimizing introgression while allowing the reintroduced red wolfpopulation to grow. Our results suggest sterilization can be an effective short-term strategy to reduce the likelihood of extirpation in colonizing populations of red wolves. Whether red wolf numbers are increased by sterilization depends on the level of sterilization effort and the acting reproductive barriers. Our results provide an outline of the conditions likely required for successful reestablishment and long-term maintenance of populations of wild red wolves in the presence of coyotes. Our modeling approach may prove generally useful in providing insight into situations involving complex species interactions when data are few.",M1
16895828,"Medicalization, reproductive agency, and the desire for surgical <e>sterilization</e> among low-income women in urban Brazil.This article draws on data from ethnographic fieldwork in an urban housing project to examine the social context and meanings of surgical sterilization for low-income women in Brazil. Low-income women resort to sterilization because they distrust or are unsatisfied with alternative methods and because it helps them to fulfill the requirements of modern, responsible motherhood. Although sterilization is an option among few alternatives, and one that has subjected women to greater medical management and intervention, I argue that sterilization also represents poor women's active struggle to improve their lives and to resist the burdens placed on them by unequal gender relations. This article contributes to a growing anthropological literature that demonstrates how reproduction has become a central site where social values are constituted and contested, and it details women's diverse responses to the process of medicalization.",M1

One hundred and twenty-six new dog owners were recruited from 15 animal clinics across Taiwan and were successfully followed up for 3-8 months. Among them, 66 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the other 60 were in the control group. At the end of the study, 22 had their dogs sterilized and 23 reported having an unsuccessful dog ownership. The educational intervention did not affect the owners' decisions to sterilize their dogs (hazard rate ratio (HRR) for the intervention group against control group=0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.4, 1.3). We found a heterogeneous effect of the applied education on the rate of unsuccessful dog ownership. The intervention group had a higher rate of unsuccessful ownership than the control group in the first 4 months of their ownership (HRR=19.2, 95% CI=4.6, 79.7), and the effect reversed after 4 months (HRR=0.5, 95% CI=0.2, 1.1).",M1
16857656,"Contraception for the older woman: an update.Although fertility declines with advancing age as the woman approaches the menopause, some risk of pregnancy persists, and effective contraception needs to be offered to avoid an unintended pregnancy. An older woman may have menstrual dysfunction or climacteric symptoms and these factors would need consideration when making the choice of contraception. Low-estrogen dose combined oral contraceptives may be prescribed to healthy non-smoking women up to about 50 years of age. The progestogen-only pill may be an appropriate option in an older woman with declining fertility.

The influence of religion at both individual and district levels was examined, and a multi-level modelling methodology was used for assessing community variations in the influence of religion on the adoption of sterilization. Individual religion was a strong predictor of the decision to adopt sterilization, and residence in a district in which more than 20% of the people were Muslims significantly lowered the odds of adoption of sterilization. There was more variation in the adoption of sterilization between districts for Muslim women and women from minority religious groups. The results demonstrate the influence of community conservatism on the choice of contraceptive methods and point to the mediating effects that community characteristics can have on access to sterilization services for women from religious minority sub-groups.",M1
16781262,"Contraception after medical abortion.OBJECTIVES: This study's objectives were to examine current evidence on contraception after abortion and to formulate guidelines for the use of different contraceptives after medical abortion based on current evidence. METHODS: This study was based on review of published literature and guidelines on postabortion use of contraception. RESULTS: Contraception needs to be initiated early following a first-trimester abortion. Postabortion family planning is an integral part of comprehensive abortion care. Concurrent contraception with surgical abortion has been found to be practical and effective, with high contraception usage following abortion. Most methods can be safely used following medical abortion and can be initiated either on the day of misoprostol administration (oral pills, condoms and injectable contraceptives) or after the next menstrual cycle (intrauterine device and <e>sterilization</e>). CONCLUSION: With proper precautions, almost all contraceptive methods can be effectively used following medical abortion.",M1
16777610,"[Abuse of caesarean delivery in Brazil: geographic dimensions of a medical aberration] Brazil is the world champion of caesareans.  This prowess points out a serious public health problem. While the increase in the percentage of caesareans among all deliveries is an international phenomenon, it is highest by far in Brazil, where caesareans account for nearly 40% of births, that is, three times the maximum recommended by WHO. This abusive practice appears pandemic and has spread in recent years throughout the entire country, although at divergent rates. It weighs heavily on Brazil's national health insurance fund. After a critical examination of the information sources related to births, we analyze successively the principal factors likely to explain this abuse: level of development, emergence of family planning and the association of caesarean delivery with tubal ligation for <e>sterilization</e> purposes, and tension within the healthcare system, especially the role of private physicians in urban areas. By studying these aspects of the problem in their geographic dimensions, we find important regional differences that must be considered in defining policies to limit this excess.",M1
16762087,"Skewed contraceptive method mix: why it happens, why it matters.Contraceptive prevalence has been central to family planning research over the past few decades, but researchers have given surprisingly little consideration to method mix, a proxy for method availability or choice. There is no 'ideal' method mix recognized by the international community; however, there may be reason for concern when one or two methods predominate in a given country. In this article method skew is operationally defined as a single method constituting 50% or more of contraceptive use in a given country. Of 96 countries examined in this analysis, 34 have this type of skewed method mix. These 34 countries cluster in three groups: (1) sixteen countries in which traditional methods dominate, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) four countries in which female <e>sterilization</e> predominates (India, Brazil, Dominican Republic and Panama); and (3) fourteen countries that rely on a single reversible method (the pill in Algeria, Kuwait, Liberia, Morocco, Sudan and Zimbabwe; the IUD in Cuba, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan; and the injectable in Malawi). A review of available literature on method choice in these countries provides substantial insight into the different patterns of method skew. Method skew in some countries reflects cultural preferences or social norms. Yet it becomes problematic if it stems from restrictive population policies, lack of access to a broad range of methods, or provider bias.",M1
16757019,"Non-surgical methods of contraception and <e>sterilization</e>.The Humane Society of the United States estimates that each year between 8 and 10 million dogs and cats enter shelters and 4-5 million of these animals are euthanized due to lack of homes. Many veterinarians within the United States recommend surgical sterilization for population control in dogs and cats. However, there are non-surgical methods to control reproduction. Pharmacologic methods of contraception and sterilization can be safe, reliable and reversible. Hormonal treatments using progestins, androgens, or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs act to either directly block reproductive hormone receptor-mediated events, or indirectly block conception via negative feedback mechanisms. Immunocontraception, via vaccination against GnRH, the luteinizing hormone receptor or zona pellucida proteins, is also possible. Intratesticular or intraepididymal injections provide a method for non-surgical sterilization of the male dog and cat. Additional methods have been employed for mechanical disruption of fertility including intravaginal and intrauterine devices and ultrasound testicular ablation. Alternative approaches to surgical sterilization will be reviewed.",M1

Safety issues regarding the carcinogenic potential of quinacrine have been raised because it is mutagenic and clastogenic in vitro. The objective of the study was to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of quinacrine dihydrochloride (quinacrine) in neonatal mice treated with single intraperitoneal doses on postpartum days 8 and 15 and observed for 52 weeks. Neonatal Crl: CD-1 mice of each sex were randomly allocated into four treatment groups (0, 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg), dosed twice with quinacrine suspended in carboxymethylcellulose, observed for 52 weeks post dose, and then euthanized, necropsied, and subjected to a full histopathological examination. In male mice, tumor incidence was not significantly increased at any site at any dose level. In female mice, the incidence of benign uterine endometrial stromal polyps was slightly greater at the mid and high dose (&gt; or = 50 mg/kg), as was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia. The incidence of polyps in these groups was not significantly greater than in controls by pair-wise comparison but was significantly greater (p = .042) by the linear trend test. The authors conclude that quinacrine administered twice to neonatal mice may have enhanced or accelerated the development of endometrial hyperplasia and uterine stromal polyps at higher doses. Because uterine stromal polyps are a commonly observed benign tumor in older mice, the significance of this finding is unclear and will require a weight of evidence evaluation for a conclusion on the carcinogenic potential of quinacrine.",M1

METHODS: Sterilization and complications were studied in 124 consecutive patients. RESULTS: Successful sterilization, defined by azoospermia at 10 to 14 months, was observed in 116 of 119 subjects. The effectiveness seemed to be equivalent to that of vasectomy. The incidence of postoperative pain and hematoma formation was similar to that with standard methods. The Vasclip procedure had similar infection rates and seemed to have lower rates of sperm granuloma when compared with vasectomy. In 3 subjects with persistent presence of sperm, histologic examination after traditional vasectomy indicated that misalignment of the device led to partial vas incision with recanalization. Patient acceptability was high: of the clinical study patients, 99% of survey respondents would recommend that other men considering a vasectomy have the Vasclip procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The Vasclip implant procedure represents a new, effective, office-based alternative to vasectomy. Physicians' benefits can include reduced procedural time and reduction of postprocedural complications. Potential patients' benefits include reduced risk of postoperative infection and sperm granuloma formation.",M1

Whether QS can be effectively performed on women with a bicornate or septate uterus is a question answered by a presentation of three such cases. METHODS: Three cases presented were part of a prospective nonrandomized study of QS in 205 women requesting sterilization at the Family Planning Clinic, School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Sonography was performed on all patients before, during and after QS. Quinacrine was packaged as seven pellets in a modified Copper-T IUD inserter (Sipharm, Sisseln, Switzerland). Each woman received the first transcervical insertion of 252 mg of quinacrine during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, usually immediately after menses. One month later, a second insertion was similarly performed. Patients were advised to use an alternate method of birth control for 12 weeks to allow time for scarring of the oviducts. A blood pregnancy test was done before the QS procedure. RESULTS: The diagnosis of a septate or bicornuate uterus was made by sonography in three of the 205 patients in the study. It was obvious that quinacrine had to be inserted into the two horns of such an anomalous uterus if the dissolved drug was to enter both fallopian tubes. Quinacrine dissolved into  lakes of quinacrine,  and sonographically could be seen at the top of the uterine fundus. For this clinical trial of 205 patients, there were 546 woman-years of follow-up, and the Pearl index was 0.73 per 100 woman-years (95% confidence limits: 0.02, 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: The bicornate or septate uterus can be a cause of failure of QS if undetected. Advantages of sonography prior to, during and after QS are apparent in the three patients with septate uteri. Sonography is advantageous when performing QS by demonstrating an anomaly of the uterus, which required separate insertions of quinacrine into each horn of a septate uterus and helping to direct quinacrine into each horn of these anomalous uteri.",M1

DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal analysis (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). SETTING: University out-patient office. PATIENTS: All patients undergoing permanent sterilization in our outpatient office who opted for hysteroscopic sterilization were included. INTERVENTIONS: Hysteroscopic placement of the Essure device in an office-based setting with only non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and paracervical block. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple data points were collected on each patient including demographic data, specific procedural information, and 12-week hysterosalpingogram data. Most of our patients were Hispanic and had an average body mass index of 30.3. Average time to perform the procedure was 12.4 minutes, with the steepest improvement in the first 13 cases. Bilateral placement of the device was successful in 98 (96%) of 102 patients. Of these patients 92 have 12-week hysterosalpingography results (6 patients were lost to follow-up), with 90 (98%) showing bilateral tubal occlusion.

METHOD: Evaluation was conducted 3 weeks after a single bilateral intratesticular injection of calcium chloride (CaCl2) at the dose of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg per testis per 100 g body weight. RESULTS: The significant graded diminution in relative sex organ weights, testicular androgenic enzymes like Delta5,3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Delta5,3beta-HSD) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, testicular content of reduced glutathione (GSH), plasma and intratesticular concentrations of testosterone, epididymal sperm count as well as significant elevation in plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testicular content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were noted in all the treated groups with respect to vehicle control. There was no chronic general stress in experimental animals as indicated by insignificant changes in plasma concentrations of corticosterone, prolactin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen and fasting blood sugar level. Dose-dependent responses on testicular histopathology were recorded by noting multinucleated giant cells in seminiferous tubules, derangement of tubular architecture along with infiltration of leucocytes and appearance of fibrous tissue throughout the testicular sections. The fertility efficacy of the 10, 15 or 20 mg CaCl2-treated males was nil, proven after mating with fertile, virgin healthy females, as there were no implantation sites in each uterine horns noted by laparotomy. CONCLUSION: Intratesticular CaCl2 injection at a specific dose might serve as a way of sterilization and may be considered as an alternative to surgical castration in male animals.",M1
16435330,"Sexual health care in persons with intellectual disabilities.In the past, preventive health concerning sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities was addressed through surgical <e>sterilization</e> as part of nationwide eugenic programs in many countries. For more than 30 years now, it has come progressively to light in the scientific literature that, besides major ethical and legal problems, these programs also failed to assess many of the individual's needs in sexual health. The fact that an increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities live in the community rather than in institutions has heightened public awareness that these individuals have sexual expectancies, desires, and needs that must be supported through both education and health services. The emergence of AIDS, including descriptions of cases among people with intellectual disabilities, has further demonstrated that surgical sterilization cannot be considered a global option to achieve preventive sexual health. The aim of this paper is to review scientific studies that have assessed the expectancies and support needs of persons with intellectual disabilities in terms of sexual health. These needs vary widely from one individual to another, according to life milieu, level of disability, and potential comorbidity. From this review, it appears that hygiene management, global gynecological care, and prevention of unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and abuse have been frequently identified as areas in which the presence of intellectual disability dictates specific support needs.

PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-two patients who underwent hysteroscopic <e>sterilization</e> by placement of Essure microinserts between August 2002 and August 2004. INTERVENTION(S): Transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic X-ray, and hysterosalpingography (HSG) 3 months after sterilization with Essure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Transvaginal ultrasound confirmation of correct localization of microinserts after a 3-month follow-up. RESULT(S): In 150 of 182 patients, confirmation of successful bilateral placement of two microinserts (300 devices) was possible. In 9 patients it was not possible to identify both devices with ultrasound, or there was doubt about the extension of the device through the uterotubal junction. The other 291 devices were identified as being in a good position. CONCLUSION(S): Hysterosalpingography at the 3-month follow-up after successful placement of Essure microinserts can be replaced by transvaginal ultrasonography. A 3-month follow-up with HSG after the Essure procedure is only required after unsatisfactory placements. In those patients in whom transvaginal ultrasonography cannot confirm satisfactory localization, a complementary pelvic X-ray should be performed.",M1
16353661,"Reproductive decision-making among HIV-Infected women.OBJECTIVE: To describe factors related to reproductive decision-making among HIV-infected women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of HIV-infected women (N=104) who received care at an HIV clinic in the southern United States were interviewed about their reproductive decision-making. Women who became pregnant subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to women who did not become pregnant, and women who underwent a <e>sterilization</e> procedure subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to women who did not get sterilized. RESULTS: Compared to women who did not get pregnant after receiving an HIV diagnosis, women who became pregnant were more likely to be young, single, diagnosed earlier in the epidemic and to have more recently used a noninjecting drug. Among women who did not get pregnant, 63% reported their diagnosis greatly affected that decision. Having a partner who wants more children was not associated with pregnancy. Compared to women who did not get sterilized after learning their HIV status, women who did get sterilized tended to be Baptist and already had a prior live birth. Neither a woman's desire nor her partner's desire for more children was associated with sterilization.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study in which medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic, obstetric and HIV-related data from January 1993 through December 2002. HIV-infected women who completed a pregnancy by birth or abortion were divided into two comparison groups:  Pre-076  and  Post-076 . The primary outcome was sterilization by postpartum tubal ligation.Results. Forty-two women (74%) in the Pre-076 group chose sterilization compared to 139 of 310 women (45%) in the Post-076 group (unadjusted OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.83, 6.47). Seventy-one percent of women younger than 21 years of age in the Pre-076 Group chose sterilization compared with only 35% of women younger than 21 years in the Post-076 group (p = 0.0136). Similarly, 78% of primiparous women chose sterilization after their first pregnancy in the Pre-076 group, compared to 14% in the Post-076 group (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Since the implementation of PACTG 076 protocol in November 1994, fewer HIV-infected women chose postpartum sterilization.

16082857,"<e>Sterilization</e> and union instability in Brazil.Brazilian women rely on sterilization as the main source of birth control. Sterilization has been one of the causes of the steep decline in fertility in Brazil, at least since the second half of 1970. It is hypothesized that understanding couples' relationships might be key to explaining this high rate of female sterilizations. Possible reasons for the higher level of fertility among women in unstable unions than among women in stable ones could be the less effective use of contraceptive methods, or that women in unstable unions tend to use less effective or reversible contraceptive methods. In this paper discrete time modelling of the timing of sterilization according to union histories is presented. The analysis uses the calendar data of the 1996 Brazilian DHS. It is shown that women in second or higher order unions have a lower risk of sterilization. This result should be taken into account in the analysis of the determinants of female sterilization in Brazil.",M1

16014263,"[Is gestagen IUD a realistic alternative to female <e>sterilization</e>?]INTRODUCTION: For years, female sterilization has been regarded as the most reliable contraceptive method available. However, sterilization is irreversible and requires a surgical procedure. The purpose of our investigation was to see how many women who were offered a reversible, long-term, non-surgical method would prefer it as an alternative to sterilization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women referred to our unit for sterilization in the years 2000 and 2001 were offered a consultation in non-operative methods of long-term contraception. All women were offered a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) while waiting to be sterilized. The women who chose LNG-IUS were followed for 1-3 years to see if they were later sterilized. RESULTS: Of the 151 women, 14 didn't come in for consultation. Among the 137 remaining women, the primary choice for 69 (50%) was sterilization; 58 women (43%) chose LNG-IUS, and 10 (7%) chose other alternatives. By the end of the observation period, 6 (10%) of the 58 women in the LNG-IUS group had chosen to be sterilized. DISCUSSION: LNG-IUS is a long-term reversible contraceptive method with an efficacy comparable to that of female sterilization. The results suggest that all women referred for sterilization should be counselled about effective alternative methods before proceeding with sterilization.",M1
15899314,"The impact of health care providers on female <e>sterilization</e> among HIV-positive women in Brazil.This paper explores the reproductive preferences and outcomes of HIV-positive women in two cities in Brazil. We used three types of data, all drawn from women who delivered in public sector hospitals: (1) clinical records of 427 HIV-positive women; (2) pre- and postpartum in-depth interviews with 60 HIV-positive women; and (3) a prospective survey carried out among 363 women drawn from the general population. The HIV-positive samples were collected on women who had prenatal care between July 1999 and June 2000, and the general population survey was conducted with women who started prenatal care between April 1998 and June 1999. Among the women in the clinic sample, we found dramatic differences in the proportion sterilized postpartum: 51% in Sao Paulo vs. 4% in Porto Alegre, compared to 3.4% and 1.1%, respectively, of women in the general population. Our qualitative data suggest that HIV-positive women in this study had strong preferences to have no more future children and that female sterilization was the preferred way to achieve this end. Therefore, we conclude that the large difference in rates is mainly due to HIV-positive women's differential access to sterilization in the two settings. In-depth interviews revealed that women in Sao Paulo were often encouraged by clinic staff to be sterilized postpartum. In contrast, HIV-positive women in Porto Alegre clinics were not offered sterilization as an option and those who requested it were repeatedly put off. The striking difference found in the frequency with which doctors provide postpartum sterilization to seropositive women in our study sites deserves attention and discussion in the respective medical communities. At the higher level of national policy on reproductive rights, there may be grounds for reopening discussion about the norms regarding postpartum procedures, and for devoting far more resources to expanding contraceptive options.",M1

METHODS: After initial tests on animals, four human scrotums were opened and treated directly with Ar(+) laser radiation. Then 58 human individual scrotums were treated with radiation by the method of trans-skin puncture. The rate of sperm reduction and elimination was tested. RESULTS: In 60 cases, the sperms were found to be eliminated completely after six months of radiation treatment. In 2 cases the sperms were found not to be eliminated completely due to the insufficient radiation. CONCLUSION: Ar(+) laser is one of the best forms of radiation for coagulation of vas deferens.

The hysteroscopic approach obviates the need for general anesthesia and surgical incision. The device is a dynamically expanding micro-insert that, when placed in the proximal portion of the fallopian tube, generates a benign tissue response that results in anchoring of the device and subsequent occlusion of the tube. The current trial of 745 women seeking birth control from Australia, Europe, and the United States were evaluated for successful micro-insert placement at three months. Comfort, safety, and return to normal activity were evaluated. All patients were followed for five years and returned for annual gynecologic status.

Another one group of animals received only 2 ml of normal saline per testis as a control. The induction of chemosterilization was measured using relative testicular weight as well as histomorphological parameters including seminiferous tubular architecture and germ cell association in seminiferous tubules along with morphology of the interstitial space. Biochemical markers included activities of testicular Delta(5), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Delta(5), 3beta-HSD), 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as monitoring the level of testicular thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes and reduced glutathione (GSH) content along with plasma concentrations of testosterone, LH and FSH. Histomorphological measures of testes showed total necrosis of testicular tissue at 30 days after an injection of either 20 or 40 mg CaCl(2) along with fibrosis in seminiferous tubules and interstitial spaces. Infiltration of leucocytes was observed with the 40 mg dose. Disintegration of germ cell arrangement in seminiferous tubules and washing out of germ cells from the tubules were noted with the 10mg dose. Relative organ weights, plasma concentrations of testosterone, testicular activities of Delta(5), 3beta-HSD, 17beta-HSD, catalase, GPx, GST, and SOD and testicular contents of GSH all were declined. Increases occurred in testicular TBARS, conjugated dienes and plasma concentrations of LH and FSH with each of the treatments by comparison with the control group. Plasma concentrations of cortisol and fasting blood sugar level as well as packed cell volume (PCV) and total plasma protein were recorded to monitor the changes of chronic stress in the experimental animals. Changes in these parameters were not significant. An intratesticular injection of calcium chloride at specified doses could be a suitable method of sterilization in preference to surgical castration of goats.",M1

The sample was composed of 360 SUDP after their first use. The probability of sterilization failure was estimated considering the number of positive microbiological results obtained by cultures of the studied devices. The overall sterilization failure probability for SUDP was 0.26. The sterilization method, which presented the lowest failure probability was the LTSF (0.01), followed by ETO (0.21) and HPP (0.56). Automated cleansing obtained a better result than manual cleansing. This trial demonstrated that the probability of sterilization in reprocessed SUDP is highly dependent on both the type of cleansing and the sterilization method applied.",M2

However, many hurdles and technical concerns regarding biological issues, such as cell retention and the ability to grow, still need to be overcome to gain full access to the clinical arena. Interaction with the host human tissues, immunogenicity, pathogen transmission as well as production costs, technical expertise, and good manufacturing and laboratory practice requirements call for careful consideration when aiming at the production of a material that is available off-the-shelf, to be used immediately in operative settings. The issue of sterilization is one of the most important steps for the clinical application of these scaffolds. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have been performed to systematically investigate how sterilization treatments may affect the properties of electrospun polymers for tissue engineering. This paper presents the results of a comparative study of different sterilization techniques applied to an electrospun poly-L-lactide scaffold: soaking in absolute ethanol, dry oven and autoclave treatments, UV irradiation, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma treatment. Morphological and chemical characterization was coupled with microbiological sterility assay to validate the examined sterilization techniques in terms of effectiveness and modifications to the scaffold. The results of this study reveal that UV irradiation and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma are the most effective sterilization techniques, as they ensure sterility of the electrospun scaffolds without affecting their chemical and morphological features.",M2

These techniques adversely affect the physical properties, functionality, and lifespan of the leaflets. In the work discussed in this paper we examined a novel procedure of using high-frequency microwaves to fix and disinfect the pericardium, without causing any harmful affects. The test bacteria used were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The pericardium was exposed to microwaves at a frequency of 18 GHz for three consecutive replicates. The findings indicated that there was almost complete inactivation of the bacteria on the biomaterial without compromising the biocompatibility, which was studied using ovine fibroblasts. An effective fixation and sterilization procedure, that is quick and has no adverse effects is presented and discussed.",M2

Secondarily, to compare the performance of crimped and knotted lines. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro mechanical evaluation. SAMPLE POPULATION: Nonsterilized, EO- and HPGP-sterilized specimens of 36.3 kg test nylon leader line (NLL) and 57.8 kg test nylon fishing line (NFL). METHODS: Single strands and looped specimens of NLL or NFL were positioned on a material testing machine. To create looped specimens, NLL were crimped using the Securos system, and NFL were knotted, as used clinically. Elongation (%) and ultimate load (N) variables were studied. RESULTS: Elongation and ultimate load of NLL groups were not significantly different between EO and HPGP. For NFL, HPGP sterilization led to slightly greater elongation than EO in loops only. Ultimate load of NFL single strands was not significantly different between EO and HPGP, but was higher after HPGP compared with EO in NFL loops. All NLL groups had less elongation and ultimate load than NFL. CONCLUSION: The effects of HPGP on NLL compared positively to EO, making HPGP an attractive alternative. As HPGP led to a slightly greater elongation of NFL than EO, the latter could be favored to sterilize NFL. Crimped NLL minimized elongation better than knotted NFL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Sterilization with HPGP seems a good alternative to EO for NLL. EO may be a better choice for NFL; however, it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance of this result. Crimped NLL minimizes elongation and may help reducing the recurrence of stifle instability postoperatively.",M2

C-section is associated with higher morbidity than vaginal delivery. Women who undergo C-section are 5 times more likely to develop a postpartum infection after delivery than women who undergo vaginal delivery. OBJECTIVE: Estimates of surgical site infection (SSI) after C-section range from 1.50 to 2.64. A quality improvement initiative was implemented at the University of Minnesota Medical School to reduce rates of SSI using changes based on recommended care initiatives. METHODS: The multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive staff education and training program, added a preoperative skin preparation protocol using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) no-rinse cloths, added CHG with alcohol for interoperative skin preparation, and modified instrument sterilization techniques. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in the overall SSI rate from 7.5% (33/441) in January-July 2006 to 1.2% (5/436) in January-July 2007 (chi(2) test statistic, 21.2; P &lt; .001; relative reduction of 84%). CONCLUSION: Interventions, including staff education, use of CHG no-rinse cloths for preoperative skin prep, CHG with alcohol for intraoperative skin prep, and appropriate instrument sterilization management led to reductions in SSI rates in patients undergoing C-section at our institution.

In addition, sterilization equipment is not always available in many settings and inadequate cleaning could lead to HIV transmission. STUDY DESIGN: A new disposable trocar for two-rod implants [i.e., Sino-implant (II) and Jadelle] was compared to a traditional reusable two-rod trocar. Clinicians in Kenya assessed the trocars in terms of ease of use, malfunctions and adverse events. RESULTS: Eighty insertions were done with the new disposable trocar and 80 insertions were done with the traditional reusable trocar; no differences in performance were found. The disposable trocar was easy to use, did not malfunction and did not cause adverse patient events. These clinical data, combined with the review of the product technical file and an inspection of the manufacturing facility by a Norwegian certification body (Det Norske Veritas), resulted in obtaining the CE Mark, a mandatory conformity mark for the distribution of this medical device in European Union member states. CONCLUSIONS: Disposable trocars eliminate the need for sterilization; this will facilitate provision of contraceptive implants in resource-constrained settings and may decrease the risk of HIV transmission.

In addition to affecting the material strength, sterilization can also increase the rate of hydrolysis, both of which can impact clinical performance. The impact of sterilization on the material/device is unpredictable and must be empirically determined. This study examined the effects of ethylene oxide treatment on the material properties of LactoSorb 82:18 poly(L-lactic acid)-poly(glycolic acid) craniofacial plates. Compared with untreated control plates, there was no effect on the initial inherent viscosity (1.3 dL/g), the glass transition temperature (58 degrees C), or on the flexural mechanical properties. Furthermore, there was no effect on the in vitro rate of hydrolysis and mechanical strength loss profile.

Multiple references suggest this organism has special needs for reproducing and maintaining the two assumed resistant stages of this organism (ascospores and sclerotia). Sterilization resistance studies were performed using a China-sourced cotton product that was naturally contaminated with P. domesticum. These studies showed the organisms to have: 1) a low resistance to moist heat sterilization at 250 degrees F (121 degrees C); a resistance to radiation no greater than that predicted by the bioburden-based resistance model (i.e., Population C) used for dose determination Method 1 described in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137-2:2006--Sterilization of health care products--Radiation--Part 2: Establishing the sterilization dose; and 3) a high resistance to EO processing.",M2

20027431,"Influence of microwave <e>sterilization</e> on the cutting capacity of carbide burs.OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cutting capacity of carbide burs sterilized with microwaves and traditional sterilization methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty burs were divided into 5 groups according to the sterilization methods: dry heat (G1), autoclave (G2), microwave irradiation (G3), glutaraldehyde (G4) or control - no sterilization (G5). The burs were used to cut glass plates in a cutting machine set for twelve 2.5-min periods and, after each period, they were sterilized (except G5) following the protocol established for each group. The cutting capacity of the burs was determined by a weight-loss method. Data were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's test. RESULTS: The means of the cutting amount performed by each group after the 12 periods were G1 = 0.2167 +/- 0.0627 g; G2 = 0.2077 +/- 0.0231 g; G3 = 0.1980 +/- 0.0326 g; G4 = 0.1203 +/- 0.0459 g; G5 = 0.2642 +/- 0.0359 g. There were statistically significant differences among the groups (p&lt;0.05); only dry heat sterilization was similar to the control. CONCLUSION: Sterilization by dry heat was the method that least affected the cutting capacity of the carbide burs and microwave sterilization was not better than traditional sterilization methods.",M2
20027427,"A survey of cross-infection control procedures: knowledge and attitudes of Turkish dentists.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of Turkish dentists in Samsun City regarding cross-infection control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was designed to obtain information about procedures used for the prevention of cross-infection in dental practices and determine the attitudes and perceptions of respondent dental practitioners to their procedures. The study population included all dentists in the city of Samsun, Turkey, in April 2005 (n=184). The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge and practice of infection control procedures, <e>sterilization</e>, wearing of gloves, mask, use of rubber dam, method of storing instruments and disposal methods of contaminated material, etc. Questionnaire data was entered into a computer and analyzed by SPSS statistical software. RESULTS: From the 184 dentists to whom the questionnaires were submitted, 135 participated in the study (overall response rate of 73.36%). As much as 74.10% dentists expressed concern about the risk of cross-infection from patients to themselves and their dental assistants. Forty-three percent of the participants were able to define 'cross-infection' correctly. The greatest majority of the respondents (95.60%) stated that all patients have to be considered as infectious and universal precautions must apply to all of them. The overall responses to the questionnaire showed that the dentists had moderate knowledge of infection control procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Improved compliance with recommended infection control procedures is required for all dentists evaluated in the present survey. Continuing education programs and short-time courses about cross-infection and infection control procedures are suitable to improve the knowledge of dentists.",M2
20022370,"The role of <e>sterilization</e> in the cytocompatibility of titania nanotubes.Titiania nanotubes have large potential in medical implant applications but their tissue compatibility is still controversial. Since the sterilization methods may impact the biocompatibility of titania nanotubes and be the source of the controversy, we investigate the influence of three commonly used sterilization methods, autoclaving, ultraviolet irradiation and ethanol immersion, on the cytocompatibility of titania nanotubes. Two titania nanostructures, namely nanonets with an average pore diameter of 25 nm and nanotubes with an average diameter of 80 nm, are used in this study. The results show that the sterilization methods significantly affect the cytocompatibility of these titania surfaces. UV and ethanol sterilization give rise to a higher surface free energy inducing higher initial cell adhesion and proliferation compared to autoclaving, whereas UV irradiation produces the best cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, as well as differentiation represented by related gene expressions. The cytocompatibility results obtained from the nanoscale surfaces are compared to those acquired from the polished surface demonstrating the significant effects. Our results suggest that the sterilization process plays an important role in the observed cytocompatibility of titania nanotubes and may be the reason for the controversial results so far. UV sterilization is found to be the best method from the viewpoint of surface contamination elimination.",M2

Well-defined procedures in the pharmaceutical industry enable effective protection against contamination by bacteria and fungi. In contrast, problems regarding microbial safety of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), especially of cell therapeutics, are at best only partially solved. The latter should be understood as a challenge for manufacturers, regulators, and physicians. Many of the manufacturing principles mentioned above are not applicable in production of cell therapeutics. Sterility of source materials cannot be guaranteed and the hitherto known procedures for <e>sterilization</e> are, as a rule, not feasible. Thus, the sterility of the final product cannot be guaranteed. Considering the extremely short shelf life of many cell therapeutics, sometimes only a few hours, the results from established methods for sterility testing are often available too late. Furthermore, the sterility of a test sample does not indicate sterility of the whole product. In most cases, conventional methods for pyrogen testing are not applicable for ATMPs. This paper demonstrates relevant limitations regarding microbial safety and pyrogenicity. Possibilities to overcome these problems are discussed and some novel solutions are proposed.",M2

However, direct implantation of the crystals in the tissue for in vivo oxygen measurements may be hindered by concerns associated with their direct contact with the tissue/cells and loss of EPR signal due to particle migration in the tissue. In order to address these concerns, we have developed encapsulations (chips) of LiNc microcrystals in polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), an oxygen-permeable, bioinert polymer. Oximetry evaluation of the fabricated chips revealed that the oxygen sensitivity of the crystals was unaffected by encapsulation in PDMS.

19997824,"Histological examination of frozen autograft treated by liquid nitrogen removed after implantation.BACKGROUND: Several oncological <e>sterilization</e> methods involving autoclaving, irradiation, or pasteurization have been developed for limb reconstruction of large bone defects following tumor excision. Studies involving histological examinations of these autografts have all found that osteogenesis occurs slowly. We have used frozen autografts treated by liquid nitrogen for limb reconstruction and have achieved excellent results for bone union. To determine if frozen autografts exhibit early bone remodeling, we investigated the repair processes of the frozen bones. METHODS: We analyzed frozen autografts treated by liquid nitrogen, retrieved at a mean of 19.1 months (2-75 months) after implantation because of complications or local tumor recurrence. The specimens were obtained from six patients with a mean age of 36.2 years (8-68 years). The six grafts comprised three osteoarticular grafts, two intercalary grafts, and one joint graft. We histologically reviewed the autograft-containing sections for tumor cell necrosis, evidence of cortical repair, the cortical junction, and joint cartilage. RESULTS: Tumor cells were completely eradicated from the frozen bone in all cases. In a specimen retrieved 5 months after implantation, a small area of the bone showed active osteocytes and osteoblasts. In three cases retrieved more than 1 year after implantation, osteocytes and osteoblasts were observed in broad portions of the frozen bones, indicating the onset of osteogenesis in the frozen bone at an early stage. The cortical host-graft junction showed incorporation along with continuity of bone trabeculae. In addition, we were able to fi nd normal chondrocytes on the articular surface. CONCLUSIONS: The frozen bone specimens in this study thus showed evidence of newly formed bone and earlier osteogenesis than has been previously reported. Our results suggest that frozen autografts may be considered one of the most useful recycled materials for biological reconstruction.",M2

As with any medical device or pharmaceutical drug intended to be used for in vivo biomedical applications, NPs must be sterile. However, very little is known regarding the effect of sterilization methods on the intrinsic properties and stability of NPs. Herein a detailed analysis of physicochemical properties of two types of AuNPs upon sterilization by means of five different techniques is reported. In addition, cell viability and production of reactive oxygen species are studied. The results indicate that sterilization by ethylene oxide seems to be the most appropriate technique for both types of NPs. It is concluded that it is crucial to test several methods in order to establish the specific type of sterilization to be performed for each particular NP.",M2
19913141,"Forgettable contraception.The term  forgettable contraception  has received less attention in family planning than has  long-acting reversible contraception.

Five principal factors determine contraceptive effectiveness: efficacy, compliance, continuation, fecundity, and the timing of coitus. Of these, compliance and continuation dominate; the key determinants of contraceptive effectiveness are human, not pharmacological. Human nature undermines methods with high theoretical efficacy, such as oral contraceptives and injectable contraceptives. By obviating the need to think about contraception for long intervals, forgettable contraception can help overcome our human fallibility. As a result, all forgettable contraception methods provide first-tier effectiveness (&lt;/=2 pregnancies per 100 women per year) in typical use. Stated alternatively, the only class of contraceptives today with exclusively first-tier effectiveness is the one that can be started -- and then forgotten for years.",M2

Sixteen fresh similar sized porcine femurs were used as the samples for the strength test. They were divided into 4 groups and each group consisted of four femurs: two right and two left. Group I was the control. The bones in Group II underwent the state of being deeply frozen mean while having the rapid temperature change during the preparation. In Group III, the bones underwent the state of being deeply frozen and having the slow temperature change during the preparation. Group IV was the freeze-dried group. Before using the compression load to the subjects, all of them were placed in the moist chamber until their bone temperature remained at room temperature. Then, all the samples were pressed down by the three-point bending, single load named Shimutzu AGB 2000 until the fracture occurred. The compression load was applied to the middle of the bone and to the other two fixed points which were designed at 10 cm away from both sides of the middle point. The load was applied at the rate of 1 mm per second under the ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and 55% humidity. The maximum weights of each group was recorded and compared with the others by using Student-t-test. The control group was the strongest as its fracture happened at 675.90 +/- 5.11 Kg. The bone strength of the deeply frozen group that had the rapid temperature change was 467.21 +/- 3.02 Kg while the one that had the slow temperature change was 467.30 +/- 2.90 Kg. There was no significant difference in terms of the strength between the bone under the rapid temperature change and the one under the slow temperature change while being prepared. The freeze-dried group yielded the weakest bone strength; the bone was broken at 61.17 +/- 4.21 Kg. The process of bone graft preparation resulted in weakening the strength of bone for approximately 30% in the deeply frozen condition and approximately 90% in the freeze-dried group. Surgeons should know the changes in the strength of the bone allograft and hand the bone grafts with care. Furthermore, they must select the proper type of bone grafts with proper indication.",M2

The main difference of the two methods is the inclusion and exclusion of the coated formulation for irradiation during terminal sterilization and aseptic processing, respectively. Both gamma-irradiation and e-beam of the final product resulted in increased PTH(1-34) oxidation, which could be reduced by lowering the irradiation dose or the irradiation temperature. Minimizing moisture and oxygen levels inside the primary packaging could effectively limit PTH oxidation to &lt; 2% initially, but the stability continued deteriorating to fall below the purity specification over 3-month storage. Aseptic processing has its own challenge as one of the device components, acrylic-based adhesive, was found to be incompatible with the peptide due to volatile compound(s) released from the irradiated adhesive. Although the nature of the volatile compounds was not fully understood, we developed a screening method capable of rapidly and effectively identifying an alternate adhesive.

19878906,"Dependence of in vitro fatigue properties of PMMA bone cement on the polydispersity index of its powder.Four variants of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement were used, the difference being in the method used to sterilize the powder (three different dosages of gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide gas) and, hence, in the molecular weight of the powder. For each cement powder, the number-average molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight (and, hence, the polydispersity index, PDI) were determined using gel permeation chromatography. For each of the cured cements, the fatigue lives (N(f)) of specimens, at loads corresponding to stresses (S) of +/-10.0 MPa, +/-12.5 MPa, +/-15.0 MPa, and +/-20.0 MPa, were determined using the protocol detailed in ASTM F2118-03. Hence, the values of the three Weibull parameters were determined for each cement set-S combination. From these results, one index of the fatigue life of the cement, namely, the Weibull mean fatigue life (N(WM)), was computed for each combination. For each cement, the Olgive equation was fitted to the S-N(f) results, yielding an estimate of another fatigue property, the cement's fatigue limit. Best-fit empirical relationships (1) betweenlnN(WM), S, and PDI, and (2) between the estimated fatigue limit and PDI were obtained.

Moreover, there is no general agreement regarding pin site care. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different pin site care techniques after treatment of tibial fractures with an Ilizarov external fixator. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of education and research hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, we followed up 610 pin sites in 39 cases using two different pin site care protocols. INTERVENTION: For the first 15 days, patients in both groups cleaned each pin site using sterile gauze impregnated with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (Polyod) every 3 days. After 15 days, patients in group 1 (20 cases, 310 pin sites) were advised to perform pin care by daily showering and brushing the pin sites with soap and an ordinary soft toothbrush, whereas patients in group 2 (19 cases, 300 pin sites) were advised to perform pin care by daily showering and cleaning the crusts using sterile gauze impregnated with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (Polyod). Each pin site was denominated according to location. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Pin sites were inspected and graded on a scale of 0 to 5 according to slight modification of the system of Dahl described by Gordon et al during outpatient visits on the 5th, 10th, 15th, 30th, 45th, 60th, 75th, 90th, 120th, and 150th days of follow up after the operation until fixator removal. Grade 1 and grade 2 infections were categorized as minor infection not requiring any extra pin site care and grade 3 and above infections as major infection. RESULTS: Minor infection rate of all pin sites was determined as 50.7% in group 1 and 43.6% in group 2. Major infection rate was determined as 3.5% in group 1 and 3.7% in group 2. No statistically significant difference was noted between the two groups (all P &gt; 0.05).

19832767,"Influence of <e>sterilization</e> on the retention properties of magnetic attachments for dental implants.OBJECTIVES: When used with dental implants advantages of the magnetic attachments include control of load transmitted to implants, improvements in stability, support and retention for the prosthesis, and the relative ease of prostheses fabrication. Clinically, the use of sterilized components is required, and this may be problematic as magnetic alloys are sensitive to temperature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of autoclave sterilization on the maximum retentive forces and characteristic curves for magnetic attachments recommended for use with dental implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eleven SmCo and NeFeB implant magnetic attachments were evaluated as provided by the respective manufacturers. Implant magnetic abutment and the corresponding denture magnet (n=5 magnet pairs) were tested before and after standardized autoclave sterilization (10 min at 134 degrees C). Each magnet pair was tested 10 times in a calibrated universal testing machine using a non-magnetic test device (s=40 mm, v=20 mm/min). Results were recorded electronically and statistically analyzed using t-test and ANOVA (Welch and Brown-Forsythe test; P&lt;0.05). RESULTS: After autoclave sterilization all magnetic pairs produced lower (though statistically insignificant) overall retention forces compared with the untreated pairs. After sterilization mean maximum retentive forces (SD) ranged from 5.65 (0.33) to 1.41 (0.07) N. The characteristic force-displacement curves of the tested magnetic systems showed differences among the single products. CONCLUSIONS: Autoclave sterilization caused a non-significant reduction in retentive force of 0.04-14.6% when compared with the unsterilized magnet pairs. There were differences between the tested magnetic pairs for both the initial breakaway forces and the characteristic force-displacement curves. Within the limitations of this study all tested magnetic attachments were sterilized in an autoclave without significant change of retention properties. Nevertheless magnetic implant abutments should be sterilized with caution to reduce the risk of alterations of the retention properties.",M2

AM reduces ocular surface scarring and inflammation, and enhances epithelialization. In addition, it shows limited immunogenicity and some anti-microbial properties. Before being applied clinically, the donor of AM is required to undergo a thorough health screening and the membrane has to undergo an accepted processing routine, which includes preservation, sterilization and de-epithelialization. There have been various articles describing methods in preserving, sterilizing and de-epithelializing AM. Each preparation technique has been reported to have differential effects on the physical and biological properties of the AM. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a standardized procedure.

19766380,"Plasma <e>sterilization</e> of poly lactic acid ultrasound contrast agents: surface modification and implications for drug delivery.Poly lactic acid (PLA) ultrasound contrast agents (CA) have been developed previously in our laboratory for ultrasound (US) imaging, as well as surface coated with doxorubicin to create a potential targeted platform of chemotherapeutic delivery using focused US. However, we have previously found it impossible to sterilize these agents while at the same time maintaining their acoustic properties, a task that would probably require fabrication within a clean facility. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using plasma to sterilize these CA while maintaining maximum echogenicity, a step that would greatly facilitate in vivo investigations. Effects of plasma exposure time (1, 3 and 6 min) and intensity (low-10 mA, 6.8 W; medium-15 mA, 10.5 W; and high-25 mA, 18 W) on the CAs' acoustic properties, surface morphology, zeta potential, capacity to carry chemotherapeutics and overall sterility are described. Both increases in plasma intensity and exposure time increased CA zeta potential and also significantly increased drug payload. High-intensity plasma exposure for 3 min was found to be an optimal sterilization protocol for maximal (100%) preservation of CA echogenicity. Plasma exposure resulted in sterile samples and maintained original CA enhancement of 20 dB and acoustic half-life over 75 min, while increasing CA zeta potential by 11 mV and doxorubicin loading efficiency by 10%. This study not only shows how a highly temperature- and pressure-sensitive agent can be sterilized using plasma, but also that surface modification can be used to increase surface binding of the drug.",M2
19765910,"A possible explanation of the germicide effect of carbon dioxide in supercritical state based on molecular-biological evidence.Supercritical carbon dioxide (CO(2)) possesses germicide (bactericide and sporicide) effect. Despite of the fact, that this effect is used in industrial <e>sterilization</e> processes, the sterilization mechanism at molecular level is unclear. Our hypotheses can provide a molecular-biological explanation for the phenomenon. We believe that in supercritical state CO(2) reacts competitively with Met-tRNA(fMet), the formation rate and the amount of formyl-methionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNA(fMet)) will be diminished by irreversible substrate consumption. The fMet-tRNA(fMet) possesses a key role in prokaryotic protein synthesis, being almost exclusively the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA. The formed carbamoyl-methionyl-tRNA (cMet-tRNA(fMet)), probably stable only under pressure and high CO(2) concentration, is stabilized by forming a ternary molecular complex with the GTP-form of the translational initiation factor 2 (GTP-IF2). This complex is unable to dissociate from preinitiation 70S ribosomal complex because of strong polar binding between the protein C-2 domain and the modified initiator aminoacyl-tRNA. The IF2-fMet-tRNA(fMet)-blocked 70S ribosomal preinitiation complex does not decompose following the GTP hydrolysis, becoming unable to synthesize proteins. The death of the microbial cell is caused by inhibition of the protein synthesis and energetic depletion. Moreover, we propose a possible mechanism for the accumulation of cMet-tRNA(fMet) in the bacterial cell. Since the translational process is an important target for antibiotics, the proposed mechanism could be a work hypothesis for discovery of new antibiotics. Made by high conservative character of prokaryotic translation initiation, the proposed IF2 pathway deterioration strategy may conduct to obtaining selective (with low mammalian toxicity) antimicrobials and at the same time, with reduced possibility of the drug resistance development.",M2

G1 and G3 were sterilized with a 14.5 KGy dose at 27 degrees C for 24 h, while G2 and G4 (controls) were not sterilized and were maintained under the same time and temperature conditions. Fluoride release measurements were made in duplicate (n=6) by an ion specific electrode. The antibacterial activity of the CPB and FS against Streptococcus mutans after gamma <e>sterilization</e> was evaluated by the agar-disc diffusion method. The diameter of the zones of microbial growth inhibition was recorded after 48 h. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha=5%). Gamma sterilization decreased the fluoride release of FS by approximately 50%, while CPB was not affected. There was no statistically significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in the antibacterial effect of CPB between gamma and non-gamma sterilization groups. FS presented no antibacterial activity. Gamma irradiation decreased the fluoride release of FS, but did not affect the antibacterial activity of the studied materials.",M2

The effect of solid concentration and the rotational speed of the agitators on the RTD were studied. The velocity of the fastest particle was 1.62 times the mean product velocity. In general, particle velocity was found to be greater than the product bulk average velocity. Mean particle residence time (MPRT) increased with an increase in the rotational speed of the agitators (P &lt; 0.05), and no particular trend was observed between the MPRT and the solid concentration. The distribution curves E (theta) were skewed to the right suggesting slow moving zones in the system.",M2
19722521,"Interactive effect of organic amendment and environmental factors on degradation of 1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin in soil.Soil organic matter is an important factor affecting the fate of soil fumigants; therefore, the addition of organic amendments to surface soils could reduce fumigant emissions by accelerating fumigant degradation. Experiments were conducted to determine the degradation of fumigants [a mixture of cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP), a similar composition as in Telone C35] in soils with organic amendment under a range of soil moisture, temperature, <e>sterilization</e>, and texture conditions. Degradation of the fumigants followed availability-adjusted first-order or pseudo-first-order kinetics with slower degradation of 1,3-D than CP. Increasing soil water content from 5 to 17.5% (w/w) slightly increased the degradation of 1,3-D, but not that of CP. Five different organic amendments at 5% (w/w) increased fumigant degradation 1.4-6.3-fold in this study. The degradation of both fumigants was accelerated with increasing amount of organic material (OM). Little interaction between soil moisture and OM was observed. Autoclave sterilization of soils did not reduce degradation of either fumigant; however, increasing the incubation temperature from 10 to 45 degrees C accelerated fumigant degradation 5-14 times. Soil texture did not affect 1,3-D degradation, but CP degraded more rapidly in finer-textured soil. These results suggest that OM type and rate and soil temperature are the most important factors affecting the degradation of 1,3-D and CP.",M2

METHODS: Endodontic files from four manufacturers were placed either immediately in thioglycolate broth or immersed in 6% sodium hypochlorite for 1, 2, or 5 minutes before placement in the broth. The files were aerobically incubated for 72 hours and sterility determined by the absence of broth turbidity, as determined by a blinded examiner. The data were analyzed using the Cochran-Q test followed by the McNemar test for pair-wise comparisons. The level of statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: When pooling all manufacturers' files, no significant differences were found between groups. CONCLUSION: New files demonstrated a 6% contamination rate and none of the immersion times in NaOCl achieved file sterility.",M2
19714986,"Reprocessing and <e>sterilization</e> of single-use electrophysiological catheters: removal of organic carbon and protein surface residues.Although evidence to date indicates that reprocessing electrophysiological (EP) catheters results in clean, sterile devices, some concerns persist with regard to the risk of residual contamination. We examined the ability of a defined reprocessing procedure coupled with a validated sterilization protocol to remove organic carbon and protein residues from worst-case soiled EP catheters resulting in clean, sterile devices. Total organic carbon (TOC) determinations indicated that detergent residues on reprocessed used catheters were nominal and significantly lower than organic carbon levels present on new catheters. Determination of the mean residual organic carbon and protein contaminants on soiled and reprocessed EP catheters further indicated that TOC and protein were reduced (&gt; or =99% of residue removed) below previously reported levels and current accepted standards. Moreover, reprocessed end-of-life catheters (six clinical uses, plus five reprocessings) were examined for residual microorganisms and found to be sterile. End-of-life catheters that had been inoculated with &gt;10(6) CFU Bacillus atrophaeus spores and subjected to a half-cycle ethylene oxide exposure were also found to be sterile. Our data indicate that EP catheter cleaning and reprocessing using defined protocols effectively removes detergent residues and biological contamination, and provides sterile devices.",M2
19695602,"Adequacy of sanitization and storage of catheters for intermittent use after washing and microwave <e>sterilization</e>.PURPOSE: Clean intermittent catheterization is used to treat neurogenic bladders and it can be adequate to maintain sterile urine. Typically polyvinylchloride, individually packaged catheters are used but they are not intended for repeat use by the manufacturer. Antibacterial soap alone or combined with microwave heating was advocated to decrease pathogens and bacterial residue, which could inoculate the bladder from a colonized catheter. We assessed the efficacy of catheter sanitizing and storage for reuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Catheters were inoculated with a 24-hour broth culture of Escherichia coli and washed in antibacterial soap, washed and microwaved or immediately packaged (positive controls) and stored for 1, 3 and 7 days, respectively. Common packaging was used, including paper towels, sealable plastic bags or sealable rigid plastic containers. Each condition was assessed in triplicate via culture of the entire catheter contents, yielding a total of 27 catheters per sanitization method. RESULTS: Antibacterial wash alone failed to sanitize 67% of catheters (6 of 9 with 2 of 3 positive per container) on day 1, 22% (2 of 9 with all positive catheters in a paper towel) on day 3 and 44% (4 of 9 with 1 in a paper towel and 3 in a plastic container) on day 7. For combined antibacterial wash and microwave heating the positive rate was 0% (0 of 9 catheters) on day 1, 22% (2 of 9 in a plastic container) on day 3 and 56% (5 of 9 with 3 in a paper towel, 1 in a plastic bag and 1 in a plastic container) on day 7. Positive untreated controls showed viable organisms throughout the test period. CONCLUSIONS: Overall 44% of catheters (12 of 27) washed with antibacterial soap yielded E. coli vs 26% (7 of 27) with combined antibacterial soap-microwave treatment. The latter is a more effective but not an absolute way to sanitize catheters for intermittent use. Longer storage time increased the risk of E. coli growth on the catheters.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: The inactivation of spores followed a biphasic kinetics consisting of a log-linear phase with rapid inactivation followed by a slow inactivation phase. In the course of plasma treatment, damage to DNA, proteins and spore membranes were observed by monitoring the occurrence of auxotrophic mutants, inactivation of catalase (KatX) activity and the leakage of dipicolinic acid, respectively. Spores of the wild-type strain showed the highest resistance to plasma treatment. Spores of mutants defective in nucleotide excision repair (uvrA) and small acid-soluble proteins (Delta sspA Delta sspB) were more sensitive than those defective in the coat protein CotE or spore photoproduct repair (splB). Exclusion of reactive particles and spectral fractions of UV radiation from access to the spores revealed that UV-C radiation is the most effective inactivation agent in the plasma, whereby the splB and Delta cotE mutant spores were equally and slightly less sensitive, respectively, than the wild-type spores. Finally, the extent of damages in the spore DNA determined by quantitative PCR correlated with the spore inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Spore inactivation was efficiently mediated by a combination of DNA damage and protein inactivation. DNA was identified to be the primary target for spore inactivation by UV radiation emitted by the plasma. Coat proteins were found to constitute a protective layer against the action of the plasma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results provide new evidence to the understanding of plasma sterilization processes. This knowledge supports the identification of useful parameters for novel plasma sterilization equipment to control process safety.",M2

Physical and chemical changes, introduced by the used methods, were evaluated by complementary techniques for surface analysis such as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effect of the changed surface properties on the adhesion of osteoblast-like cells was studied by a direct contact assay. Generally, both treatments resulted in higher number of cells adhered to the modified surfaces. The importance of the improved biocompatibility resulting from the irradiation methods is further supported by the knowledge that both UV and plasma treatments can be used as cost-effective methods for sterilization of biomedical materials and devices.",M2

In situ implantable preparation of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug, was intended with the aim to improve the patient compliance and to offer an effective antipsychotic drug therapy. D-optimal mixture design was employed to design and optimize long-acting depot injection of aripiprazole using polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) 50:50, 75:25, 85:15, and cholesterol as release rate-retarding material. Desirability technique was used for the optimization of formulation. Predicted optimized formulation was experimentally validated, and it was found that the developed formulation releases the drug for a 14-day time period. The optimized formulation showed that the cholesterol-containing formulation exhibits a better drug release profile. The pharmacokinetic studies confirmed that the developed cholesterol-based depot formulation was capable of releasing the drug for a time period of more than 14 days.

In particular, since supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) treatment, which is conducted at relatively low temperatures, is considered to be a promising alternative method to replace thermal sterilization processes that cannot be safely used in foods and bioactive materials. Although SC-CO2 has been applied to many microorganisms, the inactivation of microbial cells by SC-CO2 has only been evaluated by using a conventional viable cell count such as a plating method, by which it is not possible to systematically elucidate the microbial cell inactivation process. Therefore, in this study the physiological status of SC-CO2 treated Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium was analyzed by using GC-MS analysis of fatty acids with principal component analysis and two-dimensional electrophoresis for protein profiling. From the results of these systemic analyses, it was revealed that SC-CO2 caused significant alterations to the profiles of fatty acids and proteins of the cells.",M2

Staphylococcus aureus strain incorporated in calcium phosphate powder was subjected to isostatic compression. Several parameters of compression were tested: application of pressure, time of plateau, number of compressions, and waiting time between two compressions. The results showed that the efficacy of compression increased with applied pressure and that time of plateau did not play an important role. The number of compressions influenced the efficiency of the technique and it was necessary to allow ample time between two compressions for bacteria to sufficiently multiply. The most effective protocol for preventing the growth of S. aureus in calcium phosphate involved two compressions of 5 minutes each at 140 MPa spaced at a 24-hour interval.",M2

Unfortunately, radiotherapy side effects include rectal irritation and bleeding, erectile dysfunction and urinary frequency. Because radiation intensity decays rapidly as a function of distance, displacing irradiated prostate away from normal tissues would reduce damage and therefore side effects. The objective of this study is to develop an inflatable balloon that is implanted via a minimal invasive procedure. The balloon is made of a biodegradable polymer called poly(lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone). The implant is inserted rolled throughout the perineum; inflated in situ with a physiological saline; sealed and placed between the rectum wall, and the prostate gland. Balloon's mechanical and chemical properties were extensively characterized both in vitro and in vivo. The balloon's preparation ensures no bonding across surfaces as these may endanger the implant mechanical stability. Moreover, the coating method does not alter the polymer's molecular weight and therefore preserve its mechanical properties. Balloon's <e>sterilization</e> was carried out using ethylene oxide which, as our results show and in comparison with gamma-irradiation, doesn't damage the mechanical stability of the implant.

The inactivation of the spores by SC-CO(2) with peracetic acid (PAA) sterilant was analyzed as a function of exposure times ranging from 1 to 30 min. A linear inactivation profile for the Bacillus atrophaeus spores was observed, and a SC-CO(2) exposure time of 27 min was determined to achieve a sterility assurance level of 10(-6). The inactivation of viruses was also studied using Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viruses. After 15 min of exposure to SC-CO(2) with PAA sterilant, more than a 6 log(10) reduction was observed for EMC viruses.

They are highly resistant to the chemical and physical decontamination and sterilization procedures routinely used in healthcare facilities. The decontamination procedures recommended for the inactivation of prions are often incompatible with the materials used in medical devices. In this study, we evaluated the use of low-temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization systems and other instrument-processing procedures for inactivating human and animal prions. We provide new data concerning the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide against prions from in vitro or in vivo tests, focusing on the following: the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide sterilization and possible interactions with enzymatic or alkaline detergents, differences in the efficiency of this treatment against different prion strains, and the influence of contaminating lipids. We found that gaseous hydrogen peroxide decreased the infectivity of prions and/or the level of the protease-resistant form of the prion protein on different surface materials. However, the efficiency of this treatment depended strongly on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the delivery system used in medical devices, because these effects were more pronounced for the new generation of Sterrad technology. The Sterrad NX sterilizer is 100% efficient (0% transmission and no protease-resistant form of the prion protein signal detected on the surface of the material for the mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy 6PB1 strain and a variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strain).

19563253,"A new <e>sterilization</e> technique of bovine pericardial biomaterial using microwave radiation.Bioprosthetic valves created from chemically treated natural tissues such as bovine pericardial biomaterial are used as heart valve scaffolds. Methods currently available for sterilization of biomaterial for transplantation include the application of gamma radiation and chemical sterilants. These techniques, however, can be problematic because they can be expensive and lead to a reduction in tissue integrity. Therefore, improved techniques are needed that are cost effective and do not disrupt the physical properties, functionality, and lifespan of the valvular leaflets. This study examined a novel technique using nonthermal microwave radiation that could lead to the inactivation of bacteria in bovine pericardial biomaterial without compromising valve durability. Two common pathogenic species of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, were used as test microorganisms. Optimized microwave parameters were used to determine whether inactivation of pathogenic bacteria from bovine pericardium could be achieved. In addition, the effect of microwave sterilization on tissue integrity was examined. The mechanical properties (assessed using dynamic mechanical analysis) and tensile strength testing (using a Universal Tensile Tester) as well as thermal analysis (using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry) indicated that microwave sterilization did not compromise the functionality of bovine pericardial biomaterial. Scanning electron microscopy imaging and cytotoxicity testing also confirmed that the structure and biocompatibility of transplant biomaterial remained unaltered after the sterilization process. Results from the application of this new microwave (MW) sterilization technique to bovine pericardium showed that near-complete inactivation of the contaminant bacteria was achieved. It is concluded that nonthermal inactivation of pathogenic bacteria from bovine pericardial biomaterial could be achieved using microwave radiation.",M2

Residual levels of EO and its derivatives, ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) and ethylene glycol (EG), may be hazardous to the patients. Therefore, it must be removed by the aeration process. This study aimed to estimate the minimum aeration time for these devices to attain safe limits for use (avoiding excessive aeration time) and to evaluate the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a biosensor capable of best indicating the distribution and penetration of EO gas throughout the sterilization chamber. Sterilization cycles of 2, 4, and 8 h were monitored by Bacillus atrophaeus ATCC 9372 as a biological indicator (BI) and by the GFP. Residual levels of EO, ECH, and EG were determined by gas chromatography (GC), and the residual dissipation was studied. Safe limits were reached right after the sterilization process for Oxygenator and after 204 h of aeration for Tubing. In the 2 h cycle, the GFP concentration decreased from 4.8 (+/-3.2)% to 7.5 (+/-2.5)%. For the 4 h cycle, the GFP concentration decreased from 17.4 (+/-3.0)% to 21.5 (+/-6.8)%, and in the 8 h cycle, it decreased from 22.5 (+/-3.2)% to 23.9 (+/-3.9)%.

The bacteria grow slowly even in a rich medium and rapidly lose viability after about 19 h of growth. One of the reasons for the slow growth and for the decreased viability is the conventional method of making growth media by autoclaving. Faster growth and greater viability were observed in both broth and plates if the growth media were sterilized by microwave radiation rather than by autoclaving. One difference between autoclaved and microwaved media is that the autoclaved media are darker brown in color, which is known to be due to the Maillard reaction products, also known as Amadori products. The Maillard reaction products formed by autoclaving a mixture of lysine and glucose were shown to inhibit growth of A. actinomycetemcomitans.",M2

After that, 40 dentures were selected for microwaving. For each microorganism, 10 dentures were submitted to microwave irradiation at 650 W for 3 minutes. In addition, 10 dentures contaminated with B. subtilis were irradiated for 5 minutes. Thirty non-microwaved dentures (n = 10 for each bacteria) were used as positive controls. Replicate aliquots (25 microL) of suspensions were plated at dilutions of 10(-3) to 10(-6) on plates of selective media appropriate for each organism. After incubation (37 degrees C for 48 hours), colonies were counted (cfu/mL). TSB beakers with the microwaved dentures were incubated at 37 degrees C for a further 7 days to verify long-term disinfection. The data were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha= 0.05). RESULTS: No evidence of growth was observed at 48 hours for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on plates, and no turbidity was visible in the TSB beakers of these specimens after 7 days of incubation. Dentures contaminated with B. subtilis and irradiated for 3 minutes produced microbial growth on six plates and turbidity on all TSB beakers. Microwaving for 5 minutes resulted in survival of B. subtilis in two plates and two beakers. CONCLUSION: Microwave irradiation for 3 minutes at 650 W produced sterilization of complete dentures contaminated with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Dentures contaminated with B. subtilis were disinfected by microwave irradiation after 3 and 5 minutes at 650 W.",M2

19497057,"<e>Sterilization</e> of platelet concentrates at production scale by irradiation with short-wave ultraviolet light.BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) is recognized as a serious threat to transfusion safety. We developed a simple method for sterilization of PCs with short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC). The effects of treatment on the sterility of contaminated PCs and in vitro platelet (PLT) variables were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were prepared from pools of five buffy coats. Irradiation with UVC (wavelength, 254 nm) under vigorous agitation was from both sides of the irradiation bags. Kinetics of the inactivation of Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined. PCs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of 10 bacteria species (n = 12/species) were irradiated with UVC doses between 0.25 and 0.4 J/cm(2) and tested for sterility by a commercially available bacterial detection system (BacT/ALERT, bioMérieux) after storage at 22 degrees C for 3 or 6 days. The influence of a dose of 0.3 J/cm(2) on PLT variables was investigated on Days 1, 4, and 6 after irradiation. RESULTS: At 0.3 J/cm(2) all bacteria species tested were inactivated by more than 4 log. At this dose the influence of UVC on in vitro PLT variables was marginal; the storage stability for up to 6 days after treatment was maintained. PCs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 CFUs/mL were reproducibly sterilized in the dose range tested. In individual experiments with the spore former B. cereus, PCs were, however, unsterile after treatment. CONCLUSION: Irradiation at UVC doses not detrimental to in vitro PLT variables sterilizes PCs contaminated with a wide range of different bacteria species.",M2

Twelve bovine incisors were sectioned perpendicularly to their long axes at 7 mm from the amelodentinal junction. They were painted with acid-resistant nail varnish, except on an exposed coronal dentin area. Four groups were formed (n = 3) in accordance with the sterilization method used, before artificial caries development and after complete restoration: NE - no sterilization (control group); G - gamma-rays before and after; A - steam autoclave before and after; AG - steam autoclave before and gamma-rays after. For artificial caries development, dentin sections were immersed in BHI broth with S. mutans. After the soft carious tissue was removed, dentin was restored with Scotchbond Multi-Purpose and Filtek Z250. Next, the samples were sterilized in accordance with the methods described above and microtensile testing was performed. The data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test (p &lt; 0.05). The G (22.7 MPa) and AG groups (16.3 MPa) were not statistically different from the NE group (17.5 MPa). Nevertheless, there were statistical differences between groups A (6.3 MPa) and NE, A and G, A and AG, G and AG.

19486408,"Temperature dependence of F-, D- and z-values used in steam <e>sterilization</e> processes.AIMS: To develop a model, based on microbiological principles, to safely optimize steam sterilization processes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The minimum exposure time F for a decontamination process at a certain temperature is usually calculated from an empirical model with the decimal reduction time D and the temperature resistance coefficient z as parameters. These are implicitly assumed to be independent of temperature. Using a microbiological approach, it is shown that also D and z depend on temperature, indicating that the usual models provide only reliable results in a limited temperature region. The temperature dependence of F resulting from this approach describes the available experimental data very well. Safety margins to assure sterility can be included in a straightforward way. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present approach can be used to safely optimize decontamination processes. The corresponding mathematical model can be implemented rather directly in process control systems. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results show that for steam sterilization and disinfection processes the values of F predicted by the usual models largely underestimate the required minimum exposure times at temperatures below 120 degrees C. This has important consequences for the optimization of such processes.",M2

The behavior of unsterilized and sterilized Si-HPMC solutions in diluted and concentrated domains is first described and compared. In addition, the influence of physiological parameters such as pH and temperature on the rate of the gelation process is studied. In dilute solution, the intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) of different pre-steam sterilization Si-HPMC solutions indicates that macromolecular chains occupy a larger hydrodynamic volume than the post-steam sterilization Si-HPMC solutions. Although the unsterilized Si-HPMC solutions demonstrate no detectable influence of pH upon the rheological behavior, a decrease in the limiting viscosities (eta(0)) of solutions with increasing pH is observed following steam sterilization. This effect can be explained by the formation of intra- and intermolecular associations during the sterilization stage originating from the temperature-induced phase separation. The formation of Si-HPMC hydrogels from injectable aqueous solution is studied after neutralization by different acid buffers leading to various final pHs. Gelation time (t(gel)) decreases when pH increases (t(gel) varies from 872 to 11s at pH 7.4 and 11.8, respectively). The same effect is observed by increasing the temperature from 20 to 45 degrees C. This is a consequence of the synergistic effect of the increased reaction rate and acid buffer diffusion. pH and temperature are important parameters in the gelation process and their influence is a key factor in controlling gelation time. By adapting the gel parameters one could propose hydrogels with cross-linking properties adapted to clinical applications by controlling the amount of pH of neutralization and temperature.",M2

19459051,"Effect of EDTA and methionine on preventing loss of viscosity of cellulose-based topical gel.Methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (hypromellose) are used in topical formulations of a protein to form a viscous hydrogel. Five lots of hypromellose raw material were made into 3% gel; all showed viscosity loss after <e>sterilization</e> by autoclave. EDTA (edetate disodium) minimized the viscosity loss caused by autoclaving in the presence of up to 100 ppm H(2)O(2). These results suggest that EDTA may prevent loss of viscosity of the hydrogel when peroxide is present. H(2)O(2) at low levels (2-50 ppm) caused significant viscosity loss over time at either 40 degrees C or 5 degrees C in 3% methylcellulose or hypromellose gel. EDTA slowed the rate of viscosity loss during storage under stress by H(2)O(2) but did not completely prevent the loss. Methionine was effective in completely preventing gel-viscosity loss during storage in the presence of up to 50 ppm H(2)O(2). On the basis of these results, it is recommended that methionine be added to the protein topical formulation as a stabilizer against viscosity loss.",M2
19445639,"Ureteroscope cleaning and <e>sterilization</e> by the urology operating room team: the effect on repair costs.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flexible ureteroscopes are fragile devices, and the costs associated with their repair and replacement can be considerable. Although surgical use can degrade ureteroscope function, the cleaning and sterilization process can also cause great damage. We performed a study to define the effect of having the urology nursing staff process and sterilize all ureteroscopes, rather than the central processing core; the total repair cost and cost per use were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2007 to March 2008, all ureteroscopes were processed by the urology nursing staff. We analyzed the average cost per use as a measure of the effectiveness of this strategy. For all endoscopic stone removal cases, a flexible ureteroscope is opened onto the operative field; therefore, after every endoscopic procedure, the flexible ureteroscope needs processing and sterilizing. The number of times each ureteroscope was processed and the type and cost of repairs were recorded. RESULTS: From April 2007 to March 2008, 11 ureteroscopes were processed 478 times; average uses before repair was 28.1. Seven ureteroscopes were returned for repair because of: loss of deflection (2); loss of fiberoptic bundles (2); failed leak test (3). No ureteroscope damage was because of processing. The total repair cost in this 12-month period was $57,664.50. Amortizing repair costs over use gives a value of $120.63 cost per use. CONCLUSIONS: Training the urology nursing staff to clean and sterilize ureteroscopes is a reasonable means to reduce processing-related damages.",M2
19442721,"Design and influence of gamma-irradiation on the biopharmaceutical properties of nanoparticles containing an antigenic complex from Brucella ovis.Despite vaccination campaigns, brucellosis is still one of the most common bacterial zoonosis in the world. This work describes the development of a novel formulation strategy to the delivery of the Brucella ovis antigenic extract (HS) into ovine mucosal surfaces. Thus, HS was entrapped in conventional and mannosylated poly(anhydride) nanoparticles by the solvent displacement method, and the resulting nanosystems were gamma-irradiated to accomplish the <e>sterilization</e> required for the ophthalmic administration route. Sterilization, at either 10 kGy or 25 kGy, did not modify the size, morphology and antigen content of the nanoparticles. Similarly, the integrity and antigenicity of the entrapped antigen were not affected by gamma-irradiation. The 25 kGy gamma-irradiation dose seemed to influence negatively the HS release from the carriers. However, and in accordance with the Pearson's correlation, all the release patterns followed a similar tendency. Furthermore, the stability of the vaccine systems on lachrymal and nasal ovine fluids, showed that gamma-irradiation had no significant effects on the vaccine systems. Since all the vaccine systems accomplished the pharmacopoeial biological tests required for gamma-irradiation doses under 25 kGy, these results are highly suggestive for the use of HS loaded poly(anhydride) nanoparticles as an efficient vaccine delivery system for brucellosis immunoprophylaxis, especially for ophthalmic administration.",M2
19441113,"Optimal <e>sterilization</e> method for the zirconia/alumina composites used for total hip replacements.Zirconia/alumina composite ceramics have been recently developed for total hip arthroplasty because of their excellent mechanical properties and tribologic characteristics. All such materials used clinically must be easily sterilized, but no report has been issued concerning methods for sterilizing zirconia/alumina composite hip prostheses. Here, we show that 50 kGy of gamma irradiation effectively sterilizes both the surfaces and interiors of these materials. In addition, it was found that the commonly used ethylene oxide and 25-kGy gamma irradiation sterilization methods inadequately sterilize deep inside the femoral head. Moreover, no changes in the chemical or mechanical properties of the composites were noted after exposure to 50-kGy gamma irradiation. We suggest that 50-kGy gamma irradiation is an optimal sterilization method for zirconia/alumina composite total hip replacements.",M2
19438002,"Preparation of stable chitosan-carboxymethyl dextran nanoparticles.Chitosan-carboxymethyl dextran nanoparticles (CHI-CMD NPs) were prepared by the formation of polyelectrolyte complex via the interaction of the positive charged amino group of chitosan and the negative charged carboxyl group of carboxymethyl dextran. Biocompatible organic reagents such as lactic acid, phosphate-buffered saline, and carbonate-bicarbonate buffer were used to make CHI-CMD NPs. The pH value of narrowly distributive CHI-CMD NP suspension was close to the physiological value of 6.8, which made it possible for it to be directly applied in an in vitro test without further additional operations. In the presence of sugars (30 mM), the colloidal stability of CHI-CMD NPs could be extended to 5 to 7 days when the particle size could be maintained within a nanometer scale, while the addition of xylose or lactose was found to most effectively extend the colloidal stability of CHI-CMD NPs to 10 days. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the structural integrity of CHI-CMD NPs was not destroyed after high steam pressure <e>sterilization</e> (121 degrees C, 30 min), which confirmed the autoclavable property of CHI-CMD NPs.",M2
19435226,"Influence of pressurization rate and pressure pulsing on the inactivation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores during pressure-assisted thermal processing.Pressure-assisted thermal processing (PATP) is an emerging <e>sterilization</e> technology in which a combination of pressure (500 to 700 MPa) and temperature (90 to 120 degrees C) are used to inactivate bacterial spores. The objective of this study was to examine the role of pressurization rate and pressure pulsing in enhancing PATP lethality to the bacterial spore. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TMW 2.479 spore suspensions were prepared in deionized water at three inoculum levels (1.1 x 10(9), 1.4 x 10(8), and 1.3 x 10(6) CFU/ml), treated at two pressurization rates (18.06 and 3.75 MPa/s), and held at 600 MPa and 105 degrees C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 min. Experiments were carried out using custom-fabricated, high-pressure microbial kinetic testing equipment. Single and double pulses with equivalent pressure-holding times (1 to 3 min) were investigated by using the spore suspension containing 1.4 x 10(8) CFU/ml. Spore survivors were enumerated by pour plating, using Trypticase soy agar after incubation at 32 degrees C for 2 days. During short pressure-holding times (&lt; or = 2 min), PATP treatment with the slow pressurization rate provided enhanced spore reduction over that of the fast pressurization rate. However, these differences diminished with extended pressure-holding times. After a 5-min pressure-holding time, B. amyloliquefaciens population decreased about 6 log CFU/ml, regardless of pressurization rate and inoculum level. Double-pulse treatment enhanced PATP spore lethality by approximately 2.4 to 4 log CFU/ml, in comparison to single pulse for a given pressure-holding time. In conclusion, pressure pulsing considerably increases the efficacy of PATP treatment against bacterial spores. Contribution of pressurization rate to PATP spore lethality varies with duration of pressure holding.",M2
19429300,"Formulation, stability and degradation kinetics of intravenous cinnarizine lipid emulsion.Cinnarizine was loaded in the lipid emulsion to develop an intravenous formulation with good physical and chemical stability. High-pressure homogenization was used to prepare the lipid emulsion. The factors influencing the stability of cinnarizine lipid emulsion, such as different drug loading methods, pH, temperature, <e>sterilization</e> methods and sterilization time were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatograph. The degradation of cinnarizine in aqueous solution and lipid emulsion both followed apparent first-order kinetics. A possible degradation mechanism was postulated by the bell-shaped pH-rate profile of cinnarizine. Localization of the drug in the interfacial lecithin layer significantly improved the chemical stability of cinnarizine and its stabilizing mechanism was thoroughly discussed and proved. The activation energy of cinnarizine in lipid emulsion was calculated to be 51.27 kJ/mol which was similar to that in aqueous solution. This indicates that the stabilizing effect of the drug carrier on cinnarizine was not an alteration of the degradation reaction. In addition, shelf-life of cinnarizine in lipid emulsion was estimated to be 1471.6 days at 4 degrees C, which is much longer compared with 19.8 days in aqueous solution. The final products were stable enough to resist a 121 degrees C rotating steam sterilization for 15 min.",M2
19426349,"Heating and <e>sterilization</e> technology for long-duration space missions: transport processes in a reusable package.Long-duration space missions require a high-quality, shelf-stable food supply but must also contend with packaging waste after use. We have developed a package, adapted from a military pouch, that enables heating of foods to serving temperature. After the food is consumed, the package may be reused for containment and sterilization of waste, and, potentially, for packaging and sterilizing foods grown on a Mars base. Packages are equipped with electrodes to permit ohmic heating of internal constituents. Heat transfer within the package was modeled using the energy transport equation, coupled with the Laplace equation for electric field strength distribution. The model was verified by temperature measurements during a sample experimental run, and it was used to optimize the package design. Waste sterilization within the package was also studied and confirmed. Mass transfer (electrode component migration) was studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; the findings have shown concentrations within products to be well below current daily dietary exposure levels. Microbiological studies for sterilization indicated the need for package redesign to ensure parallel electrode configuration, as well as the use of supplemental external heaters along the nonelectrode walls of the package. Temperature profiles during heating of these packages have been determined.",M2
19388270,"[Low temperature oxygen plasma <e>sterilization</e> effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa]OBJECTIVE: Low temperature oxygen plasma was used to sterilize the Pseudomonas aeruginosa samples on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets in a self-designed reactor that included the discharge area, afterglow area and remote area. METHODS: Before and after plasma treatment, the cell morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cell wall or cell membrane cracking was testified to determine the content of protein by using coomassie light blue technique. Besides, double Langmuir probe and electron spin resonance spectroscopy were used to determine the temperature of electrons (ions) and the concentration of free radicals, respectively. RESULTS: Under the treatment time of 30 s,the germicidal effects were 4.2, 3.8 and 2.6 respectively in the three areas. SEM observations showed that the plasma activity cracks the cell wall and cell membrane, resulting in cellular content leakage. In addition,the results from electron spin resonance spectroscopy and double Langmuir electron probe showed that electrons, ions and oxygen free radicals played important roles in sterilization in the discharge area, but only oxygen free radicals acted to sterilize the bacteria in the afterglow area and the remote area. CONCLUSION: The active species can be separated effectively in this reaction equipment, and we further elucidated the mechanisms of plasma sterilization in the remote plasma field.",M2

We have examined the biomedical and physicochemical performance of this instrument. Prokariotic and gram-negative Escherichia coli and eukariotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed by silver electrolysis in 18 min and 1 min, respectively. Prokariotic and gram-positive Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus, which are most resistant to autoclave and gas sterilization, respectively, were killed by silver electrolysis within 20 min. Prokariotic and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also killed by silver electrolysis in 10 min. The intensity distribution of the ultrasonic levitation waves was homogeneous throughout the tank. The concentration of ozone gas was 2.57 mg/ kg. The concentration of dissolved silver ions was around 0.17 mg/L. The disulfide bond in proteins was confirmed to be destroyed by silver electrolysis.",M2
19339568,"Gamma inert <e>sterilization</e>: a solution to polyethylene oxidation?BACKGROUND: In the 1990s, oxidation was found to occur in ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene total joint replacement components following gamma irradiation and prolonged shelf aging in air. Orthopaedic manufacturers developed barrier packaging to reduce oxidation during and after radiation sterilization. The present study explores the hypothesis that polyethylene components sterilized in a low-oxygen environment undergo similar in vivo oxidative mechanisms as inserts sterilized in air. In addition, the potential influence of the different sterilization processes on the wear performance of the polyethylene components was examined. METHODS: An analysis of oxidation, wear, and surface damage was performed for forty-eight acetabular liners and 123 tibial inserts. The mean implantation time was 12.3+/-3.7 years for thirty-one acetabular liners that had been gamma sterilized in air and 4.0+/-2.5 years for the seventeen acetabular liners that had been gamma sterilized in inert gas. The mean implantation time was 11.0+/-3.2 years for the twenty-six tibial inserts that had been sterilized in air and 2.8+/-2.2 years for the ninety-seven tibial inserts that had been gamma sterilized in inert gas. Oxidation and hydroperoxide levels were characterized in loaded and unloaded regions of the inserts. RESULTS: Measurable oxidation and oxidation potential were observed in all cohorts. The oxidation and hydroperoxide levels were regional. Surfaces with access to body fluids were more heavily oxidized than protected bearing surfaces were. This variation appeared to be greater in historical (gamma-in-air-sterilized) components. Regarding wear performance, historical and conventional acetabular liners showed similar wear penetration rates, whereas a low incidence of delamination was confirmed for the conventional tibial inserts in the first decade of implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study explores the impact of industry-wide changes in sterilization practices for polyethylene. We found lower oxidation and oxidation potential in the conventional acetabular liners and tibial inserts that had been gamma sterilized in inert gas as compared with the historical components that had been gamma sterilized in air. However, we also found strong evidence that conventional components undergo mechanisms of in vivo oxidation similar to those observed following gamma irradiation in air. In addition, gamma sterilization in inert gas did not provide polyethylene with a significant improvement in terms of wear resistance as compared with gamma sterilization in air, except for a lower incidence of delamination in the first decade of implantation for tibial inserts.",M2

19381829,"Formulation and performance characterization of radio-sterilized  progestin-only  microparticles intended for contraception.The aim of this study was to formulate and characterize a microparticulate system of progestin-only contraceptive. Another objective was to evaluate the effect of gamma radio-<e>sterilization</e> on in vitro and in vivo drug release characteristics. Levonorgestrel (LNG) microspheres were fabricated using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) by a novel solvent evaporation technique. The formulation was optimized for drug/polymer ratio, emulsifier concentration, and process variables like speed of agitation and evaporation method. The drug to polymer ratio of 1:5 gave the optimum encapsulation efficiency. Speed of agitation influenced the spherical shape of the microparticles, lower speeds yielding less spherical particles. The speed did not have a significant influence on the drug payloads. A combination of stabilizers viz. methyl cellulose and poly vinyl alcohol with in-water solvent evaporation technique yielded microparticles without any free drug crystals on the surface. This aspect significantly eliminated the in vitro dissolution  burst effect . The residual solvent content was well within the regulatory limits. The microparticles passed the test for sterility and absence of pyrogens. In vitro dissolution conducted on the product before and after gamma radiation sterilization at 2.5 Mrad indicated no significant difference in the drug release patterns. The drug release followed zero-order kinetics in both static and agitation conditions of dissolution testing. The in vivo studies conducted in rabbits exhibited LNG release up to 1 month duration with drug levels maintained within the effective therapeutic window.",M2
