11557633,"Plasma hormone levels and central c-Fos expression in ferrets after systemic administration of cholecystokinin.<e>Posterior pituitary</e> hormone secretion and central neural expression of the immediate-early gene product c-Fos was examined in adult ferrets after intravenous administration of CCK octapeptide. Pharmacological doses of CCK (1, 5, 10, or 50 microg/kg) did not induce emesis, but elicited behavioral signs of nausea and dose-related increases in plasma vasopressin (AVP) levels without significant increases in plasma oxytocin (OT) levels. CCK activated neuronal c-Fos expression in several brain stem viscerosensory regions, including a dose-related activation of neurons in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Activated brain stem neurons included catecholaminergic and glucagon-like peptide-1-positive cells in the DVC and ventrolateral medulla. In the forebrain, activated neurons were prevalent in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and also were observed in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Activated hypothalamic neurons included cells that were immunoreactive for AVP, OT, and corticotropin-releasing factor. Comparable patterns of brain stem and forebrain c-Fos activation were observed in ferrets after intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride (LiCl; 86 mg/kg), a classic emetic agent. However, LiCl activated more neurons in the area postrema and fewer neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract compared with CCK. Together with results from previous studies in rodents, our findings support the view that nauseogenic treatments activate similar central neural circuits in emetic and nonemetic species, despite differences in treatment-induced emesis and pituitary hormone secretion.",M1
9863366,"[Hormones of the posterior region of the hypophyseal gland]Arginine vasopressin is the main hormone involved in the regulation of body fluid osmolality. The hormone is released by the <e>posterior pituitary</e> whenever water deprivation causes an increased plasma osmolality or whenever the cardiovascular system is challenged by hypovolaemia and/or hypotension. The main site of action of this hormone is the renal collecting duct, but vasopressin is also a potent vasopressor and neurotransmitter, it has a role in the secretion of corticotrophin, in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, temperature and other visceral functions. Vasopressin also promotes the release of coagulation factors by vascular endothelium and increases platelet aggregability. In addition to its classical contractile effect on uterine myometrial and mammary glandular myoepithelial cells, oxytocin acts as neurotransmitter, stimulates endometrial prostaglandin production, pituitary prolactin secretion, luteolysis, sperm transport and natriuresis, and may play a role in immune function. Sensorial stimuli arising from the cervix and vagina as well as stimulation of the breast can induce secretion of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. There are many vasopressin and oxytocin analogues (agonists and antagonists) that are synthetized with the goal of increasing duration of action and selectivity for the receptor subtypes, while non-peptide antagonists are orally active. The oxytocin and the vasopressin V1a, V1b and V2 receptors have recently been cloned and shown to form a sub-family within the large superfamily of G-protein-linked receptors. Renal V2 receptors mediate vasopressin-induced water reabsorption via induction of intracellular cAMP production in collecting duct cells. Most remaining actions of vasopressin on blood vessel constriction, liver glycogenolysis, platelet adhesion, adrenal angiotensin II secretion and certain brain functions are mediated via V1a-type receptors that are coupled to a Gq/11 protein. V1 receptor activation leads to stimulation of phospholipases C, D and A2, and an increase in intracellular calcium. Vasopressin stimulates pituitary corticotrophin release via a third vasopressin receptor type (V1b) which is present in corticotrophs. Oxytocin induces myometrial contraction, endometrial prostaglandin F2a production, mammary gland milk ejection, renal natriuresis and specific sexual, affilitative and maternal behaviours via oxytocin receptors which are also coupled to a G1/11 protein. Although only one oxytocin receptor type has been cloned so far, recent binding studies indicate that uterine endometrial oxytocin receptors may constitute a distinct receptor subtype. Expression of oxytocin receptors have relevant up- and down-regulation by oestrogens and progesterone.",M1
8771561,"Different effects of the serotonergic agonists buspirone and sumatriptan on the <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormonal responses to hypoglycemia in humans.The responses of serum oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) to the serotonergic HT1A agonist buspirone (15 mg p.o.) or the HTD1 agonist sumatriptan (6 mg injected subcutaneously) were evaluated in 7 normal men either in basal conditions or during an insulin (0.15 iu/kg as an i.v. bolus) tolerance test (ITT). Neither buspirone nor sumatriptan administration modified the basal secretion of AVP and OT. Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was unable to change neither AVP nor OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. On the other hand, the pretreatment with the 5HT1A agonist buspirone significantly enhanced the OT response during hypoglycemia, without modifying the AVP rise. The results of this study suggest that serotonergic 5HT1A receptors may interact with hypoglycemia in the stimulation of OT, but not AVP secretion.",M1
8511335,"Neurohypophyseal peptides and psychiatric diseases.The study of neurohypophyseal function in various neuropsychiatric diseases is interesting because: (1) The main neurohypophyseal peptides vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) share by themselves modulatory influence on behavior. (2) Hypothalamo-<e>posterior pituitary</e> axis is directly influenced by modifications of central neurotransmitter metabolism involved in behavior control.",M1
1795531,"Prolonged infusion of Panax ginseng saponins into the rat does not alter the chemical and kinetic profile of hormones from the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.The effect of prolonged administration (i.v.) of commercially available Panax ginseng extract (PGE) on the kinetic profile of the hormones from the posterior pituitary (PP) was studied in male Wistar rats. The rats were infused with 7.36 mg kg-1 h-1 of PGE for 8 days while the hormones from the PP were pulse-labeled at their place of translation in the hypothalamus. The concentration of labeled hormones was analyzed after increasing chase time intervals and compared to controls which were infused with the same volume of isotonic saline. The study revealed: (1) Prolonged administration of PGE prevents the drop in body weight during the 48-h period following stereotaxic surgery. At the end of the ginseng infusion period body weight increased as seen in controls. (2) The concentration of labeled oxytocin, oxytocin-neurophysin, the metabolically converted form of oxytocin-neurophysin and arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin per single PP did not change under prolonged ginseng administration. (3) The amino acid pattern from the ventromedial hypothalamus was not different from controls. From our results we conclude that the physiological effect of PGE in the rat is not based on changes in the translation, conversion rate or the chemical structure of hormones from the PP.",M1
1675505,"Feed intake and rumen motility in dwarf goats. Effects of some alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, prostaglandins and <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormones.The purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that drug-induced changes in rumen contractions influence feed intake in dwarf goats. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of clonidine (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 10 min), xylazine (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 10 min), and PGF-2 alpha (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) caused bradycardia and inhibition of rumen contractions. However, no appetite-stimulating effect of these drugs was observed. Other clinical changes induced by the alpha-adrenergic agonists included slight sedation and a decrease in body temperature; all clinical effects of clonidine and xylazine were partly antagonized by tolazoline pretreatment (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 30 min). These results suggest that the CNS control of feeding differs in ruminants and monogastric species. In dwarf goats fasted for 2 h, i.v. administration of oxytocin (0.01 IU kg-1 min-1 for 15 min), vasopressin (0.01 IU kg-1 min-1 for 15 min), octapressin (0.003 IU kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) or PGE1 (0.8 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) did not change feeding behaviour during the two observation periods (0-30 min and 180-210 min after drug infusion, respectively). In previous studies, similar doses of these drugs induced changes in heart rate and inhibition of rumen contraction in goats. These findings demonstrate that drug-induced changes in forestomach contractions do not simply cause changes in feeding behaviour. The i.v. infusion of the PGF 2 alpha analogues etiproston (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 15 min), luprostiol (30 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 15 min), cloprostenol (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) and tiaprost (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) induced hypophagic effects and stimulated intestinal propulsion.",M1
2333735,"Influence of neurohypophysectomy on the renal actions of aldosterone in the adrenalectomized rat.The influence of aldosterone administration on urine flow, Na+ and K+ excretion was examined in hypotonic saline infused, Inactin anesthetised rats following removal of the adrenals or adrenals and <e>posterior pituitary</e>. Plasma adrenal steroid levels were considerably depressed but still detectable 10-14 days after adrenalectomy. Removal of the posterior pituitary markedly reduced Na+ excretion in adrenalectomized animals implying that Na+ retention following neurohypophysectomy is not dependent on adrenal gland function. In adrenalectomized rats aldosterone administration at 42 pmol/min reduced Na+ excretion and urine flow without significantly changing K+ excretion, though plasma K+ was reduced. In adrenalectomized/neurohypophysectomized rats aldosterone further reduced the already low rate of Na+ excretion and increased K+ excretion, though there was no observable effect on urine flow. The results obtained indicate that the Na(+)-retaining actions of aldosterone are largely independent of posterior pituitary influence. The K(+)-losing action of aldosterone was, however, only observed in animals in which the posterior pituitary was absent.",M1
2735459,"Anterior and <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormone release induced in sheep by cholecystokinin.The effect of an intravenous bolus injection of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8; 0.85 micrograms/kg) on the release of cortisol, prolactin, vasopressin, and oxytocin was studied in sheep (n = 10). Concentrations of these hormones were measured in blood samples taken before (-10, 0 min) and after (5, 10, 20 min) administration of a saline vehicle or vehicle + CCK. Following CCK treatment, levels of cortisol were raised after 10 and 20 min, prolactin and vasopressin concentrations were increased after 5 min, and oxytocin secretion was unaffected.",M1
3149733,"Identification of neurohypophysial peptides in the ovaries of several mammalian and nonmammalian species.Ovarian tissue from a variety of mammalian and nonmammalian species were extracted in acid. All extracts contained both oxytocin- and vasopressin-like immunoreactivites as determined by radioimmunoassay. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of oxytocin in all ovarian extracts examined. This was in contrast to the corresponding <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland which other workers have shown do not necessarily contain the oxytocin peptide. It is suggested that oxytocin may play an important role in ovarian function in species of differing phylogeny.",M1
2450457,"Hormonal and metabolic effects of calcium channel antagonists in man.Calcium is a component of many metabolic reactions. By blocking calcium transport across cell membranes, calcium channel antagonists can therefore theoretically affect numerous metabolic and hormonal processes. In vitro studies have often documented just such an effect. Because of the expanding use and prevalence of calcium antagonists in clinical practice, a review of their in vivo effects on hormones and metabolism is warranted. The effect on glucoregulatory hormones, calcium regulatory hormones, anterior and <e>posterior pituitary</e> secretion, the renin-angiotensin axis, plasma catecholamines, and plasma lipids and lipoproteins is herein reviewed. The various calcium antagonists, by virtue of their distinct chemical structures, influence metabolism in their own unique manner. Despite the widespread involvement of calcium in hormone action, however, calcium channel antagonists have little dramatic impact on hormone regulation. This is, in part, due to the drug dosage used in clinical practice and to the inherent compensatory mechanisms built into normal endocrine function. The development of agents with greater and more potent metabolic specificity, however, coupled with the ability to target drug action, holds promise for expanded therapeutic application in the future.",M1
3029255,"The neurohypophysis: recent developments.The hormones of the neurohypophysis, vasopressin and oxytocin, have now been shown to be synthesized as part of a prohormone complex that includes a vasopressin-neurophysin and oxytocin-neurophysin, respectively. In addition, for vasopressin, there is a glycopeptide as part of the prohormone. For each hormone the prohormone is packaged into neurosecretory granules and transported via axons to the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland. In addition to this  classic  system, axons containing neurohypophyseal hormones project to the median eminence for release into portal vessels, and to other areas of the brain and spinal cord where the peptides may function as neurotransmitters rather than as hormones. As neurotransmitters, the neurohypophyseal hormones may be involved in the regulation of certain autonomic functions. Vasopressin and oxytocin are secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid where there is a diurnal rhythmic secretion of the peptides in several animal species (some species have a predominant rhythm of vasopressin and others a rhythm of oxytocin). Neurohypophyseal peptides are synthesized in some non-neuronal tissues where the function is unknown, and recently a novel peptide with similarities to oxytocin and vasotocin has been identified. The relationship of this novel peptide to the neurohypophyseal peptides is unknown. These new developments are likely to elucidate many new functions for the hormones of the neurohypophysis.",M1
3625541,"The influence of neurohypophysial hormones on renal function in the acutely hypophysectomized rat.1. Renal function and the effect of neurohypophysial hormone replacement was investigated in anaesthetized, acutely hypophysectomized, male rats. 2. Although urine production was only slightly lower over the 8 h post-operative study period in hypophysectomized rats, sodium excretion was greatly depressed reaching only 3.5 +/- 1.4 mumol/min compared with a peak of 13.2 +/- 1.0 mumol/min in intact animals. 3. In association with a decline in mean arterial blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate in hypophysectomized rats fell to 2.1 +/- 0.2 ml/min 8 h after operation by comparison with a mean rate in intact rats of 3.2 +/- 0.2 ml/min. 4. Plasma corticosterone levels were much lower in hypophysectomized (4 +/- 2 ng/ml) than in intact (36 +/- 4 ng/ml) rats, plasma aldosterone was reduced to a lesser extent (0.41 +/- 0.08 compared with 0.76 +/- 0.04 ng/ml). While oxytocin was not detectable in hypophysectomized rat plasma, trace levels of vasopressin (0.16 +/- 0.04 mu u./ml) were found. In intact unanaesthetized rats basal plasma levels of oxytocin were 0.32 +/- 0.13 mu u./ml and vasopressin were 0.85 +/- 0.19 mu u./ml. 5. Administration of oxytocin at 150 mu u./min, which produced plasma hormone levels (24.0 +/- 2.5 mu u./ml) greatly in excess of basal concentrations, increased renal sodium excretion but did not alter urine flow. Oxytocin administration at the lower rate of 15 mu u./min producing plasma hormone levels of 2.60 +/- 0.1 mu u./ml, did not alter renal sodium excretion. 6. Arginine vasopressin administered at 12 mu u./min induced plasma hormone levels of 1.54 +/- 0.09 mu u./ml and produced a large antidiuresis and small increase in the rate of sodium excretion. 7. The natriuretic response to vasopressin was potentiated by concurrent administration of oxytocin at 15 mu u./min. The peak sodium excretion of 5.8 +/- 1.0 mumol/min, however, remained well below that seen in intact rats. 8. It is concluded that, as restoration of <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormones at or above the physiological range only partially restored sodium excretion, the absence of anterior pituitary factors may also contribute directly or indirectly to the renal sodium retention of the hypophysectomized rat.",M1
4067216,"[Spontaneous rupture of the liver in pregnancy. Case study and review of the literature]The authors report a case of  spontaneous  rupture of the liver in a woman of 35 years of age. This occurred immediately after post-partum eclampsia. It was not possible to obtain complete haemostasis using absorbable haemostatic compresses along the convexity of the liver. Complete cessation of bleeding only occurred after the operation when <e>posterior pituitary</e> abstracts had been transfused. The patient died 53 days after the initial procedure from a high gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. A study of the literature shows that this rare condition is most probably a complication of toxaemia of pregnancy but the physio-pathology of these liver lesions is ill-understood. The clinical picture is in two phases--the first corresponds to the formation of a sub-capsular haematoma and the second to the intra-peritoneal rupture of this haematoma. The prognosis for this condition is poor, the maternal mortality ranging from 56%-75%. The prognosis is linked to the speed with which the diagnosis is made and surgical intervention is carried out. This should be done before the capsule of the liver ruptures. Haemostasis is nearly always best obtained by using haemostatic compression with packs but haemostasis is not always adequate, particularly if there are several lesions in both lobes of the liver. This case history shows that using posterior pituitary abstracts in transfusion can be helpful.",M1

6406529,"Characterization of neurophysin-vasopressin prohormones in human <e>posterior pituitary</e> tissue.To better characterize putative neurophysin-vasopressin prohormones in human posterior pituitary tissue, we extracted human posterior pituitary glands in 0.1 M HCl and isolated the higher molecular weight neurophysin-immunoreactive proteins. Sephadex G-75 gel filtration in 0.1 M formic acid with 6 M urea showed four distinct peaks of neurophysin immunoreactivity. Analysis of isolated lyophilized fractions of these peaks by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed neurophysin-immunoreactive proteins at molecular weights of 10,000 daltons (79-87% of the total neurophysins), 19,000-20,000 daltons (10-16%), 26,000-30,000 daltons (1-2%), and a broad range of 30,000- to 100,000-dalton immunoreactivity from the void volume (V0) peak (2-3%). The 19,000- to 20,000-dalton and 26,000- to 30,000-dalton proteins were stable after both heating and treatment with reducing agents, but could be converted by chymotrypsin proteolysis to 10,000-dalton neurophysins and 3,000- to 5,000-dalton AVP-immunoreactive proteins. In contrast, the neurophysin immunoreactivity in the V0 peak was broken down to lower molecular weight neurophysin- and AVP-immunoreactive proteins by heating alone. Extraction of human posterior pituitaries in the presence of either [125I]human AVP-neurophysin or [35S] cysteine-labeled monkey neurophysin showed that no labeled neurophysin eluted in the areas of the 19,000- to 20,000- or 26,000- to 30,000-dalton proteins, but a significant fraction of the [35S]monkey neurophysin eluted in the V0. These data suggest that the 19,000- to 20,000- and 26,000- to 30,000-dalton human neurophysins represent stable proteins which are probably common precursor molecules for neurophysin and AVP, but the greater than 30,000-dalton neurophysins found in the V0 appear to be aggregates of neurophysins, neurophysin precursors, AVP, oxytocin, and probably other proteins and lipids as well, rather than very high molecular weight precursor proteins.",M1

The effects, consisting mainly of a dose-dependent stimulation of certain behaviors, were demonstrated in three different behavioral tests. The type of the induced behaviors was dependent on the experimental conditions: If the mice were placed into a cage after the injection of the peptides, excessive scratching and grooming behaviors were induced. If they were exposed to stressful environmental influences, however, escape-directed activity was markedly stimulated with only minimal elevation of scratching and grooming behaviors. Very low doses down to less than 1 nanogram per mouse were effective. The effects can be observed after central, but not after peripheral application of the peptides and are mediated by a mechanism that displays some degree of specificity. An activity unit for the behavior-altering potency of the peptides was defined. A role of neurohypophyseal hormones or related peptides in the regulation of motivation and behavioral arousal is suggested.",M1

701754,"[The onset of labour. A reminder of its physiology (author's transl)]Until recently the onset of labour was considered to be due to changes in maternal hormone levels which were represented by a drop in the progesterone and a rise in the oxytocin levels. Recent work has shown that onset of labour is associated with several phenomena which take place parallel to one another, and they are immunological, haemodynamic, biochemical, mechanical, psychological and hormonal. The last of these are far and away the most important and have three sources: a placental source; a maternal source of sex steroids, oxytocin and prostaglandins and; of fetal origin, adrenal and <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormones. It seems that the prostaglandins and the maturation of the fetal brain are at present considered to be all-important. Better knowledge of the physiology of the onset of labour has led to greater success in pharmaco-dynamically induced labour, but this is not yet truly physiological. Therefore except in cases of pathology it does not seem right to undertake the risks of inducing labour more or less systematically.",M1
208691,"[Subcellular distribution of hypothalamic neurohormones and in vitro stimulation of their release]Neuronal compartments can be separated by differential spinning or by centrifugation on continuous or discontinuous density gradients. Application of these fractionation techniques to brain structures containing neurosecretory neurons shows that LHRH, somatostatin and a non dopamine prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF) are exclusively recovered from synaptosomal fractions. This indicates that biologically and/or immunologically reactive forms of these hormones are almost entirely concentrated in nerve-endings of neurosecretory neurons. In contrast, other neuropeptides - <e>posterior pituitary</e> hormone, but also TRH, a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P or endorphins - are also found in supernatant fractions. The existence of multiple molecular forms of neuropeptides is likely to explain these differences. Current theories postulate that they are synthetized on ribosomes as precursor forms. Their active structure is only achieved by enzymatic splitting of the pre- or the prohormone within nerve endings. This mode of synthesis is probably common to all neuropeptides, although it has only been well substantiated in a few cases, in particular for the hormones of the posterior pituitary. Thus, the lack of immunologically detectable LHRH or SRIF outside the synaptosomal fraction may reflect masking of the active immunological sites by inert peptide chains associated with prohormonal forms. Fractionation methods can also be applied to physiological or pharmacological experiments. In particular, they permit to characterize, on presynaptic membranes of neurosecretory neurons, specific receptors to neurotransmitters involved in the control of neurohormone secretion. Interaction of dopamine and acetylcholine with LHRH and CRF release are presented as examples of such applications.",M1

The administration of uterine extract reduced the duration to 15.9 days.  Administration of posterior pituitary extract reduced the duration of pseudopregnancy in the pseudopregnant hysterectomized rats to 12.4 days (p less than .001).  Aspirin treatment did not effect the length of pseudopregnancy.  It is concluded that there is a definite pituitary-utero-ovarian relationship.  The neurohypophyseal hormones may be involved in the mechanism of regression of corpora lutea of pseudopregnancy in rats.",M1

Nonhormonal immunoreactivity associated with the plasma proteins is eliminated by acetone precipitation before assay, leaving unaltered a component that is immunologically and chromatographically indistinguishable from standard AVP. Storage of plasma results in a decline in AVP concentration and, thus, must be carefully regulated. The plasma AVP values obtained by our method approximate the anticipated levels and vary in accordance with physiologic expections. In recumbent normal subjects, plasma AVP ranged from (mean +/-SD) 5.4+/-3.4 pg/ml after fluid deprivation to 1.4+/-0.8 pg/ml after water loading, and correlated significantly with both plasma osmolality (r=0.52; P&lt;0.001) and urine osmolality (r=0.77; P&lt;0.001). After fluid restriction, plasma AVP was uniformly normal relative to plasma osmolality in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia but was distinctly subnormal in all patients with pituitary diabetes insipidus. The infusion of physiologic amounts of <e>posterior pituitary</e> extract caused a dose-related rise in plasma vasopressin that afterwards declined at the expected rate (t(1/2)=22.5+/-4 min). We conclude that, when used appropriately, our radioimmunoassay method provides a useful way of assessing AVP function in man.",M1

19900438,"A role of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in the regulation of pituitary development.The mammalian pituitary gland originates from two separate germinal tissues during embryonic development. The anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary are derived from Rathke's pouch, a pocket formed by an invagination of the oral ectoderm. The posterior lobe is derived from the infundibulum, which is formed by evagination of the neuroectoderm in the ventral diencephalon. Previous studies have shown that development of Rathke's pouch and the generation of distinct populations of hormone-producing endocrine cell lineages in the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes is regulated by a number of transcription factors expressed in the pouch and by inductive signals from the ventral diencephalon/infundibulum. However, little is known about factors that regulate the development of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe. In this study, we show that the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 is extensively expressed in the developing ventral diencephalon, including the infundibulum and the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Deletion of Lhx2 gene results in persistent cell proliferation, a complete failure of evagination of the neuroectoderm in the ventral diencephalon, and defects in the formation of the distinct morphological features of the infundibulum and the posterior pituitary lobe. Rathke's pouch is formed and endocrine cell lineages are generated in the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes of the Lhx2 mutant. However, the shape and organization of the pouch and the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes are severely altered due to the defects in development of the infundibulum and the posterior lobe. Our study thus reveals an essential role for Lhx2 in the regulation of posterior pituitary development and suggests a mechanism whereby development of the posterior lobe may affect the development of the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland.",M2
19805236,"Secretin as a neurohypophysial factor regulating body water homeostasis.Hypothalamic magnocellular neurons express either one of the neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin or oxytocin, along with different neuropeptides or neuromodulators. Axonal terminals of these neurons are generally accepted to release solely the two hormones but not others into the circulation. Here, we show that secretin, originally isolated from upper intestinal mucosal extract, is present throughout the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial axis and that it is released from the <e>posterior pituitary</e> under plasma hyperosmolality conditions. In the hypothalamus, it stimulates vasopressin expression and release. Considering these findings together with our previous findings that show a direct effect of secretin on renal water reabsorption, we propose here that secretin works at multiple levels in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and kidney to regulate water homeostasis. Findings presented here challenge previous understanding regarding the neurohypophysis and could provide new concepts in treating disorders related to osmoregulation.",M2

19540855,"Oxytocin-induced elevation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, cyclic ADP-ribose or Ca(2+) concentrations is involved in autoregulation of oxytocin secretion in the hypothalamus and <e>posterior pituitary</e> in male mice.Locally released oxytocin (OT) activates OT receptors (2.1:OXY:1:OT:) in neighboring neurons in the hypothalamus and their terminals in the posterior pituitary, resulting in further OT release, best known in autoregulation occurring during labor or milk ejection in reproductive females. OT also plays a critical role in social behavior of non-reproductive females and even in males in mammals from rodents to humans. Social behavior is disrupted when elevation of free intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and OT secretion are reduced in male and female CD38 knockout mice. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether ADP-ribosyl cyclase-dependent signaling is involved in OT-induced OT release for social recognition in males, independent from female reproduction, and to determine its molecular mechanism. Here, we report that ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was increased by OT in crude membrane preparations of the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary in male mice, and that OT elicited an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in the isolated terminals over a period of 5 min. The increases in cyclase and [Ca(2+)](i) were partially inhibited by nonspecific protein kinase inhibitors and a protein kinase C specific inhibitor, calphostin C. Subsequently, OT-induced OT release was also inhibited by calphostin C to levels inhibited by vasotocin, an OT receptor antagonist, and 8-bromo-cADP-ribose. These results demonstrate that OT receptors are functionally coupled to membrane-bound ADP-ribosyl cyclase and/or CD38 and suggest that cADPR-mediated intracellular calcium signaling is involved in autoregulation of OT release, which is sensitive to protein kinase C, in the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis in male mice.",M2
19461161,"Spontaneous regression of isolated neurohypophyseal langerhans cell histiocytosis with diabetes insipidus.In pediatric and adolescent patients, the most common causes for a thickened pituitary stalk with central diabetes insipidus are germ cell tumors, lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LIN), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). We describe here a 13-year-old girl who had an abrupt onset of polyuria and polydipsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed thickening of the pituitary stalk, and loss of the physiological hyperintense signal of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland. Based on a histopathology, she was diagnosed as having LCH. Another LCH lesion was not detected. The prognoses for LCH patients with single-system and single-site are generally good so we decided on only simple observation. The lesion spontaneously regressed 3 months later, resembling a typical self-limiting course of LIN. In conclusion, the present case suggests that 1) radiological differential diagnosis between LIN and LCH is so difficult that histological confirmation is crucial for correct diagnosis, 2) some past cases of histologically-unconfirmed LIN can include LCH, 3) solitary neurohypophyseal LCH can shrink spontaneously up to near remission level.",M2
19293577,"Developmental abnormalities of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland.While the molecular mechanisms of anterior pituitary development are now better understood than in the past, both in animals and in humans, little is known about the mechanisms regulating posterior pituitary development. The posterior pituitary gland is formed by the evagination of neural tissue from the floor of the third ventricle. It consists of the distal axons of the hypothalamic magnocellular neurones that shape the neurohypophysis. After its downward migration, it is encapsulated together with the ascending ectodermal cells of Rathke's pouch which form the anterior pituitary. By the end of the first trimester, this development is completed and vasopressin and oxytocin can be detected in neurohypophyseal tissue. Abnormal posterior pituitary migration such as the ectopic posterior pituitary lobe appearing at the level of median eminence or along the pituitary stalk have been reported in idiopathic GH deficiency or in subjects with HESX1, LHX4 and SOX3 gene mutations. Another intriguing feature of abnormal posterior pituitary development involves genetic forms of posterior pituitary neurodegeneration that have been reported in autosomal-dominant central diabetes insipidus and Wolfram disease. Defining the phenotype of the posterior pituitary gland can have significant clinical implications for management and counseling, as well as providing considerable insight into normal and abnormal mechanisms of posterior pituitary development in humans.",M2
19289145,"Effects of galanin-monoaminergic interactions on vasopressin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal cell cultures.The effects of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), histamine (HA), adrenaline (ADR), noradrenaline (NADR) and K(+) administration on vasopressin (VP) secretion were studied in 13-14-day cultures of rat neurohypophyseal (NH) cells, and it was examined whether galanin (GAL) can modify the VP release enhancement induced by these monoaminergic compounds. An enzymatic dissociation technique was used to make the rat NH cell cultures. The VP contents of the supernatants of 14-day cultures were determined by radioimmunoassay. Following the administration of 10(-6) M GAL, the VP secretion into the supernatant media decreased. DA, 5-HT, ADR or NADR treatment increased the VP level substantially, while the enhancing effect of HA was more moderate. GAL administration before DA, ADR and NADR treatment prevented the VP concentration increase induced by DA, ADR or NADR. Preincubation with GAL reduced the 5-HT- or HA-induced VP level increases; the VP concentrations of the supernatant media remained above the control level. The GAL blocking effect was prevented by previous treatment with the GAL receptor antagonist galantid (M15). GAL had no effect on the VP level increase induced by K(+), which causes a non-specific hormone secretion. The results indicate that the changes in VP secretion induced by the monoaminergic system can be directly influenced by the GAL-ergic system. The interactions between the monoaminergic and GAL-ergic systems regarding VP secretion occur at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
19261974,"The role of orexin A in the control of prolactin and growth hormone secretions in sheep--in vitro study.Orexin A may play a special role in animals' sensitivity to the day length changes such as sheep. The localization of mRNA for prepro-orexin in the ovine hypothalamus was found to correspond to the pattern described in rodents. The results of that research also showed that the expression of the orexin gene depends on the length of a day and is higher during short days. Other study revealed that mRNA for orexin receptors (OxR)1 and OxR2 shows strong expression in the anterior, intermediate and <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobes of the rat. In addition, it was also found that in the anterior pituitary, OxR1 is more strongly expressed than OxR2. These observations indicate that the pituitary gland is capable of receiving the orexin signal. The aim of the study was to determine the interaction of season and orexin A on PRL and GH secretion by pituitary explants in short-term culture. Studies were carried out on pituitaries explants collected from lactating Polish Longwool sheep during the long (LD, May, n=5) and short day (SD, December, n=5). Glands were transected saggitally into halves, with each incubated in 2.5 ml of M-199 for 180-min in medium containing either 0 or 1000 ng/ml of orexin A. Treatment with orexin during LD increased significantly the secretion of PRL (P &lt; 0.01) and GH (P &lt; 0.05), compared to controls. In cultures from glands collected during SD, orexin significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased the secretion of both hormones, compared to controls. We conclude that the secretion of PRL and GH from the ovine pituitary gland is negatively responsive to orexin A during SD; whereas orexin may stimulate PRL and GH secretion during LD.",M2
19229337,"Cell-autonomous requirement for rx function in the mammalian retina and <e>posterior pituitary</e>.Rx is a paired-like homeobox gene that is required for vertebrate eye formation. Mice lacking Rx function do not develop eyes or the posterior pituitary. To determine whether Rx is required cell autonomously in these tissues, we generated embryonic chimeras consisting of wild type and Rx-/- cells. We found that in the eye, Rx-deficient cells cannot participate in the formation of the neuroretina, retina pigment epithelium and the distal part of the optic stalk. In addition, in the ventral forebrain, Rx function is required cell autonomously for the formation of the posterior pituitary. Interestingly, Rx-/- and wild type cells segregate before the morphogenesis of these two tissues begins. Our observations suggest that Rx function is not only required for the morphogenesis of the retina and posterior pituitary, but also prior to morphogenesis, for the sorting out of cells to form distinct fields of retinal/pituitary cells.",M2
19226266,"Likelihood of persistent GH deficiency into late adolescence: relationship to the presence of an ectopic or normally sited <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland.OBJECTIVES: The presence of an ectopic posterior pituitary gland (EPP) in childhood is associated with isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) and multiple pituitary hormone deficiency. GHD in late adolescence has been defined as a peak GH level &lt;5 microg/l. The aim of this study was to identify the likelihood of persistent GHD in late adolescence in patients with an EPP compared with those with a normally sited posterior pituitary (NPP). METHODS: In 18 patients with an EPP and 15 patients with an NPP, clinical, biochemical and radiographic data were collected. RESULTS: In the EPP vs. the NPP group, the change in peak GH levels at the end of growth was less (+0.4[95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.8 to 2.7] vs. +4.1[95%CI + 0.4 to +10.5] microg/l, P-value for ancova = 0.03, after adjustment for age and sex). Using a peak GH level of &lt;5 microg/l as a cut-off for GHD, 66% of EPP subjects compared with 40% of NPP subjects had GHD (P = 0.3). Hundred per cent of EPP subjects had a peak GH level on retesting &lt;10 microg/l, compared with 40% of NPP subjects (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: It is important to document GH status at the end of growth, even if there is a structural abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The presence of an EPP compared to an NPP increases the likelihood of persistent GHD by 26%. As all EPP patients had a peak GH level of &lt;10 microg/l, the cut-off for persistent GHD in late adolescence may need to be revised.",M2
19136969,"Synaptotagmin IV: a multifunctional regulator of peptidergic nerve terminals.Many members of the synaptotagmin (Syt) protein family bind Ca(2+) and trigger exocytosis, but some Syt proteins appear to have no Ca(2+)-dependent actions and their biological functions remain obscure. Syt IV is an activity-induced brain protein with no known Ca(2+)-dependent interactions and its subcellular localization and biological functions have sparked considerable controversy. We found Syt IV on both micro- and dense-core vesicles in <e>posterior pituitary</e> nerve terminals in mice. In terminals from Syt IV knockout mice compared with those from wild types, low Ca(2+) entry triggered more exocytosis, high Ca(2+) entry triggered less exocytosis and endocytosis was accelerated. In Syt IV knockouts, dense-core and microvesicle fusion was enhanced in cell-attached patches and dense-core vesicle fusion pores had conductances that were half as large as those in wild types. Given the neuroendocrine functions of the posterior pituitary, changes in Syt IV levels could be involved in endocrine transitions involving alterations in the release of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin.",M2
18987830,"Lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis and infundibulo-panhypophysitis regarded as lymphocytic hypophysitis variant.Lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH) was first reported by Saito et al. and Imura et al. as a cause of idiopathic central diabetes insipidus.

Histological examination reveals a <e>posterior pituitary</e> that is heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes with occasional plasma cells and other inflammatory cells. In early reports of the disorder, the lesion seemed to be limited to the neurohypophysis, but the present review showed cases with a combination of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus.

LINH and LIPH are essentially self-limited. In typical cases, conservative care with steroids and hormone replacement is recommended. Surgical intervention should be avoided because the natural course of the disorder may be self-limited. Pathophysiology of the disorder is still unknown. The unique clinical manifestations of the disorder are discussed and reviewed here.",M2
18953097,"Oxytocin release from the rat neurohypophysis into the blood: effects of tachykinin NK-1 and NK-2 receptors agonists and antagonists.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of peptide NK-1 and NK-2 receptors agonists and antagonists (and their natural ligands, i.e., substance P and neurokinin A) on the oxytocin (OT) secretion from the rat neurohypophysis into the blood. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of substance P (SP) or highly selective NK-1 receptor agonist--[(Sar(9),Met(O2)(11))-Substance P]-- significantly stimulated the OT secretion from the rat neurohypophysis into the general circulation. After icv injection of the NK-1 receptor antagonist--[(Tyr(6),D-Phe(7),D-His(9))-Substance P (6-11)]--the blood plasma OT concentration was significantly lower, when compared to vehicle-injected animals. On the other hand, the icv administered neurokinin A (NKA) and the NK-2 receptor agonist--[(beta-Ala(8))-Neurokinin A (4-10)]--were essentially inactive in modifying OT secretion. However, such injection of the NK-2 receptor antagonist--[(Tyr(5),D-Trp(6,8,9),Lys-NH2(10))-Neurokinin A (4-10)]--was found to diminish the blood plasma hormone concentration, when compared to vehicle-injected animals. The neurohypophysial content of OT was decreased in NKA-treated rats, but neither the NK-2 receptor agonist nor antagonist were able to affect the OT output from the rat <e>posterior pituitary</e>. The hypothalamic levels of OT were not modified by any of the studied peptides. The present data strongly indicate a major role for the tachykinin NK-1 receptor in SP- and/or NKA-dependent regulation of OT secretion from the rat neurohypophysis into the blood.",M2
18854396,"OTX2 loss of function mutation causes anophthalmia and combined pituitary hormone deficiency with a small anterior and ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e>.CONTEXT: Orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) is a transcription factor necessary for ocular and forebrain development. In humans, heterozygous mutations of OTX2 cause severe ocular malformations. However, whether mutations of OTX2 cause pituitary structural abnormalities or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) has not been clarified. OBJECTIVES: We surveyed the functional consequences of a novel OTX2 mutation that was detected in a patient with anophthalmia and CPHD. PATIENT: We examined a Japanese patient with growth disturbance, anophthalamia, and severe developmental delay. He showed deficiencies in GH, TSH, LH, FSH, and ACTH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small anterior pituitary gland, invisible stalk, ectopic posterior lobe, and Chiari malformation. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of OTX2 demonstrated a heterozygous two bases insertion [S136fsX178 (c.576-577insCT)] in exon 3. The mutant Otx2 protein localized to the nucleus, but did not activate the promoter of the HESX1 and POU1F1 gene, indicating a loss of function mutation. No dominant negative effect in the presence of wild-type Otx2 was observed. CONCLUSION: This case indicates that the OTX2 mutation is a cause of CPHD. Further study of more patients with OTX2 defects is necessary to clarify the clinical phenotypes and endocrine defects caused by OTX2 mutations.",M2

18462818,"Significance of the adrenergic system in the regulation of vasopressin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal tissue cultures.The effects of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) on vasopressin (VP) secretion were studied in 13-14-day cultures of isolated rat neurohypophyseal (NH) tissue. The VP contents of the supernatant media were determined by radioimmunoassay after a 1 or 2-h incubation. Significantly increased VP levels were detected in the tissue culture media following the administration of A (an alpha+beta(2)-receptor agonist), depending on the dose of A. The VP secretion elevation was totally blocked by the previous administration of phentolamine (an alpha(1)+alpha(2)-receptor antagonist) or corynanthine (an alpha(1)-receptor antagonist). Yohimbine (an alpha(2)-receptor antagonist) did not influence the VP secretion increase induced by A. After the administration of NA (a beta+alpha(1)-receptor agonist), a VP secretion elevation was again detected, but the degree of enhancement proved smaller than that of the VP secretion increase induced by A. Propranolol (a beta(1)+beta(2)-receptor antagonist) before NA administration prevented the VP secretion increase. Atenolol (a beta(1)-receptor antagonist) did not block the VP secretion elevation induced by NA. Corynanthine (an alpha(1)-receptor antagonist) treatment before NA administration reduced the NA-induced VP enhancement, because NA has an alpha(1)-receptor agonist character in addition to its main character (a beta-receptor agonist). Surprisingly, the administration of pindolol (a beta(1)+beta(2)-receptor antagonist) enhanced VP secretion. This contradictory effect can be explained in that pindolol not only acts as a blocker, but also exerts  intrinsic sympathomimetic action  and a strong adrenergic agonist effect. Pindolol before NA administration significantly increased the NA-induced VP elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Mainly the alpha(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors are involved in the A- or NA-induced increase of VP secretion in isolated NH tissue cultures. The results indicate that VP release is influenced directly by the adrenergic system, and the adrenergic control of VP secretion from the NH tissue in rats can occur at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
18331606,"Associations with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency in patients with an ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland.INTRODUCTION: The presence of an ectopic posterior pituitary gland (EPP) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with hypopituitarism with one or more hormone deficiencies. We aimed to identify risk factors for having multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) compared to isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) in patients with an EPP. METHODS: In 67 patients (45 male) with an EPP on MRI, the site (hypothalamic vs. stalk) and surface area (SA) [ x (maximum diameter/2) x (maximum height/2), mm(2)] of the EPP were recorded and compared in patients with IGHD and MPHD in relation to clinical characteristics. RESULTS: In MPHD (n = 32) compared to IGHD (n = 35) patients: age of presentation was younger (1.4 [0.1-10.7]vs. 4.0 [0.1-11.3] years, P = 0.005), major incidents during pregnancy were increased (47%vs. 20%, P = 0.02) as were admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (60%vs. 26%, P = 0.04), whilst EPP SA was lower (12.3 [2.4-34.6]vs. 25.7 [6.9-48.2] mm(2), P &lt; 0.001). In patients with a hypothalamic (n = 56) compared to a stalk sited EPP (n = 11): prevalence of MPHD was greater (55%vs. 9%,P = 0.05) and EPP surface area was smaller (17.3 [2.4-48.2]vs. 25.3 [11.8-38.5] mm(2), P &lt; 0.001). In regression analysis, after adjusting for age, presence of MPHD was associated with: major incidents during pregnancy (RR 6.8 [95%CI 1.2-37.7]), hypothalamic EPP site (RR 10.9 [1.0-123.9]) and small EPP SA (RR 2.5 [1.0-5.0] for tertiles of SA). CONCLUSION: In patients with an EPP, adverse antenatal events, size (small) and position (hypothalamic) of the posterior pituitary gland on MRI were associated with MPHD. These findings suggest that adverse factors during pregnancy may be important for the development of an EPP.",M2
18088359,"Differential kinetics of oxytocin and vasopressin heteronuclear RNA expression in the rat supraoptic nucleus in response to chronic salt loading in vivo.Previous studies have shown that the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin from the <e>posterior pituitary</e> always accompanies systemic hyperosmotic stimuli in rats, and that oxytocin and vasopressin mRNAs consistently increase in response to prolonged hyperosmotic stimuli. Hence, it has been widely interpreted that oxytocin and vasopressin secretion and gene expression are closely coupled. In the present study, we used both vasopressin and oxytocin intron- specific probes to measure vasopressin and oxytocin heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) levels, respectively, by in situ hybridisation in the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON) in conjunction with radioimmunoassays of vasopressin and oxytocin peptide levels in plasma and in the posterior pituitary in normally hydrated rats and after 1-5 days of salt loading. Increased oxytocin secretion in response to hyperosmotic stimuli exceeded vasopressin secretion at every time point studied. Vasopressin hnRNA in the SON increased to near maximal levels within minutes after the hyperosmotic stimulus, and was maintained throughout all 5 days of salt loading. By contrast, oxytocin hnRNA did not significantly change from control levels until approximately 2 days after hyperosmotic stimulation, and was not maximal until 3 days. In summary, increases in oxytocin gene transcription in response to osmotic stimuli are dramatically delayed compared to increases in vasopressin gene transcription under the same conditions. These data indicate that oxytocin gene transcription is not as closely correlated with pituitary peptide secretion as is vasopressin gene transcription, and suggests that there is a fundamental difference in excitation-secretion-transcription coupling mechanisms that regulate these two closely related genes in the rat magnocellular neurones in the SON.",M2

17901225,"Cellular and subcellular evidence for neuronal interaction between the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL 12 and vasopressin: regulation in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of the Brattleboro rats.We previously described a colocalization between arginine vasopressin (AVP) and the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1) in the magnocellular neurons of both the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus as well as the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. SDF-1 physiologically affects the electrophysiological properties of AVP neurons and consequently AVP release. In the present study, we confirm by confocal and electron microscopy that AVP and SDF-1 have a similar cellular distribution inside the neuronal cell and can be found in dense core vesicles in the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary. Because the Brattleboro rats represent a good model of AVP deficiency, we tested in these animals the fate of SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4. We identified by immunohistochemistry that both SDF-1 and CXCR4 immunoreactivity were strongly decreased in Brattleboro rats and were strictly correlated with the expression of AVP protein in supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and the posterior pituitary. We observed by real-time PCR an increase in SDF-1 mRNA in both heterozygous and homozygous rats. The effect on the SDF-1/CXCR4 system was not linked to peripheral modifications of kidney water balance because it could not be restored by chronic infusion of deamino-8D-ariginine-vasopressin, an AVP V2-receptor agonist. These original data further suggest that SDF-1 may play an essential role in the regulation of water balance.",M2
17690141,"Blockade of phosphodiesterase Type 5 enhances rat neurohypophysial excitability and electrically evoked oxytocin release.Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) acts specifically on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and terminates cGMP-mediated signalling. PDE5 has a well established role in vascular smooth muscle, where specific inhibitors of PDE5 such as sildenafil correct erectile dysfunction by augmenting cGMP-mediated vascular relaxation. However, the role of PDE5 outside of the vasculature has received little attention. The present study tested PDE5 inhibitors on the cGMP-mediated modulation of K(+) channels in the neurohypophysis (<e>posterior pituitary</e>). Photolysis of caged-cGMP enhanced current through Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels, and this enhancement recovered in about 2 min. Sildenafil essentially eliminated this recovery, suggesting that the reversal of K(+) current enhancement depends on cGMP breakdown. Activation of nitric oxide synthase during trains of activity in pituitary nerve terminals enhances excitability. When trains of stimulation were applied at regular intervals, sildenafil enhanced the excitability of neurohypophysial nerve terminals and increased the action potential firing probability. T-1032, a compound with high specificity for PDE5 over PDE6, had a similar action. Voltage imaging in intact neurohypophysis with a voltage sensitive absorbance dye showed that T-1032 reduced the failure of propagating action potentials during trains of activity. This indicates that PDE5 activity limits action potential propagation in neurohypophysial axons. Immunoassay of oxytocin, a neuropeptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary, demonstrated that sildenafil increased electrically evoked release. Thus, PDE5 plays an important role in the regulation of neurohypophysial function, and blockade of this enzyme can enhance the use-dependent facilitation of neurohypophysial secretion.",M2
17485169,"Induction of the galanin-like peptide gene expression in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland after acute osmotic stimulus in rats.Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is a 60 amino-acid peptide, and the GALP mRNA is restricted to pituicytes in the posterior pituitary gland (PP) and neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc). We examined whether the GALP gene expression in the PP and Arc would be induced after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of hypertonic saline, that is, acute osmotic stimulus, in rats. The dose-response (2.8, 4.5, 6.0 and 9.0% NaCl) and time-course (6.0% NaCl, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h) effects of acute osmotic stimulus on GALP mRNA levels in the PP and Arc were examined in rats by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Plasma osmolality and plasma sodium concentration increased significantly at 1h, and returned to control level at 6h after i.p. administration of hypertonic saline (6.0% NaCl). The GALP mRNA level in the PP increased significantly 3 and 6h after i.p. administration of hypertonic saline (6.0% NaCl), but the level in the Arc did not change. These results showed that acute osmotic stimulus-induced GALP gene expression in the pituicyte of the PP, but not in the neurons in the Arc, and the gene expression in the pituicyte might be regulated by plasma osmolality and/or plasma sodium concentration.",M2
17468192,"<e>Posterior pituitary</e> function in Sheehan's syndrome.OBJECTIVE: We studied posterior pituitary function in 27 patients with Sheehan's syndrome and 14 controls. DESIGN: All patients were investigated by water deprivation test and 26 of them by 5% hypertonic saline infusion test. None of the patients had symptoms of diabetes insipidus and all patients were on adequate glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone replacement therapy before testing. RESULTS: According to dehydration test, 8 (29.6%) patients had partial diabetes insipidus (PDI group) and 19 (70.3%) had normal response (non-DI group). During the 5% hypertonic saline infusion test, the maximal plasma osmolality was higher in PDI (305 +/- 4.3) and non-DI (308 +/- 1.7) groups when compared with controls (298 +/- 1.7 mOsm/kg; P &lt; 0.005), but the maximal urine osmolality was lower in PDI group (565 +/- 37) than in non-DI (708 +/- 45) and control (683 +/- 17 mOsm/kg) groups (P &lt; 0.05). The osmotic threshold for thirst perception was higher in PDI (296 +/- 4.3) and non-DI (298 +/- 1.4) groups when compared with control group (287 +/- 1.5 mOsm/kg) (P &lt; 0.005). Basal plasma osmolalities were also higher in PDI (294 +/- 1.0) and non-DI (297 +/- 1.1) groups than in controls (288 +/- 1.2 mOsm/kg; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that patients with Sheehan's syndrome have an impairment of neurohypophyseal function.

17426098,"Anterior and <e>posterior pituitary</e> function testing with simultaneous insulin tolerance test and a novel copeptin assay.CONTEXT: Posterior pituitary function in patients with suspected diabetes insipidus is usually assessed by a water deprivation test. Alternatively, a nonosmotic stimulus such as hypoglycemia may be used to stimulate vasopressin [arginine vasopressin (AVP)] secretion. Plasma AVP measurement may aid in the diagnosis and, especially, differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and polydipsia. However, AVP measurement is cumbersome. Copeptin, the stable C-terminal glycopeptide of the AVP prohormone, is stoichiometrically secreted from the posterior pituitary. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the value of copeptin levels in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 38 patients were studied during insulin-induced hypoglycemia as part of a combined pituitary function test for possible anterior pituitary disease. There were 29 patients who had normal posterior pituitary function, and nine had central diabetes insipidus. Blood sampling was done before and 30, 45, and 90 min after iv insulin injection. Copeptin was measured with a new sandwich immunoassay. RESULTS: Patients with intact posterior pituitary function had basal copeptin levels of 3.7 +/- 1.5 pm, with a maximal increase to 11.1 +/- 4.6 pm 45 min after insulin injection. Copeptin levels in patients with diabetes insipidus were 2.4 +/- 0.5 pm before insulin injection, with a maximum increase to 3.7 +/- 0.7 pm. Both basal and stimulated copeptin levels were lower in patients with diabetes insipidus as compared with patients with intact posterior pituitary function. A stimulated copeptin level 45 min after insulin injection of less than 4.75 pm had an optimal diagnostic accuracy to detect diabetes insipidus. CONCLUSION: Copeptin measurement may be used to assess posterior together with anterior pituitary function during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.",M2

SAL was detected in extract of bovine PP gland using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). A single intravenous (i.v.) injection of SAL (5 and 10mg/kg body weight) significantly and dose-dependently stimulated the release of PRL in goats (P&lt;0.05). Plasma PRL levels reached a peak 10min after the injection, then gradually returned to basal values in 60-80min. The PRL-releasing pattern was similar to that in response to sulpiride (a dopamine receptor antagonist). The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 1mg of SAL had no significant effect on the release of PRL in calves, however, 5mg significantly stimulated the release (P&lt;0.05) with peak values reached 30-40min after the injection. Moreover, SAL significantly stimulated the release of PRL from cultured bovine anterior pituitary cells at doses of 10(-6) and 10(-5)M, compared to control cells (P&lt;0.05). Taken together, our data clearly show that SAL is present in extract of the PP gland of ruminants, and has PRL-releasing activity both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, this endogenous compound is a strong candidate for the factor having PRL-releasing activity that has been previously detected in extract of the bovine PP gland.",M2
17201807,"Hormonal, pituitary magnetic resonance, LHX4 and HESX1 evaluation in patients with hypopituitarism and ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe.OBJECTIVE: LHX4 and HESX1 are important in early stages of pituitary development and their mutations can be associated with an ectopic posterior lobe (EPL) in the pituitary of patients with hypopituitarism. The EPL can be located at the median eminence or at the path of the pituitary stalk. The aim of this study was to analyse LHX4 and HESX1 and characterize the hormonal deficiency profiles, establishing relationships with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these patients. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Sixty-two patients with hypopituitarism associated with EPL were submitted to evaluation of pituitary function, analysis of MRI with EPL location and molecular analysis of LHX4 and HESX1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digestion with restriction enzyme and automatic sequencing. RESULTS: Forty-two patients had a nonvisualized pituitary stalk (NPS), and 20 a visualized pituitary stalk (VPS). Most patients (95%) with NPS had combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), with ACTH deficiency in 85%. In patients with VPS, CPHD was found in 50% and ACTH deficiency occurred in only 20%. The frequency of the location of EPL was similar in patients with VPS and NPS: 35% at median eminence and 65% at the path of the stalk. No mutations in LHX4 and HESX1 were identified. Three new polymorphisms in LHX4 were found. CONCLUSIONS: ACTH deficiency is frequent in patients with hypopituitarism and NPS (85%), the location of EPL at the median eminence was not predictive of the hormonal profile [isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) or CPHD], and LHX4 and HESX1 genes mutations remain rare causes of hypopituitarism associated with EPL.",M2
17175111,"Glutamatergic innervation of the hypothalamic median eminence and <e>posterior pituitary</e> of the rat.Recent studies have localized the glutamatergic cell marker type-2 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) to distinct peptidergic neurosecretory systems that regulate hypophysial functions in rats. The present studies were aimed to map the neuronal sources of VGLUT2 in the median eminence and the posterior pituitary, the main terminal fields of hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Neurons innervating these regions were identified by the uptake of the retrograde tract-tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) from the systemic circulation, whereas glutamatergic perikarya of the hypothalamus were visualized via the radioisotopic in situ hybridization detection of VGLUT2 mRNA. The results of dual-labeling studies established that the majority of neurons accumulating FG and also expressing VGLUT2 mRNA were located within the paraventricular, periventricular and supraoptic nuclei and around the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the preoptic area. In contrast, only few FG-accumulating cells exhibited VGLUT2 mRNA signal in the arcuate nucleus. Dual-label immunofluorescent studies of the median eminence and posterior pituitary to determine the subcellular location of VGLUT2, revealed the association of VGLUT2 immunoreactivity with SV2 protein, a marker for small clear vesicles in neurosecretory endings. Electron microscopic studies using pre-embedding colloidal gold labeling confirmed the localization of VGLUT2 in small clear synaptic vesicles. These data suggest that neurosecretory neurons located mainly within the paraventricular, anterior periventricular and supraoptic nuclei and around the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the preoptic area secrete glutamate into the fenestrated vessels of the median eminence and posterior pituitary. The functional aspects of the putative neuropeptide/glutamate co-release from neuroendocrine terminals remain to be elucidated.",M2
17159354,"Contribution of magnetic resonance imaging in non-tumoral hypopituitarism in children.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of paramount importance for evaluating the hypothalamo-pituitary axis in children. METHODS: We summarize the main points of the MRI technique, and describe the normal appearance of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis as a function of age and pubertal status. The most frequent causes of non-tumoral hypopituitarism include anterior pituitary deficiency (growth hormone deficiency may be isolated or associated with other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, with or without other malformations, and related to a known genetic abnormality in some cases), isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and <e>posterior pituitary</e> deficiency with or without anterior pituitary hormone deficiency (central diabetes insipidus may be observed without tumor development). RESULTS: We describe in detail the appearance of the adenohypophysis, the pituitary stalk and the neurohypophysis, correlations with hormone deficiencies, the abnormalities that may be associated and progression over time for each condition. CONCLUSION: An accurate description of hypothalamo-pituitary axis abnormalities is necessary for accurate diagnosis and prognosis evaluation, with certain features suggestive of particular diseases and some prognostic data correlated with phenotype.",M2
17140677,"Oxytocin levels in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> and in the heart are modified by voluntary wheel running.We hypothesized that voluntary wheel running results in increased secretion of oxytocin, a peptide involved in the stress response. An additional hypothesis was that prolonged exercise affects oxytocin levels in the heart, which is in line with the potential role of oxytocin in cardiovascular functions. Voluntary wheel running lasted 3 weeks and daily running distances increased progressively reaching maximum levels about 8 km (Sprague-Dawley rats) and 4 km (Lewis strain). The exercise resulted in significant reduction of epididymal fat, slight increase in glucose transporter GLUT4 mRNA levels and significant enhancement of plasma density. Voluntary exercise failed to influence plasma oxytocin levels either in Lewis or Sprague-Dawley rats, but it resulted in a significant decrease of oxytocin concentrations in the posterior pituitary. Plasma oxytocin concentrations were not modified even if the measurements were made in the dark phase of the day. In voluntary wheel running Sprague-Dawley rats, the content of oxytocin in the right heart atrium was lower than in controls. Thus, the present findings demonstrate that prolonged voluntary wheel running results in a decrease in pituitary oxytocin content without evident changes in hormone concentrations in peripheral blood. However, prolonged exercise used has a significant impact on oxytocin levels in the heart.",M2

DESIGN: We aimed to (1) evaluate the presence of circulating vasopressin-cell autoantibodies (AVPc-Abs) in young patients with central diabetes insipidus (CDI), (2) detect organ-specific autoantibodies as markers of autoimmunity, and (3) define the relationship between immune markers and neuroimaging findings. PATIENTS: Twenty patients were evaluated at a median age of 16.3 years. Twelve patients had idiopathic CDI, six had Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and two had germinoma. AVPc-Abs were evaluated in 40 healthy children. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary region was performed longitudinally in all subjects. MEASUREMENTS: Circulating arginine vasopressin (AVP), protein tyrosine phosphatase (IA2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), endomysium antibodies (EMA), parietal cell (PCA), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG) and TSH-receptor (TSHr) autoantibodies were evaluated. RESULTS: Circulating AVPc-Abs were found in 15 patients (75%), nine with idiopathic CDI, four with LCH and two with germinoma; the pituitary stalk was involved in most of them. Five patients with idiopathic CDI showed a persistence of AVPc-Abs during follow-up and one became positive subsequently. Serum IA2 autoantibodies were demonstrated in 14 patients (70%) and 21-OH autoantibodies in three of them. CONCLUSION: In idiopathic CDI, circulating AVPc-Abs suggest an autoimmune involvement of the neurohypophyseal system. The identification of AVPc-Abs in subjects who could have either idiopathic CDI or LCH or germinoma, however, indicates that AVPc-Abs cannot be considered a completely reliable marker of autoimmune CDI. Thus, close clinical and MRI follow-up are needed because AVPc-Abs may mask germinoma or LCH.",M2
16940453,"Novel HESX1 mutations associated with a life-threatening neonatal phenotype, pituitary aplasia, but normally located <e>posterior pituitary</e> and no optic nerve abnormalities.CONTEXT: Hesx1 is one of the earliest homeodomain transcription factors expressed during pituitary development. Very few HESX1 mutations have been identified in humans; although in those cases the disease phenotype shows considerable variability, all but one of the patients display an ectopic posterior pituitary and/or optic nerve abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to describe the complex phenotype associated with the panhypopituitarism of two unrelated Italian patients who, at birth, presented with hypoglycemic seizures and respiratory distress complicated by shock, in a familial context of neonatal death in one family and spontaneous miscarriage in both families and to identify the molecular basis of this unusual syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary region, study of HESX1 gene and transcripts, and assessment of the ability of mutated HESX1 proteins to repress transcription were measured. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging examination showed an anterior pituitary aplasia in a flat sella turcica and a normally located posterior pituitary in both patients. A constellation of extrapituitary developmental defects were found in the two patients, but without any optic nerve abnormalities. Sequencing of HESX1 exons and their flanking intronic regions revealed two different homozygous mutations. A frameshift (c.449_450delAC) was identified in one case, whereas the other patient carried a splice defect (c.357 + 2Tb &gt; C) confirmed by the study of HESX1 transcripts. If translated, these mutations would lead to the synthesis of truncated proteins partly or entirely lacking the homeodomain, with no transcriptional repression, as shown by their inability to inhibit PROP1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: These observations reveal two novel HESX1 mutations in a so-far-undescribed disease phenotype characterized by a life-threatening neonatal condition associated with anterior pituitary aplasia, in the absence of ectopic posterior pituitary and optic nerve abnormalities, two features classically associated with HESX1 defects.",M2

16700001,"Changes of sex hormone-binding globulin/SHBG expression in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system of rats during pregnancy, parturition and lactation.Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is expressed in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. High co-localization rates of SHBG with oxytocin have been observed in the hypothalamus, indicating that SHBG plays a role in pregnancy, parturition and lactation. Further studies have shown that hypothalamic SHBG expression is malleable to changing steroid conditions. In this study, we have examined SHBG levels in the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei and in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe of late pregnant, parturient and early lactating rats by IN SITU hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and ELISA. Immunocytochemical and biochemical analysis showed that the SHBG levels increased during late pregnancy in hypothalamic nuclei. During parturition, SHBG levels fell in the magnocellular nuclei but increased in the posterior pituitary lobe. SHBG levels increase again during lactation. At day six of lactation, there was no significant difference in SHBG levels compared to normal cycling female rats, which served as control in this study. IN SITU hybridization showed increased SHBG mRNA signal during late pregnancy. The highest SHBG expression was observed during parturition. Our data indicate that hypothalamic SHBG expression changes during pregnancy, parturition and lactation, parallel to ovarian steroid and co-localized OT levels. This may in part be linked to known steroid actions on synthesis and secretion of magnocellular hypothalamic peptide hormones, important for the control of parturition and lactation.",M2

PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Sixty children with GHD and PPE were evaluated in this retrospective chart review (1988-2003). RESULTS: Known extra-pituitary birth defects (BD) were present in 31 patients (BD+, 52%) and absent in 29 patients (BD-). Among BD+ patients, seven had well-defined syndromes (Fanconi anaemia, n = 2; Pallister-Hall, n = 1; Currarino, n = 2; or Stilling-Duane, n = 2) and the other 24 had 53 BDs, mainly involving the brain, eyes and the craniofacial structures (n = 27, 51%) but also affecting the heart, skeleton, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and skin. Of the 60 patients, seven (12%) were born to consanguineous parents (five sporadic and two familial cases). There were seven (12%) familial cases, with wide variations in clinical presentation, endocrine profiles and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings within families and various patterns consistent with autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked transmission. CONCLUSION: The high rate of extra-pituitary BDs and of familial components supports a role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder. A detailed record of phenotypic abnormalities in patients with GHD and PPE might produce useful hypotheses for genetic studies.",M2
16530280,"Histamine-induced enhancement of vasopressin and oxytocin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal tissue cultures.The effects of histamine (HA) on vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) secretion were studied in 13-14-day cultures of isolated rat neurohypophyseal (NH) tissue. The VP and OT contents of the supernatant were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after a 1 or 2-h incubation. Significantly increased levels of VP and OT production were detected in the tissue culture media following HA administration, depending on the HA dose. The elevation of NH hormone secretion could be partially blocked by previous administration of the HA antagonist mepyramine (MEP, an H1 receptor antagonist) or cimetidine (CIM, an H2 receptor antagonist). Thioperamide (TPE, an H3-H4 receptor antagonist) did not influence the VP or OT secretion increase induced by HA. The application of MEP, CIM or TPE after HA administration proved ineffective. The H1 and H2 receptors are mainly involved in the HA-induced increase of both VP and OT secretion in isolated NH tissue cultures. The results indicate that NH hormone release is influenced directly by the histaminergic system, and the histaminergic control of VP and OT secretion from the NH tissue in rats can occur at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
16497814,"Intravenous 6-hydroxydopamine attenuates vasopressin and oxytocin secretion stimulated by hemorrhage and hypotension but not hyperosmolality in rats.The present study sought to determine whether chemical destruction of peripheral catecholaminergic fibers with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) attenuates vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) secretion stimulated by hemorrhage, hypotension, and hyperosmolality. Rats received 6OHDA (100 mg/kg iv) or vehicle (1 ml/kg iv) on days 1 and 7, and experiments were performed on day 8. Serial hemorrhage (4 samples of 2 ml per 300 g body wt at 10-min intervals) increased plasma VP and OT levels in both groups; however, the increase in plasma VP and OT levels was significantly attenuated in 6OHDA-treated vs. control rats despite a significantly lower mean arterial blood pressure. Similarly, the increase in plasma VP and OT levels in response to hypotension produced by the selective arteriolar vasodilator diazoxide was significantly attenuated in 6OHDA-treated rats. In marked contrast to hemorrhage and hypotension, hyperosmolality produced by an infusion of 1 M NaCl (2 ml/h iv) stimulated increases in plasma VP and OT levels that were not different between 6OHDA-treated and control rats. In a parallel set of experiments, intravenous 6OHDA treatment reduced dopamine--hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> but had no substantial effect in the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. In each experiment, the pressor response to tyramine (250 microg/kg iv) was significantly attenuated in 6OHDA-treated rats, thereby confirming that 6OHDA treatment destroyed sympathetic catecholaminergic fibers. Collectively, these findings suggest that catecholaminergic fibers located outside the blood-brain barrier contribute to VP and OT secretion during hemorrhage and arterial hypotension.",M2
16432224,"A comprehensive description of the transcriptome of the hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system in euhydrated and dehydrated rats.The hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system (HNS) consists of the large peptidergic magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic hypo thalamic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), the axons of which course through the internal zone of the median eminence and terminate at blood capillaries of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The HNS is a specialized brain neurosecretory apparatus responsible for the production of the antidiuretic peptide hormone vasopressin (VP). VP maintains water balance by promoting water conservation at the level of the kidney. Dehydration evokes a massive increase in the regulated release of VP from magnocellular neuron axon terminals in the <e>posterior pituitary</e>, which is accompanied by a plethora of changes in the morphology, electrophysiological properties, and biosynthetic and secretory activity of the HNS. We wish to understand this functional plasticity in terms of the differential expression of genes. We have therefore used microarrays to comprehensively catalog the genes expressed in the PVN, the SON and the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland of control and dehydrated rats. Comparison of these gene lists has enabled us to identify transcripts that are regulated as a consequence of dehydration as well as RNAs that are enriched in the PVN or the SON. We suggest that these differentially expressed genes represent candidate regulators and effectors of HNS activity and remodeling.",M2

We report two cases of posterior pituitary astrocytomas in middle-aged women presenting as focal lesions of the neurohypophysis. A review of the literature reveals only a few reports of this tumor, and there has been scanty discussion of the imaging findings of posterior pituitary astrocytomas compared with lesions of the anterior pituitary gland. This report reviews the clinical characteristics and imaging findings and discusses the differential diagnosis of these two cases.",M2
16000849,"Angiopoietins are expressed in the normal rat pituitary gland.Interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with the angiopoietins (Ang) is an essential component of angiogenesis. Localization of VEGF in the anterior pituitary raises the possibility that Ang must be present in the pituitary gland as well. In this study Ang expression was detected in the normal rat pituitary gland at the gene level by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. The latter was analyzed by both light and confocal microscopy. Constitutive expression of Ang1, Ang2, and their receptor Tie2 was detected at both the mRNA and protein level in all the pituitary glands studied. Of interest was the localization of both Ang1 and Ang2 in scattered PAS positive adenohypophysial cells rather than in endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy showed colocalization of both Ang1 and Ang2 proteins within the same adenohypophysial cells. Dual immunostaining for Ang1 and the anterior pituitary hormones that show PAS positivity demonstrated colocalization of Ang1 with follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. In the <e>posterior pituitary</e>, strong Ang1 signal observed in vascular endothelial cells masked the weak Ang2 signal, a pattern that is similar to that reported in brain endothelial cells. The presence of both angiopoietins and VEGF in the pituitary gland suggest that these ligands interact during angiogenesis as they are known to do in other systems to maintain the rich vascular network of the gland. This first report of angiopoietin localization in the rat pituitary gland opens a new line of investigation on angiogenesis in pituitary glands that will impact human endocrinology in the future.",M2
15964147,"AVP- and OT-neurophysins response to apomorphine and clonidine in major depression.A number of studies have reported abnormalities of neurohypophyseal secretions in major depressive disorder. The purpose of the present study was to test the influence of apomorphine and clonidine injections on plasma vasopressin (AVP)-neurophysins and oxytocin(OT)-neurophysins levels, as direct index of <e>posterior pituitary</e> activation in major depression. Apomorphine and clonidine tests were carried out in 25 medication-free depressive patients and 25 age and gender-matched healthy controls. Blood for neurophysins analysis was drawn by venipuncture at t0, t + 20, t + 40, t + 60 and t + 120. Baseline AVP-neurophysins concentrations were significantly lower in depressives (0.12 +/- 0.14 ng/ml) than in healthy subjects (0.24 +/- 2.15 ng/ml) (p &lt; 0.04). The response to apomorphine test revealed a significant reduced response at 20 (p = 0.01), 40 (p = 0.007) and 60 (p = 0.02) and 120 (p = 0.02)min. Following clonidine test, post hoc tests also revealed a significant decrease at 0 (p = 0.04), 20 (p = 0.01), 40 (p = 0.007) and 60 (p = 0.02) and 120 (p = 0.006)min. Concerning OT-neurophysins, no significant differences were found between depressed and controls in response to clonidine or apomorphine injections. Following clonidine and apomorphine, major depressives exhibited a significantly lower peak GH response than controls. The study supports partially the hypothesis of a reduced vasopressinergic activity in depression. Moreover, we did not find any influence of acute apomorphine or clonidine injections on vasopressin-neurophysin or oxytocin-neurophysin in depressive patients.",M2
15961227,"Coexistence of salusin and vasopressin in the rat hypothalamo-hypophyseal system.Salusins are two newly discovered TOR-related peptides consisting of 28 and 20 amino acids and designated salusin-alpha and salusin-beta, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry techniques, salusin-like immunoreactivity was detected in the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract and immunopositive cells were distributed in the suprachiasmatic, supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus. In the paraventricular nucleus, salusin-like immunoreactivity was observed both in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Many salusin-positive nerve fibers and their terminals were identified in the internal layer of the median eminence and <e>posterior pituitary</e>. Less intense salusin-positive staining of fibers and terminals was found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and external layer of the median eminence. Dual immunostaining was performed to determine if salusin coexisted with vasopressin or oxytocin in the hypothalamus. Most of the salusin-like immunoreactivity was detected in vasopressin- but not in oxytocin-containing neurons in these nuclei. The functional significance of the coexistence of salusin with vasopressin is discussed, including the possibility that salusin participates in the regulation of blood pressure.",M2
15950103,"Ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> high signal in preoperative and postoperative macroadenomas: dynamic MR imaging.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with macroadenoma, posterior pituitary high signal (PPHS) on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is sometimes observed in an ectopic location. The present study compared incidences of ectopic PPHS before and after macroadenoma surgery using MR imaging, including dynamic MR imaging to ascertain whether this ectopic change is irreversible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging was performed preoperatively in 111 cases of macroadenoma, and then repeated more than 1-year postoperatively in 47 patients. Enhancement of PPHS was assessed using dynamic MR imaging. Areas of enhanced hyperintensity were considered true PPHS, and the relationship between presence and location of true PPHS and adenoma volume was analyzed. Moreover, changes in the presence and location of true PPHS were ascertained among the patients who underwent postoperative follow-up MR imaging. RESULTS: Preoperatively, PPHS was seen only in the normal location in 29 patients (Group A: 26.1%). High signal was detected only in an ectopic location in 58 patients, and early enhancement of this ectopic high signal was confirmed by dynamic MR imaging in 56 patients (Group B: 50.5%). No PPHS was observed in 24 patients (Group C: 21.6%). Adenoma volume was significantly greater for Group B than for Group A (p&lt;0.001). Among the Group B patients who underwent MR imaging postoperatively (n=31), the location of PPHS was not changed, except for two patients in whom PPHS was absent. Postoperatively, PPHS was not observed in the normal location in any patient in the Group B. CONCLUSIONS: Greater volume of adenoma is associated with a higher incidence of ectopic PPHS, and the ectopic change is irreversible.",M2
15927785,"Co-expression of vasopressin and androgen-binding protein in the rat hypothalamus.In previous studies we have observed the expression of androgen binding protein (ABP) in the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. With immunocytochemical double staining we found partial co-localization with oxytocin. In the present study we used antibodies to the anti-diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) for co-localization with ABP in the rat hypothalamus. Both antigens were seen in the magnocellular paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Dense fiber networks with varicosities containing both AVP and ABP immunoreactivity were visible throughout the hypothalamus, the median eminence and in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe. Double immunostaining revealed also co-existence in the parvocellular portion of the paraventricular nucleus and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. ABP immunoreactive neurons in the preoptic region were devoid of AVP staining, AVP neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis stained only occasionally for ABP. We conclude that both the magnocellular and the parvocellular hypothalamic vasopressin systems are capable of expressing the steroid binding globulin, which is probably subject to axonal transport, along with the peptide hormone. Intrahypothalamic expression of ABP may be among the mechanisms necessary for rapid actions of steroids on hypothalamic neuroendocrine systems.",M2
15864593,"Diabetes insipidus presentation before renal and pulmonary features in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis.We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with Wegener's granulomatosis complicated by central diabetes insipidus. The patient had initially seronegative polyarthritis which mostly responded well to methotrexate and steroid therapy. Eight months later the patient suffered from polyuria and polydipsia. There were no abnormalities of the anterior pituitary hormones. MR images showed only loss of brightness of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. Extensive evaluation of the patient revealed the presence of ANCA, in c-ANCA pattern and also PR3 positivity. Three months later findings of glomerulonephritis, as suggested by an active urine sediment and gradual proteinuria, and, finally, asymptomatic pulmonary nodules completed the clinical picture of Wegener's disease within 1 year. Renal biopsy showed crescent formation in two glomeruli, consistent with ANCA-related glomerulonephritis which showed pauci-immün depositions by direct immunofluorescence. Diabetes insipidus symptoms mostly regressed; renal and pulmonary findings completely disappeared with glucocorticoid and pulse cyclophosphamide treatment. These findings show that diabetes insipidus may rarely develop early in the disease process and ANCA positivity was directly indicative of Wegener's granulomatosis before the classic clinical signs of the disease.",M2
15819972,"Bovine <e>posterior pituitary</e> extract stimulates prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland in vitro and in vivo in cattle.It has been reported that the posterior pituitary (PP) gland contains a potent, unknown prolactin (PRL)-releasing factor (PRF) in rats. PRFs are assumed to be produced in neurones located within the hypothalamus, and to be peptidergic in nature. However, little is known about PRFs in domestic animals. To characterize the PRF in the PP of domestic animals, the present study examined the PRL-releasing activity of an acidic extract from bovine PP (bPP) in vitro and in vivo in cattle. First, the PRL-releasing effect of bPP extract was compared with that of PRL-releasing peptide (PrRP), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from cultured bovine anterior pituitary cells. The extract significantly increased PRL concentrations in the culture medium, at doses of 0.002 and 0.02 eq./ml (one eq. is the PP extract from one animal), compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05). PrRP failed to stimulate the release of PRL. TRH significantly increased PRL concentrations in the culture medium, at doses from 10(-9) to 10(-7) M, compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of increase in the PRL concentration, by 0.02 eq./ml bPP extract, was significantly greater than that in TRH (p &lt; 0.05). Secondly, plasma PRL responses to the intravenous (i.v.) injection of bPP extract (0.5 eq./head), PrRP [3.59 mug/kg body weight (BW)], TRH (1 mug/kg BW), and a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride, 0.1 mg/kg BW), were examined in calves. PrRP failed to stimulate PRL release; however, plasma PRL increased immediately following the injection of bPP extract, TRH and sulpiride. The PRL-releasing effect of i.v. injections of TRH and sulpiride was more potent than that of bPP extract. Finally, plasma PRL responses to the intra-hypothalamic injection of bPP extract were examined in calves. The intra-hypothalamic infusion (arcuate nucleus) of 0.0625 eq./head of bPP extract strongly stimulated PRL release in calves (p &lt; 0.05). The present results show that PP contains a physiologically potent PRF in cattle.",M2
15800844,"Over- and underdosage of SOX3 is associated with infundibular hypoplasia and hypopituitarism.Duplications of Xq26-27 have been implicated in the etiology of X-linked hypopituitarism associated with mental retardation (MR). Additionally, an expansion of a polyalanine tract (by 11 alanines) within the transcription factor SOX3 (Xq27.1) has been reported in patients with growth hormone deficiency and variable learning difficulties. We report a submicroscopic duplication of Xq27.1, the smallest reported to date (685.6 kb), in two siblings with variable hypopituitarism, callosal abnormalities, anterior pituitary hypoplasia (APH), an ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> (EPP), and an absent infundibulum. This duplication contains SOX3 and sequences corresponding to two transcripts of unknown function; only Sox3 is expressed in the infundibulum in mice. Next, we identified a novel seven-alanine expansion within a polyalanine tract in SOX3 in a family with panhypopituitarism in three male siblings with an absent infundibulum, severe APH, and EPP. This mutation led to reduced transcriptional activity, with impaired nuclear localization of the mutant protein. We also identified a novel polymorphism (A43T) in SOX3 in another child with hypopituitarism. In contrast to findings in previous studies, there was no evidence of MR or learning difficulties in our patients. We conclude that both over- and underdosage of SOX3 are associated with similar phenotypes, consisting of infundibular hypoplasia and hypopituitarism but not necessarily MR.",M2
15757853,"The natural history of post-traumatic neurohypophysial dysfunction.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <e>Posterior pituitary</e> function remains poorly investigated after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We report the results of a study designed to prospectively define the natural history of post-traumatic diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) using standard reliable methodology. DESIGN AND METHODS: 50 consecutive patients with severe or moderate TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 3/15-13/15) were prospectively studied on three occasions: at the acute phase and at 6 months and at 12 months following TBI. In the acute phase, DI was diagnosed either by the presence of hypernatraemia in association with hypotonic polyuria or by the water-deprivation test (WDT) and, at 6 and 12 months by the WDT in all patients. Normative data on response to the WDT were obtained from healthy matched volunteers. Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). RESULTS: 13 patients (26%) had DI in the acute post-TBI phase, of whom nine patients recovered by 6 months and one additional patient recovered by 12 months. Of the remaining three patients with permanent DI, two had partial vasopressin deficiency. Acute-phase peak plasma osmolality correlated negatively with the initial GCS scores (r = -0.39, P = 0.005) and with the GOS scores (r = -0.45, P = 0.001). Seven patients had SIADH in the acute phase of TBI but none did at 6 or 12 months. No new cases of DI or SIADH were noted after the acute phase. CONCLUSION: This prospective study shows that posterior pituitary dysfunction is common following TBI. Most cases recover completely but there is an appreciable frequency of long-term DI which can be subtle and should be recognized and managed appropriately.",M2
15680491,"Serotonin-induced enhancement of vasopressin and oxytocin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal tissue culture.The effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) on vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) secretion were studied in 13-14-day cultures of isolated rat neurohypophyseal (NH) tissue. The VP and OT contents of the supernatant were determined by radioimmunoassay after a 1 or 2 h incubation. Significantly increased levels of VP and OT production were detected in the tissue culture media following 5-HT administration, depending on the 5-HT dose. The elevation of NH hormone secretion could be partially blocked by previous administration of the 5-HT antagonist ketanserin or metergoline. WAY-100635 did not influence the increased VP secretion induced by 5-HT, but the elevated OT production was prevented by WAY-100635 before 5-HT administration. The application of WAY-100635, ketanserin or metergoline, after 5-HT administration proved ineffective. The results indicate that NH hormone release is influenced directly by the serotonergic system. The serotonergic control of VP and OT secretion from the NH tissue in rats can occur at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
15546901,"Do all patients with childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and ectopic neurohypophysis have persistent GHD in adulthood?Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging findings are of great value for the diagnosis of nonacquired GH deficiency (GHD), and ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> hyperintense signal (EPPHS) is a sensitive and specific indicator of hypopituitarism. It has been suggested that patients with childhood-onset GHD and EPPHS do not require additional investigation of GH secretion and should not be retested when adult height is achieved. This recommendation has never been validated through a systematic study. This study aimed to characterize the anterior pituitary function status of patients with EPPHS treated for GHD during childhood after completion of GH therapy when adult height had been achieved. Patients (n = 18; 15 males and three females) with childhood-onset GHD associated with ectopic neurohypophysis were treated with hGH (0.20 +/- 0.05 mg/kg.wk) for 9.9 +/- 4.0 yr (from 6.8 +/- 4.7 to 17.7 +/- 1.3 yr of age) with a mean height gain of 2.6 +/- 1.4 sd score. GH secretion was reevaluated by arginine insulin (n = 15) or propanolol glucagon (n = 3) test after 0.5 +/- 0.6 yr of GH withdrawal. At reevaluation, peak GH was more than 10 mug/liter in four patients (22%; range, 11.7-19.5 microg/liter; group I), between 5 and 10 microg/liter in three patients (17%; range, 7.3-9 mug/liter; group II), and less than 5 microg/liter in 11 patients (61%; range, 0-4.7 microg/liter; group III). A positive correlation was found between serum IGF-I and peak GH levels after attainment of adult height (P = 0.007). Only one of the seven patients who showed increased GH secretion ability in adulthood (groups I and II) demonstrated other hormonal deficiencies (gonadotropin and adrenal insufficiencies). Among the 11 patients with persistent severe GHD (group III), 10 (91%) of the 11 subjects were shown to have multiple pituitary hormone deficits after attainment of adult height. The structure of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis differs among groups [i.e. patients who showed increased GH secretion ability in adulthood (groups I and II) vs. those who remained severely GHD (group III)]. The location of the EPPHS was significantly different among groups (P &lt; 0.003). The EPPHS was found at the median eminence in all but one of group III patients and along the pituitary stalk (proximal stalk) in all but one of group I and II patients. The pituitary stalk was visible and described as normal (n = 1) or thin (n = 6) in all group I and II patients, whereas the pituitary stalk was not visible even after enhancement in seven of the 11 group III patients (P &lt; 0.02). The prevalence of anterior pituitary hypoplasia and the mean height gain sd score were similar in each group. In conclusion, only 61% of patients with childhood-onset GHD and EPPHS remained severely GHD, and thus suitable for GH therapy, in adulthood. Although the pathogenesis of anterior pituitary dysfunction remains unclear in patients with ectopic neurohypophysis, isolated GHD, location of EPPHS along the stalk, and visibility of the pituitary stalk on magnetic resonance imaging findings clearly represent important markers to predict a less severe form of the disease.",M2
15237933,"Serial MR intensity changes of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> in patients with diabetes insipidus after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas: report of two cases.This is the first report describing magnetic resonance (MR) intensity changes of the posterior pituitary gland in the patients suffering from the classical  triphasic  diabetes insipidus (DI) after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas. A 21-year-old female and a 54-year-old female were admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of Cushing's disease and acromegaly due to pituitary microadenomas, respectively. No evidence of DI was found, and T1-weighted MR images exhibited  bright spot  corresponding to the posterior pituitary in both cases. Both experienced the classical  triphasic  pattern of water metabolism disturbance after successful transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas, that is, polyuria-oliguria-polyuria. The MR signal hyperintensity in posterior pituitary was detected during the first polyuric phase, but the hyperintensity disappeared during the second polyuric phase. In addition,  bright spot  was restored along with the recovery from DI in the chronic phase. These findings of serial MR images supported that the first DI phase of the classical triphasic course of water metabolism disturbance was caused by secretional dysfunction of stored vasopressin from the posterior gland, whereas the second DI phase was due to impairment in the functional integrity producing vasopressin-containing granules after depletion of vasopressin in the oliguric phase.",M2
15203243,"Galanin-like peptide gene expression in the hypothalamus and <e>posterior pituitary</e> of the obese fa/fa rat.We examined the galanin-like peptide (GALP) gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and posterior pituitary (PP) in 6- and 18-week-old male obese fa/fa rats. GALP mRNA in the ARC in fa/fa rats was significantly decreased in 6- and 18-week-old and GALP mRNA in the PP in fa/fa rats was significantly increased in 18-week-old compared to lean Fa/? rats. Insulin treatment in hyperglycemic fa/fa rats partially reversed those changes. These results suggest that the GALP gene expression in fa/fa rats might be regulated in part by leptin-independent mechanisms.",M2
15070961,"Idiopathic central diabetes insipidus is associated with abnormal blood supply to the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland caused by vascular impairment of the inferior hypophyseal artery system.Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) has been linked to vascular central nervous system damage, although the pathophysiology of the mechanism has never been perfectly understood. Indeed, the vascular system of human pituitary gland has rarely been the subject of rigorous investigation except at postmortem. Recently, studies of pituitary gland blood supply have been carried out by means of a time evaluation of pituitary gland enhancement with noninvasive dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after contrast medium injection. In the present study, we decided to investigate the status of posterior pituitary blood supply by evaluating vascular pituitary patterns in a group of 19 patients with idiopathic CDI in whom previous standard MR imaging had failed to identify causal specific lesions. The control group was composed of 55 subjects with a median age of 12 yr (range, 4.2-17 yr) who had idiopathic isolated GH deficiency and normal pituitary morphology and 15 young adults (18-25 yr) who had normal pituitary gland and no endocrine dysfunction. Nineteen patients (12 females and seven males), ranging in age at the time of diagnosis of CDI from 0.5-14.9 yr (median, 5 yr), were examined with dynamic MR imaging between 1990 and 1997 at a median age of 14.1 yr (range, 5.0-26.3 yr). CDI was diagnosed according to clinical findings of polyuria and polydipsia, water deprivation test, and desmopressin acetate therapeutic trial. All of the patients had permanent CDI and were being treated with satisfactory results with desmopressin, two to three times daily, either intranasally or orally. The previous MR imaging findings of the 19 CDI patients had shown the absence of posterior pituitary hyperintensity, normal pituitary stalk, and normal anterior pituitary size. Enhancement of the straight sinus, representing a temporal reference point and occurring in normal subjects simultaneously to that of the posterior pituitary gland, was observed in all subjects after iv gadopentetate dimeglumine administration, with no substantial differences between patients and controls. However, the enhancement of the posterior pituitary lobe occurred simultaneously with the enhancement of the straight sinus in all of the controls but in only 14 of the 19 patients with CDI. In the remaining five patients, the enhancement of the straight sinus was not associated with the expected contrast enhancement of the posterior pituitary gland, suggesting abnormal blood supply to the posterior pituitary lobe. This is in keeping with vascular impairment of the inferior hypophyseal artery system and suggests that abnormal blood supply to the posterior pituitary gland is associated with what, until now, has been considered idiopathic CDI.",M2

METHODS: We present a 7-year-old boy who showed short stature, nystagmus, inward deviation and low vision. Ophthalmological and general physical examinations, further endocrine evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and sella turcica were performed. RESULTS: Both fundi showed symptoms of morning glory syndrome. The discs were pink and deeply excavated, and were surrounded by a ring of chorioretinal pigmentary disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the absence of the infundibulum and posterior pituitary ectopia. Growth hormone studies confirmed the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. Therapy with recombinant human growth hormone was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Although most cases of morning glory syndrome occur as isolated ocular abnormalities, it may occur in association with systemic anomalies, including posterior pituitary ectopia and hypopituitarism. A complete general physical examination and growth evaluation is important for early detection and treatment, resulting in benefit for these patients.",M2

14709795,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide does not colocalize with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei and <e>posterior pituitary</e> of cats and rats.Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) immunoreactive cells were demonstrated in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei in cats and rats. In cats these immunoreactive cells were stained without any treatment or intervention; however, in rats we had to use the pituitary stalk section to enhance the amount of PACAP and VIP for successful immunostaining. In both species the regions occupied by PACAP and VIP immunoreactive cells partially overlap each other in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Nevertheless, in either cats or rats PACAP and VIP immunoreactivities do not colocalize in the same cells studied by double labeling immunohistochemistry (IHC) or by the combination of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. As was expected, PACAP and VIP immunoreactive materials were stored in different fibers of the posterior pituitary where the distribution of PACAP and VIP fibers also showed different patterns: PACAP fibers form a dense plexus at the periphery of the posterior lobe, in the vicinity of the intermediate lobe; however, the VIP fibers were evenly distributed mainly in the center of the posterior lobe. In spite of the high sequence homology of PACAP and VIP, the two peptides are synthesized in different subpopulations of hypothalamic neurons. This different distribution correlates well with the different role of the hypothalamic PACAP and VIP in the biologic clock and in the functions of the anterior and posterior pituitary.",M2
14665445,"Regulation of vasopressin secretion by ETA and ETB receptors in compartmentalized rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants.The endothelins (ET) have been implicated in vasopressin (AVP) release in vivo and in vitro. The effects of ET in this system are complex, and the net AVP secretory response likely depends on a unique combination of ET isoform, ET receptor subtype, and neural locus. The purpose of these studies was to examine the role of ET receptor subtypes at hypothalamic vs. neurohypophysial sites on somatodendritic and neurohypophysial AVP secretion. Experiments were done in cultured explants of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of Long Evans rats. Either the whole explant (standard) or only the hypothalamus or <e>posterior pituitary</e> (compartmentalized) was exposed to log dose increases (0.01-10 nM) of the agonists ET-1 (ET(A) selective), ET-3 (nonselective), or IRL-1620 (ET(B) selective) with or without selective ET(A) (BQ-123, 2-200 nM) or ET(B) (IRL-1038, 6-600 nM) receptor antagonism. In standard explants, ET-1 and ET-3 dose-dependently increased, whereas IRL-1620 decreased net AVP release. Hypothalamic ET(B) receptor activation increased both somatodendritic and neurohypophysial AVP release. At least one intervening synapse was involved, as tetrodotoxin blocked the response. Activation of ET(A) receptors at the hypothalamic level inhibited, whereas ET(A) receptor activation at the posterior pituitary stimulated, neurohypophysial AVP secretion. Antagonism of hypothalamic ET(A) receptors potentiated the stimulatory effect of ET-1 and ET-3 on neurohypophysial secretion, an effect not observed with ET(B) receptor-induced somatodendritic release of AVP. Thus the response of whole explants reflects the net result of both stimulatory and inhibitory inputs. The integration of these excitatory and inhibitory inputs endows the vasopressinergic system with greater plasticity in its response to physiological and pathophysiological states.",M2
14625054,"Distribution of androgen-binding protein in the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system, co-localization with oxytocin.Androgen-binding protein (ABP) is known to be expressed in the male and female rat hypothalamus. In the present study, we observed immunocytochemically ABP in neurons of the magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, in the preoptic region and in the lateral hypothalamus. Dense fiber networks with varicosities, containing ABP immunofluorescence, were visible throughout the hypothalamus, the median eminence and in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe. Double immunostaining revealed a partial coexistence of ABP-and oxytocin immunoreactivity in a portion of the magnocellular perikarya. ABP was isolated by affinity chromatography from hypothalamus homogenates. Western blots resulted in immunoreactive (IR) bands with an approximate molecular weight of 35 and 50 kDa. Mass spectrometry of these preparations confirmed the presence of ABP, which was almost identical to ABP isolated from rat testis. It is likely that ABP, expressed in magnocellular oxytocinergic neurons, is subject to axonal transport and release in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.",M2

14599713,"Inhibitory effect of galanin on dopamine induced increased oxytocin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal tissue cultures.The regulation of oxytocin (OT) release by galanin (GAL) at the neurohypophyseal (NH) nerve terminal is not adequately understood. The effect of GAL on the secretion of OT was studied in 13- to 14-day cultures of isolated rat NH tissue. By this time, the hormone content of the medium had become constant. The OT content of the supernatant medium was determined by RIA after a 1- or 2-h incubation. A significantly decreased content of OT was found following incubation with 10(-6)-10(-8) M doses of GAL. Dopamine (DA) and the DA-active drugs apomorphine (APM) and Pro-Lys-Gly (PLG) (10(-6) M in each medium) increased the OT synthesis of NH tissue cultures. This elevation of OT secretion could be blocked by the administration of GAL together with DA, APM or PLG. The DA-blocking effect of GAL was prevented by previous treatment with the GAL receptor antagonist galantid (M15). The results indicate that OT release from the NH is directly influenced by the GAL-ergic system. The GAL-ergic control of OT secretion from NH tissue in rats can occur at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
14580661,"Septo-optic dysplasia with congenital hepatic fibrosis.This article reports a 7-year-old female with septo-optic dysplasia and congenital hepatic fibrosis. She manifested nystagmus and severe hepatosplenomegaly. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed agenesis of the septum pellucidum, optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary gland stalk hypoplasia, and absence of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland. She was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and adrenal insufficiency. Thus, this case was regarded as septo-optic dysplasia. No mutation was evident in the coding and boundary regions of the homeobox gene HESX1. Percutaneous biopsy of the liver demonstrated the presence of broad septa of fibrous tissue containing abundant bile ducts without inflammatory cell infiltrates, a finding compatible with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Although there is an association between septo-optic dysplasia and neonatal cholestasis, believed to be related to hypopituitarism, this case of septo-optic dysplasia with congenital hepatic fibrosis is apparently the first reported in the English literature.",M2
14504846,"MRI of ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> bright spot with large adenomas: appearances and relationship to transient postoperative diabetes insipidus.MRI of large pituitary adenomas has revealed that a posterior pituitary bright spot (PPBS), comprising ADH-containing neurosecretory granules, is commonly ectopic before surgery and attached to the tip of the pituitary stalk late after surgery. Although the PPBS indicates functional integrity of the posterior lobe, transient diabetes insipidus (DI), caused by deficiency of ADH, is frequent early after surgery. We attempted to clarify how the shape, signal intensity and site of the PPBS before surgery are related to transient DI in the early postoperative period. We carried out MRI on 15 patients with a large adenoma and an ectopic PPBS before surgery and then within 1 week (early), 1-2 months (intermediate) and 6 or more months (late) after the operation. There were nine who had transient DI, which subsided by the intermediate study; none had permanent DI. Regardless of transient DI, the PPBS was visible, and its signal intensity was similar, on all postoperative studies. Although 11 did not change in shape, four showed a remarkable change from a flat shape before surgery to a rounded one postoperatively. On the intermediate MRI, the PPBS had descended to the level of the diaphragma as mass effect disappeared.",M2
12899671,"Modulation of GABAA receptors and neuropeptide secretion by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone in posterior and intermediate pituitary.A number of neurosteroids bind to GABAA receptors and alter their responsiveness to neurotransmitters. Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding how this form of receptor modulation alters inhibitory synaptic function. Neurosteroid-sensitive GABAA receptors have also been demonstrated in many endocrine cells, but little is known about how neurosteroids modulate the release of hormones. Here, the action of allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that enhances GABAA receptor-mediated responses, was investigated in <e>posterior pituitary</e> nerve terminals and intermediate pituitary endocrine cells. Patch clamp recordings showed that GABA-evoked currents were enhanced to similar degrees and with similar concentration dependences in both locations. An organ bath preparation of the neurointermediate lobe was used to investigate drug effects on secretion of vasopressin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. GABA increased the basal release of vasopressin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone from the posterior and intermediate pituitary lobe, respectively, an effect that could be blocked by picrotoxinin. Vasopressin release evoked by electrical stimulation was also examined, and a small statistically significant inhibition by 5 microM GABA was observed. Allopregnanolone increased the basal release of vasopressin, and this effect was blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxinin. Allopregnanolone had no effect in conjunction with GABA. In contrast to the posterior lobe, allopregnanolone had no effect on release from the intermediate lobe. Thus, allopregnanolone in physiological relevant concentrations modulates GABAA receptors in both the posterior and intermediate lobes, but only affects hormone release in the posterior lobe.",M2
12750014,"Induction of galanin-like peptide gene expression in the rat <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland during endotoxin shock and adjuvant arthritis.Galanin-like peptide (GALP) was recently isolated from the porcine hypothalamus. The GALP mRNA is restricted in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and pituicytes in the posterior pituitary grand (PP) of the rat. The physiological function of the GALP is not clear in both areas. We focused on the regulation of the GALP gene expression to determine the role of GALP in the PP. We examined the effects of potent stressors to modulate a pituitary function, nociceptive stimuli and acute and chronic inflammatory stresses on the expression of the GALP gene in the PP using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 5% formalin in the bilateral hind paws caused a moderate increase of GALP gene expression in the PP. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also caused a marked increase of GALP gene expression in the PP. Effects of i.p. injection of LPS on the expression of the GALP gene in the PP were attenuated by pretreatment with i.p. injection of indomethacin. The levels of GALP mRNA in the PP were markedly increased by two peaks at 24 h and 15 days after s.c. injection of heat-inactivated M. butyricum that induced adjuvant arthritis. These results suggested that inflammatory stresses may be a potent stimulant to induce the expression of the GALP gene in the PP.",M2

12649596,"Cell volume induced hormone secretion: studies on signal transduction and specificity.Cell swelling causes an immediate secretory response in various cell types. Induced secretion possesses some unique features suggesting the involvement of a specific signal transduction pathway. The effect of 10-20 microM GdCl3, 100 microM HgCl2, 1-100 microM indomethacin and 1-20 microM nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on cell swelling-induced hormone secretion (isosmotic 80 mM ethanol or 15-30% hyposmotic medium) from incubated rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and <e>posterior pituitary</e> (oxytocin and TRH), isolated pancreatic islets (TRH) and perifused anterior pituitary cells (prolactin) were examined. To determine how general the effect of cell swelling is on exocytotic secretion, the release of two different neurohormones (thyrotropin releasing hormone -TRH and oxytocin) from the same tissue explant were studied. Both hyposmotic medium or isosmotic ethanol containing medium induced immediate TRH and prolactin release from the tested tissues. The effect of GdCl3, HgCl2, NDGA or indomethacin showed no inhibition of cell swelling induced secretion. In contrast to TRH, oxytocin release was not induced by isosmotic ethanol containing medium from the PVN or posterior pituitary. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that signal transduction leading to exocytosis after cell swelling does not involve GdCl3 sensitive stretch activated channels, mercury sensitive aquaporins, or indomethacin and NDGA sensitive mediators including prostaglandins and leukotriens. Cell swelling-induced exocytosis possesses limited selectivity; cells specifically involved in water and salt regulation retain their specific response to osmotic stimuli.",M2
12639960,"Microarray analysis reveals interleukin-6 as a novel secretory product of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.Physiological activation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) by dehydration results is a massive release of vasopressin (VP) from the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. This is accompanied by a functional remodeling of the HNS. In this study we used cDNA arrays in an attempt to identify genes that exhibit differential expression in the hypothalamus following dehydration. Our study revealed nine candidate genes, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a putative novel secretory product of HNS worthy of further analysis. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry confirmed that IL-6 is robustly expressed in the supraoptic (SON) and the paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus. By double staining immunofluorescence we showed that IL-6 is largely co-localized with VP in the SON and PVN. In situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting all revealed IL-6 up-regulation in the SON and PVN following dehydration, thus validating the array data. The same dehydration stimulus resulted in an increase in IL-6 immunoreactivity in the axons of the internal zone of the median eminence and a marked reduction in IL-6-like material in the posterior pituitary gland. We thus suggest that IL-6 takes the same secretory pathway as VP and is secreted from the posterior pituitary following a physiological stimulus.",M2

He had previously suffered from orbital myositis, central diabetes insipidus (DI), peripheral neuritis, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Physical and immunological examinations revealed that he was suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region demonstrated a significant enlargement of the pituitary stalk and <e>posterior pituitary</e>. Endocrinological examinations showed that he had not only DI and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism but also hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism, which were ascribed to the pituitary stalk lesion. Lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis associated with SLE was diagnosed. Administration of 30 mg/day of prednisolone for one month resulted in a marked reduction of the pituitary stalk thickening and posterior pituitary. It is recommended that a pharmacological dose of glucocorticoid be used in the treatment of lymphocytic hypophysitis patients who show significant thickening of the pituitary stalk and/or a large pituitary mass.",M2
12609754,"Effects of lipopolysaccharide on neurokinin A content and release in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.The administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly affects pituitary secretion, and its effects are probably mediated by cytokines produced by immune cells or by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis itself. Since neurokinin A (NKA) plays a role in inflammatory responses and is involved in the control of prolactin secretion, we examined the in vivo effect of LPS on the concentration of NKA in hypothalamus and pituitary (assessed by RIA) and serum prolactin levels in male rats. One hour after the intraperitoneal administration of LPS (250 microg/rat), NKA content was decreased in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> but not in the hypothalamus or anterior pituitary. Three hours after injection, LPS decreased NKA concentration in the hypothalamus and anterior and posterior pituitary. In all the conditions tested, LPS significantly decreased serum prolactin. We also examined the in vitro effects of LPS (10 microg/ml), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 10 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha, 50 ng/ml) on hypothalamic NKA release. Interleukin-6 increased NKA release without modifying hypothalamic NKA concentration, whereas neither LPS nor TNF-alpha affected them. Our results suggest that IL-6 may be involved in the increase of hypothalamic NKA release induced by LPS. NKA could participate in neuroendocrine responses to endotoxin challenge.",M2
12609499,"The magnocellular oxytocin system, the fount of maternity: adaptations in pregnancy.Oxytocin secretion from the <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland is increased during parturition, stimulated by the uterine contractions that forcefully expel the fetuses. Since oxytocin stimulates further contractions of the uterus, which is exquisitely sensitive to oxytocin at the end of pregnancy, a positive feedback loop is activated. The neural pathway that drives oxytocin neurons via a brainstem relay has been partially characterised, and involves A2 noradrenergic cells in the brainstem. Until close to term the responsiveness of oxytocin neurons is restrained by neuroactive steroid metabolites of progesterone that potentiate GABA inhibitory mechanisms. As parturition approaches, and this inhibition fades as progesterone secretion collapses, a central opioid inhibitory mechanism is activated that restrains the excitation of oxytocin cells by brainstem inputs. This opioid restraint is the predominant damper of oxytocin cells before and during parturition, limiting stimulation by extraneous stimuli, and perhaps facilitating optimal spacing of births and economical use of the store of oxytocin accumulated during pregnancy. During parturition, oxytocin cells increase their basal activity, and hence oxytocin secretion increases. In addition, the oxytocin cells discharge a burst of action potentials as each fetus passes through the birth canal. Each burst causes the secretion of a pulse of oxytocin, which sharply increases uterine tone; these bursts depend upon auto-stimulation by oxytocin released from the dendrites of the magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. With the exception of the opioid mechanism that emerges to restrain oxytocin cell responsiveness, the behavior of oxytocin cells and their inputs in pregnancy and parturition is explicable from the effects of hormones of pregnancy (relaxin, estrogen, progesterone) on pre-existing mechanisms, leading through relative quiescence at term inter alia to net increase in oxytocin storage, and reduced auto-inhibition by nitric oxide generation. Cyto-architectonic changes in parturition, involving evident retraction of glial processes between oxytocin cells so they get closer together, are probably a response to oxytocin neuron activation rather than being essential for their patterns of firing in parturition.",M2
12576148,"Atrial natriuretic peptide mediates oxytocin secretion induced by osmotic stimulus.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), first discovered in the heart, has been also detected in various brain regions involved in the control of cardiovascular function and water and sodium balance. The anteroventral region of the third ventricle (AV3V) and the subfornical organ (SFO) have ANP-immunoreactive projections towards the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Extracellular fluid (ECF) hyperosmolality stimulates the secretion of oxytocin (OT) which induces ANP release by the atrium. On the other hand, passive immunoneutralization of ANP reduces OT secretion in response to ECF hypertonicity. Previous studies have shown the co-localization of ANP and OT in PVN and SON neurons and in the periventricular region, as well as the presence of ANPergic and oxytocinergic neurons in the median eminence. The aim of the present study was to investigate the OT and ANP content in the SON and PVN of the hypothalamus and in the <e>posterior pituitary</e> (PP) after an osmotic stimulus that induces OT secretion. The results showed that intracerebroventricular microinjection of normal rabbit serum (NRS) or of ANP antiserum followed or not by an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline did not alter OT secretion or OT content in the PVN, SON, and PP; passive ANP immunoneutralization reduced the basal content of ANP in the PVN, SON, and PP of animals in a situation of isotonicity; the ANP antiserum inhibited the increase of OT secretion and content of OT and ANP in the PVN, SON and PP induced by the osmotic stimulus. Thus, the increase in plasma OT and oxytocinergic neurons of the hypothalamus-posterior pituitary system in response to hypertonicity depends on the action of endogenous ANP, i.e., ECF hypertonicity must activate ANPergic neurons which directly or indirectly stimulate OT release.",M2
12566720,"Diabetes insipidus.Diabetes insipidus is a heterogeneous condition characterized by polyuria and polydipsia caused by a lack of secretion of vasopressin, its physiological suppression following excessive water intake, or kidney resistance to its action. In many patients, it is caused by the destruction or degeneration of the neurons that originate in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Known causes of these lesions include: germinoma or craniopharyngioma; Langerhans cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis of the central nervous system; local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases; trauma following surgery or accident; and, rarely, genetic defects in vasopressin biosynthesis inherited as autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive traits. Thirty to fifty percent of cases are considered idiopathic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows identification of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> hyperintensity and of hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities. Thickening of the pituitary stalk is the second most common finding on MRI scans in several local inflammatory pathologies and autoimmune diseases or germinoma, but it is not specific to any single subtype. A progressive increase in the size of the anterior pituitary gland should alert physicians to the possibility that a germinoma is present, whereas a decrease can suggest the presence of an inflammatory or autoimmune process. Most children with acquired central diabetes insipidus and a thickened pituitary stalk have anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies during follow-up. Biopsy of enlarged pituitary stalk should be reserved for patients with a hypothalamic-pituitary mass and progressive thickening of the pituitary stalk, since spontaneous recovery may occur.",M2

12535156,"Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin potentiates the effect of osmotic stimulation on vasopressin synthesis and secretion in the rat hypothalamus.Vasopressin secreted by magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei is essential for water balance. In this study, we examined magnocellular neurone responses to osmotic stimulation in vehicle-injected controls or rats receiving an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 250 microg/100 g of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 3 h or 6 h earlier. LPS injection had no effect on plasma vasopressin concentrations in control rats but it caused marked and transient potentiation of the responses to a single i.p. injection of hypertonic saline (five- and two-fold, 3 and 6 h after LPS, respectively). The enhancement of plasma vasopressin responses was independent of plasma sodium concentrations or changes in blood pressure. Basal vasopressin mRNA expression in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei decreased slightly 6 h after LPS injection, without changes in vasopressin transcription as indicated by vasopressin heteronuclear (hn) RNA levels. Parvocellular neurones showed expected increases in vasopressin hnRNA expression following LPS injection and a further increase after i.p. hypertonic saline injection (due to the painful component). In contrast to magnocellular vasopressin mRNA expression, the effects of LPS and hypertonic saline injections in parvocellular neurones were additive and not synergistic. Light microscopic immunohistochemical examination revealed an increase in size of vasopressin but not oxytocin axonal terminals in the neural lobe 3 h after LPS injection. Osmotic stimulation caused marked depletion of vasopressin immunoreactivity in axonal terminals of the neural lobe in both control and LPS-pretreated rats. The changes in vasopressin axon terminals were accompanied by induction of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 in the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. The data show that endotoxemia causes morphological and functional alterations of the hypothalamic neurohypophyseal system, resulting in facilitation rather than inhibition of vasopressin synthesis, and secretion in response to osmotic stimulation.",M2
12488823,"The effect of D-aspartate on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, GABA and dopamine release.Since D-aspartate stimulates prolactin and LH release, our objective was to determine whether D-aspartate modifies the release of hypothalamic and <e>posterior pituitary</e> factors involved in the control of their secretion and whether its effects on these tissues are exerted through NMDA receptors and mediated by nitric oxide. In the hypothalamus, D-aspartate stimulated luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and GABA release and inhibited dopamine release through interaction with NMDA receptors. It increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, and its effects on LHRH and hypothalamic GABA release were blunted when NOS was inhibited. In the posterior pituitary gland, D-aspartate inhibited GABA release but had no effect on dopamine or alpha-MSH release. We report that D-aspartate differentially affects the release of hypothalamic and posterior pituitary factors involved in the regulation of pituitary hormone secretion.",M2
12468105,"Inhibitory effect of galanin on dopamine-induced enhanced vasopressin secretion in rat neurohypophyseal tissue cultures.The effect of galanin (GAL) on vasopressin (VP) secretion was studied in 13-14-day cultures of isolated rat neurohypophyseal (NH) tissue. The VP content of the supernatant was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after a 1- or 2-h incubation. A significantly decreased content of VP was detected following the administration of 10(-6)-10(-9) M doses of GAL. Dopamine (DA) and the DA-active drugs apomorphine (APM) and Pro-Lys-Gly (PLG) (10(-6) M in each medium) increased the VP level of NH tissue cultures. This VP concentration elevation could be blocked by the administration of GAL together with DA, APM or PLG. The DA-blocking effect of GAL was prevented by previous treatment with the GAL receptor antagonist galantid (M15). The results indicate that VP release is directly influenced by the GAL-ergic system. The GAL-ergic control of VP secretion from NH tissue in rats can occur independently of the hypothalamus, at the level of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.",M2
12414875,"Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging and function in patients with growth hormone deficiency with and without mutations in GHRH-R, GH-1, or PROP-1 genes.Pituitary stalk interruption and ectopic posterior lobe on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequently observed in patients with GH deficiency (GHD), but their pathogenesis remains controversial. We performed pituitary stimulation tests, MRI, and studied GH-1, GHRH receptor (GHRH-R), and Prophet of Pit-1 (PROP-1) genes in 76 patients with GHD. Of 33 patients with isolated GHD, 4 had GH-1 deletions and 4 had GHRH-R mutations; of 43 patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiency, 1 had PIT-1 and 5 had PROP-1 mutations. Compared with the 62 patients without mutations, 14 patients with mutations had higher frequency of consanguinity (57 vs. 2%, P &lt; 0.001), familial cases (21 vs. 3%, P &lt; 0.05), and lower frequency of breech delivery or hypoxemia at birth (0 vs. 39%, P &lt; 0.005). On MRI, all patients with mutations had an intact stalk, whereas it was interrupted or thin in 74% without mutations (P &lt; 0.001). The <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe was in normal position in 92% of patients with mutations against 13% without mutations (P &lt; 0.001). Among patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiency, hormonal deficiencies were of pituitary origin in all with PROP-1 and PIT-1 mutations and suggestive of hypothalamic origin in 81% without mutations. Perinatal insults were associated with thin/interrupted pituitary stalk, ectopic posterior lobe, and hypothalamic origin of hormonal deficiencies. In contrast, GH-1, GHRH-R, and PROP-1 mutations were associated with consanguineous parents, intact pituitary stalk, normal posterior lobe, and pituitary origin of hormonal deficiencies. We conclude that pituitary MRI and hormonal response to stimulation tests are useful in selection of patients and candidate genes to elucidate the etiological diagnosis of GHD.",M2
12372734,"Ectopic <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe and periventricular heterotopia: cerebral malformations with the same underlying mechanism?BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ectopic posterior pituitary lobe often occurs in children with growth hormone deficiency and is part of the spectrum associated with septo-optic dysplasia. Some cases of septo-optic dysplasia are caused by homozygous mutations in the homeobox gene HESX1, whereas heterozygous mutations are associated with milder phenotypes. To date, HESX1 is the only gene associated with ectopic posterior pituitary lobe. We describe an association between ectopic posterior pituitary lobe and periventricular heterotopia in four children without classic features of septo-optic dysplasia and suggest possible mechanisms on the basis of a review of pituitary embryology and recent molecular genetic advances. METHODS: Among 20 children with ectopic posterior pituitary lobe, four had associated periventricular heterotopia. We herein review the clinical and MR imaging findings of these four children. Mutation screening of HESX1 was performed in two. RESULTS: All four children had growth hormone deficiency. None had visual or neurologic disturbances. MR images showed a range of pituitary appearances, with scattered discrete periventricular heterotopia in each case. Other abnormalities were limited to small suprasellar lipomas and callosal dysgenesis. A heterozygous HESX1 mutation was present in one case. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of ectopic posterior pituitary lobe and periventricular heterotopia suggests they have a common underlying genetic basis that is due to gene expression at different locations and stages of development. The presence of a heterozygous HESX1 mutation in one case suggests this gene is important in the development of both ectopic posterior pituitary lobe and periventricular heterotopia and supports their place in the spectrum of septo-optic dysplasia. Further analysis of HESX1 and other genes in related developmental pathways will elucidate their roles in the development of both malformations.",M2
12207161,"Lipopolysaccharide- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced changes in prolactin secretion and dopaminergic activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects pituitary hormone secretion, including prolactin release, by inducing synthesis and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Since prolactin is mainly under tonic inhibitory control of dopamine, we investigated the effect of LPS and TNF-alpha on the hypothalamic-pituitary dopaminergic system. LPS (100-250 microg/rat, i.p.) decreased serum prolactin levels after 1 or 3 h. Sulpiride, a dopaminergic antagonist, increased serum prolactin and blocked the inhibitory effect of LPS. LPS increased hypothalamic dopamine and DOPAC concentrations and the DOPAC/dopamine ratio both in mediobasal hypothalamus and the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. LPS also enhanced dopamine and DOPAC concentration in the anterior pituitary. LPS elevated plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine but it did not modify the concentration of epinephrine or norepinephrine in the tissues studied. The administration of TNF-alpha (i.c.v., 1 h, 100 ng/rat) decreased serum prolactin but did not affect plasma catecholamine levels. TNF-alpha did not modify the DOPAC/dopamine ratio in hypothalamus or posterior pituitary but increased dopamine and DOPAC concentrations in the anterior pituitary. Incubations of hypothalamic explants showed that TNF-alpha did not modify in vitro basal dopamine release and reduced K(+)-evoked dopamine release. On the contrary, incubations of posterior pituitaries showed that TNF-alpha significantly increased basal and K(+)-evoked dopamine release. These results indicate that LPS and TNF-alpha increase dopamine turnover in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This increase in dopaminergic activity could mediate the inhibitory effect of LPS and TNF-alpha on prolactin release. Furthermore, the increase in dopaminergic activity elicited by LPS could be mediated by an increase in hypothalamic TNF-alpha during endotoxemia.",M2
12193077,"Modulation of ET(B) receptor-induced arginine-vasopressin secretion by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-dependent mechanisms in hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants.The endothelins (ETs) stimulate the secretion of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in vivo and in vitro. The activation of hypothalamic ET(B) receptors increases AVP release, but the neurotransmitters mediating these responses are not known. In the compartmentalized hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explant model, the overall basal release of AVP was 53+/-17 pg x h(-1) x PP(-1) (where PP is <e>posterior pituitary</e>). ET(B) receptor activation in hypothalamic sites by 1 nM IRL1620 dose-dependently increased AVP secretion, with a maximal response of 340+/-70% of basal x h(-1) x PP(-1), whereas 1 nM ET-1, the ET(A) receptor-selective agonist, inhibited AVP release to 44+/-8% x h(-1) x PP(-1). Addition of MK801 along with IRL1620 inhibited AVP release to a value no different from basal (122+/-41% x h(-1) x PP(-1)). In contrast, 10 microM DNQX [6,7-dinitroquinozaline-2,3-(1H,4H)-dione] did not block ET(B) receptor-induced AVP release (326+/-73% x h(-1) x PP(-1)), and nor did non-selective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonism. The GABA(A) (where GABA is gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor agonist muscimol (10 microM) inhibited AVP release in response to IRL1620 (127+/-30% x h(-1) x explant(-1)). These data suggest that AVP release induced by activation of hypothalamic ET(B) receptors is mediated by a hypothalamic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated mechanism. In turn, the local release of GABA associated with NMDA activation may exert an inhibitory influence and dampen the AVP secretory response.",M2
12098644,"The activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors differentially affects GABA and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone release from the hypothalamus and the <e>posterior pituitary</e> of male rats.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) release from hypothalamic fragments and posterior pituitaries. The actions of a number of subtype-selective mGluR agonists were monitored. A group I mGluR agonist, (S)-3-hydroxyphenylglycine (3-HPG; 0.5 mM), decreased K+-induced hypothalamic GABA release. (RS)-1-Aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA), a specific group I mGluR antagonist (0.2 mM), blocked the effect of 3-HPG. (2S, 1'S, 2'S)-2-(Carboxycyclopropyl) glycine (L-CCG-I) and L-serine-O-phosphate (L-SOP; 0.01-1 mM), agonists of group II and III mGluRs, respectively, did not modify hypothalamic evoked GABA release. Group I mGluR activation decreased, whereas group III increased and group II induced no changes in GABA release from the posterior pituitary. 3-HPG (1 mM) and L-CCG-I (0.1 mM) decreased, whereas L-SOP (0.01-0.1 mM) did not change alpha-MSH release from hypothalamic fragments. No agonists of the three mGluR groups modified alpha-MSH release from the posterior pituitary. These results indicate that activation of mGluRs differentially affects GABA and alpha-MSH release from the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary.",M2
12097912,"Capacitance steps and fusion pores of small and large-dense-core vesicles in nerve terminals.The vesicles that package neurotransmitters fall into two distinct classes, large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) and small synaptic vesicles, the coexistence of which is widespread in nerve terminals. High resolution capacitance recording reveals unitary steps proportional to vesicle size. Measurements of capacitance steps during LDCV and secretory granule fusion in endocrine and immune cells have provided important insights into exocytosis; however, extending these measurements to small synaptic vesicles has proven difficult. Here we report single vesicle capacitance steps in <e>posterior pituitary</e> nerve terminals. These nerve terminals contain neuropeptide-laden LDCVs, as well as microvesicles. Microvesicles are similar to synaptic vesicles in size, morphology and molecular composition, but their contents are unknown. Capacitance steps of two characteristic sizes, corresponding with microvesicles and LDCVs, were detected in patches of nerve terminal membrane. Both types of vesicles fuse in response to depolarization-induced Ca(2+) entry. Both undergo a reversible fusion process commonly referred to as 'kiss-and-run', but only rarely. Fusion pores seen during microvesicle kiss-and-run have a conductance of 19 pS, 11 times smaller than LDCV fusion pores. Thus, LDCVs and microvesicles use structurally different intermediates during exocytosis.",M2
11980620,"Clinical and molecular analysis of three families with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a novel and recurrent mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene.OBJECTIVE: To test further the hypothesis that autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adFNDI) is caused by heterozygous mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene that exert a dominant negative effect by producing a precursor that misfolds, accumulates and eventually destroys the neurosecretory neurons. METHODS: Antidiuretic function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> and AVP-NPII gene analysis were performed in 10 affected members of three unreported families with adFNDI. RESULTS: As in previously studied patients, adFNDI apparently manifested after birth, was due to a partial or severe deficiency of AVP, and was associated with absence or diminution of the hyperintense MRI signal normally emitted by the posterior pituitary, and with a heterozygous mutation in the AVP-NPII gene. In family A, a transition 275G--&gt;A, which predicts replacement of cysteine 92 by tyrosine (C92Y), was found in the index patient, but not in either parent, indicating that it arose de novo. The six affected members of family B had a transversion 160G--&gt;C, which predicts replacement of glycine 54 by arginine (G54R). It appeared de novo in the oldest affected member, and was transmitted in a dominant manner. In family C, six of 15 living affected members were tested and all had a novel transition, 313T--&gt;C, which predicts replacement of cysteine 105 by arginine (C105R). It, too, was transmitted in a dominant manner. As in other patients with adFNDI, the amino acids replaced by the mutations in these three families are known to be particularly important for correct and efficient folding of the precursor. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the malfolding/toxicity hypothesis underlying the pathogenesis of adFNDI. Moreover, they illustrate the value of genetic analysis in all patients who develop idiopathic diabetes insipidus in childhood, even if no other family members are affected.",M2
11950639,"Preoperative location of the pituitary bright spot in patients with pituitary macroadenomas.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the location of the pituitary bright spot in patients with pituitary macroadenomas before surgery. METHODS: A total of 54 patients with pituitary macroadenomas were retrospectively included in this study. Nonenhanced spin-echo T1-weighted MR images were reviewed to identify the location of the high-intensity-signal <e>posterior pituitary</e> lobe that indicates antidiuretic hormone (ADH) storage. Images were acquired with a 1.5-T machine by using 3-mm-thick contiguous sections in two or three orthogonal planes and a 300 x 512 matrix. RESULTS: The bright spot corresponding to ADH storage was identified in 44 (81%) patients. Two groups of patients were defined by the height of the macroadenoma: Group A patients (n = 27) had pituitary macroadenomas less than 20 mm in height, and group B (n = 27) had macroadenomas 20 mm or larger. In group A, the bright spot was identified in 25 patients (93%); it was located in the sella in 24 of these cases (96%). In group B, the bright spot was identified in 19 patients (70%); it was in an ectopic location in 14 of these cases (74%). CONCLUSION: MR imaging can be used to depict the pituitary bright spot in most patients with pituitary macroadenomas before surgery. The bright spot is usually identified at its expected location within the sella in patients with pituitary macroadenomas less than 20 mm in height, whereas an ectopic location is common when pituitary macroadenomas are larger more than 20 mm.",M2
11836335,"Effects of aging on vasopressin production in a kindred with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus due to the DeltaE47 neurophysin mutation.Postmortem examinations of the hypothalamus of patients with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adNDI), which have been reported only on persons dying between the ages of 37-87 yr, reveal the presence of the arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing parvocellular neurons but the absence of 95% of the expected AVP-producing magnocellular neurons. To determine whether the clinical course of adNDI is compatible with the hypothesis that the neuropathologic findings are attributable to a progressive loss of magnocellular neurons beginning in early life, we performed <e>posterior pituitary</e> magnetic resonance imaging and water deprivation tests, including plasma ACTH measurements, on 17 affected members of a kindred with the deltaE47 neurophysin mutation whose ages ranged from 3 months to 54 yr. Nine adult nonaffected members (ages, 20-56 yr) underwent these tests as controls. All six children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a posterior pituitary hyperintense signal (PPHS). Eight of nine affected adults showed an absent or barely visible PPHS, whereas eight of nine age-matched nonaffected adults produced a normal size PPHS. During water deprivation tests, infants concentrated their urine normally, and a 3-month-old infant produced a high plasma AVP level of 15.7 pmol/liter. By school age, affected children were no longer able to concentrate their urine or prevent hypernatremia. Affected adults became dehydrated; their median plasma AVP level was less than 1.0 pmol/liter, but their median fasting plasma ACTH was 2-fold greater than the level of nonaffected adults (10.0 vs. 5.0 pmol/liter; P = 0.008). These results suggest that adNDI is a progressive disease associated with chronic loss of the magnocellular neurons that supply AVP to the posterior pituitary but preservation of the parvocellular neurons that supply AVP and CRH to the median eminence and stimulate ACTH production during hypernatremia.",M2
11784695,"Naturally occurring free D-aspartate is a nuclear component of cells in the mammalian hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.It is generally believed that only L-amino acids have a physiological role in species other than bacteria. Recently, the existence of some D-amino acids, particularly D-aspartate, in various organs of several higher animals has been reported. Here we demonstrate that naturally occurring free D-aspartate is localized subcellularly to the heterochromatin in the nucleoli (but not in either the dendrites or axonal terminals) of magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the rat hypothalamus, and also of microglia and pericytes in the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. Our results imply that naturally occurring free D-aspartate might have a physiological role in nuclear function in mammals. The findings provide new insight for the biological function of D-stereoisomers of amino acids as well as the organization of the nucleus of at least some eukaryotic cells.",M2
11762705,"Differential effects of glutamate agonists and D-aspartate on oxytocin release from hypothalamus and <e>posterior pituitary</e> of male rats.In order to determine whether ionotropic (iGluRs) and metabotropic (mGluRs) glutamate receptor activation modulates oxytocin release in male rats, we investigated the effect of agonists of both types of glutamate receptors on oxytocin release from hypothalamus and posterior pituitary. Kainate and quisqualate (1 mM) increased hypothalamic oxytocin release. Their effects were prevented by selective AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists. NMDA (0.01-1 mM) did not modify hypothalamic oxytocin release. Group I mGluR agonists, such as quisqualate and 3-HPG, significantly increased hypothalamic oxytocin release. These effects were blocked by AIDA (a selective antagonist of group I mGluRs). In the posterior pituitary, oxytocin release was not modified by kainate, quisqualate, trans-ACPD (a broad-spectrum mGluR agonist) and L-SOP (a group III mGluR agonist). However, NMDA (0.1 mM) significantly decreased oxytocin release from posterior pituitary. D-Aspartate significantly increased oxytocin release from the hypothalamus, while it decreased oxytocin release from posterior pituitary. AP-5 (a specific NMDA receptor antagonist) reduced the D-Aspartate effect in the hypothalamus, but not in the posterior pituitary. Our data indicate that the activation of non-NMDA receptors and group I mGluRs stimulates oxytocin release from hypothalamic nuclei, whereas NMDA inhibits oxytocinergic terminals in the posterior pituitary. D-Aspartate also has a dual effect on oxytocin release: stimulatory at the hypothalamus and inhibitory at the posterior pituitary. These results suggest that excitatory amino acids differentially modulate the secretion of oxytocin at the hypothalamic and posterior pituitary levels.",M2
11755241,"Immunocytochemical localization of a galanin-like peptide (GALP) in pituicytes of the rat <e>posterior pituitary</e> gland.A galanin-like peptide (GALP) was recently isolated as a ligand of GalR2, a galanin receptor subtype. The GALP mRNA is expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary (PP). In this study, we demonstrated the localization of GALP-immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the rat PP. In normal conditions, a few GALP-ir cells were detected in the PP, and these cells increased on dehydration for 4 days. The GALP-immunopositive reaction was dramatically enhanced by the intraperitoneal injection of colchicine. For the identification of GALP-ir cells in the PP, we performed electron microscopic observation, and also double immunocytochemical staining for GALP and S-100 protein. Both studies clearly indicated that the GALP-ir cells in the PP are pituicytes.",M2
11603568,"Hyperintensity of <e>posterior pituitary</e> on MR T1WI in a boy with central diabetes insipidus caused by missense mutation of neurophysin II gene.We present a 10-year old boy with central diabetes insipidus (CDI) showing hyperintensity in a normal-sized posterior pituitary on magnetic resonance (MR) T1-weighted image (T1WI). He complained of nocturnal enuresis and polyuria. Daily urine volume increased to 4 to 5 L, and AVP plasma level was very low. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified exons of the arginine vasopressin (AVP)-neurophysin (NP) II gene were sequenced. Nucleotide-1884 guanine in Exon 2 was substituted with thymine, which induced a substitution of glycine for valine at amino acid position 65 in the NP II moiety. However, MR imaging showed hyperintensity in the posterior pituitary on T1WI. These results suggest that the MR findings of the posterior pituitary in CDI may vary.",M2
11580900,"cGMP-mediated facilitation in nerve terminals by enhancement of the spike afterhyperpolarization.cGMP has long been suspected to play a role in synaptic plasticity, but the inaccessibility of nerve terminals to electrical recording has impeded tests of this hypothesis. In <e>posterior pituitary</e> nerve terminals, nitric oxide enhanced Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel activity by activating guanylate cyclase and PKG. This enhancement occurred only at depolarized potentials, so the spike threshold remained unaltered but the afterhyperpolarization became larger. During spike trains, the enhanced afterhyperpolarization promoted Na+ channel recovery from inactivation, thus reducing action potential failures and allowing more Ca(2+) to enter. Activating guanylate cyclase, either with applied nitric oxide, or with physiological stimulation to activate nitric oxide synthase, increased action potential firing. Thus, the cGMP/nitric oxide cascade generates a short-term, use-dependent enhancement of release.",M2
11573986,"Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal responsiveness in water-deprived rats.The differential effects of osmotic stimulation on magnocellular and parvocellular hypothalamic neurons were studied by analysis of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin (VP) expression in controls and 48-h water-deprived rats subjected to either restraint for 1 h or a single lipopolysaccharide injection (250 microg/100 g). Water deprivation reduced basal CRH mRNA levels but the increments following 4 h of restraint or 6 h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection were similar to those in controls. In contrast, water deprivation had no effect on basal VP heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) and mRNA levels in parvocellular neurons, but responses to restraint or LPS injection were reduced. VP expression in magnocellular paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and plasma sodium and vasopressin were higher in water-deprived rats, changes which were unaffected by restraint. LPS injection reduced VP mRNA but not hnRNA levels in magnocellular neurons and increased plasma vasopressin levels only in water-deprived rats independently of changes in plasma sodium. This was accompanied by an increase in vasopressin mRNA content in the <e>posterior pituitary</e>. The data show that the blunted ACTH responses to acute stress during chronic osmotic stimulation are correlated with the inability of parvocellular neurons to increase VP rather than CRH expression. In addition, LPS-induced endotoxemia causes disturbances of the magnocellular vasopressinergic system with an unexpected potentiation of osmotic simulated VP secretion. The lack of increase in VP transcription after LPS and changes in VP mRNA distribution suggest that endotoxemia affect the secretory process at the levels of the neurohypophyseal axon terminal.",M2
11373325,"Immunohistochemical localization and comparison of carboxypeptidases D, E, and Z, alpha-MSH, ACTH, and MIB-1 between human anterior and corticotroph cell  basophil invasion  of the <e>posterior pituitary</e>.Basophil invasion, i.e., invasion of basophilic corticotrophs from the residual intermediate lobe into the posterior lobe of the human pituitary gland, is believed to be a physiological phenomenon. This study evaluated the distribution of CPE, CPD, CPZ, alpha-MSH, ACTH, and Ki-67 immunoreactivity between human anterior pituitary and basophil invasion of the neurohypophysis. Mild to moderate immunoreactivities for CPE and CPZ were distributed relatively uniformly in the majority of the anterior pituitary cells and basophil invasion. In contrast, only corticotrophs exhibited intense CPD immunoreactivity. Basophil invasion showed similar immunoreactivities for alpha-MSH, ACTH, CPE, and CPZ as corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary, except for CPD, which was detected much less frequently. In the posterior lobe, CPE, CPD, and CPZ were present within the Herring bodies. Although no MIB-1 immunoreactivity was identified in anterior pituitary cells, limited MIB-1 labeling was detected in basophil invasion in five of ten cases. Highly selective expression of CPD in corticotrophs suggests that CPD plays a particularly important role in prohormone (POMC) processing in corticotrophs, with minimal or no significant roles in non-corticotrophs. Evidence that corticotrophs in basophil invasion are undergoing proliferation and are also phenotypically different from their counterpart in the anterior pituitary has further raised the possibility of some neoplastic potential.",M2
11360389,"Lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis associated with recurrent optic neuritis.A 38-year-old woman presented with diabetes insipidus. The T1-weighted images showed a loss of the hyperintense signal of the <e>posterior pituitary</e> and thickening of the pituitary stalk. DDAVP was started with the diagnosis of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH). Three months later, she complained of right visual acuity loss. MRI revealed right optic nerve swelling, compatible with the diagnosis of the retrobulbar optic neuritis. She had two other such episodes in the next 3 months. She developed a transient oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies as well. Each time the symptoms disappeared with corticosteroid therapy. The pituitary stalk became normal in size 6 months later. LINH and recurrent optic neuritis occurred in a short duration. Accordingly, a common causative background is suspected. Since the auto-immune process has been hypothesized as a cause of optic neuritis, our case may present further clinical evidence to support the hypothesis of an auto-immune mechanism for LINH.",M2
11306007,"Astrocytic Fos expression in the rat <e>posterior pituitary</e> following LPS administration.Systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration has been shown to cause profound Fos expression in multiple regions of the brain. In the present experiment, Fos expression in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON), posterior pituitary, and anterior pituitary was investigated using quantitative immunohistochemistry. In the SON and anterior pituitary, a large number of Fos-positive cells were observed by restraint stress, hyperosmotic administration (1.5, 3, and 9% NaCl), and LPS administration (5, 25, and 125 microg/kg). In the posterior pituitary, LPS administration caused a significant increase in the number of Fos-positive nuclei in a dose-dependent manner, whereas restraint stress and hyperosmotic stimulation (1.5 and 3% NaCl) did not increase the number of Fos-positive cells and 9% NaCl administration induced weak Fos immunoreactivity. Moreover, a dual-labeling study using a confocal microscope revealed that Fos-positive cells in the posterior pituitary were astrocytes using MAP2, an astrocytic marker in the posterior pituitary. Here, we demonstrated that the astrocytes of the posterior pituitary expressed Fos in response to LPS administration, which suggests that Fos expression participates in the activation of astrocytes during acute-phase responses with LPS administration.",M2
