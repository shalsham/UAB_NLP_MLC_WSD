20209335,"Comparative evaluation of phenol and thimerosal as preservatives for a candidate vaccine against American cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>.For decades thimerosal has been used as a preservative in the candidate vaccine for cutaneous leishmaniasis, which was developed by Mayrink et al. The use of thimerosal in humans has been banned due to its mercury content. This study addresses the standardization of phenol as a new candidate vaccine preservative. We have found that the proteolytic activity was abolished when the test was conducted using the candidate vaccine added to merthiolate (MtVac) as well as to phenol (PhVac). The Montenegro's skin test conversion rates induced by MtVac and by PhVac was 68.06% and 85.9%, respectively, and these values were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). The proliferative response of peripheral mononuclear blood cells shows that the stimulation index of mice immunized with both candidate vaccines was higher than the one in control animals (p &lt; 0.05). The ability of the candidate vaccines to induce protection in C57BL/10 mice against a challenge with infective Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes was tested and the mice immunized with PhVac developed smaller lesions than the mice immunized with MtVac. Electrophoresis of phenol-preserved antigen revealed a number of proteins, which were better preserved in PhVac. These results do in fact encourage the use of phenol for preserving the immunogenic and biochemical properties of the candidate vaccine for cutaneous leishmaniasis.",M1
20206667,"Treatment of canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> by the vaccine Leish-111f+MPL-SE.Immunotherapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) may provide an alternative to both marginally effective chemotherapy and undesired euthanasia of infected dogs and could have a great impact not only on animal welfare, but also on control of human disease. Therefore, we examined the potential immunotherapeutic efficacy of the subunit vaccine Leish-111f+MPL-SE, which has undergone rigorous preclinical testing and been demonstrated safe in human clinical trials. Two separate trials were performed in Salvador, Brazil, to evaluate the vaccine for therapeutic efficacy against CVL caused by natural infection: an Open Trial and a Blinded Trial. In the Open Trial 59 dogs with clinically active CVL were sequentially allocated to four groups: group 1 received Leish-111f+MPL-SE; group 2 was treated with Glucantime; group 3 received a combination of the vaccine and Glucantime; and group 4 was given no treatment. At the 6-month assessment, the 13 non-treated dogs had either died or showed no clinical improvement. In contrast, most dogs in groups 1-3 showed initial improvement (100%, 80%, and 92%, respectively). Upon evaluation for a mean of 36 months after therapy, the following cure rates were observed: 75% for group 1 dogs (exact 95% confidence interval [CI] 43-95%), 64% for group 2 dogs (exact 95% CI 31-89%), and 50% for group 3 dogs (exact 95% CI 19-81%). Therapeutic efficacy of the Leish-111f+MPL-SE vaccine was reconfirmed in a subsequent Blinded Trial. The vaccine was effective for mild cases of CVL and was compromised in dogs with severe disease. Although further studies are required to understand mechanisms of action, the Leish-111f+MPL-SE vaccine is a promising tool to control VL in both dogs and humans.",M1
20145701,"BALB/c mice vaccinated with Leishmania major ribosomal proteins extracts combined with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides become resistant to disease caused by a secondary parasite challenge.<e>Leishmaniasis</e> is an increasing public health problem and effective vaccines are not currently available. We have previously demonstrated that vaccination with ribosomal proteins extracts administered in combination of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides protects susceptible BALB/c mice against primary Leishmania major infection. Here, we evaluate the long-term immunity to secondary infection conferred by this vaccine. We show that vaccinated and infected BALB/c mice were able to control a secondary Leishmania major challenge, since no inflammation and very low number of parasites were observed in the site of reinfection. In addition, although an increment in the parasite burden was observed in the draining lymph nodes of the primary site of infection we did not detected inflammatory lesions at that site. Resistance against reinfection correlated to a predominant Th1 response against parasite antigens. Thus, cell cultures established from spleens and the draining lymph node of the secondary site of infection produced high levels of parasite specific IFN-gamma in the absence of IL-4 and IL-10 cytokine production. In addition, reinfected mice showed a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio for anti-Leishmania antibodies. Our results suggest that ribosomal vaccine, which prevents pathology in a primary challenge, in combination with parasite persistence might be effective for long-term maintenance of immunity.",M1
20106998,"In situ immunolocalization and stage-dependent expression of a secretory serine protease in Leishmania donovani and its role as a vaccine candidate.Proteases have been found to play essential roles in many biological processes, including the pathogenesis of <e>leishmaniasis</e>. Most parasites rely on their intracellular and extracellular protease repertoire to invade and multiply in mammalian host cells. However, few studies have addressed serine proteases in Leishmania and their role in host pathogenesis. Here we report the intracellular distribution of a novel L. donovani secretory serine protease in the flagellar pocket, as determined by immunogold labeling. Flow cytometry and confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expression of the protease diminishes sequentially from virulent to attenuated strains of this species and is also highly associated with the metacyclic stage of L. donovani promastigotes. The level of internalization of parasites treated with the anti-115-kDa antibody into host macrophages was significantly reduced from that of non-antibody-treated parasites, suggesting that this serine protease probably plays a role in the infection process. In vivo studies confirmed that this serine protease is a potential vaccine candidate. Altogether, the 115-kDa serine protease might play vital roles in L. donovani pathogenesis and hence could be recognized as a potential candidate for drug design.",M1
19946351,"Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies recognizing a common 57-kDa antigen of Leishmania species.BACKGROUND: The therapy of leishmania infection is difficult and each year 1.5 million new cases of cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> and 500,000 new cases of visceral leishmaniasis are estimated, therefore, there is a need for an effective vaccine. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) is one of the suitable methods for isolation and purification of leishmania antigens. In this report, we produced several mAb against leishmania infantum antigens for antigen purification to be used as candidate vaccine. METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected with freeze-thawed promastigote twice together with Freund adjuvant. Three days before fusion, antigen in saline was injected into the tail vain and then mice were killed and the spleen lymphocytes were fused with myeloma SP2/0. RESULTS: Five mAb against promastigote form of Leishmania infantum parasite were obtained. Western-blot analysis showed that these mAb recognize a band of 57- kDa protein either in parasite lysate or on whole L. infantum, L. tropica, L. major and L. donovani. It seems that the 57 kDa-protein is the major surface leishmania antigen (gp63) that is neither stage-specific nor differentially regulated. These mAb do not recognize the recombinant gp63 antigen and seems recognizing only the native form of a gp63 isoform. The IgG1 mAb was purified by affinity column and was used to purify 57 kDa antigens from Leishmania lysate. CONCLUSION: Since these antibodies recognizing one specific protein band in 4 different strains of leishmania, they could be used for leishmania diagnostic kits and also for purification of antigen to be tested for its protective effect against leishmania infection.",M1
19933862,"Ubiquitin conjugation of open reading frame F DNA vaccine leads to enhanced cell-mediated immune response and induces protection against both antimony-susceptible and -resistant strains of Leishmania donovani.Resistance of Leishmania donovani to sodium antimony gluconate has become a critical issue in the current, prolonged epidemic in India. Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that is protective against both antimony-susceptible and -resistant strains of L. donovani. The multigene LD1 locus located on chromosome 35 of Leishmania is amplified in approximately 15% of the isolates examined. The open reading frame F (ORFF), a potential vaccine candidate against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>, is part of the multigene LD1 locus. ORFF was expressed as a chimeric conjugate of ubiquitin to elicit an Ag-specific cell-mediated immune response. Analysis of the cellular immune responses of ubiquitin-conjugated ORFF (UBQ-ORFF) DNA-immunized, uninfected BALB/c mice demonstrated that the vaccine induced enhanced IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared with nonubiquitinated ORFF DNA vaccine. Higher levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma and the low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 further indicated that the immune responses with UBQ-ORFF were mediated toward the Th1 rather than Th2 type. Infection of immunized mice with either the antimony-susceptible (AG83) or -resistant (GE1F8R) L. donovani strain showed that UBQ-ORFF DNA vaccine induced higher protection when compared with ORFF DNA. UBQ-ORFF DNA-immunized and -infected mice showed a significant increase in IL-12 and IFN-gamma and significant down-regulation of IL-10. High levels of production of nitrite and superoxide, two macrophage-derived oxidants that are critical in controlling Leishmania infection, were observed in protected mice. The feasibility of using ubiquitinated-conjugated ORFF DNA vaccine as a promising immune enhancer for vaccination against both antimony-susceptible and -resistant strains of L. donovani is reported.",M1
19879995,"Safety and immunogenicity of a defined vaccine for the prevention of cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Healthy Colombian adult volunteers with no history of leishmaniasis were evaluated for evidence of previous subclinical infection with Leishmania based on the Montenegro skin test (MST). Twelve MST-positive subjects were enrolled in an open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial (the  MST-positive trial ) and received three injections of the LEISH-F1+MPL-SE vaccine (consisting of 10 microg recombinant Leishmania polyprotein LEISH-F1 antigen [TSA+LmSTI1+LeIF]+25 microg MPL-SE adjuvant). Sixty-eight MST-negative subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (the  MST-negative trial ) and were randomly assigned to receive three injections of either the vaccine (n=34), 10 microg LEISH-F1 protein alone (n=17), or saline placebo (n=17). In both trials, the study injections were given subcutaneously on Days 0, 28, and 56, and subjects were followed for safety and immunological endpoints. The LEISH-F1+MPL-SE vaccine was safe and well tolerated in MST-positive and MST-negative subjects. In both trials, an IFN-gamma response to the LEISH-F1 antigen at Day 84 was observed in more than half of the vaccine recipients. In the MST-negative trial, the IFN-gamma response was significantly more frequent and of greater magnitude in vaccine recipients than in protein-alone or placebo recipients. An IgG antibody response to LEISH-F1 was observed in all vaccine recipients. In both trials, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to LEISH-F1 was observed in most of the vaccine recipients. In the MST-negative trial, DTH was significantly higher in vaccine than placebo recipients. These clinical trials of the first defined vaccine for leishmaniasis show that the LEISH-F1+MPL-SE vaccine is safe and immunogenic in healthy subjects with and without evidence of previous subclinical infection with Leishmania.",M1

19818721,"Recombinant Leishmania tarentolae expressing the A2 virulence gene as a novel candidate vaccine against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. To date, there is no effective vaccine against this disease. Many antigens have been examined so far as protein- or DNA-based vaccines, but none of them conferred complete long-term protection. The use of live attenuated vaccines has recently emerged as a promising vaccination strategy. In this study, we stably expressed the Leishmania donovani A2 antigen in Leishmania tarentolae, a non-pathogenic member of the genus Leishmania, and evaluated its protective efficacy as a live vaccine against L. infantum challenge. Our results show that a single intraperitoneal administration of the A2-recombinant L. tarentolae strain protects BALB/c mice against L. infantum challenge and that protective immunity is associated with high levels of IFN-gamma production prior and after challenge. This is accompanied by reduced levels of IL-5 production after challenge, leading to a potent Th1 immune response. In contrast, intravenous injection elicited a Th2 type response, characterized by higher levels of IL-5 and high humoral immune response, resulting in a less efficient protection. All together, these results indicate the promise of A2-expressing L. tarentolae as a safe live vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis.",M1
19786136,"Optimized subunit vaccine protects against experimental <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Development of a protective subunit vaccine against Leishmania spp. depends on antigens and adjuvants that induce appropriate immune responses. We evaluated a second generation polyprotein antigen (Leish-110f) in different adjuvant formulations for immunogenicity and protective efficacy against Leishmania spp. challenges. Vaccine-induced protection was associated with antibody and T cell responses to Leish-110f. CD4 T cells were the source of IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-2 double- and triple-positive populations. This study establishes the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the improved Leish-110f subunit vaccine antigen adjuvanted with natural (MPL-SE) or synthetic (EM005) Toll-like receptor 4 agonists.",M1
19776191,"Vaccination with live Leishmania major and CpG DNA promotes interleukin-2 production by dermal dendritic cells and NK cell activation.Cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> due to Leishmania major is an emerging, chronic parasitic disease that causes disfigurement and social stigmatization. Drug therapy is inadequate, and there is no vaccine. Inoculation of virulent parasites (leishmanization) is the only intervention that has ever provided protection, because it mimics natural infection and immunity, but it was discontinued due to safety concerns (uncontrolled vaccinal lesions). In an effort to retain the benefits (immunity) while avoiding the side effects (lesions) of leishmanization, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with L. major and CpG DNA (Lm/CpG). This combination prevented lesions while inducing immunity. Also, the vaccination with live parasites and the Toll-like receptor 9 agonist enhanced innate immune responses by activating dermal dendritic cells (DCs) to produce cytokines. Here we report that the Lm/CpG vaccine induced dermal DCs, but not bone marrow-derived DCs, to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2). The release of this unusual DC-derived cytokine was concomitant with a peak in numbers of NK cells that produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and also enhanced activation of proliferation of IFN-gamma+ CD4+ T cells. Parasite growth was controlled in Lm/CpG-vaccinated animals. This is the first demonstration of the ability of dermal DCs to produce IL-2 and of the activation of NK cells by vaccination in the context of leishmaniasis. Understanding how the Lm/CpG vaccine enhances innate immunity may provide new tools to develop vaccines against L. major, other chronic infectious diseases, or other conditions, such as cancer.",M1
19747996,"Antibiotic resistance free plasmid DNA expressing LACK protein leads towards a protective Th1 response against Leishmania infantum infection.Canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> is a serious public health concern in the Mediterranean basin since dogs are the main Leishmania infantum reservoir. However, there is not a vaccination method in veterinary use in this area, and therefore the development of a vaccine against this parasite is essential for the possible control of the disease. Previous reports have shown the efficacy of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with the pCIneo plasmid and the poxvirus VV (both Western Reserve and MVA strains) expressing L. infantum LACK antigen against canine leishmaniasis. As pCIneo-LACK plasmid contains antibiotic resistance genes, its use as a profilactic method is not recommended. Hence, the antibiotic resistance gene free pORT-LACK plasmid is a more suitable tool for its use as a vaccine. Here we report the protective and immunostimulatory effect of the prime-boost pORT-LACK/MVA-LACK vaccination tested in a canine experimental model. Vaccination induced a reduction in clinical signs and in parasite burden in the liver, an induction of the Leishmania-specific T cell activation, as well as an increase of the expression of Th1 type cytokines in PBMC and target organs.",M1
19712953,"Immunological stimulation for the treatment of <e>leishmaniasis</e>: a modality worthy of serious consideration.Instead of relying on drugs to reduce the parasite burden of leishmaniasis, and waiting for the effector immune response to develop in time to control the parasites, immunotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy can rapidly induce the effector immune response. With a safe and potent drug plus an affordable therapeutic vaccine (immunostimulant), which remains to be developed, a single visit by patients with visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis might be sufficient to induce a quick and lasting recovery. Drug toxicity and the emergence of resistance could also be dramatically reduced compared with present long-term monotherapy. Immunotherapy could be an effective addition to chemotherapy for leishmaniasis.",M1
19706899,"Increase of NK cells and proinflammatory monocytes are associated with the clinical improvement of diffuse cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> after immunochemotherapy with BCG/Leishmania antigens.Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) is characterized by disseminated lesions and the absence of a specific cellular immune response. Here, the immunochemotherapy outcome of a patient with DCL from Amazonian Brazil infected with Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis is presented. After several unsuccessful chemotherapy treatment regimens and many relapses, a monthly immunotherapy scheme of L. amazonensis PH8 plus L. (Viannia) braziliensis M2903 monovalent vaccines associated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was established, one round of which also included an M2903 vaccine associated with intermittent antimonial treatment. Temporary healing of all lesions was achieved, although Leishmania skin tests were negative and interferon gamma was not detected in mononuclear cell cultures stimulated with Leishmania antigens. The frequencies of CD16 (+)CD56(+) NK cells (approximately 2x) and CD14 (+)CD16(+) proinflammatory monocytes (approximately 8x) increased in peripheral blood, and CD56 (+) lymphocytes were found infiltrating the lesions. An association between the increase of the frequency of innate immune system cells and the healing of lesions is shown, suggesting that this protocol of immunotherapy reduced the parasite load and activated NK cells and monocytes.",M1
19638322,"Induction of cellular and humoral responses by autoclaved and heat-killed antigen of Leishmania donovani in experimental visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.The potential of autoclaved and heat-killed antigen of Leishmania donovani to induce cell-mediated and humoral response has been evaluated in the present study. The vaccines were delivered thrice subcutaneously at an interval of 2 weeks. Two weeks after second booster, BALB/c mice were challenged with 10(7) stationary phase promastigotes of L. donovani. Significant protection was achieved in immunized mice against L. donovani challenge with 69% to 76% and 59% to 64% reduction in parasite load in the liver and spleen respectively. Immunization induced significantly higher level of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice immunized with heat-killed antigen followed by autoclaved antigen. The immune response was assessed by quantifying Leishmania-specific antibodies and cytokine production. The antibody response was predominantly of IgG type with increased IgG2a production and lesser amount of IgM. The immunization preferentially stimulates the production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in splenocytes which suggests a Th1 type response with a concomitant down-regulation of IL-10 and IL-4. These results indicate a potential for the heat-killed and autoclaved antigen as a vaccine which could trigger cell-mediated immune response.",M1
19631187,"Alterations in phenotypic profiles of peripheral blood cells from patients with human American cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> following treatment with an antimonial drug and a vaccine.The susceptibility or resistance of a vertebrate host to leishmaniasis is related to the species of Leishmania and to the host immune response of the host. In the present study, the phenotypic profiles of the peripheral blood cells of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) were evaluated before and after receiving three different therapeutic regimens. The study population comprised 24 patients, living in an ACL-endemic area of Caratinga (MG, Brazil), who had been diagnosed as ACL-positive on the basis of characteristic lesions, the Montenegro skin reactivity test, and/or positive parasitology. Subjects were divided into three groups and received treatment regimens based on (i) the pentavalent antimonial (SbV) N-methyl meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime), (ii) the vaccine Leishvacin, or (iii) SbV in association with the vaccine. Comparative analyses of peripheral mononuclear cells prior to and after treatment revealed that the therapeutic regimens induced no significant differences in the percentages of CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes, or CD16+ and CD56+ natural killer cells. Additionally, the CD4/CD8 and CD3/CD19 ratios remained unaltered by any of the treatments applied. Most previous studies in the field have focused on the analysis of peripheral blood from ACL patients following in vitro stimulation with either Leishmania antigens or mitogens. The ex vivo cellular immune phenotypic profiles determined in the present study, however, revealed that different ACL treatments did not significantly alter either the immune response exhibited by a patient prior to therapy or the expected cure rate.",M1
19592661,"Intracellular replication-deficient Leishmania donovani induces long lasting protective immunity against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.No vaccine is currently available for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani. This study addresses whether a live attenuated centrin gene-deleted L. donovani (LdCen1(-/-)) parasite can persist and be both safe and protective in animals. LdCen1(-/-) has a defect in amastigote replication both in vitro and ex vivo in human macrophages. Safety was shown by the lack of parasites in spleen and liver in susceptible BALB/c mice, immune compromised SCID mice, and human VL model hamsters 10 wk after infection. Mice immunized with LdCen1(-/-) showed early clearance of virulent parasite challenge not seen in mice immunized with heat killed parasites. Upon virulent challenge, the immunized mice displayed in the CD4(+) T cell population a significant increase of single and multiple cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF) producing cells and IFN-gamma/IL10 ratio. Immunized mice also showed increased IgG2a immunoglobulins and NO production in macrophages. These features indicated a protective Th1-type immune response. The Th1 response correlated with a significantly reduced parasite burden in the spleen and no parasites in the liver compared with naive mice 10 wk post challenge. Protection was observed, when challenged even after 16 wk post immunization, signifying a sustained immunity. Protection by immunization with attenuated parasites was also seen in hamsters. Immunization with LdCen1(-/-) also cross-protected mice against infection with L. braziliensis that causes mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Results indicate that LdCen1(-/-) can be a safe and effective vaccine candidate against VL as well as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causing parasites.",M1
19561376,"Expression of recombinant heat-shock protein 70 of MCAN/IR/96/LON-49, a tool for diagnosis and future vaccine research.BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is present in all organisms studied so far, and is a major immunogen in infections caused by pathogens including Leishmania spp. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clone and express HSP70 from L. infantum strain MCAN/IR/96/LON-49 and evaluate antibody response against HSP70 in visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> (VL). METHODS: The L. infantum HSP70 gene segment was amplified by specific primers. It was cloned into pTZ57R vector and subcloned into pET32a (+) expression vector. The new construct was transformed in the E.coli Rosetta strain, and HSP70 protein was expressed in the presence of 1 mM IPTG and purified using a HiTrap chelating column. Antibody responses against HSP70 were determined by ELISA in 37 patients with visceral leishmaniasis and 63 healthy controls. RESULTS: Expression of HSP70 protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and dot blot with an anti-His tag antibody. There was no difference between the sequence of nucleotides of the HSP70 gene in the present study and other reported sequences. The ELISA results indicated that the sera of 81.1% (30/37) of the patients and 6.3% (5/63) of controls reacted to L. infantum HSP70. CONCLUSION: The conservative nature of the HSP70 molecule is an advantage in vaccine studies, because of minor differences (6%) between the nucleotide sequences and consequently the similarity in amino acid sequences in various strains of L. infantum. It could therefore be used in vaccine research against leishmaniasis and also as a tool for serodiagnosis.",M1
19542458,"Immunization with the DNA-encoding N-terminal domain of proteophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani generates Th1-type immunoprotective response against experimental visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Leishmania produce several types of mucin-like glycoproteins called proteophosphoglycans (PPGs) which exist as secretory as well as surface-bound forms in both promastigotes and amastigotes. The structure and function of PPGs have been reported to be species and stage specific as in the case of Leishmania major and Leishmania mexicana; there has been no such information available for Leishmania donovani. We have recently demonstrated that PPG is differentially expressed in sodium stibogluconate-sensitive and -resistant clinical isolates of L. donovani. To further elucidate the structure and function of the ppg gene of L. donovani, a partial sequence of its N-terminal domain of 1.6 kb containing the majority of antigenic determinants, was successfully cloned and expressed in prokaryotic as well as mammalian cells. We further evaluated the DNA-encoding N-terminal domain of the ppg gene as a vaccine in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) against the L. donovani challenge. The prophylactic efficacy to the tune of approximately 80% was observed in vaccinated hamsters and all of them could survive beyond 6 mo after challenge. The efficacy was supported by a surge in inducible NO synthase, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 mRNA levels along with extreme down-regulation of TGF-beta, IL-4, and IL-10. A rise in the level of Leishmania-specific IgG2 was also observed which was indicative of enhanced cellular immune response. The results suggest the N-terminal domain of L. donovani ppg as a potential DNA vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis.",M1
19500553,"Vaccination of dogs with six different candidate <e>leishmaniasis</e> vaccines composed of a chimerical recombinant protein containing ribosomal and histone protein epitopes in combination with different adjuvants.Chimerical protein  Q , composed of antigenic ribosomal and histone sequences, in combination with live BCG is a promising canine leishmaniasis vaccine candidate; one of the few vaccine candidates that have been tested successfully in dogs. Unfortunately, live BCG is not an appropriate adjuvant for commercial application due to safety problems in dogs. In order to find a safe adjuvant with similar efficacy to live BCG, muramyl dipeptide, aluminium hydroxide, Matrix C and killed Propionibacterium acnes in combination with either E. coli- or baculovirus-produced recombinant JPCM5_Q protein were tested. Groups of five or seven dogs were vaccinated with six different adjuvant-antigen combinations and challenged with a high dose intravenous injection of Leishmania infantum JPC strain promastigotes. All candidate vaccines proved to be safe, and both humoral and cellular responses to the recombinant proteins were detected at the end of the prime-boost vaccination scheme. However, clinical and parasitological data obtained during the 10 month follow-up period indicated that protection was not induced by either of the six candidate vaccines. Although no direct evidence was obtained, our data suggest that live BCG may have a significant protective effect against challenge with L. infantum in dogs.",M1
19490731,"Early CD44(hi)CD4+ and CD44(hi)CD8+ T cell numbers and the absence of mannose-rich glycoconjugates determine the protective outcome of anti-leishmanial immunity.Vaccination remains the best hope for control of all forms of <e>leishmaniasis</e>, and the development of a safe and effective vaccine is a critical global public-health priority. Our previous work showed that immunization with non-persistent phosphomannomutase-deficient (DeltaPMM) Leishmania major parasites confers significant protection in susceptible BALB/c mice due to increased T-cell numbers and suppression of IL-10 and IL-13 early during infection. Here, we complemented the DeltaPMM L. major parasites with human PMM2 to determine whether we could further improve the protection. Complemented DeltaPMM parasites have restored glycoconjugate biosynthesis, while retaining avirulence of the parental knockout strain. Immunization with hPMM2 add-back parasites showed similar Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles to that observed in DeltaPMM-vaccinated mice. However, the numbers of the activated CD4+CD44(hi) and CD8+CD44(hi) T cells recruited to the draining lymph nodes early after Leishmania infection were reduced, leading to decreased protection following hPMM2-immunization. Thus, the magnitude of T-cell responses early in the infection and the absence of mannose-rich glycoconjugates determine the protective outcome of anti-leishmanial immunity.",M1
19464528,"Decrease of the incidence of human and canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> after dog vaccination with Leishmune in Brazilian endemic areas.Leishmune, the first prophylactic vaccine licensed against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), has been used in Brazil since 2004, where seropositive dogs are sacrificed in order to control human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). We demonstrate here that vaccination with Leishmune does not interfere with the serological control campaign (110,000 dogs). Only 1.3% of positivity (76 among 5860) was detected among Leishmune uninfected vaccinees. We also analyzed the possible additive effect of Leishmune vaccination over dog culling, on the decrease of the incidence of CVL and VL in two Brazilian endemic areas, from 2004 to 2006. In Araçatuba, a 25% of decline was seen in CVL with a 61% decline in human cases, indicating the additive effect of Leishmune vaccination of 5.7% of the healthy dogs (1419 dogs), on regular dog culling. In Belo Horizonte (BH), rising curves of canine and human incidence were observed in the districts of Barreiro, Venda Nova and Noroeste, while the canine and human incidence of Centro Sul, Leste, Nordeste, Norte, Pampulha and Oeste, started to decrease or maintained a stabilized plateau after Leishmune vaccination. Among the districts showing a percent decrease of human incidence (-36.5%), Centro Sul and Pampulha showed the highest dog vaccination percents (63.27% and 27.27%, respectively) and the lowest dog incidence (-3.36% and 1.89%, respectively). They were followed by Oeste, that vaccinated 25.30% of the animals and experienced an increase of only 12.86% of dog incidence and by Leste and Nordeste, with lower proportions of vaccinees (11.72% and 10.76%, respectively) and probably because of that, slightly higher canine incidences (42.77% and 35.73%). The only exception was found in Norte district where the reduced human and canine incidence were not correlated to Leishmune vaccination. Much lower proportions of dogs were vaccinated in Venda Nova (4.35%), Noroeste (10.27%) and Barreiro (0.09%) districts, which according to that exhibited very increased canine incidences (24.48%, 21.85% and 328.57%, respectively), and pronounced increases in human incidence (14%, 4% and 17%, respectively). The decrease of canine (p=-0.008) and human incidences (p=-0.048) is directly correlated to the increase of the number of vaccinated dogs, confirming the additive control effect of Leishmune vaccination over dog culling, reducing the parasite reservoir, protecting dogs and, in this way, reducing the risk of transmission of VL to humans and becoming a new effective control tool.",M1
19386420,"Selection of appropriate serological tests to measure the incidence of natural Leishmania infantum infection during DNA/MVA prime/boost canine vaccine trials.In response to the increasing need for field trials of experimental DNA vaccines against zoonotic visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> in dogs, our aim was to validate the use of ELISA protocols which will be suitable for detection of natural infection in vaccinated dogs. We have previously demonstrated that DNA/modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing tryparedoxin peroxidase (TRYP) induced high titres of TRYP antigen-specific IgG in immunized dogs. Here we report our findings that seroconversion to an unrelated diagnostic antigen rK39 did not occur in vaccinated dogs, and that responses to crude Leishmania infantum promastigote antigen (CLA) were weak and short-lived. This is in contrast to strong responses to both antigens shown in naturally infected dogs. To select an appropriate serological test for measurement of infection incidence, we also tested longitudinal samples from an immunologically well-characterized cohort of naturally infected dogs. The sensitivity of CLA ELISA was superior to that of rK39 in early stage infection (from 2 months before, to 2 months after the first detection of infection by PCR or parasitological culture), and more sensitive than rK39 in cross-sectional sampling (81.0% vs 61.9%). We conclude that CLA ELISA will provide sensitive estimates of L. infantum infection incidence in DNA/MVA vaccinated dogs, though optimal testing would include rK39, or a similar recombinant antigen, to improve overall specificity.",M1
19370612,"Interventions for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>.BACKGROUND: Pentavalent antimonial drugs are the most prescribed treatment for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Other drugs have been used with varying success. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of therapeutic interventions for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2009), the Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 1,2009), MEDLINE (2003 to January 2009), EMBASE (2005 to January 2009), LILACS (from inception to January 2009), CINAHL (1982-May 2007) and other databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatments for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 38 trials involving 2728 participants. Results are based on individual studies or limited pooled analyses. There was good evidence in:Leishmania braziliensis and L. panamensis infections:Intramuscular (IM) meglumine antimoniate (MA) was better than oral allopurinol for 28 days (1RCT n=127, RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.26, 0.58). Intravenous (IV)MA for 20-days was better than 3-day and 7-day IVMA plus 15% paromomycin plus 12% methylbenzethonium chloride (PR-MBCL) or 7-day IVMA (1RCT n= 150, RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.11, 0.50; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.53, 0.90; RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44, 0.92 respectively). Oral allopurinol plus antimonials was better than IV antimonials (2RCT n= 168, RR 1.90; 95% CI 1.40, 2.59; I(2)=0%).L. braziliensis infections:Oral pentoxifylline plus IV sodium stibogluconate (SSG) was better than IVSSG (1RCT n= 23, RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.03, 2.69); IVMA was better than IM aminosidine sulphate (1RCT n= 38, RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00, 0.78) and better than IV pentamidine isethionate (1RCT n= 80, RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29, 0.71). Intramuscular MA was better than Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (1RCT n= 93, RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.32, 0.65).L .panamensis infections:Oral allopurinol was better than IVMA (1RCT n= 58, RR 2.20; 95% CI 1.34, 3.60). Aminosidine sulphate at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and 18 mg/kg/day for 14 days were better than aminosidine sulphate 12 mg/kg/day for 7 days (1RCT n= 60, RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07, 0.73; RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07, 0.73 respectively). Oral ketoconazole for 28 days, oral miltefosine and topical PR-MBCL were better than placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most trials have been designed and reported so poorly that they are inconclusive. There is a need for large well conducted studies that evaluate long-term effects of current therapies to improve quality and standardization of methods.",M1
19221514,"Vaccines and vaccination strategies against human cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>.One might think that the development of a vaccine against cutaneous leishmaniasis would be relatively straightforward because the type of immune response required for protection is known and natural immunity occurs following recovery from primary infection. However, there is as yet no effective vaccine against the disease in humans. Although vaccination in murine studies has yielded promising results, these vaccines have failed miserably when tested in primates or humans. The reasons behind these failures are unknown and remain a major hurdle for vaccine design and development against cutaneous leishmaniasis. In contrast, recovery from natural, deliberate or experimental infections results in development of long-lasting immunity to re-infection. This so called infection-induced resistance is the strongest anti-Leishmania immunity known. Here, we briefly review the different approaches to vaccination against cutaneous leishmaniasis and argue that vaccines composed of genetically modified (attenuated) parasites, which induce immunity akin to infection-induced resistance, may provide best protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans.",M1
19147234,"Histological study of cell migration in the dermis of hamsters after immunisation with two different vaccines against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Vaccine candidates, including live and/or killed parasites, Leishmania-purified fractions, defined recombinant antigens and antigen-encoding DNA-plasmids have been proposed to use as vaccine anti-Leishmania. More recently, the hamsters have been used to pre-selection of antigens candidate to apply in further experiments using canine model. In this report we evaluated the kinetics of cell migration in dermal inflammatory infiltrate, circulating leukocytes and the presence of nitric oxide (NO)/induced nitric oxide synthase during the early (1-24h) and late (48-168h) periods following inoculation of hamsters with antigenic components of anti-canine visceral leishmaniasis vaccines Leishmune and Leishmania braziliensis antigen (LB) with and without saponin (Sap) adjuvant. Our results show that LB caused an early reduction of lymphocytes in the dermis while Sap and LBSap triggered a late recruitment, suggesting the role of the adjuvant in the traffic of antigen-presenting cells and the induction of lymphocyte migration. In that manner our results suggest that the kinetics of cell migration on hamster model may be of value in the selection of vaccine antigens prior the tests in dogs particularly in respect of the toxicity of the preparations.",M1
19121082,"Protein-energy malnutrition decreases immune response to Leishmania chagasi vaccine in BALB/c mice.Protein-energy malnutrition and visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> are important problems of public health affecting millions of people worldwide. Vaccine efficacy depends on the ability of individuals to mount an appropriate immune response and may be inadequate in malnourished persons. In this study, we used a mouse model to verify the effect of combined protein, iron and zinc deficiency in the response to Leishmania chagasi antigen vaccine. BALB/c mice were fed with a low-protein (3% casein), iron- and zinc-deficient diet or control diet (14% casein and sufficient in zinc and iron). After malnutrition establishment, mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with L. chagasi Ag plus saponin. After vaccination, mice were nutritionally repleted and then all mice were challenged with L. chagasi promastigotes. Four weeks later, liver and spleen parasite load was evaluated. Our data show that vaccine caused a significant reduction in parasite load in spleen and liver from mice fed with control diet. However, splenic parasitism was increased in mice fed with deficient diet and this diet caused a reduction in splenocyte IFN-gamma production in response to the vaccine in repleted mice. These data suggest that malnutrition may alter immune response to L. chagasi vaccine in BALB/c model of infection, even after nutritional repletion.",M1
19110023,"T-cell-derived cytokines, nitric oxide production by peripheral blood monocytes and seric anti-Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi IgG subclass patterns following immunization against canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> using Leishvaccine and Leishmune.It is generally accepted that distinct cytokine expression by the cellular immune response plays a critical role during the outcome of experimental as well as natural canine visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL). Despite the fact that immunoprophylaxis of CVL has become an important control strategy and protective immunity has been reported upon immunization with whole as well as purified Leishmania antigens, the cytokine profile of T-cells triggered by anti-CVL vaccines still remain to be determined. Herein, we have developed a cross-sectional analysis of German Shepherd dogs submitted to vaccination protocols with Leishvaccine (n=6) and Leishmune (n=6). Our data identified distinct immunological profiles elicited by Leishvaccine and Leishmune, with the Leishvaccine triggering a mixed, IFN-gamma and IL-4, cytokine pattern in addition to high levels of anti-Leishmania IgG1, whereas the Leishmune induced an immunological pattern characterized by enhanced levels of IFN-gamma, NO and anti-Leishmania chagasi IgG2. It was important to notice that despite the distinct immunological patterns triggered by Leishvaccine and Leishmune, the ability of both immunobiologicals to activate T-cell-derived IFN-gamma synthesis further suggesting their immunogenic potential against CVL. These findings added support to our hypothesis that both antigenic composition (whole antigen in Leishvaccine versus purified antigen in Leishmune) as well as the adjuvant nature (BGC and saponin) used for the vaccine formulation may count for the distinct activation pattern observed.",M1
19095029,"A prime/boost DNA/Modified vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine expressing recombinant Leishmania DNA encoding TRYP is safe and immunogenic in outbred dogs, the reservoir of zoonotic visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Previous studies demonstrated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) prime/boost vaccines expressing tryparedoxin peroxidase (TRYP) and Leishmania homologue of the mammalian receptor for activated C kinase (LACK) against Leishmania major challenge in mice, which was consistent with results from TRYP protein/adjuvant combinations in non-human primates. This study aimed to conduct safety and immunogenicity trials of these DNA/MVA vaccines in dogs, the natural reservoir host of Leishmania infantum, followed-up for 4 months post-vaccination. In a cohort of 22 uninfected outbred dogs, blinded randomised administration of 1000 microg (high dose) or 100 microg (low dose) DNA prime (day 0) and 1x10(8)pfu MVA boost (day 28) was shown to be safe and showed no clinical side effects. High dose DNA/MVA vaccinated TRYP dogs produced statistically higher mean levels of the type-1 pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma than controls in whole blood assays (WBA) stimulated with the recombinant vaccine antigen TRYP, up to the final sampling at day 126, and in the absence of challenge with Leishmania. TRYP vaccinated dogs also demonstrated significantly higher TRYP-specific total IgG and IgG2 subtype titres than in controls, and positive in vivo intradermal reactions at day 156 in the absence of natural infection, observed in 6/8 TRYP vaccinated dogs. No significant increases in IFN-gamma in LACK-stimulated WBA, or in LACK-specific IgG levels, were detected in LACK vaccinated dogs compared to controls, and only 2/9 LACK vaccinated dogs demonstrated DTH responses at day 156. In all groups, IgG1 subclass responses and antigen-specific stimulation of IL-10 were similar to controls demonstrating an absence of Th2/T(reg) response, as expected in the absence of in vivo restimulation or natural/experimental challenge with Leishmania. These collective results indicate significant antigen-specific type-1 responses and in vivo memory phase cellular immune responses, consistent with superior potential for protective vaccine immunogenicity of DNA/MVA TRYP over LACK.",M1
19053149,"Photodynamic vaccination of hamsters with inducible suicidal mutants of Leishmania amazonensis elicits immunity against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Leishmania, naturally residing in the phagolysosomes of macrophages, is a suitable carrier for vaccine delivery. Genetic complementation of these trypanosomatid protozoa to partially rectify their defective heme-biosynthesis renders them inducible with delta-aminolevulinate to develop porphyria for selective photolysis, leaving infected host cells unscathed. Delivery of released  vaccines  to antigen-presenting cells is thus expected to enhance immune response, while their self-destruction presents added advantages of safety. Such suicidal L. amazonensis was found to confer immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy on hamsters against L. donovani. Neither heat-killed nor live parasites without suicidal induction were effective. Photodynamic vaccination of hamsters with the suicidal mutants reduced the parasite loads by 99% and suppressed the development of disease. These suppressions were accompanied by an increase in Leishmania-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity and lymphoproliferation as well as in the levels of splenic iNOS, IFN-gamma, and IL-12 expressions and of Leishmania-specific IgG2 in the serum. Moreover, a single intravenous administration of T cells from vaccinated hamsters was shown to confer on naïve animals an effective cellular immunity against L. donovani challenges. The absence of lesion development at vaccination sites and parasites in the draining lymphnodes, spleen and liver further indicates that the suicidal mutants provide a safe platform for vaccine delivery against experimental visceral leishmaniasis.",M1
19046772,"Advances in flow cytometric serology for canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>: diagnostic applications when distinct clinical forms, vaccination and other canine pathogens become a challenge.We have previously reported the applicability of flow cytometry anti-fixed Leishmania infantum chagasi promastigotes IgG (FC-AFPA-IgG) as a novel serological device for laboratorial diagnosis of CVL. Herein, we validate throughout a blind study applied into a broader range of coded sera samples that FC-AFPA-IgG at serum dilution 1:8192 have an outstanding performance to discriminate the serological reactivity of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL, n=64) and Leishmune vaccines (VAC, n=62) and non-infected controls (NI, n=25). Moreover, we have evaluated the performance of indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and the crude-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in parallel with FC-AFPA-IgG, to discriminate the seroreactivity of NI, CVL and VAC. Our data demonstrated that both ELISA and FC-AFPA-IgG showed similar performance to detect the seronegativity in 100% of NI, whereas FC-AFPA-IgG displayed better performance to exclude seropositivity in 100% of VAC. The high kappa agreement indexes observed suggested similar performance between these two serological testes when distinct clinical forms of CVL become a challenge. Furthermore, the FC-AFPA-IgG applied at sera dilution 1:8192 showed a remarkable performance to discriminate CVL from other co-endemic canine infections with high co-negativity in dogs infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania braziliensis (86% and 84%, respectively). In conclusion, the data presented here re-emphasize the applicability of FC-AFPA-IgG as an innovative methodology able to discriminate post-infection imunomediated seroreactivity from that triggered by prophylactic immunization with minor cross-reactivity with other relevant canine pathogens, which may contribute as a supplementary assay for the CVL immunodiagnosis.",M1
18991606,"Discovery of novel vaccine candidates and drug targets against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> using proteomics and transcriptomics.Among the three clinical forms (cutaneous, mucosal and visceral) of leishmaniasis visceral (VL) one is the most devastating type caused by the invasion of the reticuloendothelial system of human by Leishmania donovani, L. infantum and L. chagasi. India and Sudan account for about half the world's burden of VL. Current control strategy is based on chemotherapy, which is difficult to administer, expensive and becoming ineffective due to the emergence of drug resistance. An understanding of resistance mechanism(s) operating in clinical isolates might provide additional leads for the development of new drugs. Further, due to the lack of fully effective treatment the search for novel immune targets is also needed. So far, no vaccine exists for VL despite indications of naturally developing immunity. Therefore, an urgent need for new and effective leishmanicidal agents and for this identification of novel drug and vaccine targets is imperative. The availability of the complete genome sequence of Leishmania has revolutionised many areas of leishmanial research and facilitated functional genomic studies as well as provided a wide range of novel targets for drug designing. Most notably, proteomics and transcriptomics have become important tools in gaining increased understanding of the biology of Leishmania to be explored on a global scale, thus accelerating the pace of discovery of vaccine/drug targets. In addition, these approaches provide the information regarding genes and proteins that are expressed and under which conditions. This review provides a comprehensive view about those proteins/genes identified using proteomics and transcriptomic tools for the development of vaccine/drug against VL.",M1
18844599,"Cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>: progress towards a vaccine.Leishmaniases are vector-borne diseases due to the protozoan parasite Leishmania . Since no prevention method is available and as current therapy is costly, often poorly tolerated and not always efficacious, the development of alternative therapies, including vaccines, constitutes the priority in the fight of Leishmania infection. This review focuses on recent advances in the development of vaccines against leishmaniasis, with emphasis on the cutaneous form. Indeed, the fact that recovery from leishmaniasis is associated with immunity against new infection provides a rational basis for the development of vaccination strategy against infection with Leishmania . Evidence from animal studies demonstrate that protection can be achieved following infection with live-attenuated Leishmania as well as through immunization with purified proteins or DNA vaccines. In addition, recent results have shown that immunization against the saliva of the insect vector could have synergistic effects with conventional vaccination. Finally, vaccination using dendritic cells was recently demonstrated as a possible tool for Leishmania vaccination.",M1
18833039,"Vaccinations against cutaneous Leishmania infection.Cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> is an endemic disease with increasing incidence, even in Europe. Recently, it has attracted more attention due to reactivation in immunocompromised hosts, e.g. in the context of HIV. Therapeutic options range from topical treatment to systemic therapy for more complex cases. A vaccine does not exist at present. Despite of several attempts, vaccine generation has proven to be difficult even though protective immunity against this obligate intracellular protozoan parasite is dependent on the development of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells capable of releasing IFN?. IFN?, in turn, activates phagocytic host cells to generate oxidative radicals and to eliminate the parasite. This review will describe the basic immunology leading to the development of protective immunity in infected individuals. In addition, the authors will focus on highlighting the different approaches utilized for vaccine development and describe what a efficient vaccine may consist of. Combined intensive research in the fields of basic parasitology and immunology may allow for the generation of an efficacious vaccine against this important human pathogen in the near future.",M1

One of the major groups of virulence factors in Leishmania belongs to cysteine proteinase family. In this study, for the first time, the protective potential of Leishmania infantum cysteine proteinase type III (CPC) by using a prime-boost strategy is evaluated in BALB/c mice. The experiment was carried out in three groups of mice. Vaccinated group was primed with pcDNA-cpc and boosted with rCPC-DHFR in combination with CpG motif and Montanide 720 as adjuvant. Control groups received pcDNA and rDHFR or PBS. The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1, nitric oxide concentration and IFN-gamma induction in vaccinated group is significantly higher than controls. Furthermore, the parasite load of vaccinated group is significantly lower than controls. In addition, sera reactivity of visceral leishmaniasis individuals was examined and showed considerable reactivities toward rCPC in comparison with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The achieved result is highly encouraging the use of cysteine proteinases types I, II and III as vaccine candidate against visceral leishmaniasis.",M1

A further fractionation of F2-fraction into seven subfractions (F2.1-F2.7) and re-assessment for their immunostimulatory responses revealed that out of these, only four (F2.4-F2.7) belonging to 89.9-97.1 kDa, stimulated remarkable Th1-type cellular responses either individually or in a pooled form (P4-7). In this study these potential subfractions were further assessed for their prophylactic potential in combination with BCG against L. donovani challenge in hamsters. Optimum parasite inhibition ( approximately 99%) was obtained in hamsters vaccinated with pooled subfractions and they survived for 1 year. The protection was further supported by remarkable lymphoproliferative, IFN-gamma and IL-12 responses along with profound delayed type hypersensitivity and increased levels of Leishmania-specific IgG2 antibody as observed on days 45, 90 and 120 post-challenge suggesting that a successful subunit vaccine against VL may require multiple Th1-immunostimulatory proteins. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis of these subfractions further revealed that of the 19 identified immunostimulatory proteins, Elongation factor-2, p45, Heat shock protein-70/83, Aldolase, Enolase, Triosephosphate isomerase, Disulfideisomerase and Calreticulin were the major ones in these subfractions.",M1

Leishmune has been proven to be safe and tolerable and a transmission-blocking vaccine which renders vaccinated dogs non-infectious to sand fly vectors. In the present investigation, 550 healthy seronegative dogs of endemic and epidemic areas of Brazil were monitored for Leishmune-induced immunogenicity during a 2-year trial. Another group of 588 untreated exposed dogs was also studied in parallel. Both groups were seronegative on day 0. The strong immunogenicity induced by Leishmune vaccine was demonstrated by the 98% of FML-seroconversion, increase in absorbencies, the 82.7% DTH positive reactions and increase in skin test size diameters, the average increase in CD8+ total lymphocytes population in blood (27.1%), expected for QS21 saponin-containing vaccine, the sustained proportions of CD4+ T cells, and the average increased proportions of CD21+ B lymphocytes (42.3%). The Leishmune-induced protection against CVL is demonstrated by the results: 98.8% asymptomatic dogs (at the end of first year) and 99% healthy survivors (at the end of the second year) among vaccinated dogs, compared to the 79.4% asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs (p&lt;0.001) monitored in the untreated exposed cohort. In spite of the low vaccine coverage, it was possible to detect a 66.1% (p&lt;0.005) reduction in Belo Horizonte and an 80.2% (p&lt;0.005) reduction in Araçatuba of the incidence of CVL among vaccinated dogs, when compared to the global incidence of CVL of each town, respectively.

It became the licensed Leishmune vaccine for canine prophylaxis in Brazil. The immune response raised by the vaccine is long lasting, immunotherapeutic and reduces dog infectivity blocking the transmission of the disease, as revealed by an in vivo assay. The preliminary epidemiological control data of vaccinated areas in Brazil indicate that, in spite of the still low vaccine coverage, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of the human and canine disease. A 36-kDa glycoprotein, in the FML complex, is the human marker of the disease, which was protective in mice as native recombinant protein or DNA vaccine. The DNA vaccine is now being tested against the canine disease. This review resumes the development of the second-generation FML-saponin-Leishmune vaccine, its adjuvant and of the NH36 DNA vaccine, toward the identification of its major epitopes that might be included in a possible future synthetic vaccine.",M1

It seems that preparing a vaccine may be the final solution. The aim of this study was to determine various Leishmania (L.) major antigens vaccine candidates and effects of the vaccine on delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Many different methods of vaccine preparation plus or without adjuvant were used. We prepared crude antigen combinations by five different methods using antigens from L. major parasites. Phase I was done in animals. The immunogenic effect was evaluated with the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction with five different doses, including 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 microg/ml of total protein + BCG in Balb/c and conventional laboratory white mice (out breed). Our results showed that the cocktail antigen was highly specific. No injection of BCG solvent or saline treated controls showed significant results.

The objective of this study was to compare cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> patients and subjects immunized with a first-generation candidate vaccine composed of killed Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes to a whole-cell promastigote antigen extract (La) and to the recombinant protein LACK (Leishmania analogue receptor for activated C kinase), both from L. amazonensis. Thirty-two patients, 35 vaccinees and 13 healthy subjects without exposure to Leishmania, were studied. Cytokine production was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The interferon (IFN)-gamma levels stimulated by La were significantly higher and the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 significantly lower than those stimulated by LACK in the patient group, while LACK induced a significantly higher IFN-gamma production and a significantly lower IL-10 production compared with those induced by La in the vaccinated group. LACK also induced a significantly higher frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells than did La in the vaccinated group. The contrast in the cytokine responses stimulated by LACK and La in PBMC cultures from vaccinated subjects versus patients indicates that the human immune response to crude and defined Leishmania antigens as a consequence of immunization differs from that induced by natural infection.",M1

We show that BALB/c mice vaccinated with LRP in the presence of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) were protected against the development of dermal pathology and showed a reduction in the parasite load after challenge with L. major. This protection was associated with the induction of an IL-12 dependent specific-IFN-gamma response mediated mainly by CD4(+) T cell, albeit a minor contribution of CD8(+) T cells cannot be ruled out. Induction of Th1 responses against LRP also resulted in a reversion of the Th2 responses associated with susceptibility. A marked reduction of IgG1 antibody titer against parasite antigens besides an impaired IL-4 and IL-10 cytokine production by parasite specific T cells was observed. In addition, we show that the administration of the LRP plus CpG-ODN preparation also conferred protection in the naturally resistant C57BL/6 mice. In this strain protection was associated with a LRP specific IFN-gamma production in lymph nodes draining the challenge site. We believe that these evolutionary conserved proteins, combined with adjuvants that favor Th1 responses, may be relevant components of a pan-Leishmania vaccine.",M1

Further, A2-specific CD8+ T cells from immunized mice were capable of lysing sensitized target cells in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated an association of A2-specific T cell responses and reduced parasitism in both liver and spleen from mice immunized with AdA2 and challenged with L. (L.) chagasi.",M1
18555567,"Kinetics of cell migration to the dermis and hypodermis in dogs vaccinated with antigenic compounds of Leishmania braziliensis plus saponin.The search for new immunobiologicals against canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> (CVL) has intensified in the last decade. However, it still remains to be elucidated that mechanisms of the innate immune response in situ after immunization (a.i.). The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of cell migration in the skin dogs with distinct antigenic compounds of the LBSap vaccine. Our major findings indicated that saponin adjuvant alone or combined with Leishmania braziliensis antigen induced strong local acute inflammatory reaction. However, these reactions not progressed to ulcerated lesions. Overall, the cell profile found in Sap and LBSap was composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. There was also increased production of iNOS in Sap and LBSap groups. Thus, we can conclude that dogs immunized by LBSap and the saponin adjuvant elicited a potential innate-immune activations status compatible with effective control of the resistance to infection by Leishmania and contributing to a better understanding of the innate-immunity events induced by the LBSap vaccine.",M1
18509051,"Immunity to a salivary protein of a sand fly vector protects against the fatal outcome of visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> in a hamster model.Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal disease for humans, and no vaccine is currently available. Sand fly salivary proteins have been associated with protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis. To test whether vector salivary proteins can protect against VL, a hamster model was developed involving intradermal inoculation in the ears of 100,000 Leishmania infantum chagasi parasites together with Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva to mimic natural transmission by sand flies. Hamsters developed classical signs of VL rapidly, culminating in a fatal outcome 5-6 months postinfection. Saliva had no effect on the course of infection in this model. Immunization with 16 DNA plasmids coding for salivary proteins of Lu. longipalpis resulted in the identification of LJM19, a novel 11-kDa protein, that protected hamsters against the fatal outcome of VL. LJM19-immunized hamsters maintained a low parasite load that correlated with an overall high IFN-gamma/TGF-beta ratio and inducible NOS expression in the spleen and liver up to 5 months postinfection. Importantly, a delayed-type hypersensitivity response with high expression of IFN-gamma was also noted in the skin of LJM19-immunized hamsters 48 h after exposure to uninfected sand fly bites. Induction of IFN-gamma at the site of bite could partly explain the protection observed in the viscera of LJM19-immunized hamsters through direct parasite killing and/or priming of anti-Leishmania immunity. We have shown that immunity to a defined salivary protein (LJM19) confers powerful protection against the fatal outcome of a parasitic disease, which reinforces the concept of using components of arthropod saliva in vaccine strategies against vector-borne diseases.",M1
18395948,"Despite Leishvaccine and Leishmune trigger distinct immune profiles, their ability to activate phagocytes and CD8+ T-cells support their high-quality immunogenic potential against canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Phenotypic features of peripheral blood leukocytes have been investigated as a pre-requisite to characterize the protective immunity attributed to both Leishvaccine and Leishmune. Our results showed that either those vaccine were accompanied by distinct profiles on innate immune compartment. While Leishvaccine promoted early changes in phenotypic features of neutrophils and eosinophils with late involvement of monocytes, Leishmune induced early and persistent activation of neutrophils and monocytes, without changes on eosinophil activation status. Regarding the adaptive immunity, Leishvaccine sponsored a mixed profile, associated with phenotypic changes of T and B-lymphocytes. Major phenotypic changes in CD4+ T-cells with transient activation of CD8+ T-cell, besides decreased frequency of B-cell expressing CD32 were the hallmark of Leishvaccine. In contrast, Leishmune was associated with phenotypic changes in T-lymphocytes, particularly in CD8+ T-cells, and selective up-regulation of CD3+CD5+LowCD8+ cells. We hypothesized that this dissimilar alteration in immunological events would represent phenomenon directly related with the molecular nature of these vaccines besides the distinct adjuvants employed. However, it is important to emphasize that both immunobiologicals are able to activate phagocytes and CD8+ T-cells and therefore could be considered priority vaccines with a high-quality immunogenic potential against CVL.",M1
18389179,"Persistent parasites and immunologic memory in cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>: implications for vaccine designs and vaccination strategies.Despite a plethora of publications on the murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis and their contribution to our understanding of the factors that regulate the development of CD4+ T cell immunity in vivo, there is still no effective vaccine against the human disease. While recovery from natural or experimental infection with Leishmania major, the causative agent of human cutaneous leishmaniasis, results in persistence of parasites at the primary infection site and the development of long-lasting immunity to reinfection, vaccination with killed parasites or recombinant proteins induces only short-term protection. The reasons for the difference in protective immunity following recovery from live infection and vaccination with heat-killed parasites are not known. This may in part be related to persistence of live parasites following healing of primary cutaneous lesions, because complete clearance of parasites leads to rapid loss of infection-induced immunity. Recent reports indicate that in addition to persistent parasites, IL-10-producing natural regulatory T cells may also play critical roles in the maintenance and loss of infection-induced immunity. This review focuses on current understanding of the factors that regulate the development, maintenance and loss of anti-Leishmania memory responses and highlights the role of persistent parasites and regulatory T cells in this process. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing effective vaccines and vaccination strategies against cutaneous leishmaniasis.",M1

This clinical trial had the purpose to test the combination of N-methyl meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime and the second generation recombinant vaccine Leish-110f plus the adjuvant MPL-SE to treat the canine leishmaniasis (CanL). Thirty symptomatic naturally infected mongrel dogs were divided into five groups. Animals received standard treatment with Glucantime or treatment with Glucantime Leish-110f + MPL-SEas immunochemotherapy protocol. Additional groups received Leish-110f + MPL-SE only, MPL-SE only, or placebo. Evaluation of haematological, biochemical (renal and hepatic function) and plasmatic proteins, immunological (humoral and cellular immune response) and the parasitological test revealed improvement of the clinical parameters and parasitological cure in dogs in both chemotherapy alone and immunochemotherapy cohorts. However, the immunotherapy and immunochemotherapy cohorts had reduced number of deaths, higher survival probability, and specific cellular reactivity to leishmanial antigens, in comparison with chemotherapy cohort only and control groups (adjuvant alone and placebo). These results support the notion of using well-characterized recombinant vaccine as an adjunct to improve the current chemotherapy of CanL.",M1
18321614,"Immunogenicity of HSP-70, KMP-11 and PFR-2 leishmanial antigens in the experimental model of canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum/L. chagasi that is emerging as an important medical and veterinary problem. Dogs are the domestic reservoir for this parasite and, therefore, the main target for controlling the transmission to humans. In the present work, we have evaluated the immunogenicity of the Leishmania infantum heat shock protein (HSP)-70, paraflagellar rod protein (PFR)-2 and kinetoplastida membrane protein (KMP)-11 recombinant proteins in dogs experimentally infected with the parasite. We have shown that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from experimentally infected dogs proliferated in response to these recombinant antigens and against the soluble leishmanial antigen (SLA). We have also quantified the mRNA expression level of the cytokines induced in PBMC upon stimulation with the HSP-70, PFR-2 and KMP-11 proteins. These recombinant proteins induced an up-regulation of IFN-gamma. HSP-70 and PFR-2 also produced an increase of the TNF-alpha transcripts abundance. No measurable induction of IL-10 was observed and low levels of IL-4 mRNA were produced in response to the three mentioned recombinant antigens. Serum levels of specific antibodies against HSP-70, PFR-2 and KMP-11 recombinant proteins were also determined in these animals. Our study showed that HSP-70, KMP-11 and PFR-2 proteins are recognized by infected canines. Furthermore, these antigens produce a Th1-type immune response, suggesting that they may be involved in protection. The identification as vaccine candidates of Leishmania antigens that elicit appropriate immune responses in the canine model is a key step in the rational approach to generate a vaccine for canine visceral leishmaniasis.",M1
18195029,"gp63 in stable cationic liposomes confers sustained vaccine immunity to susceptible BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania donovani.Visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> is deadly if not treated, and development of a vaccine with long-term immunity remains a challenge. In this study, we showed that cationic distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) liposomes, when used as vaccine adjuvant with the immunodominant 63-kDa glycoprotein (gp63) of Leishmania donovani promastigotes, induced significant protection against progressive visceral leishmaniasis in susceptible BALB/c mice. gp63 used without adjuvant elicited partial protection but in association with liposomes exhibited marked resistance in both the livers and spleens of the mice challenged 10 days after the last vaccination. The protective efficacy of liposomal gp63 vaccination was dose dependent, with 2.5 mug of protein showing optimal protection. The immunity conferred by this vaccine formulation was durable, as mice challenged 12 weeks after immunization were still protected, and the infection was controlled for at least 3 months postchallenge. Production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) by splenic T cells, and of serum immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a following immunization, suggested that a mixed Th1/Th2 response had been induced following immunization. However, control of disease progression and parasitic burden in mice vaccinated with gp63 in cationic DSPC liposomes was associated with enhancement of antigen-specific IFN-gamma and downregulation of IL-4, demonstrating a Th1 bias. Long-term immunity elicited by this vaccine corresponded to, in addition to the presence of antigen-specific Th1, CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results demonstrated that stable cationic liposomes containing gp63 acted as a potent adjuvant for protein antigen to induce long-term protection against L. donovani that represents an alternative to DNA vaccination.",M1
18180079,"A killed Leishmania vaccine with sand fly saliva extract and saponin adjuvant displays immunogenicity in dogs.A vaccine against canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> (CVL), comprising Leishmania braziliensis promastigote protein, sand fly gland extract (SGE) and saponin adjuvant, was evaluated in dog model, in order to analyse the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine. The vaccine candidate elicited strong antigenicity in dogs in respect of specific SGE and Leishmania humoral immune response. The major saliva proteins recognized by serum from immunized dogs exhibited molecular weights of 35 and 45 kDa, and were related to the resistance pattern against Leishmania infection. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating CD21+ B-cells and CD5+ T-cells, reflected by higher counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. The observed interaction between potential antigen-presenting cells (evaluated as CD14+ monocytes) and lymphocyte activation status indicated a relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses. The higher frequency in L. chagasi antigen-specific CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and their positive association with intense cell proliferation, in addition to the progressively higher production of serum nitric oxide levels, showed a profile compatible with anti-CVL vaccine potential. Further studies on immunological response after challenge with L. chagasi may provide important information that will lead to a better understanding on vaccine trial and efficacy.",M1

The MST diameter was categorized as negative and in quartiles of positive response, constituting five groups. Trace element serum levels were analyzed by coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry, with study subjects classified into two groups depending on low or high levels of trace elements observed. MST-positive subjects had an MST diameter (mean+/-SD) of 10.35+/-4.64mm, with copper, selenium and zinc serum levels of 1433.7+/-665.7microg/l, 88.6+/-39microg/l and 999.2+/-366microg/l, respectively. The MST diameter was significantly different in the selenium groups only. The selenium levels also differed with the quartiles of the MST diameters of individuals testing positive (P&lt;0.05).

This randomized and double-blind study aimed to assess safety, immunogenicity and curative potentials of a novel immunochemotherapy regimen in patients with persistent PKDL. Following informed consent, 30 patients were randomized to receive alum-precipitated autoclaved Leishmania major (Alum/ALM) vaccine+Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or vaccine diluent and SSG. The SSG+Alum/ALM+BCG proved safe with minimal local adverse events. In the SSG+vaccine group, 87% of the patients were cured by day 60 compared with 53% in the SSG alone group (SSG+vaccine efficacy=71%, 95% CI for risk ratio 0.7-1.16). On day 90 of follow-up there were two relapses in the SSG alone arm and none in the SSG+vaccine arm. Pre-treatment cytokines showed high IFN-gamma or high IFN-gamma/IL-10 levels and leishmanin skin test (LST) non-reactivity, while healing/clinical improvement were associated with LST reactivity and low IFN-gamma levels in both study groups (P=0.004). In conclusion, SSG+Alum/ALM+BCG is safe and immunogenic with significant healing potentials in persistent PKDL lesions. Immunochemotherapy probably augmented IFN-gamma production, which induced healing. Leishmanin skin reactivity is a good surrogate marker of cure in persistent PKDL lesions.",M1
17908806,"Hybrid cell vaccination resolves Leishmania donovani infection by eliciting a strong CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response with concomitant suppression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) but not IL-4 or IL-13.There is an acute dearth of therapeutic interventions against visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> that is required to restore an established defective cell-mediated immune response. Hence, formulation of effective immunotherapy requires the use of dominant antigen(s) targeted to elicit a specific antiparasitic cellular immune response. We implemented hybrid cell vaccination therapy in Leishmania donovani-infected BALB/c mice by electrofusing dominant Leishmania antigen kinetoplastid membrane protein 11 (KMP-11)-transfected bone marrow-derived macrophages from BALB/c mice with allogeneic bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from C57BL/6 mice. Hybrid cell vaccine (HCV) cleared the splenic and hepatic parasite burden, eliciting KMP-11-specific major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Moreover, splenic lymphocytes of HCV-treated mice not only showed the enhancement of gamma interferon but also marked an elevated expression of the Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 at both transcriptional and translational levels. On the other hand, IL-10 production from splenic T cells was markedly suppressed as a result of HCV therapy. CD8+ T-cell depletion completely abrogated HCV-mediated immunity and the anti-KMP-11 CTL response. Interestingly, CD8+ T-cell depletion completely abrogated HCV-induced immunity, resulting in a marked increase of IL-10 but not of IL-4 and IL-13. The present study reports the first implementation of HCV immunotherapy in an infectious disease model, establishing strong antigen-specific CTL generation as a correlate of HCV-mediated antileishmanial immunity that is reversed by in vivo CD8+ T-cell depletion of HCV-treated mice. Our findings might be extended to drug-nonresponsive visceral leishmaniasis patients, as well as against multiple infectious diseases with pathogen-specific immunodominant antigens.",M1
17900304,"The immunodominant T helper 2 (Th2) response elicited in BALB/c mice by the Leishmania LiP2a and LiP2b acidic ribosomal proteins cannot be reverted by strong Th1 inducers.The search for disease-associated T helper 2 (Th2) Leishmania antigens and the induction of a Th1 immune response to them using defined vaccination protocols is a potential strategy to induce protection against Leishmania infection. Leishmania infantum LiP2a and LiP2b acidic ribosomal protein (P proteins) have been described as prominent antigens during human and canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>. In this study we demonstrate that BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major develop a Th2-like humoral response against Leishmania LiP2a and LiP2b proteins and that the same response is induced in BALB/c mice when the parasite P proteins are immunized as recombinant molecules without adjuvant. The genetic immunization of BALB/c mice with eukaryotic expression plasmids coding for these proteins was unable to redirect the Th2-like response induced by these antigens, and only the co-administration of the recombinant P proteins with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) promoted a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. According to the preponderance of a Th2 or mixed Th1/Th2 responses elicited by the different regimens of immunization tested, no evidence of protection was observed in mice after challenge with L. major. Although alterations of the clinical outcome were not detected in mice presensitized with the P proteins, the enhanced IgG1 and interleukin (IL)-4 response against total Leishmania antigens in these mice may indicate an exacerbation of the disease.",M1

Serological evaluation revealed that SMT is recognized by VL patients. C57BL/6 mice immunized with this vaccine candidate plus MPL-SE showed Ag-specific Th1 immune responses characterized by robust production of IFN-gamma upon specific Ag re-exposure in vitro. Upon challenge with L. infantum, mice immunized with SMT plus MPL-SE showed significant lower parasite burdens in both spleens and livers compared with non-immunized mice or mice injected with adjuvant alone.

17132302,"Safety and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine for visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> (Alum-precipitated autoclaved Leishmania major + BCG) in children: an extended phase II study.BACKGROUND: Untreated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an inevitably fatal childhood disease. First-generation candidate vaccines for VL [autoclaved Leishmania major (ALM) + BCG] have been found to be safe and immunogenic but not superior to BCG alone. Modulation of ALM by adsorption to Alum significantly increases the immunogenicity. The Alum-adsorbed ALM vaccine was found to be safe and strongly immunogenic in healthy adult volunteers in a non-VL-endemic area. This study aimed at establishing the safety and immunogenicity of Alum-precipitated autoclaved L. major + BCG vaccine in children under field conditions. METHODS: A total of 544 healthy, leishmanin non-reactive children (&lt;15 y) were randomly allocated to receive either a single intradermal injection of Alum/ALM + BCG or vaccine diluent (placebo). Volunteers were closely followed for 2 years at 6-month intervals for vaccine safety and immunogenicity. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated with minimal side-effects. Leishmanin skin test conversion (&gt;or=5 mm) was seen in 56%, 50%, 25% and 31% at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-vaccination, respectively; conversion in the placebo group was 4%, 12%, 3% and 13% at the same follow-up visits. There was no significant increase in anti-leishmanial antibodies in either study arm at any of the follow-up visits. During the study, four patients in the placebo arm developed parasitologically confirmed VL. CONCLUSION: Alum/ALM + BCG vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children under field conditions. Multiple injections might be needed to obtain results similar to those obtained in healthy volunteers.",M1

From June 1999 to June 2000, we studied the safety and immunogenicity of different doses of alum-precipitated ALM + BCG vaccine mixture administered intradermally to evaluate whether the addition of alum improved the immunogenicity of ALM. Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers were recruited and sequentially allocated to receive either 10 microg, 100 microg, 200 microg, or 400 microg of leishmanial protein in the alum-precipitated ALM + BCG vaccine mixture. Side effects were minimal for all doses and confined to the site of injection. All volunteers in the 10 microg, 100 microg, and 400 microg groups had a leishmanin skin test (LST) reaction of &gt; or = 5 mm by day 42 and this response was maintained when tested after 90 d. Only 1 volunteer out of 5 in the 200 microg group had a LST reaction of &gt; or = 5 mm by day 42 and the reasons for the different LST responses in this group are unclear. This is the first time that an alum adjuvant with ALM has been in used in humans and the vaccine mixture was safe and induced a strong delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in the study volunteers. On the basis of this study we suggest that 100 1 microg of leishmanial protein in the vaccine mixture is a suitable dose for future efficacy studies, as it induced the strongest DTH reaction following vaccination.",M1

Blood samples were also assayed from different groups including volunteers with history of CL and volunteers with previous positive or negative leishmanin skin test (LST) without a history of CL. The vaccinated volunteers had received a single dose of either ALM mixed with a low dose of BCG or the same dose of BCG alone. The LST and in vitro proliferative response (stimulation index, SI), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and, in a few cases, interleukin (IL)-4 production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to soluble Leishmania antigens were measured. The results indicated that volunteers who developed CL in the vaccine arm showed a slightly higher SI than cases who received BCG alone. Volunteers with history of CL and volunteers with positive LST demonstrated the strongest proliferation indices and IFN-gamma production.

Animals were immunized with triple doses (21 days apart) of either ALD or ALM (1.0 mg) with or without BCG (0.1 mg) and challenged 21 days later with 1 x 10(6) L. donovani amastigotes intracardially. Animals immunized with ALM + BCG and ALD + BCG yielded 94.3% and 86.1% parasite inhibition respectively in comparison to the BCG only and unvaccinated controls. Fifty and 33.3% of the vaccinated animals (ALM + BCG and ALD + BCG respectively) were completely devoid of parasites when tested on day 45 post-challenge (p.c.) and survived till the experiment was terminated. The mean survival of ALM + BCG and ALD + BCG groups (animals harbouring parasites) was longest (168 and 139 days respectively). No significant increase in anti-leishmanial antibody level (ELISA) was noticed in ALD + BCG and ALM + BCG groups whereas it increased progressively in the rest of the experimental groups. The lymphoproliferative responses to PHA and Con A, of the 2 vaccinated groups were comparable to that of normal controls on day 45 p.c. The study suggests that ALD along with BCG can offer substantial protection against visceral leishmaniasis in hamsters.",M1

Drug treatment is expensive, and drug resistance is becoming increasingly common. Safe, effective, and cheap vaccines are needed. We report the results of a vaccine trial against human visceral leishmaniasis. METHODS: We undertook a double-blind randomised trial to test the safety and efficacy of an autoclaved Leishmania major (ALM) promastigote vaccine (1 mg per dose). Of 5093 volunteers screened, 2306 had negative leishmanin skin tests and reciprocal titres of less than 6400 in the direct agglutination test. They were randomly assigned two doses of ALM mixed with BCG or BCG alone. Volunteers were followed up for 2 years. The primary endpoint was clinical visceral leishmaniasis or post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Side-effects were confined to the injection site. The cumulative frequency of visceral leishmaniasis at 2 years did not differ significantly between the group assigned ALM plus BCG and that assigned BCG alone (133/1155 [11.5%] vs 141/1151 [12.3%], p=0.6). The vaccine efficacy was 6% (95% CI -18 to 25). The proportion of individuals showing leishmanin skin conversion was significantly higher in the ALM plus BCG group than in the BCG alone group throughout follow-up (303 [30%] vs 72 [7%] at 42 days). Individuals whose leishmanin test converted after vaccination (induration &gt; or =5 mm) had a significantly lower frequency of visceral leishmaniasis than non-responders (27/375 [7.2%] vs 210/1660 [12.7%], p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that two doses of ALM plus BCG offered significant protective immunity against visceral leishmaniasis compared with BCG alone. Leishmanin skin conversion with an induration of 5 mm or more in either group was associated with protection from the disease.",M1

To describe P. argentipes' seasonal patterns, six visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e> (VL) endemic villages, three in Muzaffarpur and three in Sunsari districts in India and Nepal, respectively, were selected based on accessibility and VL incidence. Ten houses per cluster with the highest P. argentipes density were monitored monthly for 15-16 mo using Center for Disease Control and Prevention light traps. Minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall data for the months January 2006 through December 2007 were collected from the nearest available weather stations. Backwards stepwise regression was used to generate the minimal adequate model for explaining the monthly variation in P. argentipes populations. The seasonality of P. argentipes is similar in India and Nepal, with two annual density peaks around May and October. Monthly P. argentipes density is positively associated with temperature and negatively associated with rainfall in both study sites. The multivariate climate model explained 57% of the monthly vectorial abundance. Vector control programs against P. argentipes (i.e., indoor residual spraying) should take into account the seasonal described here when implementing and monitoring interventions.

Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) as possible tools for control have not been widely tested against them. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of Olyset Net and PermaNet LLINs alongside a local brand, K-O Tab treated net (Supanet) against Phlebotomus duboscqi female sandflies. METHODS: Four replicates of unwashed and 20x washed Olyset Nets and PermaNets, K-O Tab-treated and untreated Supanet and 'no net' treatments were evaluated against sandflies within the laboratory by tunnel tests and in semi-field conditions in the greenhouse model for their efficacy. RESULTS: All bednets allowed entry of P. duboscqi sandflies and subsequent blood-feeding. Olyset net's blood feeding inhibition was significantly higher than that of Supanet in the laboratory but not in semi-field condition. Of the LLINs, only Olyset net had sandflies that could not feed significantly more than those of Supanet. Additionally, no significant efficacy difference was observed between LLINs washed 20x and unwashed ones. The only significant difference noted in number of sandflies that were found dead or paralyzed within bednets in the semi-field condition was between Olyset and K-O Tab treated Supanet. In the laboratory, unwashed Olyset had a significantly higher number of sandflies killed than all other bednet treatments. CONCLUSION: Olyset net use in areas where sandflies are nuisance biters and/or disease vectors could be more beneficial in preventing sandfly bites than other tested bednets. It is recommended that mesh sizes of LLINs should be smaller for control of sandflies than those used for control of mosquitoes.",M2

It was prevalent before 1945, and until its recent reemergence, it was nearly eradicated by 1996 as a consequence of the destruction of reservoir hosts and vectors. A survey carried out to provide an unbiased estimate of current transmission rates in dogs and humans showed a 9-fold increase in dog seroprevalence (reaching 14.9%) compared with 10 years ago. However, no human cases caused by Leishmania infantum were detected, although L. donovani cases were reported recently. The 62 strains isolated from dogs were typed as L. infantum MON-1 (98.4%), which is the predominating zymodeme in the Mediterranean region, and MON-98 (1.6%). The Phlebotomus species P. tobbi (vector of L. infantum in Cyprus), P. galilaeus, and P. papatasi were the predominant species captured. Two transmission cycles seem to run in parallel in Cyprus: in dogs with L. infantum and in humans with L. donovani.",M2
20188477,"Relationship of Leishmania-specific IgG levels and IgG avidity with parasite density and clinical signs in canine <e>leishmaniasis</e>.The clinical status and tissue parasite burden of the skin and spleen of 40 dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi (syn. Leishmania infantum), together with 5 uninfected control dogs, were assessed. On the basis of the clinical evaluation, infected dogs were classified as asymptomatic (AD) or symptomatic (SD). Infected animals were also grouped according to their parasite load as exhibiting low (LP), medium (MP) and high (HP) parasitism. The results indicated a high parasite load in the skin samples of SD animals in relation to the AD group. The serum immunoglobin isotype profiles of the studied animals revealed increased levels of IgG(1) in the AD and LP dogs, whereas high levels of IgG(2) were correlated with SD and HP dogs. The avidity index (AI) of IgG(total) in the SD group was high in comparison of that of the AD group. Moreover, animals with a larger parasite burden either in the spleen or skin showed higher AI values than animals with lower parasitism. Based on these findings, it is suggested that CVL commences with an asymptomatic clinical form with low parasitism, high production of IgG(1) and low affinity of IgG(total) molecules, and evolves into a symptomatic clinical form with higher parasitism intensity, higher IgG(2) levels, and high affinity of IgG(total).",M2

METHODS: Sera were obtained from 10 experimentally L. Infantum-infected dogs, 5 naturally infected dogs, 16 healthy dogs, 26 Babesia canis, Erhlichia canis, Dirofilaria immitis, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania (Viannia) spp infected dogs, 40 dogs from non-endemic areas and 150 from endemic areas. Sera were tested for L. infantum infection using immunofluorescent antibody (IFAT), ELISA and Western blot (WB) tests. RESULTS: Positives results were obtained for 73 % of known infected dogs by the IFAT test and false positives were obtained for 2.5 % of non-infected dogs using WB. ELISA was not efficient for diagnosis. 24 antigenic fractions were recognised in tested sera using WB; however, 29, 34, 50, 69, 75, 86, 99 and 123 kDa bands were recognised in sera from dogs from non-endemic areas, healthy dogs and Trypanosoma cruzi, Erhlichia canis, Dirofilaria immitis and Babesia canis infected dogs. The 13 kDa fraction proved potentially useful for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis. CONCLUSIONS: The separate use of parasitological and serological test could lead to misdiagnosis of Leishmania infection; using both kinds of technique simultaneously is thus highly recommended.",M2

20098495,"Climate change and risk of <e>leishmaniasis</e> in north america: predictions from ecological niche models of vector and reservoir species.BACKGROUND: Climate change is increasingly being implicated in species' range shifts throughout the world, including those of important vector and reservoir species for infectious diseases. In North America (México, United States, and Canada), leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease that is autochthonous in México and Texas and has begun to expand its range northward. Further expansion to the north may be facilitated by climate change as more habitat becomes suitable for vector and reservoir species for leishmaniasis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The analysis began with the construction of ecological niche models using a maximum entropy algorithm for the distribution of two sand fly vector species (Lutzomyia anthophora and L. diabolica), three confirmed rodent reservoir species (Neotoma albigula, N. floridana, and N. micropus), and one potential rodent reservoir species (N. mexicana) for leishmaniasis in northern México and the United States. As input, these models used species' occurrence records with topographic and climatic parameters as explanatory variables. Models were tested for their ability to predict correctly both a specified fraction of occurrence points set aside for this purpose and occurrence points from an independently derived data set. These models were refined to obtain predicted species' geographical distributions under increasingly strict assumptions about the ability of a species to disperse to suitable habitat and to persist in it, as modulated by its ecological suitability. Models successful at predictions were fitted to the extreme A2 and relatively conservative B2 projected climate scenarios for 2020, 2050, and 2080 using publicly available interpolated climate data from the Third Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report. Further analyses included estimation of the projected human population that could potentially be exposed to leishmaniasis in 2020, 2050, and 2080 under the A2 and B2 scenarios. All confirmed vector and reservoir species will see an expansion of their potential range towards the north. Thus, leishmaniasis has the potential to expand northwards from México and the southern United States. In the eastern United States its spread is predicted to be limited by the range of L. diabolica; further west, L. anthophora may play the same role. In the east it may even reach the southern boundary of Canada. The risk of spread is greater for the A2 scenario than for the B2 scenario. Even in the latter case, with restrictive (contiguous) models for dispersal of vector and reservoir species, and limiting vector and reservoir species occupancy to only the top 10% of their potential suitable habitat, the expected number of human individuals exposed to leishmaniasis by 2080 will at least double its present value. CONCLUSIONS: These models predict that climate change will exacerbate the ecological risk of human exposure to leishmaniasis in areas outside its present range in the United States and, possibly, in parts of southern Canada. This prediction suggests the adoption of measures such as surveillance for leishmaniasis north of Texas as disease cases spread northwards. Potential vector and reservoir control strategies-besides direct intervention in disease cases-should also be further investigated.",M2

20077951,"Current status and perspectives of the immunotherapy of <e>leishmaniasis</e>.There is still a need for innovative and alternative therapies against leishmaniasis. Despite recent advances in immunology, effective immunotherapy against the disease has not yet been proven. Live, attenuated and dead parasites, purified and recombinant specific antigens, DNA vaccines as well as DC-based immunization that have been employed in the development of protective vaccine have not yet been adopted as immunotherapeutic agents. Recently, a commercially prophylactic vaccine (Leish-110f) was developed by BioPharm International, by constructing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of TSA (thiol-specific antioxidant), LmSTI1 (L. major stress-inducible protein 1) and LeIF (Leishmania elongation initiation factor). This vaccine, when administered together with the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), either alone or plus squalene (MPL-SE) or AdjuPrime, protected mice against L. major and L. infantum infections. Also, Leishvacin (Leishvacin, Biobrs, Montes Carlos, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil), a commercial non-living promastigote polyvalent Leishmania vaccine administered either alone or combined with BCG, was found to be highly immunogenic against American CL in humans. Leishvacin alone was also found to be effective as a prophylactic vaccine, sensitizing lymphocytes from normal uninfected humans, which was further accelerated by recombinant GM-CSF. Standardization and additional carefully controlled studies in animals and humans, using these new vaccines and other immunomodulators in conjunction with various chemotherapeutic agents, are still required to determine the optimal conditions for the development of a potent anti-leishmanial immunotherapy and immunochemotherapy.",M2
20069036,"Detection and identification of old world Leishmania by high resolution melt analysis.BACKGROUND: Three major forms of human disease, cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>, visceral leishmaniasis and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, are caused by several leishmanial species whose geographic distribution frequently overlaps. These Leishmania species have diverse reservoir hosts, sand fly vectors and transmission patterns. In the Old World, the main parasite species responsible for leishmaniasis are Leishmania infantum, L. donovani, L. tropica, L. aethiopica and L. major. Accurate, rapid and sensitive diagnostic and identification procedures are crucial for the detection of infection and characterization of the causative leishmanial species, in order to provide accurate treatment, precise prognosis and appropriate public health control measures. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: High resolution melt analysis of a real time PCR product from the Internal Transcribed Spacer-1 rRNA region was used to identify and quantify Old World Leishmania in 300 samples from human patients, reservoir hosts and sand flies. Different characteristic high resolution melt analysis patterns were exhibited by L. major, L. tropica, L. aethiopica, and L. infantum. Genotyping by high resolution melt analysis was verified by DNA sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism. This new assay was able to detect as little as 2-4 ITS1 gene copies in a 5 microl DNA sample, i.e., less than a single parasite per reaction. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new technique is useful for rapid diagnosis of leishmaniasis and simultaneous identification and quantification of the infecting Leishmania species. It can be used for diagnostic purposes directly from clinical samples, as well as epidemiological studies, reservoir host investigations and vector surveys.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From three regions of Ecuador, 256 local healers called  Agents of Traditional Medicine  (ATMs) were interviewed about their knowledge of the use of plants to treat and heal the illness recognized by the ATMs as leishmaniasis. From literature sources, 14 plants were identified as being used in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Subsequently, plant material was collected from a representative selection of 39 species. A total of 140 extracts were screened in vitro against Leishmania donovani, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma cruzi. Additionally, these extracts were evaluated for their anti-microbial activities using five gram-positive and -negative bacteria as well as Candida albicans. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The survey resulted in 431 use-records for 145 plant-taxa used for the treatment of leishmaniasis. The 10 most frequently reported taxa accounted for 37.7% of all records. In the case of leishmaniasis, activity was observed for Elephantopus mollis, Minquartia guianensis, Bocconia integrifolia, Gouania lupuloides, Scoparia dulcis, an as-yet-unidentified species of Piper and Brugmansia.

20031330,"Emerging trends in the seroprevalence of canine <e>leishmaniasis</e> in the Madrid region (central Spain).This report describes a cross-sectional serological survey of the epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) performed in 2006 and 2007 in the Madrid region (central Spain) where the disease is endemic. The work presented here is one of the several studies conducted in different Spanish regions under the Integrated Project of the European Commission entitled Emerging Diseases in a changing European eNvironment (EDEN). The aim of this project is to identify and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions that determine the spatial and temporal distributions and dynamics of several pathogenic agents including Leishmania infantum (EDEN-LEI). The study area (Madrid Autonomous Region) was selected on the grounds of its wide altitude range. This area was surveyed from NE to SW across its mountain range (Sistema Central) and plateau area. One thousand and seventy-six dogs from 32 villages were examined for clinical signs of CanL, and serum samples were obtained to determine several haematological and biochemical variables. Leishmaniasis-specific antibodies were identified using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). 87 of the 1076 dogs were seropositive for the protozoan (IFAT: cut-off&gt;or=1/80) indicating a seroprevalence of 8.1% (0-16.1% depending on the village). On the basis of a physical examination and the biochemical/haematological status of each dog, 32 of the 87 infected dogs were described as clinically healthy (37%). Seroprevalence showed a peak in young dogs (1-2 years) and a second larger peak among the older dogs (7-8 years). Factors correlated with a higher infection risk were age (OR=1.15 [95% CI: 1.07-1.22]), weight (OR=1.10 [95% CI: 1.04-1.16]), and living outdoors as opposed to in a home (OR=3.38 [95% CI: 1.42-8.05]). According to data from studies performed in 1992 in the same area, the seroprevalence of CanL has increased 1.54-fold [95% CI: 1.04-2.29]. Given that this increasing trend cannot be attributed to differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the dog populations, it is proposed that environmental changes could have had an impact on vector and reservoir densities and their geographical distributions. Further studies designed to explain this trend should attempt to correlate sand fly densities and CanL seroprevalences with climate, land use and human changes.",M2

Serum samples were collected from 1810 animals and tested for the presence of leishmanial antibodies by IFAT, ELISA and western blotting. The overall seroprevalence recorded was 25.1%. Of the seropositive dogs, 58.8% showed no clinical signs of the disease, 25.8% had a few, minor signs and the remaining 15.4% showed more severe illness. The major clinical signs of infection were weight loss, skin lesions and lymphadenopathy. Although seropositive dogs were found in all of the boroughs (daïras) of Algiers, seroprevalences were highest in the western part of the city (i.e. in the boroughs of Bouzaréah, Chéraga and Zéralda), ranging from 23.0% to 44.5%. Statistical analysis showed a relationship between seropositivity for leishmanial infection and the dog's age and lifestyle (i.e. whether the dog lived outside and/or in areas with dense vegetation).

The etiologic agent is an obligate intracellular protozoan, Leishmania infantum. In 1999, an outbreak of a canine leishmaniasis was reported in a Foxhound kennel in New York, and since that report, several other outbreaks have occurred across the United States in additional Foxhound kennels. Because of the high mortality and transmissibility associated with these outbreaks, it is essential that clinicians be aware of this disease to permit its rapid recognition and institution of control measures. Cases with a travel history may suggest imported disease; these are mainly observed from Southern Europe (eg, south of France, Spain, and Italy). Breeds from these and other endemic areas may be at higher risk of infection with Leishmania because of vertical transmission.

The existence of different species combined with host factors may condition clinical presentation, treatment options, and disease outcome. In an endemic country, a predominance of certain species and presentations may be expected, whereas from the perspective of a tropical medicine referral unit a wider variety of cases from diverse geographical areas may be observed. METHODS: Retrospective study of imported leishmaniasis cases diagnosed at a Tropical Medicine referral unit in Spain, during the period of January 1995 to June 2008. RESULTS: In total, 18 cases were diagnosed: 12 cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), 4 mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML), and 2 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases. Two patients were immunosuppressed. The majority of CL cases (9/12) occurring in travelers were acquired in New World countries and were treated with pentavalent antimonials. Three ML cases were acquired in the New World, two received initial treatment with pentavalent antimonials and two with liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB). For all four ML cases, a change in drug choice and multiple treatment courses were necessary, and one remained refractory to treatment. Both VL cases were acquired in Africa and responded well to LAmB treatment. CONCLUSION: The management of leishmaniasis in non-endemic countries is still a challenge for physicians. With the variety of cases presented, both in immigrants and travelers from different geographical areas, this series illustrates the great diversity of imported leishmaniasis in terms of presentation, treatment options, and outcome.

19913112,"Sequence analysis and PCR-RFLP profiling of the hsp70 gene as a valuable tool for identifying Leishmania species associated with human <e>leishmaniasis</e> in Brazil.Since the first report of the genus Leishmania, many species have been described. In Brazil, human leishmaniasis has been associated with eight Leishmania species, of which seven are responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). In some endemic areas, CL is associated with only one species; however, in other areas, such as the Amazon, the etiology of CL can be assigned to many species. The multitude of highly similar Leishmania species in Brazil makes it difficult to develop an appropriate method of typing them. Most Leishmania species were first described based on epidemiological and biological characteristics, and these were later corroborated by Multilocus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE), the gold standard technique for identifying Leishmania species. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of MLEE, many PCR-based methods have been developed and used for parasite identification. In the present study, we analyzed the sequence of the hsp70 gene in Leishmania species associated with human leishmaniasis in Brazil. This analysis led to the identification of restriction enzymes that could be used for PCR-RFLP-based identification. The results obtained were in complete agreement with those obtained by MLEE, suggesting that PCR-RFLP analysis of hsp70 could soon replace MLEE for routine Leishmania typing.",M2

To obtain information of more immediate significance to public health, the research focus must shift from laboratory models to natural pathogen-transmission systems. Identification and characterization of heterogeneities inherent to VBD systems should be prioritized to allow development of local, adaptive control strategies that efficiently make use of limited resources. Importantly, increased involvement of disease-endemic country (DEC) scientists, institutes, and communities will be key to enhance and sustain the fight against VBD.",M2
19807787,"Deciphering the Leishmania exoproteome: what we know and what we can learn.Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of <e>leishmaniasis</e>. Survival and transmission of these parasites in their different hosts require membrane-bound or extracellular factors to interact with and modify their host environments. Over the last decade, several approaches have been applied to study all the extracellular proteins exported by an organism at a particular time or stage in its life cycle and under defined conditions, collectively termed the secretome or the exoproteome. In this review, we focus on emerging data shedding light on the secretion mechanisms involved in the production of the Leishmania exoproteome. We also describe other methodologies currently available that could be used to analyse the Leishmania exoproteome. Understanding the complexity of the Leishmania exoproteome is a key component to elucidating the mechanisms used by these parasites for exporting proteins to the extracellular space during its life cycle. Given the importance of extracellular factors, a detailed knowledge of the Leishmania exoproteome may provide novel targets for rational drug design and/or a source of antigens for vaccine development.",M2
19803542,"Surveillance for antibodies to Leishmania spp. in dogs from Sri Lanka.The global distribution of <e>leishmaniasis</e> is rapidly expanding into new geographic regions. Dogs are the primary reservoir hosts for human visceral leishmaniasis caused by infection with Leishmania infantum. Natural infections with other Leishmania spp. can occur in dogs, but their role as reservoir hosts for other species of Leishmania is uncertain. Leishmania donovani is traditionally considered a visceralizing anthroponotic species; however, cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani has been reported in Sri Lanka. In the present study, sera from 114 dogs in Sri Lanka were examined for antibodies to visceralizing Leishmania spp. Sera were tested by the canine immunochromatographic strip assays based on recombinant K39 antigen. Anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies were detectable in 1 of 114 (0.9%) dogs from Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, serological evidence suggests that leishmaniasis may be an emerging zoonosis in Sri Lanka.",M2

The infection was initially diagnosed upon clinical and immunohistological findings. Subsequent comparative sequence analysis of diagnostic PCR products from the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of ssrRNA classified the respective isolates as neither Old World nor New World Leishmania species. However, four isolates subjected to molecular analyses all exhibited a close phylogenetic relationship to Leishmania sp. siamensis, an organism recently identified in a visceral leishmaniasis patient from Thailand. Future investigations will demonstrate if this form of leishmaniasis represents an emerging, and perhaps zoonotic, disease of European, or even global, importance.",M2
19797268,"Leishmania GP63 alters host signaling through cleavage-activated protein tyrosine phosphatases.With more than 12 million people affected worldwide, 2 million new cases occurring per year, and the rapid emergence of drug resistance and treatment failure, <e>leishmaniasis</e> is an infectious disease for which research on drug and vaccine development, host-pathogen, and vector-parasite interactions are current international priorities. Upon Leishmania-macrophage interaction, activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1 rapidly leads to the down-regulation of Janus kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, resulting in the attenuation of host innate inflammatory responses and of various microbicidal macrophage functions. We report that, in addition to SHP-1, the PTPs PTP1B and TCPTP are activated and posttranslationally modified in infected macrophages, and we identify an essential role for PTP1B in the in vivo progression of Leishmania infection. The mechanism underlying PTP modulation involves the proteolytic activity of the Leishmania surface protease GP63. Access of GP63 to macrophage PTP1B, TCPTP, and SHP-1 is mediated in part by a lipid raft-dependent mechanism, resulting in PTP cleavage and stimulation of phosphatase activity. Collectively, our data present a mechanism of cleavage-dependent activation of macrophage PTPs by an obligate intracellular pathogen and show that internalization of GP63, a key Leishmania virulence factor, into host macrophages is a strategy the parasite uses to interact and survive within its host.",M2
19782495,"Leishmania spp. identification by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and its applications in French Guiana.Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis was for many years the only species commonly identified in French Guiana, but precise species identifications were quite rare. We describe a new restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction technique using a 615-bp fragment of the RNA polymerase II gene and 2 restriction enzymes, TspRI and HgaI. Seven reference strains (Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, L. (V.) guyanensis, Leishmania (Viannia) naiffi, Leishmania (Leishmania) major, Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum) and 112 clinical samples from positive lesions were used for the development of the technique. The rates of positive species identification were 85.7% for punch skin biopsy specimens, 93.1% for positive Giemsa-stained smears, and 100% for positive culture supernatants. In the framework of cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e> species surveillance for the 2006 to 2008 period, parasite identification was carried out for 199 samples from different patients.

19762280,"Are neutrophils important host cells for Leishmania parasites?Neutrophils are the most crucial cells for early defence against infections. When appropriately activated, they can kill obligate intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. However, once the phagocytotic killing has been evaded, neutrophils can serve as host cells for Leishmania. Parasitized neutrophils were suggested to function as a 'Trojan horse', to transfer Leishmania silently to macrophages. In vivo imaging has contributed a second evasion mechanism. We termed it the 'Trojan rabbit' strategy, whereby parasites escape dying neutrophils to infect macrophages. Here, we discuss the different experimental models used to study neutrophil function in <e>leishmaniasis</e>. We suggest that the capacity of neutrophils to function as an immune evasion target depends on the genetic background of the host and the parasite strain used for the experiments.",M2
19762221,"Leishmanicidal activity of benzophenones and extracts from Garcinia brasiliensis Mart. fruits.Infections by protozoans of the genus Leishmania are the major worldwide health problem, with high endemicity in developing countries. The drugs of choice for the treatment of <e>leishmaniasis</e> are the pentavalent antimonials, which exert renal and cardiac toxicity. Thus, there is a strong need for safer and more effective treatments against leishmaniasis. The present study was designated to evaluate, by a bioguided assay, the leishmanicidal activity of extracts (hexane, ethyl-acetate and ethanolic) and molecules both obtained by means of extraction from pericarps of Garcinia brasiliensis fruits. The hexane extract presented the best activity on the extracellular (promastigotes) and intracellular (amastigotes) forms of Leishmania (L.) amazonensis, when compared to the other extracts. Based on these findings, this extract was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, affording nine fractions then resulting in three purified prenylated benzophenones - 7-epi-clusianone (1), garciniaphenone (2) and guttiferone-a (3). They showed significant activity on Leishmania (L.) amazonensis, and little toxicity for mammalian cells. Structure-activity relationships were evaluated showing that the IC(50) value displayed is dependent of prenyl groups and phenolic hydroxyls number, and inversely proportional to the hydrophobicity. Our results are promising, showing that these compounds are biologically active on Leishmania (L.) amazonensis.",M2
19756413,"Rational approaches for drug designing against <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Leishmaniasis has been ignored for many years mainly because it plagues remote and poor areas. However, recently, it has drawn attention of several investigators, and active research is going on for antileishmanial drug discovery. The current available drugs have high failure rates and significant side effects. Recently, liposomal preparations of amphotericin B are available and have proved to be a better drug, but they are very expensive. Miltefosine is one of the few orally administered drugs that are effective against Leishmania. However, it has exhibited teratogenicity, hence, should not be administered to pregnant women. Thus, the search for novel and improved antileishmanial drugs continue. A rational approach to design and develop new antileishmanials can be to identify several metabolic and biochemical differences between host and parasite that can be exploited as drug target. Moreover, many natural products also have significant antileishmanial activity and are yet to be exploited. In the current review, we aim to bring together various drug targets of Leishmania, recent development in the field, future prospects, and hope in the area.",M2
19752271,"In vitro sensitivity testing of Leishmania clinical field isolates: preconditioning of promastigotes enhances infectivity for macrophage host cells.Diagnostic material from patients with <e>leishmaniasis</e> is generally available as promastigotes, and proper testing for susceptibility to first-line drugs by the intracellular amastigote assay is frequently hampered by the poor infectivity of the promastigotes for the macrophage host cell. Several conditions for optimization of the in vitro metacyclogenesis and cell infectivity of Leishmania donovani, L. guyanensis, and L. braziliensis field strains obtained from patients receiving standard antimony medication were investigated. Triggering log-phase promastigotes to become amastigote-like by increasing the temperature or acidifying the culture medium was not successful. Adequate metacyclogenesis and the highest levels of macrophage infection were obtained after 5-day-old late-log-phase promastigote cultures were preconditioned at 25 degrees C to pH 5.4 for 24 h in Schneider's medium prior to infection. The susceptibility assay with primary peritoneal mouse macrophages included pentavalent antimony (Sb(V); sodium stibogluconate), trivalent antimony (Sb(III); potassium antimonyl tartrate), miltefosine, and the experimental drug PX-6518. All strains were sensitive to miltefosine (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] &lt; 10 microM) and PX-6518 (IC(50) &lt; 2 microg/ml) but showed distinct susceptibility to Sb(V) and/or Sb(III), depending on whether they were derived from cured, relapse, or nonresponder patients. Within the available set of Leishmania species and strains, simultaneous Sb(V)-Sb(III) resistance was clearly associated with treatment failure; however, a larger set of isolates is still needed to judge the predictive value of Sb(V)-Sb(III) susceptibility profiling on treatment outcome. In conclusion, the proposed conditioning protocol further contributes toward a more standardized laboratory model for evaluation of the drug sensitivities of field isolates.",M2
19751477,"Foxp3 expression in lesions of the different clinical forms of American tegumentary <e>leishmaniasis</e>.As the diversity in clinical presentation of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is determined mainly by the immune response of host, our aim was to evaluate the in situ expression of Foxp3 [marker of regulatory T (Treg) cell] in lesions of the different clinical forms of ATL. Foxp3(+) cells were observed in 39.5% (32/81) of the samples and the number of positive cells was low in all the clinical forms. Even presenting a significantly lower number of CD4(+) T cells, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) showed a higher expression of Foxp3 when compared with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). In LCL and MCL, the number of Foxp3(+) cells correlated positively with the number of apoptotic cells (active caspase-3(+) cells). A positive correlation was also observed between the expression of active caspase-3 and FasL in these clinical forms. Our data suggest that increased number of Treg cells may be associated to the hyporesponsiveness observed in DCL and also indicate that the apoptosis may be a possible mechanism of action of Foxp3(+) Treg cell in LCL and MCL. However, further studies are required to better understand the mechanism of action of Treg cell.",M2
19746163,"Ancient <e>Leishmaniasis</e> in a highland desert of Northern Chile.BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease endemic today in many areas of South America. METHODOLOGY: We discovered morphologic and molecular evidence of ancient infections in 4 female skulls in the archaeological cemetery of Coyo Oriente, in the desert of San Pedro de Atacama, Northern Chile. The boney facial lesions visible in the skulls could have been caused by a number of chronic infections including chronic Leishmaniasis. This diagnosis was confirmed using PCR-sequenced analyses of bone fragments from the skulls of the affected individuals.Leishmaniasis is not normally found in the high-altitude desert of Northern Chile; where the harsh climate does not allow the parasite to complete its life cycle. The presence of Leishmaniasis in ancient skulls from the region implies infection by the protozoan in an endemic area-likely, in our subjects, to have been the lowlands of North-Eastern Argentina or in Southern Bolivia. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the presence of the disease in ancient times in the high altitude desert of San Pedro de Atacama is the result of an exogamic system of patrilocal marriages, where women from different cultures followed their husbands to their ancestral homes, allowing immigrant women, infected early in life, to be incorporated in the Atacama desert society before they became disfigured by the disease. The present globalization of goods and services and the extraordinary facile movement of people across borders and continents have lead to a resurgence of infectious diseases and re-emergence of infections such as Leishmaniasis. We show here that such factors were already present millennia ago, shaping demographic trends and the epidemiology of infections just as they do today.",M2

19724693,"A novel organotellurium compound (RT-01) as a new antileishmanial agent.<e>Leishmaniasis</e> is a neglected disease and endemic in developing countries. A lack of adequate and definitive chemotherapeutic agents to fight against this infection has led to the investigation of numerous compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RT-01, an organotellurane compound presenting biological activities, in 2 experimental systems against Leishmania amazonensis. The in vitro system consisted of promastigotes and amastigotes forms of the parasite, and the in vivo system consisted of L. amazonensis infected BALB/c mice, an extremely susceptible mouse strain. The compound proved to be toxic against promastigotes and amastigotes. The study also showed that treatment with RT-01 produces an effect similar to that treatment with the reference antimonial drug, Glucantime, in L. amazonensis infected mice. The best results were obtained following RT-01 intralesional administration (720 microg/kg/day); mice showed significant delay in the development of cutaneous lesions and decreased numbers of parasites obtained from the lesions. Significant differences in tissue pathology consisted mainly of no expressive accumulation of inflammatory cells and well-preserved structures in the skin tissue of RT-01-treated mice compared with expressive infiltration of infected cells replacing the skin tissue in lesions of untreated mice. These findings highlight the fact that the apparent potency of organotellurane compounds, together with their relatively simple structure, may represent a new avenue for the development of novel drugs to combat parasitic diseases.",M2
19723479,"Two cases of primary endonasal <e>leishmaniasis</e> in Sardinia (Italy).Leishmaniasis is an endemic protozoan infection in Sardinia, one of the major islands of the Mediterranean Basin. We report two cases of endonasal primary Leishmaniasis, which is a very rare event in adult men who are immunocompetent, born in, and residents of Sardinia. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of intra and extracellular Leishmania amastigotes in the histological smear. Isoenzymatic characterization identified Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-111 in both cases. Laboratory and instrumental investigations excluded visceral involvement. Treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantim) intralesional administration, 1 ml weekly for 4-5 weeks, led to complete resolution. The unusual location is likely a reflection an uncommon site of inoculation of the protozoa, transmitted by flying vectors. The patients were a shepherd and a farmer, respectively, both professions at high risk of infection because of their habits of sleeping outdoors under trees or in country cottages during spring and summer and exposed to sand fly bites. Although mucosal involvement and infection by Leishmania infantum, a potential cause of visceral leishmaniasis, the Sardinian patients experienced a benign disease course considering muco-cutaneous forms described in the New World. Differential diagnosis and early detection are necessary in order to start effective treatment and prevent more serious complications.",M2

The main goal of our study was to evaluate the real prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in dogs by means of real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and serology. We included prospectively 140 military dogs wearing deltamethrine-impregnated collars. Parasitaemia levels were then measured by means of quantitative real time PCR targeting kinetoplast DNA with TaqMan chemistry. ELISA and western blotting (WB) were used for serological screening. The number of dogs working in three areas was the following: Var (n=48), Bouches-du-Rhône (n=61) and Corsica (n=31). Prevalence of symptomatic dogs was 0.7% (n=1). ELISA and WB were positive in one (0.71%) and 19 (14%) dogs, respectively. Fifty-eight dogs (41.4%) had a positive parasitaemia. Global prevalence (positive WB and/or positive qPCR) was 50% (n=70). Mean parasitaemia was 0.018 parasites/mL in the global population and 0.043 parasites/mL in positive dogs [min: 0.0002 to max: 2]. The concordance percent for WB and qPCR results was 55% (n=77). Regarding the prevalence of positive parasitaemia, a significant difference was noticed between dogs living in the Var region and those coming from the two other areas. Parasitaemia was rapidly positive within the first semester of stay in an enzootic area. Despite the use of deltamethrine-impregnated collars, the proportion of dogs with low parasitaemia is important. Thus, it may be relevant to evaluate the effect of screening and treating asymptomatic canine reservoirs on human infection by performing further studies comparing both populations.",M2
19691868,"The molecular epidemiology and phylogeography of Trypanosoma cruzi and parallel research on Leishmania: looking back and to the future.Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan agent of Chagas disease, and the most important parasitic disease in Latin America. Protozoa of the genus Leishmania are global agents of visceral and cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>, fatal and disfiguring diseases. In the 1970s multilocus enzyme electrophoresis demonstrated that T. cruzi is a heterogeneous complex. Six zymodemes were described, corresponding with currently recognized lineages, TcI and TcIIa-e--now defined by multiple genetic markers. Molecular epidemiology has substantially resolved the phylogeography and ecological niches of the T. cruzi lineages. Genetic hybridization has fundamentally influenced T. cruzi evolution and epidemiology of Chagas disease. Genetic exchange of T. cruzi in vitro involves fusion of diploids and genome erosion, producing aneuploid hybrids. Transgenic fluorescent clones are new tools to elucidate molecular genetics and phenotypic variation. We speculate that pericardial sequestration plays a role in pathogenesis. Multilocus sequence typing, microsatellites and, ultimately, comparative genomics are improving understanding of T. cruzi population genetics. Similarly, in Leishmania, genetic groups have been defined, including epidemiologically important hybrids; genetic exchange can occur in the sand fly vector. We describe the profound impact of this parallel research on genetic diversity of T. cruzi and Leishmania, in the context of epidemiology, taxonomy and disease control.",M2
19666482,"Inoculation of killed Leishmania major into immune mice rapidly disrupts immunity to a secondary challenge via IL-10-mediated process.Recovery from natural or experimental Leishmania major infection, the causative agent of cutaneous <e>leishmaniasis</e>, results in development of durable immunity in mice and humans that is manifested as rapid control of parasite replication and resolution of cutaneous lesion after secondary challenge. This form of  infection-induced  immunity is thought to occur naturally in endemic areas and is generally considered the gold standard for any effective vaccine against cutaneous leishmaniasis. To determine factors that might heighten or abrogate infection-induced immunity, we investigated the impact of inoculating dead antigen in the form of killed Leishmania parasites to healed mice. We show that inoculation of killed parasites into mice that resolved their primary virulent L. major infection results in rapid and relatively sustained loss of infection-induced immunity. This loss of immunity was not due to the inability of killed parasites to induce inflammatory responses (such as delayed type hypersensitivity), but it was related to their failure to induce robust IFN-gamma response. Furthermore, inoculation of killed Leishmania parasites into healed mice led to rapid expansion of IL-10-producing CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in lymph nodes draining the primary infection site. Treatment with anti-CD25 or anti-IL-10R mAb abolished killed parasite-induced loss of immunity. Our study suggests that vaccination with killed parasites could predispose naturally immune individuals to become susceptible to new infections and/or disease reactivation. This may account for the lack of efficacy of such vaccines in field trials in endemic regions. These findings have important implications for vaccine design and vaccination strategies against human cutaneous leishmaniasis.",M2

The flow cytometry technique, using promastigote parasite forms, performed better than total soluble extract IgG-ELISA. At the species level, the use of Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major as antigens in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) decreased the overall sensitivity. To assess the specificity of these tests, sera from malaria, toxoplasmosis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, and leprosy patients were used. We also included sera from Leishmania non-infected endemic individuals. The cutaneous species displayed a decreased specificity in both assays. Although more sensitive, flow cytometry using promastigote parasite forms generally presented lower levels of specificity when compared with total extract of IgG-ELISA. Overall, the results of the study show the potential of IgG flow cytometry for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Although highly sensitive, a refinement of the flow cytometry method should be performed to improve the overall specificity.",M2
19634705,"Immunobiology of <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by various species of Leishmania, a unicellular kinetoplastid protozoan flagellate. It manifests mainly in 3 clinical forms; visceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), of which VL is the most severe form of the disease. VL is lethal if untreated and spontaneous cure is extremely rare. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually has milder course and often results into a self-healing of ulcers. Resolution of leishmanial infection is dependent on the coordinated interactions between components of cell mediated immune response, specifically the activation of targeted T-cell populations for appropriate cytokine production and activation of macrophages. In murine model, the development of Thl response is associated with control of infection, and Th2 response is associated with disease progression. However, Th1 and Th2 dichotomy in the human system is not as distinct as in mice and the murine model does not strictly apply to human leishmaniasis. This review focuses the dichotomy of immune response against various clinical forms of the disease. An in-depth knowledge of sequences involved in the immune response to the parasite would help in designing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against leishmaniasis.",M2

Part II.AIM OF THE STUDY: A knowledge attitude and practice study centred on leishmaniasis and its treatment was performed among the Chayahuita, an Amazonian Peruvian ethnic group living in an endemic area. This study documents traditional Chayahuita plant's use and disease concepts. Also, activity of some medicinal plants used by the Chayahuita is highlighted and discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three Chayahuita people were interviewed, following a semi-structured questionnaire focussed on disease knowledge and perception, personal attitude and healing practices. Simultaneously, a collection of plants was performed in different ecotopes, in order to make an extensive inventory of the pharmacopoeia. RESULTS: For the Chayahuita, cutaneous (CL) and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) are considered as diseases of their own, with specific names, aetiologies, mode of transmission. Regarding CL, Chayahuita people consider that the humid characteristic of the skin ulcer is a discriminative fact orienting the diagnostic forTa'ta' (leishmaniasis). Forty-six different species were designated useful against LC and /or MCL (29 species by means of the questionnaire and 27 species when collecting in different ecotopes). Thirty-seven extracts corresponding to 31 species used medicinally were screened in vitro against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes, assessing their viability by the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT). Six species displayed a good activity (10 microg/ml&lt;IC50&lt;20 microg/ml): an undetermined hemi-epiphytic Clusiaceae, Cybianthus anthuriophyllus Pipoly (Myrsinaceae), two Piper, Piper sanguineispicum Trel., and Piper loretoanum Trel.

19625128,"Leishmania spp. and/or Trypanosoma cruzi diagnosis in dogs from endemic and nonendemic areas for canine visceral <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Due to the phylogenetic similarity between Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), serological cross-reactions and false-positive results are quite common. This study aimed to elucidate canine leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis diagnosis by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) on serum samples, and direct parasitological examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in liver and spleen samples. One hundred dogs from Zoonosis Control Center (ZCC) in Bauru, SP, an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and 100 dogs from the Dog Warden Service in Botucatu, SP, a nonendemic area for VL, were studied. IFAT showed positive results for Leishmania spp. in 65% of canine serum samples from Bauru while 40% of the samples were positive for T. cruzi by this test. All samples from Botucatu were negative for leishmaniasis in IFAT, and only 4% were positive for T. cruzi. Out of 200 serum samples tested, 33 (16.5%) showed positive serological results for both the parasites. Direct parasitological examination and PCR found, respectively, 59% and 76% of the liver samples and 51% and 72% of the spleen samples of dogs from Bauru positive for Leishmania spp. Twenty-six (78.8%) of 33 dogs that showed anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-T. cruzi antibodies also tested positive by direct parasitological examination and PCR for Leishmania spp., which indicates that these dogs presented leishmaniasis. No liver or spleen sample from the 200 dogs analyzed showed a positive PCR result for T. cruzi. These findings support the occurrence of cross-reactions between Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi in IFAT; they also corroborate the need for simultaneous PCR and/or parasitological examination to establish canine leishmaniasis (CL) diagnosis.",M2

The adaptations of some species to places modified by humans bring these vectors into contact with dwellings, which can facilitate disease transmission, and the vector control strategies adopted have rendered controversial results. Regarding leishmaniasis, for instance, which vector and reservoirs control can be effective, there is an assumption that the incidence of human infection is directly related to the number of infectious dogs, as well as to entomological factors. Therefore, vector control can provide a cheaper and more practical solution to prevent cases of leishmaniasis. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the factors involved, chemical control is still essential, and biological insecticides and insecticide plants, for example, represent areas for study that should be encouraged and developed since they show promising results.

19597544,"Local suppression of T cell responses by arginase-induced L-arginine depletion in nonhealing <e>leishmaniasis</e>.The balance between T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cell responses is a major determinant of the outcome of experimental leishmaniasis, but polarized Th1 or Th2 responses are not sufficient to account for healing or nonhealing. Here we show that high arginase activity, a hallmark of nonhealing disease, is primarily expressed locally at the site of pathology. The high arginase activity causes local depletion of L-arginine, which impairs the capacity of T cells in the lesion to proliferate and to produce interferon-gamma, while T cells in the local draining lymph nodes respond normally. Healing, induced by chemotherapy, resulted in control of arginase activity and reversal of local immunosuppression. Moreover, competitive inhibition of arginase as well as supplementation with L-arginine restored T cell effector functions and reduced pathology and parasite growth at the site of lesions. These results demonstrate that in nonhealing leishmaniasis, arginase-induced L-arginine depletion results in impaired T cell responses. Our results identify a novel mechanism in leishmaniasis that contributes to the failure to heal persistent lesions and suggest new approaches to therapy.",M2

19556565,"Is real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) more useful than a conventional PCR for the clinical management of <e>leishmaniasis</e>?It is currently unknown if the use of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) adds value to the diagnosis and follow-up prognosis of patients affected by leishmaniasis. We performed a study using a real-time PCR directed against the alpha-polymerase gene and a semiquantitative PCR that target the SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene as control for the diagnosis and quantification of parasites in patients with visceral (VL) and cutaneous (CL) leishmaniasis. Our single copy real-time PCR missed one diagnosis of VL compared with the conventional PCR, whereas both PCR methods were able to detect Leishmania parasites in CL. Under anti-leishmania treatment the kinetics of parasitemia were comparable with the two methods. The real-time PCR directed against alpha-polymerase of Leishmania despite being able to make a more accurate quantification of parasites does not add to the decision-making management compared with a semiquantitative PCR, and it is comparatively expensive.",M2
19530624,"Diagnosis of clinical samples spotted on FTA cards using PCR-based methods.The broad clinical presentation of <e>Leishmaniasis</e> makes the diagnosis of current and past cases of this disease rather difficult. Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major &amp; L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 &amp; P6 as well as P1 &amp; P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species.",M2

19508747,"Antileishmanial activity in Israeli plants.<e>Leishmaniasis</e> is a vector-borne disease caused by flagellated protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, which affects both humans and other mammals. Most of the available drugs against the disease are toxic and parasite resistance to some of the drugs has already developed. In the present study, the leishmanicidal activities of methanolic extracts of some Israeli plants have been evaluated in vitro, against the free-living promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania major. Of the 41 extracts examined, those of two plants (Nuphar lutea&gt;Withania somnifera) were highly effective (with a maximum inhibitory effect of &gt;50%), those of three other species (Pteris vittata&gt;Smyrnium olusatrum&gt;Trifolium clypeatum) were moderately effective (25%-50%) and another four extracts (Erodium malacoides&gt;Hyparrhenia hirta&gt;Thymelaea hirsuta&gt;Pulicaria crispa) showed a marginal effect (15%-22%) against the parasites. Extracts of nine plant species therefore showed antileishmanial activity but only the extract of N. lutea, used at 1.25 microg/ml, eliminated all the intracellular parasites within 3 days of treatment, with no detectable toxicity to the host macrophages. The mean (S.D.) values recorded for the median inhibitory concentrations of this extract (IC50) against the promastigotes [2.0 (0.12) microg/ml] and amastigotes [0.65 (0.023) microg/ml] and the median lethal concentration (LD50) against macrophages [2.1 (0.096) microg/ml] were encouraging, giving a therapeutic selectivity index [LD50/IC50 for amastigotes)] of 3.23. The extract of N. lutea was, in fact, generally as effective as the paromomycin that was used as the 'gold standard' drug. These results indicate that N. lutea and probably also Withania somnifera might be potential sources of clinically useful, antileishmanial compounds.",M2

We conducted a retrospective probabilistic risk assessment for military personnel potentially exposed to insecticides during the  Leishmaniasis Control Plan  (LCP) undertaken in 2003 at Tallil Air Base, Iraq. We estimated acute and subchronic risks from resmethrin, malathion, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and pyrethrins applied using a truck-mounted ultra-low-volume (ULV) sprayer and lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin used for residual sprays. We used the risk quotient (RQ) method for our risk assessment (estimated environmental exposure/toxic endpoint) and set the RQ level of concern (LOC) at 1.0. Acute RQs for truck-mounted ULV and residual sprays ranged from 0.00007 to 33.3 at the 95th percentile. Acute exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, and chlorpyrifos exceeded the RQ LOC. Subchronic RQs for truck-mounted ULV and residual sprays ranged from 0.00008 to 32.8 at the 95th percentile. Subchronic exposures to lambda-cyhalothrin and chlorpyrifos exceeded the LOC. However, estimated exposures to lambda-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, and chlorpyrifos did not exceed their respective no observed adverse effect levels.",M2
19496409,"Synthetic sex pheromone attracts the <e>leishmaniasis</e> vector Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) to traps in the field.Improving vector control remains a key goal in reducing the world's burden of infectious diseases. More cost-effective approaches to vector control are urgently needed, particularly because vaccines are unavailable and treatment is prohibitively expensive. The causative agent of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL), Leishmania chagasi, Cunha and Chagas (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), is transmitted between animal and human hosts by blood-feeding female sand flies attracted to mating aggregations formed on or above host animals by male-produced sex pheromones. Our results show the potential of using synthetic pheromones to control populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz and Neiva (Diptera: Psychodidae), the sand fly vector of one of the world's most important neglected diseases, AVL. We showed that a synthetic pheromone, (+/-)-9-methylgermacrene-B, produced from a low-cost plant intermediate, attracted females in the laboratory. By formulating dispensers that released this pheromone at a rate similar to that released by aggregating males, we were able to attract flies of both sexes to traps in the field. These dispensers worked equally well when deployed with mechanical light traps and inexpensive sticky traps. If deployed effectively, pheromone-based traps could be used to decrease AVL transmission rates through specific targeting and reduction of L. longipalpis populations. This is the first study to show attraction of a human disease-transmitting insect to a synthetic pheromone in the field, showing the general applicability of this novel approach for developing new tools for use in vector control.",M2
19478956,"Using biotic interaction networks for prediction in biodiversity and emerging diseases.Networks offer a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing inter-species ecological and evolutionary interactions. Previously considered examples, such as trophic networks, are just representations of experimentally observed direct interactions. However, species interactions are so rich and complex it is not feasible to directly observe more than a small fraction. In this paper, using data mining techniques, we show how potential interactions can be inferred from geographic data, rather than by direct observation. An important application area for this methodology is that of emerging diseases, where, often, little is known about inter-species interactions, such as between vectors and reservoirs. Here, we show how using geographic data, biotic interaction networks that model statistical dependencies between species distributions can be used to infer and understand inter-species interactions. Furthermore, we show how such networks can be used to build prediction models. For example, for predicting the most important reservoirs of a disease, or the degree of disease risk associated with a geographical area. We illustrate the general methodology by considering an important emerging disease--<e>Leishmaniasis</e>. This data mining methodology allows for the use of geographic data to construct inferential biotic interaction networks which can then be used to build prediction models with a wide range of applications in ecology, biodiversity and emerging diseases.",M2
19478944,"Cooperation between apoptotic and viable metacyclics enhances the pathogenesis of <e>Leishmaniasis</e>.Mimicking mammalian apoptotic cells by exposing phosphatidylserine (PS) is a strategy used by virus and parasitic protozoa to escape host protective inflammatory responses. With Leishmania amazonensis (La), apoptotic mimicry is a prerogative of the intramacrophagic amastigote form of the parasite and is modulated by the host. Now we show that differently from what happens with amastigotes, promastigotes exposing PS are non-viable, non-infective cells, undergoing apoptotic death. As part of the normal metacyclogenic process occurring in axenic cultures and in the gut of sand fly vectors, a sub-population of metacyclic promastigotes exposes PS. Apoptotic death of the purified PS-positive (PS(POS)) sub-population was confirmed by TUNEL staining and DNA laddering. Transmission electron microscopy revealed morphological alterations in PS(POS) metacyclics such as DNA condensation, cytoplasm degradation and mitochondrion and kinetoplast destruction, both in in vitro cultures and in sand fly guts. TUNEL(POS) promastigotes were detected only in the anterior midgut to foregut boundary of infected sand flies. Interestingly, caspase inhibitors modulated parasite death and PS exposure, when added to parasite cultures in a specific time window. Efficient in vitro macrophage infections and in vivo lesions only occur when PS(POS) and PS-negative (PS(NEG)) parasites were simultaneously added to the cell culture or inoculated in the mammalian host. The viable PS(NEG) promastigote was the infective form, as shown by following the fate of fluorescently labeled parasites, while the PS(POS) apoptotic sub-population inhibited host macrophage inflammatory response. PS exposure and macrophage inhibition by a subpopulation of promastigotes is a different mechanism than the one previously described with amastigotes, where the entire population exposes PS. Both mechanisms co-exist and play a role in the transmission and development of the disease in case of infection by La. Since both processes confer selective advantages to the infective microorganism they justify the occurrence of apoptotic features in a unicellular pathogen.",M2

19462565,"[PCR-RFLP and RAPD for typing neotropical Leishmania]INTRODUCTION: The analysis of the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and random amplified polymorphic DNA have been useful tools for Leishmania identification. OBJECTIVES: Molecular procedures were demonstrated for identification and typing of reference strains of New World Leishmania and their applicability was validated for clinical samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from 16 reference strains of Latin American Leishmania as well as from clinical samples of <e>leishmaniasis</e> patients. A sequence coding for cysteine proteinase B was amplified by PCR and subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The enzyme used was Taq1. For eight of the reference strains, the random amplified polymorphic desoxyribonucleic acid technique (RAPD) was applied. Band patterns for Leishmania species differentiation were established each each method. The sample size of the clinical sample was of 5. RESULTS: PCR products of the cysteine proteinase B gene were obtained for L. braziliensis, L. peruviana, L. panamensis and L. guyanensis. For the other species, L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, L. garnhami, L. lainsoni, L. chagasi, L. naiffi, no amplification occurred. The patterns of restriction fragments revealed band patterns in common for L. peruviana, L. guyanensis and L. panamensis, whereas L. braziliensis had a distinctive pattern. When human samples were examined, amplification occurred for all cases, and the profiles corresponded to the common profile of L. peruviana, L. guyanensis and L. panamensis. The RAPD technique demonstrated reproducible and distinctive patterns for each of the 8 reference strains, L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, L. garnhami, L. lainsoni, L. chagasi, L. naiffi, making possible to differentiate all them. The advantages and limitations of each procedure are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of RFP and RAPD methodologies provide useful tools to identify medical important species of Leishmania by recognizing DNA sequences characteristic of each species.",M2

We investigated the antileishmanial activity of Tridax procumbens extracts and a pure compound against promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts and (3S)-16,17-didehydrofalcarinol (1) were obtained by chromatographic methods from Tridax procumbens, and the latter identified by spectroscopic analysis. The effect of these extracts and 1 on the growth inhibition of promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana was evaluated. In order to test the safety of extracts and 1, mammalian cells were treated with them, and cell viability was assessed using trypan blue and MTT. RESULTS: We demonstrated that extracts of Tridax procumbens and 1 showed a pronounced activity against Leishmania mexicana. The methanol extract inhibited promastigotes growth of Leishmania mexicana with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 3 microg/ml, while oxylipin 1 exhibited the highest inhibition at IC(50)=0.478 microg/ml.

Seven sandfly species are incriminated as vectors and Leishmania infections have been detected in several non-human mammal hosts. Transmission is associated with forest-related activities, but recently, cases of autochthonous, urban transmission were reported. Because most cases are caused by L.

Animals presenting positive ELISA and/or positive parasitological diagnosis of Leishmania were enrolled in the group of infected dogs (n=32). Animals with negative ELISA results and parasitological tests for Leishmania, including a negative immunofluorescence test for toxoplasmosis and neosporosis, were included as the control group (n=10). Brain samples were collected, stored in 10% buffered formalin and subjected to routine histological procedures, following by staining with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical examination for T and B lymphocytes and phagocytic cells. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected to determine the anti-Leishmania antibody titers. Histological examination of HE stains demonstrated intense inflammatory infiltrate, primarily in the choroid plexus, which was composed of mononuclear cells with no detectable parasites. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CD3(+) T lymphocytes were the major components of the inflammatory infiltrate at the choroid plexus and in the brain. Infected dogs had more CD3(+) T cells than uninfected animals (P=0.0002). Cerebrospinal fluid from infected dogs contained high titers of anti-Leishmania antibodies in comparison with control animals (P&lt;0.0001), which suggests a compromise of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

19361864,"Synthesis and characterization of a pyridine-2-thiol N-oxide gold(I) complex with potent antiproliferative effect against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. insight into its mechanism of action.In the search for new therapeutic tools against parasitic diseases caused by the Kinetoplastids Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, a novel gold(I) triphenylphosphine complex with the bioactive coligand pyridine-2-thiol N-oxide (mpo) was synthesized and characterized by using analytical and conductometric measurements, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI) and electronic, FTIR and (1)H and (31)P NMR spectroscopies. A dinuclear structure is suggested for the complex. At a 1 microM concentration the complex induced in vitro after 30 min a potent leishmanicidal effect (LD(50)) against promastigotes of Leishmania (L.) mexicana while on Leishmania (V.) braziliensis with the same concentration only a leishmanistatic effect (IC(75)) was observed 48 h after treatment. Similar differential susceptibilities were also found when testing the ligand mpo, but at a higher dose (5 microM). In addition, the compound showed growth inhibitory effect on Dm28c T. cruzi epimastigotes in culture (IC(50) 0.09 microM), being even more active than the anti-trypanosomal reference drug Nifurtimox (IC(50) 6 microM). DNA interaction studies showed that this biomolecule does not constitute a main target for the mpo complex currently tested. Instead, the significant potentiation of the antiproliferative effect against both Leishmania species and T. cruzi could be associated to the inhibition of NADH fumarate reductase, a kinetoplastid parasite-specific enzyme absent in the host. Furthermore, due to its low unspecific cytotoxicity on mammalian cells (J774 macrophages), the new gold complex showed a selective anti-parasite activity.

19317451,"Molecular basis of antimony treatment in <e>leishmaniasis</e>.Leishmaniasis is a disease that affects 2 million people and kills 70000 persons every year. It is caused by Leishmania species, which are human protozoan parasites of the trypanosomatidae family. Trypanosomatidae differ from the other eukaryotes in their specific redox metabolism because the glutathione/glutathione reductase system is replaced by the unique trypanothione/trypanothione reductase system. The current treatment of leishmaniasis relies mainly on antimonial drugs. The crystal structures of oxidized trypanothione reductase (TR) from Leishmania infantum and of the complex of reduced TR with NADPH and Sb(III), reported in this paper, disclose for the first time the molecular mechanism of action of antimonial drugs against the parasite. Sb(III), which is coordinated by the two redox-active catalytic cysteine residues (Cys52 and Cys57), one threonine residue (Thr335), and His461' of the 2-fold symmetry related subunit in the dimer, strongly inhibits TR activity. Because TR is essential for the parasite survival and virulence and it is absent in mammalian cells, these findings provide insights toward the design of new more affordable and less toxic drugs against Leishmaniasis.",M2
19317431,"Kahalalide F, an antitumor depsipeptide in clinical trials, and its analogues as effective antileishmanial agents.<e>Leishmaniasis</e> is a human parasitic disease caused by infection by the protozoan Leishmania spp. Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment available, but its efficacy is increasingly challenged by the rising incidence of resistance and the frequent severe side effects associated with first-line drugs. Thus the development of leads with distinct mechanisms of action is urgently needed. A strategy often used for this purpose consists of assaying for leishmanicidal activity drugs formerly developed for other applications, such as amphotericin B (antifungal) or miltefosine (antitumor), among others, to profit from previous pharmacological and toxicological studies. Kahalalide F (KF) is a tumoricidal cyclic depsipeptide currently under phase II clinical trials for several types of cancer and psoriasis. Its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Here we report the leishmanicidal activity of KF and its synthetic analogues at a micromolar range of concentrations. Its lethality is strongly linked to the alteration of the plasma membrane (PM) of the parasite based on (i) a rapid depolarization of the PM and uptake of the vital dye SYTOX Green upon its addition; (ii) evidence of severe morphological damage to the membrane of the parasite, as shown by transmission electron microscopy; and (iii) a rapid drop in the intracellular ATP levels, which correlates significantly with the leishmanicidal activity for active analogues, some of them with significant improvement of their therapeutic index with respect to the parental molecule. In addition to the basic knowledge obtained, this class of lethal mechanism is considerably less prone to the induction of resistance than classical drugs. All together, these observations foster further studies for the optimization of KF and its analogues as new anti-Leishmania leads with a new mode of action.",M2

In addition, we approach the available assays for testing lead compounds in large scale and their limitations for they represent one of the bottlenecks in the pipeline for novel drug discovery. We conclude the article presenting a recent coordinated initiative (TDR Transfection Network) established to overcome some of these limitations by the generation of Plasmodium and Leishmania transgenic parasites better suited for HTS platforms.",M2
19271999,"The potential effects of global warming on changes in canine <e>leishmaniasis</e> in a focus outside the classical area of the disease in southern France.In 1994, an ecoepidemiologic study was carried out in the mid-Ariège valley (French Pyrenees) where autochthonous cases of canine leishmaniasis had been previously reported. Serologic samples were collected from 336 dogs in two groups of villages. The seroprevalences were 11.67% in the valley villages and only 1.43% in the foothill villages. Five lymph node biopsies were taken from serologically positive dogs, and resultant isolates were identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1. Phlebotomine sandflies were collected in five locations by CDC light traps. Both of the known French vectors, Phlebotomus ariasi and P. perniciosus, were identified. Bioclimatic and floristic studies showed that this area is an enclave of the supra-Mediterranean climatic zone, containing a typically xerothermophilic Mediterranean flora. The Pyrenees Mountains are usually considered to be outside of the endemic range of leishmaniasis in southern France, and so our demonstration of a microfocus of canine leishmaniasis in the northern foothills is noteworthy. A second serologic survey carried out in 2007 (216 dogs) showed an inversion of the seropositive rates between the two groups of villages compared with those of 1994: only 2.72% in the valley villages and 11.32% in the foothills villages. The decrease of seroprevalence in the first area (valley villages) can be related to a considerable use of deltamethrin collars during the transmission season. The increase of seroprevalence of the foothill villages could be related to climatic conditions, since there was an increase of about 1 degrees C in the mean annual temperature.",M2
19269250,"Leishmania commandeers the host inflammatory response through neutrophils.Neutrophils are the first cells to migrate to the site of tissue damage. Recent work has addressed Leishmania survival and entry into macrophages through the infection of neutrophils that are recruited as a normal response to sandfly bites. New findings indicate that Leishmania is able to escape from neutrophils and 'silently' enter macrophages, a modification of the 'Trojan horse' model. Neutrophil depletion impaired disease progression, indicating an important role for neutrophils in <e>leishmaniasis</e>.",M2
19257849,"Tracing immunity to human <e>leishmaniasis</e>.People who have recovered from leishmaniasis are believed to have long-lasting protection against subsequent infection. Understanding the immunological changes that are associated with protection from cure of and susceptibility to the disease are fundamental to both designing and evaluating vaccine candidates against the leishmaniases. In the quest for a vaccine against leishmaniasis, appropriate surrogate markers of immunity would be valuable and cost effective. Biomarkers would ease screening and selection of potentially efficient vaccine candidates. Moreover, biomarkers of disease may be used to monitor disease and aid therapeutic prognosis. This would be useful in the evaluation of both existing and new drugs, making invasive post-treatment evaluation redundant. Biomarkers may also be indicative of the severity of the disease and may be able to predict the outcome of an infection and indicate whether the patient will spontaneously recover, exhibit mild symptoms or if the disease is disseminating and will be severe. In this article we discuss the immunological changes associated with different forms of human leishmaniasis and the value of appropriate immunological biomarkers in finding an effective vaccine and an evaluation of therapies against leishmanial disease will be given.",M2

19248652,"Insect vectors of Leishmania: distribution, physiology and their control.<e>Leishmaniasis</e> is a deadly vector-borne disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Mediterranean regions. The causative agent of leishmaniasis is transmitted from man to man by a tiny insect called sandfly. Approximately, 600 species of sandflies are known but only 10% of these act as disease vectors. Further, only 30 species of these are important from public health point. Fauna of Indian sub-zone is represented by 46 species, of these, 11 belong to Phlebotomine species and 35 to Sergentomyia species. Phlebotomus argentipes is the proven vector of kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis in India. This review gives an insight into the insect vectors of human leishmaniasis, their geographical distribution, recent taxonomic classification, habitat, and different control measures including indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), environmental management, biological control, and emerging resistance to DDT. Role of satellite remote sensing for early prediction of the disease by identifying the sandflygenic conditions cannot be undermined. The article also underlines the importance of synthetic pheromones which can be used in near future for the control of these vectors.",M2
19232658,"The methodological quality of cluster randomised controlled trials for managing tropical parasitic disease: a review of trials published from 1998 to 2007.The aim of this review was to assess the methodological quality of cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCT) for the management of tropical parasitic disease published between 1998 and 2007. A literature survey was conducted using Medline for CRCTs of interventions aimed at managing any one of the six major tropical parasitic diseases: malaria, <e>leishmaniasis</e>, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Information was extracted from the published articles in order that, for each trial, categorical responses could be made to a pre-specified list of 12 questions concerning issues relating to the methodological quality of the trial, including choice of design, generalisability, baseline assessment, blinding, use or non-use of a matched design, and accounting for the intraclass correlation in both design and analysis. The literature survey found 38 CRCTs. Of the 35 CRCTs that reported at least one human outcome, 27 were for interventions in the management of malaria whilst the rest were for managing leishmaniasis (4 trials), lymphatic filariasis (2 trials) and schistosomiasis (2 trials). For every one of the pre-specified questions that concerned an issue associated with methodological quality, the responses were consistent with the practice of trialists in relation to the given issue being generally poor.",M2
