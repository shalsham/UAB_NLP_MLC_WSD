20480891,"Determination of allergenic <e>egg</e> proteins in food by protein-, mass spectrometry-, and DNA-based methods.Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in both adults and children, and foods including eggs and their byproducts should be declared under food allergen labeling policies in industrial countries. Therefore, to develop and validate a sensitive and specific method to detect hidden egg allergens in foods, we compared immunochemical, DNA-based, and proteomic methods for detecting egg allergens in foods using egg allergen standards such as egg whole protein, egg white protein, egg yolk protein, ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, lysozyme, and alpha-livetin. Protein-based immunochemical methods, including ELISA as an initial screening quantitative analysis and immunoblotting as a final confirmatory qualitative analysis, were very sensitive and specific in detecting potentially allergenic egg residues in processed foods in trace amounts. In contrast, the proteomics-based, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS and LC-tandem quadrupole time-of-flight MS methods were not able to detect some egg allergens, such as ovomucoid, because of its nondenaturing property under urea and trypsin. The DNA-based PCR method could not distinguish between egg and chicken meat because it is tissue-nonspecific. In further studies for the feasibility of these immunochemical methods on 100 real raw dietary samples, four food samples without listed egg ingredients produced a positive response by ELISA, but exhibited negative results by immunoblotting.",M1
20480889,"Validation procedures for quantitative food allergen ELISA methods: community guidance and best practices.This document provides supplemental guidance on specifications for the development and implementation of studies to validate the performance characteristics of quantitative ELISA methods for the determination of food allergens. It is intended as a companion document to other existing publications on method validation. The guidance is divided into two sections: information to be provided by the method developer on various characteristics of the method, and implementation of a multilaboratory validation study. Certain criteria included in the guidance are allergen-specific. Two food allergens, <e>egg</e> and milk, are used to demonstrate the criteria guidance. These recommendations will be the basis of the harmonized validation protocol for any food allergen ELISA method, whether proprietary or nonproprietary, that will be submitted to AOAC and/or regulatory authorities or other bodies for status recognition. Regulatory authorities may have their own particular requirements for data packages in addition to the guidance in this document. Future work planned for the implementation and validation of this guidance will include guidance specific to other priority allergens.",M1
20460670,"Influence of <e>egg</e> storage time and preincubation warming profile on embryonic development, hatchability, and chick quality.When eggs are stored beyond 7 d, hatchability and chick quality decrease. The cause of the negative effects of prolonged egg storage is not clear. The negative effects may be caused by a decrease in embryo viability due to an increase in cell death. The optimal time and curve of preincubation warming (the preincubation warming profile) may be different for eggs stored over short and long periods of time because embryo viability is dependent on egg storage time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preincubation warming profiles affect embryonic development, hatchability, and chick quality when eggs are stored for a short or prolonged time. Two experiments were conducted. In both experiments, a 2x2 completely randomized design was used with 2 storage times (4 and 14 d at 17 degrees C in experiment I and 4 and 13 d at 19 degrees C in experiment II) and 2 preincubation warming profiles (within 4 or 24 h from storage temperature to 37.8 degrees C). In experiment I, results suggested that the effect of preincubation warming profile on hatchability was dependent on storage time. However, because a low number of eggs were used in this experiment, these differences were not significant. In experiment II, the interaction between storage time and preincubation warming profile was observed for embryonic mortality during the first 2 d of incubation and hatchability (P=0.006 and P=0.01, respectively). When storage time was 13 d, embryonic mortality during the first 2 d of incubation decreased by 4.4% and hatchability increased by 5.7% when the 24-h preincubation warming profile was used instead of the 4-h preincubation warming profile. However, no effect of preincubation warming profile was observed when storage time was 4 d. In both experiments, chick quality decreased when storage time increased but was not affected by preincubation warming profile. We concluded that a slow preincubation warming profile is beneficial for hatchability when storage time is prolonged but does not affect chick quality.",M1
20450000,"The effects of condensed tannins extracted from different plant species on <e>egg</e> hatching and larval development of Teladorsagia circumcincta (Nematoda: Trichostrongylidae).The effects of condensed tannins (CTs) extracted from five species of plants on egg hatching and larval development of Teladorsagia circumcincta (Stadelmann, 1894) (syn. Ostertagia circumcincta) were evaluated using in vitro bioassays. The extracts of CTs were obtained from Lotus pedunculatus (LP), Lotus corniculatus (LC), Dorycnium pentaphyllum (DP), Dorycnium rectum (DR) and Rumex obtusifolius (RO). The results of egg hatching assay showed that about 53%, 68%, 51%, 60% and 46% of the eggs hatched when in vitro incubations contained 900 microg/ml of CTs from LP, LC, DP, DR and RO, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 relative to control incubation), while in control incubations (no CT added) 87% of the eggs hatched. In the larval development assay, development was allowed to proceed for 7 days, by which time 89% of the hatched larvae in control wells (no CTs) had reached the infective third stage (L3). In incubations containing 200 microg CT from LP, LC, DP, DR and RO/ml, about 8%, 15%, 14%, 8% and 4% of the eggs attained full development to L3 larvae, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 relative to control incubation). Only 1% of the eggs were able to develop to L3 larvae in incubations containing 400 microg CT extracted from LC/ml, whilst in the incubations containing the same concentration of other CTs the eggs were not able to develop to L3 larvae. It seems that CTs are not only slowing down the larval development but also kill the undeveloped larvae. At 400 microg/ml, for example, CT from LP, LC, DP, DR and RO killed 67%, 48%, 68%, 93% and 91% of first-stage (L1) and second-stage (L2) larvae, respectively. This study shows that CTs are able to disrupt the life cycle of nematodes.",M1
20421497,"Visual modeling shows that avian host parents use multiple visual cues in rejecting parasitic <e>eggs</e>.One of the most striking outcomes of coevolution between species is egg mimicry by brood parasitic birds, resulting from rejection behavior by discriminating host parents. Yet, how exactly does a host detect a parasitic egg? Brood parasitism and egg rejection behavior provide a model system for exploring the relative importance of different visual cues used in a behavioral task. Although hosts are discriminating, we do not know exactly what cues they use, and to answer this it is crucial to account for the receiver's visual perception. Color, luminance ( perceived lightness ) and pattern information have never been simultaneously quantified and experimentally tested through a bird's eye. The cuckoo finch Anomalospiza imberbis and its hosts show spectacular polymorphisms in egg appearance, providing a good opportunity for investigating visual discrimination owing to the large range of patterns and colors involved. Here we combine field experiments in Africa with modeling of avian color vision and pattern discrimination to identify the specific visual cues used by hosts in making rejection decisions. We found that disparity between host and foreign eggs in both color and several aspects of pattern (dispersion, principal marking size, and variability in marking size) were important predictors of rejection, especially color. These cues correspond exactly to the principal differences between host and parasitic eggs, showing that hosts use the most reliable available cues in making rejection decisions, and select for parasitic eggs that are increasingly mimetic in a range of visual attributes.",M1
20417310,"Effects of in ovo exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on hepatic AHR/ARNT-CYP1A signaling pathways in common cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo).Our previous studies have isolated multiple isoforms of aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs) and AHR nuclear translocators (ARNTs) in avian species. However, roles of such genes on cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) expression are not fully understood. To investigate the effects of dioxins on the hepatic expression profiles of AHR1, AHR2, ARNT1 and ARNT2 in avian species, and whether the expression levels of AHRs and ARNTs affect the transcriptions of CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 genes, the <e>eggs</e> of common (great) cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) collected from Lake Biwa, Japan, were in ovo administrated with 0, 1500 and 4500pg/g egg of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and the hepatic expression levels of AHRs, ARNTs and CYP1As in embryos were monitored with two-step real-time RT-PCR. In young and adult cormorants collected from the same location, the hepatic expressions of these genes were also measured to understand the effects of growth stage. The residue levels of TCDD and other chlorinated dioxin-like congeners (DLCs) in the body of cormorants were quantified with high-resolution gas chromatography equipped with mass-spectrometry. There was no observable effect of in ovo TCDD treatment even at the highest dosage on mortality, body weight and morphology of the liver, heart, spleen, kidney and lung in the embryos. The mRNA expression of ARNT2 was slightly suppressed by the treatment with TCDD, while no alteration was observed for the expression of AHR1, AHR2 and ARNT1. Expressions of CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 were dose-dependently enhanced by TCDD, but CYP1A4 mRNA level increased more prominently than CYP1A5, indicating the difference in induction efficiency between the CYP1A isozymes. Comparison of hepatic mRNA levels of these genes among embryonic, young and adult cormorants revealed that young and adult cormorants had greater CYP1A5 expression levels than embryos, independently of the accumulation levels of DLCs. These results suggest that the hepatic induction of each CYP1A by DLCs in cormorants occurs in an isoform-specific manner and CYP1A5 expression, at least partially, depends on the factors related to the growth of cormorants, but the transcriptional processes of CYP1As are not related to the expression levels of AHRs and ARNTs. This study yielded results supporting our previous observations that in reality, high accumulation of DLCs induces hepatic CYP1A4 and 1A5 expressions in the wild cormorant population.",M1
20377352,"Polymorphism in resting <e>egg</e> size and hatching strategy in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus pallas.This study examined polymorphism in the resting egg size, hatching pattern, morphotype, and starvation tolerance of stem females in a local population of the freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Fifteen rotifer families were cultured under laboratory conditions to induce the production of inbred, homozygous resting eggs. Each family of resting eggs was measured for size and aliquots were then incubated at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C to test the phenotypic plasticity of hatching dynamics in this population. The distribution of resting egg size was approximately normal in each family, and the sizes of the resting egg shell and embyro showed significant differences among families, ranging from 6.4-8.9 (x 10(5) microm(3)) and 3.7-5.2 (x 10(5) microm(3)), respectively. Hatching rates also varied greatly among families at each temperature, with average values ranging from 10.0-51.5% at 10 degrees C and 3.1- 67.2% at 20 degrees C. Hatching temperature clearly affected the hatching pattern. Resting eggs of most families hatched synchronously at 20 degrees C, whereas they were likely to hatch more sporadically at 10 degrees C. We observed no correlation between size of resting egg and subsequent hatching variability. This was the first time to find a large diversity in morphotype of B. calyciflorus stem females among different families. In some families, most stem females lacked posterolateral spines, but in other families, they had two short posterolateral spines. There was a considerable variation in survival time of stem females that had undergone starvation, and survival time was positively correlated with resting egg size. The divergence in these life history traits may have important implications for understanding the rotifer's adaptive strategy and life history evolution.",M1
20377351,"Morph-specific fecundity and <e>egg</e> size in the female-dimorphic damselfly Ischnura senegalensis.Females of coenagrionid damselflies exhibit color dimorphism, consisting of an andromorph and a gynomorph. This study compared reproductive traits between the female morphs in both field-captured and laboratory-reared females of the female-dimorphic damselfly Ischnura senegalensis. No difference was found in the onset of egg development between the morphs. The andromorphs developed significantly smaller mature eggs and had significantly more immature eggs than the gynomorphs. These results suggest that the andromorphs are r-strategists (high fecundity with small eggs), whereas the gynomorphs are K-strategists (low fecundity with large eggs). Fecundity and egg size might determine the quantity and quality of the offspring, respectively, indicating that morph-specific reproductive traits would contribute to the overall fitness of each female morph, and consequently be key factors affecting morph frequency in a population.",M1
20377310,"Birth defects in wildlife: the role of environmental contaminants as inducers of reproductive and developmental dysfunction.The etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes is not well understood. Wildlife observations provide considerable evidence that environmental contaminants can play a critical role in reproductive and developmental dysfunction. Early evidence leading to a widespread awareness of the impact of environmental chemicals on surrounding wildlife was observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes. A suite of reproductive and congenital defects was identified in birds, reptiles, and mammals alike that were attributed to high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and industrial chemicals. Due to the ubiquitous and persistent nature of many anthropogenic chemicals, these defects, including thyroid dysfunction, hatching success, <e>egg</e> shell thinning, and gross birth deformities, have since been identified in numerous wildlife populations across the world. Certain wildlife taxa such as amphibians are especially vulnerable to chemical perturbation and are suffering alarming population declines. Amphibian field studies have found severe hindlimb and other developmental abnormalities and it has been demonstrated that the greater the agricultural intensity, the greater the number and severity of defects in toad populations. Alligators living in contaminated lakes have shown a significant reduction in penis size and fish exposed to tributyltin have shown tail deformities and abnormal eye development. Physiological and molecular responses to chemical insult are often conserved across vertebrates, alerting scientists and medical professionals alike that greater attention needs to be paid to the roles environmental contaminants play in the etiology of congenital disorders in both humans and wildlife.",M1
20362323,"Maternal transfer of chlorinated contaminants in the leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, nesting in French Guiana.We examined the maternal transfer of organochlorine contaminants (OCs), pesticides (DDTS and HCHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the temporal variation of blood and <e>eggs</e> concentrations from 38 leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting in French Guiana. PCBs were found to be the dominant OCs with respective mean concentrations of 55.14 ng g(-1) lipid-mass for egg and 1.26 ng mL(-1) wet-mass for blood. OC concentrations were lower than concentrations measured in other marine turtles which might be due to the lower trophic position (diet based on gelatinous zooplankton) and to the location of their foraging and nesting grounds. All OCs detected in leatherback blood were detected in eggs, suggesting a maternal transfer of OCs. This transfer was shown to depend on female blood concentration for SigmaDDTs and for the most prevalent PCB congeners, since significant relationships were found between paired blood-egg concentrations. During the nesting season, OC concentrations in eggs and the percentage of lipid in eggs were found to decline in successive clutches, highlighting a process of offloading from females to their eggs and a decreasing investment of lipid from females into their clutches. OCs in eggs tended to be higher in females spending 3 years in the foraging grounds between two nesting seasons than in those spending 2 years, suggesting an impact of time spacing two breeding seasons, called remigration interval, and of location of the foraging grounds.",M1
20354064,"Applications of cold temperature stress to age fractionate Caenorhabditis elegans: a simple inexpensive technique.The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans's (CE) successful use in studies of aging is well documented. Cold temperature stress of mixed populations of CE provides a rapid inexpensive means of obtaining three life stage-specific cohorts. Cohorts are obtained in quantities that allow acquisition of replicate metabolite profiles of changes associated with development, aging, and senescence. The fractionation technique is effective with monoxenic and axenic CE cultures. Cohort Y contains 100% young worms, and Cohort A contains 75% adult worms. Cohort M, prereproductive and reproductive, contains some A and Y due to continuous <e>egg</e> laying and hatch. Principal component analysis of normalized data from metabolite profiles obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography electrochemical analysis clearly separates Cohort Y from Cohort A and monoxenic from axenic cultured worms. Access to replicate quantities of age-defined worms will aid studies of alterations in homeostatic controls associated with aging and senescence.",M1
20299459,"Dicalcin inhibits fertilization through its binding to a glycoprotein in the <e>egg</e> envelope in Xenopus laevis.Fertilization comprises oligosaccharide-mediated sperm-egg interactions, including sperm binding to an extracellular egg envelope, sperm penetration through the envelope, and fusion with an egg plasma membrane. We show that Xenopus dicalcin, an S100-like Ca(2+)-binding protein, present in the extracellular egg envelope (vitelline envelope (VE)), is a suppressive mediator of sperm-egg interaction. Preincubation with specific antibody greatly increased the efficiency of in vitro fertilization, whereas prior application of exogenous dicalcin substantially inhibited fertilization as well as sperm binding to an egg and in vitro sperm penetration through the VE protein layer. Dicalcin showed binding to protein cores of gp41 and gp37, constituents of VE, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and increased in vivo reactivity of VE with a lectin, Ricinus communis agglutinin I, which was accounted for by increased binding ability of gp41 to the lectin and greater exposure of gp41 to an external environment. Our findings strongly suggest that dicalcin regulates the distribution of oligosaccharides within the VE through its binding to the protein core of gp41, probably by modulating configuration of oligosaccharides on gp41 and the three-dimensional structure of VE framework, and thereby plays a pivotal role in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization.",M1
20226671,"Arabidopsis female gametophyte gene expression map reveals similarities between plant and animal gametes.The development of multicellular organisms is controlled by differential gene expression whereby cells adopt distinct fates. A spatially resolved view of gene expression allows the elucidation of transcriptional networks that are linked to cellular identity and function. The haploid female gametophyte of flowering plants is a highly reduced organism: at maturity, it often consists of as few as three cell types derived from a common precursor [1, 2]. However, because of its inaccessibility and small size, we know little about the molecular basis of cell specification and differentiation in the female gametophyte. Here we report expression profiles of all cell types in the mature Arabidopsis female gametophyte. Differentially expressed posttranscriptional regulatory modules and metabolic pathways characterize the distinct cell types. Several transcription factor families are overrepresented in the female gametophyte in comparison to other plant tissues, e.g., type I MADS domain, RWP-RK, and reproductive meristem transcription factors. PAZ/Piwi-domain encoding genes are upregulated in the <e>egg</e>, indicating a role of epigenetic regulation through small RNA pathways-a feature paralleled in the germline of animals [3]. A comparison of human and Arabidopsis egg cells for enrichment of functional groups identified several similarities that may represent a consequence of coevolution or ancestral gametic features.",M1
20218504,"Influence of thiamine deficiency on lake trout larval growth, foraging, and predator avoidance.Diet-related thiamine deficiency increases the acute mortality, known as early mortality syndrome, of salmonines from some of the Great Lakes. The consequences of thiamine deficiency as measured at the <e>egg</e> stage for other important early life stage processes like growth, foraging efficiency, and predator avoidance that may also result in mortality, are unknown. Accordingly, we investigated the impacts of low thiamine on the specific growth rate (SGR) of first-feeding fry, the ability of first-feeding fry to capture Daphnia, fry emergence in the presence of a potential predator (round goby Apollina [formerly Neogobius] melanostomus), and predation by slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus. We used a combination of thiamine-deficient and thiamine-replete wild stocks of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush for this purpose. From these investigations we developed predictive relationships. Specific growth rate was related to egg thiamine concentration. From the exponential relationship, it was predicted that the threshold egg thiamine concentrations associated with 20% and 50% reductions in SGR are 8.1 and 5.1 nmol/g, respectively. The foraging rate on Daphnia was also related to egg thiamine concentration by an exponential relationship. It was predicted that the threshold concentrations associated with 20% and 50% reductions in this rate are 6.9 and 2.9 nmol/g, respectively. The presence of a round goby significantly reduced emergence success, but the level of goby predation was unrelated to egg thiamine concentration. Sculpin predation was related, although weakly, to the initial egg thiamine concentration. This research found that thiamine deficiency affected growth, foraging, and predator avoidance in lake trout fry. Growth effects resulting from thiamine deficiency may represent the most sensitive means of monitoring the impact of the secondary consequences of thiamine deficiency. Mortality associated with the combined effects of reduced growth and foraging has the potential to seriously impair lake trout recruitment.",M1
20218501,"<e>Egg</e> fatty acid composition from lake trout fed two Lake Michigan prey fish species.We previously demonstrated that there were significant differences in the egg thiamine content in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush fed two Lake Michigan prey fish (alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and bloater Coregonus hoyi). Lake trout fed alewives produced eggs low in thiamine, but it was unknown whether the consumption of alewives affected other nutritionally important components. In this study we investigated the fatty acid composition of lake trout eggs when females were fed diets that resulted in different egg thiamine concentrations. For 2 years, adult lake trout were fed diets consisting of four combinations of captured alewives and bloaters (100% alewives; 65% alewives, 35% bloaters; 35% alewives, 65% bloaters; and 100% bloaters). The alewife fatty acid profile had higher concentrations of arachidonic acid and total omega-6 fatty acids than the bloater profile. The concentrations of four fatty acids (cis-13, 16-docosadienoic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) were higher in bloaters than in alewives. Although six fatty acid components were higher in lake trout eggs in 2001 than in 2000 and eight fatty acids were lower, diet had no effect on any fatty acid concentration measured in lake trout eggs in this study. Based on these results, it appears that egg fatty acid concentrations differ between years but that the egg fatty acid profile does not reflect the alewife-bloater mix in the diet of adults. The essential fatty acid content of lake trout eggs from females fed alewives and bloaters appears to be physiologically regulated and adequate to meet the requirements of developing embryos.",M1
20218500,"Linking <e>egg</e> thiamine and fatty acid concentrations of Lake Michigan lake trout with early life stage mortality.The natural reproduction of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Michigan is thought to be compromised by nutritional deficiency associated with inadequate levels of thiamine (vitamin B1) in their eggs. However, mortality driven by thiamine deficiency (commonly referred to as early mortality syndrome [EMS]) is not the only significant cause of low lake trout survival at early life stages. In this study, we sought to better understand the combined effects of variable levels of thiamine and fatty acids in lake trout eggs on prehatch, posthatch, and swim-up-stage mortality. We sampled the eggs of 29 lake trout females from southwestern Lake Michigan. The concentrations of free thiamine and its vitamers (e.g., thiamine monophosphate [TMP] and thiamine pyrophosphate [TPP]) as well as fatty acid profiles were determined in sampled eggs. Fertilized eggs and embryos were monitored through the advanced swim-up stage (1,000 degree-days). Three distinct periods of mortality were identified: prehatch (0-400 degree-days), immediately posthatch (401-600 degree-days), and swim-up (601-1,000 degree-days). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed (1) that cis-7-hexadecenoic acid in both neutral lipids (NL) and phospholipids (PL) correlated with prehatch mortality, (2) that docosapentaenoic acid in PL and docosahexaenoic acid in NL correlated with posthatch mortality, and (3) that total lipids, TPP, and palmitoleic acid in NL, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid in PL correlated with the frequency of EMS. These results indicate the complexity of early life stage mortality in lake trout and suggest that inadequate levels of key fatty acids in eggs, along with variable thiamine content, contribute to the low survival of lake trout progeny in Lake Michigan.",M1
20218499,"Nutrient and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in American alligator <e>eggs</e> and their associations with clutch viability.Since the early 1900s, the lakes of the Ocklawaha basin in central Florida have experienced ecological degradation due to anthropogenic development. One species affected by this degradation is the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis, which has suffered from poor clutch viability and embryo mortality. Although some studies indicate that organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) may be involved, OCPs do not account for all of the variation seen in hatch rates. Indeed, nutrition and non-OCP contaminants have been associated with developmental problems in fish and birds. Our study evaluated embryo mortality in alligators at reference and OCP-contaminated sites as a function of exposure to OCPs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), along with egg nutrients (Zn, Se, and vitamins A, E, and B1). The four-pronged study consisted of a case-control cohort study, an expanded field study, a topical egg treatment thiamine amelioration experiment, and a topical egg treatment thiamine antagonist experiment. The results from the two field studies suggested that the total thiamine levels in the eggs were positively associated with clutch viability and negatively associated with the lipid content and certain OCPs measured in egg yolks. In addition, PCBs, PAHs, Zn, Se, and vitamins A and E were not found to be associated with the observed clutch viability defects. The thiamine levels in the eggs explained 38% of the variation in clutch survival in the case-control cohort study and 27% in the expanded field study. The topical egg treatment experiments were successful in elevating the thiamine concentrations in the albumin but not the yolk. No significant differences were noted among treatment groups in either egg treatment experiment with respect to clutch survival. In summary, thiamine egg concentrations explain some of the variation in the clutch viability of free-ranging alligators, but the cause-effect relationships are still unclear.",M1
20209438,"Oscillatory Ca2+ dynamics and cell cycle resumption at fertilization in mammals: a modelling approach.Fertilization in mammals is accompanied by Ca(2+) oscillations in the <e>egg</e> cytoplasm, leading to exit from meiosis and entry into the first embryonic cell cycle. The signal transduction pathway linking these Ca(2+) changes to cell-cycle related kinases has not yet been fully elucidated, but involves activation of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we develop a computational model to investigate the mechanism by which cell cycle resumption can be sensitive to the temporal pattern of Ca(2+) increases. Using a model for CaMKII activation that reproduces the frequency sensitivity of this kinase, simulations confirm that Ca(2+) spikes are accompanied by in phase variations in the level of CaMKII activity and suggest that in most mammalian species, Ca(2+) spikes are well suited to maximize CaMKII activation. The full model assumes that CaMKII brings about a decrease in the level of cyclinB-cdk1 by two pathways, only one of which is CSF-dependent. Parameters are selected to account for the experimental observations where mouse eggs were artificially activated by different Ca(2+) stimulatory protocols. The model is then used in the context of 'assisted oocyte activation (AOA)' to investigate why the best rates of successful activation are obtained when eggs are submitted to two applications of Ca(2+) ionophores.",M1
20209432,"Identification of the sperm motility-initiating substance in the newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster, and its possible relationship with the acrosome reaction during internal fertilization.Motility initiation is a key event during internal fertilization of female-stored sperm, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In internally fertilizing urodeles, quiescent sperm initiate motility on the surface of the <e>egg</e>-jelly, a thick extracellular matrix that accumulates around the egg in oviduct. By immunizing mice with egg-jelly extracts, we successfully generated an alpha34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which neutralized sperm motility-initiating activity in the egg-jelly of the newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster, in a dose-dependent manner. The alpha34 mAb recognized an unglycosylated 34 kDa protein in the outermost of the six layers that comprise egg-jelly. Under nonreducing conditions, immunoblotting with alpha34 mAb produced many bands in addition to the 34 kDa protein, suggesting that the 34 kDa protein associates not only with the jelly matrix itself, but also with additional substances present in the matrix. Our current results are compatible with the supposed features of sperm motility-initiating substance (SMIS), indicating that the 34 kDa protein itself, or a complex consisting of the 34 kDa protein and some other molecules, is the SMIS in C. pyrrhogaster. Immunofluorescence staining further indicated that SMIS was distributed in a dot-like pattern in the outermost jelly layer and was fully covered with acrosome reaction-inducing substance (ARIS). Immunocytochemical and scanning electron microscopic examinations of the outermost jelly layer strongly suggests that the 34 kDa protein localized in granules (2 microm) and that ARIS was distributed covering the granules and in the sheet-like structure above the granules. These data suggest that the initiation of sperm motility is mediated by the acrosome reaction.",M1
20195564,"Occurrence and variation of <e>egg</e> cannibalism in brown trout Salmo trutta.Egg cannibalism is a common behavior among fish taxa and is largely studied in species with parental care. Heterocannibalism and filial cannibalism have both been reported in salmonids, a group with no extended parental care, but the topic remained somewhat under-documented, especially in brown trout (Salmo trutta). In the present study, 83 spawning events were recorded finely with high-resolution video in three natural populations. Redd covering dynamics by females and the timing of cannibalism showed that eggs were vulnerable mainly during the first 120 s after spawning. Cannibalism occurred in 25% of spawnings and was principally perpetrated by peripherals but the sires also cannibalized their brood, especially after multiple mating. The probability of cannibalism increased with operational sex ratio but did not correlate with the date in spawning season. Occurrence of cannibalism also differed between populations. Our results suggest that such behavior is frequent and may reduce the fitness of parents. Its evolutionary implications for population ecology should be considered, since it appeared to be controlled by environmental and spatial factors.",M1
20190277,"Drf1-dependent kinase interacts with Claspin through a conserved protein motif.The Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase (DDK) is required for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Another protein, Claspin, mediates the activation of a cellular checkpoint response to stalled replication forks and is also a regulator of replication. In this study, we found that DDK phosphorylates Claspin in vitro and forms a nuclear complex containing Cdc7, Drf1, and Claspin in Xenopus <e>egg</e> extracts. In addition, purified Claspin and DDK are capable of a direct in vitro interaction. We identified a conserved binding site on Claspin required for its interaction with DDK. This site corresponds to the first of two sequence repeats in the Chk1-binding domain of Claspin. Furthermore, we have established that two amino acids in this motif, Asp(861) and Gln(866), are essential for the interaction between Claspin and DDK. We found that mutant forms of Claspin incapable of interacting with DDK are still able to associate with and activate Chk1 in response to DNA replication blockages. However, Claspin-depleted egg extracts that have been reconstituted with these mutants of Claspin undergo DNA replication more slowly. These findings suggest that the interaction of DDK with Claspin mediates a checkpoint-independent function of Claspin related to DNA replication.",M1
20180700,"A key ecological trait drove the evolution of biparental care and monogamy in an amphibian.Linking specific ecological factors to the evolution of parental care pattern and mating system is a difficult task of key importance. We provide evidence from comparative analyses that an ecological factor (breeding pool size) is associated with the evolution of parental care across all frogs. We further show that the most intensive form of parental care (trophic <e>egg</e> feeding) evolved in concert with the use of small pools for tadpole deposition and that egg feeding was associated with the evolution of biparental care. Previous research on two Peruvian poison frogs (Ranitomeya imitator and Ranitomeya variabilis) revealed similar life histories, with the exception of breeding pool size. This key ecological difference led to divergence in parental care patterns and mating systems. We present ecological field experiments that demonstrate that biparental care is essential to tadpole survival in small (but not large) pools. Field observations demonstrate social monogamy in R. imitator, the species that uses small pools. Molecular analyses demonstrate genetic monogamy in R. imitator, the first example of genetic monogamy in an amphibian. In total, this evidence constitutes the most complete documentation to date that a single ecological factor drove the evolution of biparental care and genetic and social monogamy in an animal.",M1
20175680,"Senescence of maternal effects: aging influences <e>egg</e> quality and rearing capacities of a long-lived bird.Senescence could depress prenatal and postnatal capacities of mothers to invest in offspring. Longitudinal observations on the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) revealed a quadratic effect of female age on fledgling production and cohort differences in rate of reproductive decline. By swapping clutches between females of different ages, we tested whether reproductive senescence is due to decline in egg quality or capacity to care. As laying mothers aged, egg size, ulna length of 5-day-old chicks, and ulna growth of second chicks up to age 30 days declined, and as rearing mothers aged, ulna growth and cellular mediated immune response of second chicks diminished. Oddly, senescent females (&gt;11 years) produced more fledglings when rearing offspring of middle-aged females (8-11 years) than when rearing offspring of senescent or young females. Thus, senescence reduced egg quality and rearing capacities, and reproductive success of senescent mothers depended on prenatal effects associated with the age of the laying mother. Reproductive senescence of boobies may involve constraints on resources allocated to reproduction as well as adaptive adjustment of provision and care according to offspring value, implying that negative effects of senescence on offspring survival can be ameliorated by plasticity in postlaying or postnatal care.",M1
20151713,"Adsorption of <e>egg</e> phosphatidylcholine to an air/water and triolein/water bubble interface: use of the 2-dimensional phase rule to estimate the surface composition of a phospholipid/triolein/water surface as a function of surface pressure.Phospholipid monolayers play a critical role in the structure and stabilization of biological interfaces, including all membranes, the alveoli of the lungs, fat droplets in adipose tissue, and lipoproteins. The behavior of phospholipids in bilayers and at an air-water interface is well understood. However, the study of phospholipids at oil-water interfaces is limited due to technical challenges. In this study, egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) was deposited from small unilamellar vesicles onto a bubble of either air or triolein (TO) formed in a low-salt buffer. The surface tension (gamma) was measured using a drop tensiometer. We observed that EPC binds irreversibly to both interfaces and at equilibrium exerts approximately 12 and 15 mN/m of pressure (Pi) at an air and TO interface, respectively. After EPC was bound to the interface, the unbound EPC was washed out of the cuvette, and the surface was compressed to study the Pi/area relationship. To determine the surface concentration (Gamma), which cannot be measured directly, compression isotherms from a Langmuir trough and drop tensiometer were compared. The air-water interfaces had identical characteristics using both techniques; thus, Gamma on the bubble can be determined by overlaying the two isotherms. Both TO and EPC are surface-active, so in a mixed TO/EPC monolayer, both molecules will be exposed to water. Since TO is less surface-active than EPC, as Pi increases, the TO is progressively ejected. To understand the Pi/area isotherm of EPC on a TO bubble, a variety of TO-EPC mixtures were spread at the air-water interface. The isotherms show an abrupt break in the curve caused by the ejection of TO from the monolayer into a new bulk phase. By overlaying the compression isotherm above the ejection point with a TO bubble compression isotherm, Gamma can be estimated. This allows determination of Gamma of EPC on a TO bubble as a function of Pi.",M1

20140711,"Whole effluent assessment of industrial wastewater for determination of bat compliance: Part 1: Paper manufacturing industry.BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: The applicability of the Whole Effluent Assessment concept for the proof of compliance with the  best available techniques  has been analysed with paper mill wastewater from Germany by considering its persistency (P), potentially bio-accumulative substances (B) and toxicity (T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty wastewater samples from 13 paper mills using different types of cellulose fibres as raw materials have been tested in DIN or ISO standardised bioassays: the algae, daphnia, luminescent bacteria, duckweed (Lemna), fish-<e>egg</e> and umu tests with lowest ineffective dilution (LID) as test result. The potentially bio-accumulative substances (PBS) were determined by solid-phase microextraction and referred to the reference compound 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene. Usually, a primary chemical-physical treatment of the wastewater was followed by a single or multi-stage biological treatment. One indirectly discharged wastewater sample was pre-treated biologically in the Zahn-Wellens test before determining its ecotoxicity. RESULTS: No toxicity or genotoxicity at all was detected in the acute daphnia and fish egg as well as the umu assay. In the luminescent bacteria test, moderate toxicity (up to LIDlb=6) was observed. Wastewater of four paper mills demonstrated elevated or high algae toxicity (up to LIDA=128), which was in line with the results of the Lemna test, which mostly was less sensitive than the algae test (up to LIDDW=8). One indirectly discharged wastewater sample was biodegraded in the Zahn-Wellens test by 96% and was not toxic after this treatment. Low levels of PBS have been detected (median 3.27 mmol L(-1)). The colouration of the wastewater samples in the visible band did not correlate with algae toxicity and thus is not considered as its primary origin. Further analysis with a partial wastewater stream from thermomechanically produced groundwood pulp (TMP) revealed no algae or luminescent bacteria toxicity after pre-treatment of the sample in the Zahn-Wellens test (chemical oxygen demand elimination 85% in 7 days). Thus, the algae toxicity of the respective paper mill cannot be explained with the TMP partial stream; presumably other raw materials such as biocides might be the source of algae toxicity. DISCUSSION: Comparative data from wastewater surveillance of authorities confirmed the range of ecotoxicity observed in the study. Wastewater from paper mills generally has no or a moderate ecotoxicity (median LID 1 and 2) while the maximum LID values, especially for the algae and daphnia tests, are considerably elevated (LIDA up to 128, LIDD up to 48). CONCLUSIONS: Wastewater from paper mills generally is low to moderately ecotoxic to aquatic organisms in acute toxicity tests. Some samples show effects in the chronic algae growth inhibition test which cannot be explained exclusively with colouration of the samples. The origin of elevated algae ecotoxicity could not be determined. In the algae test, often flat dose-response relationships and growth promotion at higher dilution factors have been observed, indicating that several effects are overlapping. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: At least one bioassay should be included in routine wastewater control of paper mills because the paper manufacturing industry is among the most water consuming. Although the algae test was the most sensitive test, it might not be the most appropriate test because of the complex relationship of colouration and inhibition and the smooth dose-effect relationship or even promotion of algae growth often observed. The Lemna test would be a suitable method which also detects inhibitors of photosynthesis and is not disturbed by wastewater colouration.",M1

The egg body and operculum have an exochorion formed by irregular juxtaposed polygonal cells; these cells are without sculpture and the majority of them are hexagonal in shape. The five instars of T. dimidiatacan be distinguished from each other by characteristics of the pre, meso and metanotum. The number of setiferous tubercles increases progressively among instars. The sulcus stridulatorium of 1st instar nymphs is amorphous, showing median parallel grooves; from the 2nd instar on the sulcus is, progressively, elongate, deep and posteriorly pointed with stretched parallel grooves. All instars have a trichobothrium on the apical 1/3 of segment II of the antenna. The opening of the Brindley's gland is on the mesopleura. Fifth instar nymphs have an apical ctenidium on the ventral surface of the fore tibia. Dorsal glabrous patches are found on the lateral 1/3 of abdomen. Bright oval patches are found on the ventral median line of the abdomen, from segment IV-VI; 1st instar nymphs lack these patches. Abdominal dorsal plates are present from the 1st-5th instars; the 1st instar also contains a rectangular plate in segment IX.

The efficiency of replication depends on a cold treatment of Drosophila embryos before the extract preparation and a formation of nuclei facilitated by the addition of membrane fractions to the extracts. In vitro DNA replication is ORC and CDC6 dependent, as a removal of these proteins from the extracts abolishes DNA replication. The N-terminal part of Orc1 protein, which is important for non-replicative functions of ORC, is dispensable for the replication in vitro. We also show that the conserved ATP ase motif of CDC6 is crucial for the replication. Our studies indicate that a Drosophila cell free system proves to be an extremely useful tool for a functional dissection of the processes and factors involved in DNA replication in metazoans.",M1
20126309,"Electroporation facilitates introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into schistosome <e>eggs</e>.BACKGROUND: The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, because the transgene might be propagated and amplified by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched from treated eggs, and because eggs can be readily obtained from experimentally infected rodents. METHODS/FINDINGS: We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. First, eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation. Cy3-signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Second, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase activity was detected three hours later, whereas luciferase was not evident in eggs soaked in the mRNA. Third, schistosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs, indicating the presence of transgenes in larval schistosomes that had been either soaked or electroporated. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis determined that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. In addition, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of approximately 20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D). CONCLUSIONS: Square wave electroporation facilitates introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg. Electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.",M1
20105071,"<e>Eggs</e> under pressure: components of water potential of chameleon eggs during incubation.Water exchange of squamate eggs is driven by the difference between the water potentials of eggs and of their nest environment. While osmotic potential is generally assumed to dominate the net water potential of eggs, resistance of the eggshell to stretching also affects egg water potential. We therefore determined osmotic potentials and pressure potentials (mechanical pressure) of eggs of the veiled chameleon Chamaeleo calyptratus over the course of incubation. Because embryos are diapausing gastrulae when eggs are laid and diapause persists several months, the water potential of eggs can be evaluated before it is influenced by the developing embryo. Water uptake during the first 2 wk of incubation was rapid as a result of the large difference between the total water potential of the egg (-848 kPa) and that of its incubation substrate. After about 2 wk, water potential of the egg stabilized at -460 kPa. By day 80 of incubation, the developing embryo and allantois affected water exchange of the egg. The allantoic fluid was initially very dilute, but its osmotic potential decreased to about -200 kPa by the end of incubation. Pressure potential of the egg averaged 25 kPa, with no systematic trend during incubation. The pressure potential exerted by the eggshell reduced the difference between the water potential of the egg and the water potential of the environment, that is, the ability of eggs to take up water. At the time of oviposition, this effect was relatively small, producing a 4%-6% reduction in water potential difference. Once the yolk osmotic potential stabilized, however, the reduction was 12% or more. This observation means that the dynamics of water uptake by squamate eggs cannot be fully understood without consideration of the pressure that is exerted on the contents of eggs by their shells.",M1

20097207,"Cooperation and the evolution of anisogamy.In the lights of the concept of cooperation wholes, I discuss why the differentiation of sperm and ova can occur with a mathematical model. Most of Parker's explanations for anisogamy are not completely proper, because it is proved that sperm competition is neither sufficient nor necessary for anisogamy and cooperation to deal with fertilization risks is the real key to understand the evolution of anisogamy. According to the computer simulation results, the transport of gametes between different individuals, risks of the transport, the consequent inequality of sperm and <e>eggs</e> and competition among different individuals were the main causes of gamete differentiation. But these factors have different roles and effects. The transport risk is the main reason for individuals of different mating types to cooperate and differentiate into sperm and egg producers. The transported gametes have an advantage to evolve into sperm to seek for a larger gamete number over the fixed gametes, because they suffer more risks as they can encounter the same fixed gamete and less sibling competition as they can be dispersed better. Gamete competition among different individuals just causes the transported gametes to become as small as possible if they have already become smaller beyond a critical state. In the final discussion, I further put the evolution of anisogamy into a broader background of levels of selection and of the evolution of cooperation, the most important existential mode of matters that makes life as life.",M1

This raises the question of a link between these two groups of proteins at the oocyte membrane. We propose two hypotheses to explain why the absence of one of these proteins from the oocyte membrane results in the same phenotype. The first hypothesis envisages different levels of control by these molecules of the common induced signaling cascade. The second relies on the known involvement of these molecules in the overall organization of the plasma membrane. Their disappearance could thus prevent sperm-egg fusion either by disruption of the signaling cascade and/or by an important disorganization of the oocyte membrane. In this review, describing their structural and functional characteristics, and using published results on the oocyte, we try to analyze how these two protein families could interact.",M1
20079516,"Absorption and biotransformation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers DE-71 and DE-79 in chicken (Gallus gallus), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) <e>eggs</e>.We recently reported that air cell administration of penta-brominated diphenyl ether (penta-BDE; DE-71) evokes biochemical and immunologic effects in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos at very low doses, and impairs pipping (i.e., stage immediately prior to hatching) and hatching success at 1.8mugg(-1) egg (actual dose absorbed) in American kestrels (Falco sparverius). In the present study, absorption of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners was measured following air cell administration of a penta-BDE mixture (11.1mug DE-71g(-1) egg) or an octa-brominated diphenyl ether mixture (octa-BDE; DE-79; 15.4mug DE-79g(-1) egg). Uptake of PBDE congeners was measured at 24h post-injection, midway through incubation, and at pipping in chicken, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and American kestrel egg contents, and at the end of incubation in black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) egg contents. Absorption of penta-BDE and octa-BDE from the air cell into egg contents occurred throughout incubation; at pipping, up to 29.6% of penta-BDE was absorbed, but only 1.40-6.48% of octa-BDE was absorbed. Higher brominated congeners appeared to be absorbed more slowly than lower brominated congeners, and uptake rate was inversely proportional to the log K(ow) of predominant BDE congeners. Six congeners or co-eluting pairs of congeners were detected in penta-BDE-treated eggs that were not found in the dosing solution suggesting debromination in the developing embryo, extraembryonic membranes, and possibly even in the air cell membrane. This study demonstrates the importance of determining the fraction of xenobiotic absorbed into the egg following air cell administration for estimation of the lowest-observed-effect level.",M1

In order to carry out the work, four groups were formed, each containing 20 engorged females, which were immersed for 5 min in different concentrations of thymol (1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%) and a control group (water + dimethylsulfoxide). The following biological parameters were observed: initial weight (mg); egg mass weight (mg); pre-oviposition, oviposition, and survival period (days); hatching percentage (%HP); egg production (%EPI) and nutritional (%NI) indexes; and the percentage of control (%C). In order to perform the second stage, thymol solutions were sprayed on the egg masses (50 mg). The parameters' initial weight and pre-oviposition did not present significant differences (p&gt;0.05) among the groups. Thymol caused alterations in the parameters egg mass weight, oviposition, survival period, hatching percentage, EPI, and NI, presenting highly significant differences between the treatments and the control group (p&lt;0.01). The control efficacy was higher than 95% in all the treatments, reaching 99% in the concentration of 2.0%. In the ovicide test, the hatching percentage was not affected in any of the treatments (p&gt;0.05). In the second experiment, when eggs were treated directly, the thymol did not affect significantly this parameter. These results demonstrate that thymol showed deleterious action on most of the analyzed parameters; thus, it is possible to conclude that, in laboratorial conditions, this monoterpene was efficient in the control of engorged females of R.

There was a significant effect of storage period on egg weight loss during storage (P&lt;0.001), a significant increase occurring in weight loss for each additional week the eggs were stored, and this weight loss amounted to more than 3% for the eggs stored for 35 d. Storage period affected egg weight loss during incubation (P&lt;0.05). An increase in egg weight loss during incubation occurred, increasing from 21 d of storage and amounting to more than 10% for the eggs stored for 35 d. Storage period had a significant effect on hatchability (P&lt;0.05). Storage of red-legged partridge eggs up to 28 d does not affect subsequent hatchability, but a significant decline in hatchability occurs when the eggs are stored for 35 d. This research confirms, as occurs in other Alectoris species, that long-term storage of red-legged partridge eggs (to 28 d) does not have a negative effect on hatchability. These findings will be useful in terms of successful hatchery management, mainly by allowing prolonged storage of eggs while gathering a sufficient-sized batch to be incubated, and shipment of long shelf life hatching eggs at game farms while losing little hatchability until further incubation.",M1
20074328,"Functional genomics tool: gene silencing in Ixodes scapularis <e>eggs</e> and nymphs by electroporated dsRNA.BACKGROUND: Ticks are blood-sucking arthropods responsible for transmitting a wide variety of disease-causing agents, and constitute important public health threats globally. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent in the eastern and central U.S. RNAi is a mechanism by which gene-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers degradation of homologous mRNA transcripts. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for effectively suppressing gene expression in the egg and nymphal stages of I. scapularis by electroporation. RESULTS: The genes encoding the putative Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cytoplasmic Cystatin, Syntaxin-5, beta-Actin and Calreticulin were targeted by delivering the dsRNA encoding the specific gene coding regions in the unfed nymphs. Silencing was measured using real time qRT-PCR. Electroporation as a mode of dsRNA delivery appears to be substantially efficient and less traumatic to the tick than dsRNA microinjection in the unfed nymphs. Using Cy3-labeled dsRNA to monitor the movement, electroporated dsRNA entered the nymphs and spread to salivary glands and other tissues. The significant disruption of beta-actin and cytoplasmic Cystatin transcripts in tick eggs demonstrate the applicability of this technique. The PLA2, cytoplasmic Cystatin, Syntaxin-5, beta-Actin and Calreticulin genes were also significantly silenced, suggesting that this method has the potential to introduce dsRNA in eggs and unfed nymphs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that electroporation can be used as a simple dsRNA delivery tool in assessing the functional role of tick genes in the vector-host interactions. This technique represents a novel approach for specific gene suppression in immature stages of ticks.",M1
20069834,"Stimulatory and suppressive effects of novaluron on the Colorado potato beetle reproduction.The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is one of the most damaging insect pests of potato, Solanum tuberosum L. Novaluron is a relatively new benzoylphenyl urea insect growth regulator with good activity against this pest. Earlier studies revealed that feeding on potato foliage treated with novaluron induces reversible <e>egg</e> hatch inhibition in adult Colorado potato beetles. We investigated whether novaluron effects depend on physiological state of the beetles at the time of exposure. The following four treatments were created: young beetles unmated at the beginning of the experiment and feeding on potato foliage treated with novaluron, young beetles unmated at the beginning of the experiment and feeding on untreated foliage, older beetles mated at the beginning of the experiment and feeding on foliage treated with novaluron, and older beetles mated at the beginning of the experiment and feeding on untreated foliage. The beetles were exposed to the respective treatments for 5 d. After that, both young and older beetles feeding on novaluron-treated leaves were switched onto untreated leaves and monitored for another 5 d to test their ability to recover. Young beetles unmated at the beginning of the experiment produced more eggs after feeding on the treated foliage, possibly indicating the presence of a pesticide-induced homeostatic modulation. No such effect was observed in the older beetles. Regardless of beetle physiological state at the beginning of the experiment, eggs produced on treated foliage did not hatch. The beetles eventually resumed laying viable eggs after being switched onto untreated foliage, with the recovery being delayed by approximately 24 h in young beetles compared with older beetles. Our results corroborate that novaluron reduces fertility of treated adults.",M1
20059971,"Vitellogenin C-terminal fragments participate in fertilization as <e>egg</e>-coat binding partners of sperm trypsin-like proteases in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi.Sperm trypsin-like proteases are known to play important roles in fertilization, but their detailed functions are still unknown. We previously explored the binding partners of sperm trypsin-like proteases, HrProacrosin and HrSpermosin, in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, and we isolated several candidate proteins on the vitelline coat. We found that some of these proteins are identical to the C-terminal coding region (CT) and von Willebrand factor type D (vWF-D) domain of vitellogenin. We also found that CT on the vitelline coat disappears after fertilization. Vitellogenin is a large lipid transfer protein that is enzymatically processed during vitellogenesis. Although the processed domains including phosvitin and lipovitellin are known to function as yolk nutrient proteins, the roles of the CT and vWF-D domain remain elusive. Our results showed that the CT and vWF-D domain of vitellogenin are processed and attached to the vitelline coat, which in turn participate in fertilization as the binding partners of sperm proteases.",M1
20050771,"Demography and life history of the <e>egg</e> parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae, on two moths Anagasta kuehniella and Plodia interpunctella in the laboratory.The egg parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is the most important and widely distributed species of Trichogramma in Iran. It attacks eggs of several lepidopterous pests, and is a major biological control agent. Rearing parasitoids is necessary for experimental work, and, potentially, for mass release in the field. Selecting a suitable host is critical for developing a successful rearing method. If other conditions are the same, the rate of population increase will be a suitable indicator of parasitoid performance on different hosts. However, conclusions based on a single generation can be misleading because of the learning ability of parasitoids. Life history parameters of T. brassicae were studied on two hosts easily reared in the laboratory, Anagasta kuehniella Zeller, and Plodia interpunctella Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). All the experiments were carried out at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, 65+/-10% RH, and 16:8 L:D photoperiod. Eight parameters including gross and net reproductive rates (GRR and R(0) respectively), intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), finite rate of population increase (lambda), intrinsic birth and death rates (b and d respectively), cohort generation time (T), and doubling time (DT) were compared between two hosts for two generations. All parameters showed a highly significant difference (alpha = 0.01) between hosts. GRR, R(0), r(m), lambda, and b were higher, while d, T, and DT were lower in Anagasta than Plodia. The intrinsic rate of natural increase was 0.2912 and 0.2145 female/female/day and net replacement rate was 45.51 and 19.26 female/female/generation in Anagasta and Plodia respectively. Differences between generations were significant except for r(m), lambda, and d. The net replacement rate was 28.56 and 39 in the 1(st) and 2(nd) generations respectively. These results showed that A. kuehniella was a better host than P. interpunctella. Higher reproduction occurred in the second generation that may be due to increased adaptation to experimental conditions.",M1
20050770,"<e>Egg</e> formation in lepidoptera.Reproductive biology in the Twentieth Century produced comprehensive descriptions of the mechanisms of egg formation in most of the major orders of insects. While many general principles of ovarian development and physiology emerged, every order turned out to have a set of its own special motifs. Discovery of the lepidopteran motifs is summarized in this essay. The emphasis is on developmental mechanisms, beginning with the early growth and differentiation of female germ cells and ending, after many turns in morphogenesis, physiology and biosynthesis, with eggs that are filled with yolk and encased in chorions. Examples of uniquely lepidopteran traits include the cellular composition of ovarian follicles, the number of tubular ovarioles in which they mature, the functions of cell-to-cell junctional complexes in their maturation, their use of glycosaminoglycans to maintain intercellular patency during vitellogenesis, the role of proton and calcium pumps in their ion physiology, a separate postvitellogenic period of water and inorganic ion uptake, and the fine structure and protein composition of their chorions. Discovery of this combination of idiosyncracies was based on advances in the general concepts and techniques of cell and molecular biology and on insights borrowed from studies on other insects. The lepidopteran ovary in turn has contributed much to the understanding of egg formation in insects generally.",M1
20049994,"Analysis of Schistosoma mansoni population structure using total fecal <e>egg</e> sampling.Many parasite populations are difficult to sample because they are not uniformly distributed between several host species and are often not easily collected from the living host, thereby limiting sample size and possibly distorting the representation of the population. For the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, we investigated the use of eggs, in aggregate, from the stools of infected individuals as a simple and representative sample. Previously, we demonstrated that microsatellite allele frequencies can be accurately estimated from pooled DNA of cloned S. mansoni adults. Here, we show that genotyping of parasite populations from reproductively isolated laboratory strains can be used to identify these specific populations based on characteristic patterns of allele frequencies, as observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and automated sequencer analysis of fluorescently labeled PCR products. Microsatellites used to genotype aggregates of eggs collected from stools of infected individuals produced results consistent with the geographic distribution of the samples. Preferential amplification of smaller alleles, and stutter PCR products, had negligible effect on measurement of genetic differentiation. Direct analysis of total stool eggs can be an important approach to questions of population genetics for this parasite by increasing the sample size to thousands per infected individual and by reducing bias.",M1
20048340,"CDC6 interaction with ATR regulates activation of a replication checkpoint in higher eukaryotic cells.CDC6, a replication licensing protein, is partially exported to the cytoplasm in human cells through phosphorylation by Cdk during S phase, but a significant proportion remains in the nucleus. We report here that human CDC6 physically interacts with ATR, a crucial checkpoint kinase, in a manner that is stimulated by phosphorylation by Cdk. CDC6 silencing by siRNAs affected ATR-dependent inhibition of mitotic entry elicited by modest replication stress. Whereas a Cdk-phosphorylation-mimicking CDC6 mutant could rescue the checkpoint defect by CDC6 silencing, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant could not. Furthermore, we found that the CDC6-ATR interaction is conserved in Xenopus. We show that the presence of Xenopus CDC6 during S phase is essential for Xenopus ATR to bind to chromatin in response to replication inhibition. In addition, when human CDC6 amino acid fragment 180-220, which can bind to both human and Xenopus ATR, was added to Xenopus <e>egg</e> extracts after assembly of the pre-replication complex, Xenopus Chk1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced without lowering replication, probably through a sequestration of CDC6-mediated ATR-chromatin interaction. Thus, CDC6 might regulate replication-checkpoint activation through the interaction with ATR in higher eukaryotic cells.",M1
20043751,"Induction of type 2 responses by schistosome worms during prepatent infection.During natural schistosome infection, the induction of T helper type 2 (Th2) responses has been ascribed to parasite <e>eggs</e>, because exposure of the host to this life-cycle stage elicits a polarized Th2 response to egg antigens. In the present study, we show that schistosome worms also elicit systemic, antigen-specific type 2 responses during prepatent infection, before egg deposition begins. CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin (IL)-4 were induced by both male and female worms during single-sex infections, demonstrating that this response is independent of exposure to eggs. The Th2 response was accompanied by production of immunoglobulin E and the sensitization of circulating basophils to produce additional IL-4 in response to schistosome antigens. Together, our data show that schistosome worms establish an immunologic milieu where CD4(+) T cells and basophils are both primed to produce IL-4 before eggs are laid, suggesting that worms play a role in establishment of the Th2 response that is critical for host survival and parasite transmission.",M1
20040373,"GATA transcription, translation and regulation in Haemaphysalis longicornis tick: analysis of the cDNA and an essential role for vitellogenesis.Blood feeding tightly regulates the reproductive cycles of ticks. Vitellogenesis and nutritional signaling are key events in the tick reproductive cycle. Here we report the identification of a GATA factor that is synthesized after a blood meal and acts as a transcriptional activator of vitellogenin (Vg), and the identification of an S6 kinase that is a transcription regulator of the amino acid signaling pathway. Tick GATA mRNA accumulated in the midgut prior to blood feeding. However, translation of GATA was activated by blood feeding because the GATA protein dramatically increased in the fat body of engorged females. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of S6 kinase and GATA factor revealed the involvements of S6 kinase in GATA activation and resulted in a significant inhibition of the major yolk protein vitellogenin in engorged ticks and effectively disrupting <e>egg</e> development after a blood meal. These results indicate that the GATA factor, a specific transcriptional activator of Vg gene, represents an important molecule for the regulation of tick vitellogenesis and reproduction.",M1
20036059,"Viability of the nematophagous fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia after passage through the gastrointestinal tract of horses.The predatory capacity of the nematophagous fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia (isolate VC4) embedded in sodium alginate pellets after passage through the gastrointestinal tract of horses was assessed in vitro against Oxyuris equi <e>eggs</e>. Twelve previously dewormed crossbred mares, average weight of 362.5kg (+/-21) were used in the experiment. Each animal of the treated group received an oral dose (100g) of sodium alginate pellets containing P. chlamydosporia mycelial mass. The control group received pellets without fungus. Faecal samples from fungus-treated and control groups were collected at intervals of 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72h after pellet administration and placed in Petri dishes containing 2% water-agar. One thousand eggs of O. equi were plated in Petri dishes of both treated and control groups, with six replicates, and incubated in oven, 25 degrees C, in the dark, for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, one hundred eggs were removed from each Petri dish and classified according to the following parameters: type 1, physiological and biochemical effect without morphological damage to eggshell, with hyphae adhered to the shell; type 2, lytic effect with morphological change in the eggshell and embryo without hyphal penetration, and type 3, lytic effect with morphological change in the eggshell and embryo, with hyphal penetration and internal egg colonization. Chlamydospore production was observed in Petri dishes of the treated group. The isolate VC4 remained viable after passing through the gastrointestinal tract of horses and maintained the ovicidal activity against O. equi eggs when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.01) after each collection interval: 29.1% (8h), 28.2% (12h), 31.1% (24h), 27.4% (36h), 30.9% (48h) and 28.4% (72h). The results suggest that P. chlamydosporia could be used as an effective biological control agent of O. equi eggs in natural conditions.",M1
20035434,"Spring vegetation phenology is a robust predictor of breeding date across broad landscapes: a multi-site approach using the Corsican blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).The regulation of reproductive schedules is an important determinant of avian breeding success. In heterogeneous environments, the optimal breeding period may fluctuate temporally across habitats, often on a spatial scale much shorter than the average dispersal range of individuals. The synchronisation of reproductive events with the most favourable period at a given site therefore involves the integration of a suite of fine-scale environmental signals which contain information about future breeding conditions. In this study, we monitored clutch initiation date of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in a wide range of environmental conditions (altitude, temperature regimes, habitat type) in Corsica (France) to understand the role of spring temperature and leafing phenology on the precise fine-tuning of <e>egg</e> laying on a local scale. Timing of breeding in blue tits was strongly correlated with phenology of the dominant vegetation (r(2) = 0.87). In contrast, spring temperature was not as robust a predictor of the timing of breeding, because a large part of the residual variation in egg-laying date was accounted by differences (ca. 2 weeks) in the development of the vegetation between habitat types (evergreen vs. deciduous oak forests). Female blue tits therefore appear to use the environmental variable (vegetation phenology) that is most closely linked to the future production of insect prey in order to accurately time laying over the entire spatio-temporal breeding landscape.",M1
20031237,"Biomarker candidate discovery in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) continuously exposed to North Sea produced water from <e>egg</e> to fry.In this study Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to different levels of North Sea produced water (PW) and 17beta-oestradiol (E(2)), a natural oestrogen, from egg to fry stage (90 days). By comparing changes in protein expression following E(2) exposure to changes induced by PW treatment, we were able to compare the induced changes by PW to the mode of action of oestrogens. Changes in the proteome in response to exposure in whole cod fry (approximately 80 days post-hatching, dph) were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis and identified by MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometry, using a newly developed cod EST database and the NCBI database. Many of the protein changes occurred at low levels (0.01% and 0.1% PW) of exposure, indicating putative biological responses at lower levels than previously detected. Using discriminant analysis, we identified a set of protein changes that may be useful as biomarker candidates of produced water (PW) and oestradiol exposure in Atlantic cod fry. The biomarker candidates discovered in this study may, following validation, prove effective as diagnostic tools in monitoring exposure and effects of discharges from the petroleum industry offshore, aiding future environmental risk analysis and risk management.",M1
20027470,"Comparative descriptions of <e>eggs</e> from three species of Rhodnius (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae).The authors describe and compare the morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of eggs from the three most recent described species of the genus Rhodnius Stål, 1859, which have not previously been studied. These species are Rhodnius colombiensis (Mejia, Galvão &amp; Jurberg 1999), Rhodnius milesi (Carcavallo, Rocha, Galvão &amp; Jurberg 2001) and Rhodnius stali (Lent, Jurberg &amp; Galvão 1993). The results revealed that there are similarities in the exochorial architecture of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy; these include the predominance of hexagonal cells that are common to all Rhodnius species and variable degrees of lateral flattening, which is common not only to species of this genus, but also to the Rhodniini tribe. Differences in overall colour, the presence of a collar in R. milesi, a longitudinal bevel in R. stali and the precise length of R. colombiensis can be useful distinguishing features. As a result of this study, the key for egg identification proposed by Barata in 1981 can be updated.",M1
20027172,"Effects of cyanobacterial biomass on avian reproduction: a Japanese quail model.OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed at evaluation of the response of Japanese quails to cyanobacterial biomass administered in feed using biochemical profiles and parameters of reproduction. DESIGN: Effects of cyanobacterial biomass were studied according to the OECD 206 Guideline on Avian Reproduction Toxicity. A total of 16 control and 16 experimental pairs (32 males and 32 females) were analyzed. The chronic exposure of parent birds lasted eight weeks with the daily sum of 61.62 microg MCs including 26.54 microg MC-RR, 7.62 microg MC-YR and 27.39 microg MC-LR. RESULTS: There was no mortality both in control and cyanobacterial-biomass-exposed adults during the present study. Nor did the birds show any clinical signs of intoxication. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was increased about three-fold in exposed birds. No other biochemical parameters were showing significant differences. A total of 824 and 821 <e>eggs</e> were laid by control and exposed birds, respectively, during the eight-week study period. Eggs laid by cyanobacterial-biomass-exposed hens had lower weight than in controls (11.99+/-1.13g and 12.40+/-1.27g, respectively; p&lt;0.01). Egg viability, hatchability, and the effect of hatching in control and experimental birds were 79.6+/-9.3 and 86.8+/-8.2% (p&lt;0.05), 83.2+/-12.6 and 90.1+/-9.3%, and 65.2+/-17.7 and 77.7+/-15.2% (p&lt;0.05), respectively. There was also a statistically significant difference in the number of 14-day old survivors per hen per day in control and experimental birds (0.38+/-0.02 and 0.43+/-0.01 %, respectively). CONCLUSION: The lower weight of eggs produced by exposed parental hens was not reflected in their biological quality. On the contrary, reproductive parameters in cyanobacterial-biomass-exposed birds were better than in the control group. It might be hypothesized that compounds of hormonal activity could be present in the complex cyanobacterial biomass. However, further research into this issue is necessary.",M1
20021759,"Functional response of Gonatocerus ashmeadi and the  new association  parasitoid G. tuberculifemur attacking <e>eggs</e> of Homalodisca vitripennis.The functional response of two egg parasitoids, Gonatocerus tuberculifemur (Ogloblin) and G. ashmeadi Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), to varying densities of Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) eggs was studied in the laboratory. G. tuberculifemur showed a type II functional response where parasitism increased at a decreasing rate as host egg density increased from 5 to 40, reaching an asymptote of an upper limit of 9.3 host eggs within the 1-h exposure period. The instantaneous attack rate and handling time as estimated by the random predator equation were 2.28/h and 0.10 h, respectively. In contrast, G. ashmeadi showed a type I functional response where the number of hosts attacked followed a constant linear increase regardless of host density to an upper limit of 11.5 host eggs within the 1-h exposure period. Female G. ashmeadi parasitized on average 4.3 and 3.5 more eggs per hour when presented with 10 and 20 H. vitripennis eggs, respectively, compared with G. tuberculifemur. When 5 or 40 H. vitripennis eggs were offered, there was no significant difference in parasitism rates between parasitoid species. Percentage of female offspring was significantly higher (5%) for G. ashmeadi compared with G. tuberculifemur. Under the experimental conditions used in these evaluations, results suggest that G. tuberculifemur is an inferior parasitoid to G. ashmeadi.",M1

20016486,"Coots use hatch order to learn to recognize and reject conspecific brood parasitic chicks.Avian brood parasites and their hosts provide model systems for investigating links between recognition, learning, and their fitness consequences. One major evolutionary puzzle has continued to capture the attention of naturalists for centuries: why do hosts of brood parasites generally fail to recognize parasitic offspring after they have hatched from the <e>egg</e>, even when the host and parasitic chicks differ to almost comic degrees? One prominent theory to explain this pattern proposes that the costs of mistakenly learning to recognize the wrong offspring make recognition maladaptive. Here we show that American coots, Fulica americana, can recognize and reject parasitic chicks in their brood by using learned cues, despite the fact that the hosts and the brood parasites are of the same species. A series of chick cross-fostering experiments confirm that coots use first-hatched chicks in a brood as referents to learn to recognize their own chicks and then discriminate against later-hatched parasitic chicks in the same brood. When experimentally provided with the wrong reference chicks, coots can be induced to discriminate against their own offspring, confirming that the learning errors proposed by theory can exist. However, learning based on hatching order is reliable in naturally parasitized coot nests because host eggs hatch predictably ahead of parasite eggs. Conversely, a lack of reliable information may help to explain why the evolution of chick recognition is not more common in hosts of most interspecific brood parasites.",M1
20007178,"Sex allocation in yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) depends on nutritional constraints on production of large last <e>eggs</e>.Male and female offspring can differ in their susceptibility to pre-natal (e.g. egg quality) and post-natal (e.g. sib-sib competition) conditions, and parents can therefore increase their individual fitness by adjusting these maternal effects according to offspring sex. In birds, egg mass and laying/hatching order are the main determinants of offspring viability, but these effects can act differently on each sex. In a previous study, relatively large last-laid (c-)eggs of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) were more likely to carry a female embryo. This suggests compensatory allocation of maternal resources to daughters from c-eggs, which suffer reduced viability. In the present study, we supplemented yellow-legged gulls with food during the laying period to experimentally test whether their nutritional conditions were responsible for the observed covariation between c-egg sex and mass. As predicted, food supplementation enhanced female c-eggs' mass more than that of male c-eggs. Thus, this experiment indicates that mothers strategically allocated their resources to c-eggs, possibly in order to compensate for the larger susceptibility of daughters to hatching (and laying) order. The results also suggested that mothers decided on resource allocation depending on the sex of already ovulated c-eggs, rather than ovulating ova of either sex depending on food availability.",M1

The salting-out procedure employed a relatively low (30%) concentration of saturated ammonium sulfate. This was a critical step that separated Zrps from approximately 89% of other plasma proteins. Subsequently, three subtypes of Zrp (Zrp-alpha, -beta and -gamma) were purified by four (Zrps-alpha, -gamma) or five (Zrp-beta) serial column chromatography steps. The Intact masses of purified Zrp-alpha, -beta and -gamma were 290 kDa, 134 kDa, and 73 kDa, while masses estimated by SDS-PAGE were 78 kDa, 54 kDa, and 47 kDa, respectively. Antibodies were prepared against Zrp-beta and -gamma and utilized to develop specific immunoassays. The plasma levels of Zrp-beta and -gamma In reproductive female cod were estimated to be 591.42+/-77.59 microg/ml and 768.71+/-120.39 microg/ml, respectively. Thus, practical procedures for the separation of Zrp subtypes were developed in cod, which resulted in the development of subtype-specific Zrp immunoassays in this species; a similar method could be adopted for the separation, detection, and quantification of Zrp subtypes in other teleosts.",M1
19962722,"Inter- and intraclutch variation in <e>egg</e> mercury levels in marine bird species from the Canadian Arctic.Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that has been of increasing concern in the Canadian Arctic. We measured total Hg in eggs of three marine birds (Arctic terns Sterna paradisaea, common eiders Somateria mollissima borealis, long-tailed ducks Clangula hyemalis) that breed in the Canadian Arctic, to compare Hg laying order effects from the same clutch and to examine Hg among species. Early-laid eggs of all three species had 24-48% higher Hg concentrations than late laid eggs. Arctic terns had approximately twice the concentration of Hg in their eggs as the two duck species, and Hg in eider eggs from the High Arctic was higher than Hg in eggs from the Low Arctic. Higher Hg in tern eggs was consistent with this species occupying a higher trophic position in marine food webs, as indicated by stable nitrogen isotope (delta(15)N) values. The egg-laying sequence may need to be considered for Hg biomonitoring studies where small samples sizes are planned, and early eggs may be preferable for such studies since early eggs may be more representative of potential maximum levels of Hg in the marine food webs.",M1
19949841,"Anti-aphrodisiac compounds of male butterflies increase the risk of <e>egg</e> parasitoid attack by inducing plant synomone production.During mating in many butterfly species, males transfer spermatophores that contain anti-aphrodisiacs to females that repel conspecific males. For example, males of the large cabbage white, Pieris brassicae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), transfer the anti-aphrodisiac, benzyl cyanide (BC) to females. Accessory reproductive gland (ARG) secretion of a mated female P. brassicae that is deposited with an egg clutch contains traces of BC, inducing Brussels sprouts plants (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera) to arrest certain Trichogramma egg parasitoids. Here, we assessed whether deposition of one egg at a time by the closely related small cabbage white, Pieris rapae, induced B. oleracea var. gemmifera to arrest Trichogramma wasps, and whether this plant synomone is triggered by substances originating from male P. rapae seminal fluid. We showed that plants induced by singly laid eggs of P. rapae arrest T. brassicae wasps three days after butterfly egg deposition. Elicitor activity was present in ARG secretion of mated female butterflies, whereas the secretion of virgin females was inactive. Pieris rapae used a mixture of methyl salicylate (MeSA) and indole as an anti-aphrodisiac. We detected traces of both anti-aphrodisiacal compounds in the ARG secretion of mated female P. rapae, whereas indole was lacking in the secretion of virgin female P. rapae. When applied onto the leaf, indole induced changes in the foliar chemistry that arrested T. brassicae wasps. This study shows that compounds of male seminal fluid incur possible fitness costs for Pieris butterflies by indirectly promoting egg parasitoid attack.",M1
19946828,"Influence of maternal corticosterone treatment on incubation length of <e>eggs</e> laid by Japanese quail hens selected for divergent adrenocortical stress responsiveness.1. Previous studies have shown that more yolk corticosterone is found in the eggs of random bred Japanese quail hens implanted with corticosterone during egg formation; both unstressed and stressed quail hens selected for exaggerated (high stress) rather than reduced (low stress) plasma corticosterone response to brief restraint deposit more corticosterone into their egg yolks. The length of egg incubation is also known to be shorter in eggs laid by high than low stress hens. 2. Here we investigated the interactive effects of quail stress line (low vs. high stress) with maternal corticosterone treatment (empty implant controls vs. corticosterone-implants) during egg formation on length of egg incubation. 3. Mean (+/-SEM) length of egg incubation for high stress control eggs (3973 +/- 04 h) was similarly shorter (by about 4.5 h) than that found for low stress control eggs (3928 +/- 02 h). In addition, on average, the incubation length of eggs laid by corticosterone-implanted hens (3929 +/- 05 h) was nearly 3 h shorter than that found for eggs laid by control hens (3958 +/- 02 h) regardless of stress line. 4. Line x hen-implant treatment effects on mean (+/-SEM) length of egg incubation partitioned in rank order as follows: low stress control (3978 +/- 05 h) &gt; low stress corticosterone-implant (3959 +/- 07 h) &gt; high stress control (3938 +/- 03 h) &gt; high stress corticosterone-implant (3912 +/- 04 h). 5. Our original contention that selection for exaggerated adrenocortical responsiveness is associated with a reduction in the length of egg incubation was supported. Because maternal stress-induced elevations of yolk B are known to occur, the present findings of further shortenings of the hatching times of eggs of corticosterone-treated hens of both stress lines are also important to the poultry industry because they warn producers that unless stress in hens during egg formation is minimised, abbreviated egg incubation periods may result beyond the effects that a hen's genetic predisposition to adrenocortical stress responsiveness has on the length of egg incubation.",M1
19946823,"Effect of different dietary levels of mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) leaves and spice supplementation on productive performance, <e>egg</e> quality, lipid metabolism and metabolic profiles in laying hens.In order to study the influence of white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) leaves on productive performance, egg quality, lipids metabolism and metabolic profiles, 180 Hy-line laying hens were randomly distributed to 6 dietary treatments each contained 6 replicates of 5 individually caged hens during the period from 50 to 60 weeks of age. 2. Three isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets were formulated to contain 0, 50 and 100 g/kg of sun-dried mangrove leaves. Each diet was fed with or without supplementation of 2 g of cardamom, cumin, hot and black pepper mixture (1:1:1:1)/kg diet. 3. Mangrove leaves at either 50 or 100 g/kg adversely affect laying rate, egg mass and FCR, whilst increasing water intake and water to feed ratio. Mangrove leaves had no significant effect on dry matter, protein, lipid, cholesterol and ash content of liver, or on dry matter, protein and ash of yolk. 4. Plasma total protein, total lipids; liver enzymes AST and ALT and mortality rate were not significantly affected by mangrove leaves. On the other hand, yolk lipid, yolk cholesterol and plasma cholesterol significantly decreased, while yolk colour significantly increased with inclusion of 50 or 100 g/kg mangrove leaves, and Haugh unit score significantly increased with 100 g/kg mangrove leaves. 5. Spice mixture significantly increased egg weight by 2.2%. Yolk lipid content significantly decreased by 2.6%, while yolk colour and Haugh unit significantly increased with inclusion of spice mixtures. 6. In conclusion, mangrove leaves at 50 g/kg may be included in the laying hen diets as a means of decreasing lipid and cholesterol in yolk and plasma cholesterol and increasing yolk colour. Spice mixture at 2 g of cardamom, cumin, hot and black pepper mixture (1:1:1:1)/kg diet increased laying rate, egg mass, Haugh unit score and yolk colour while decreasing yolk lipids.",M1
19944106,"Variation in the hatching behaviour of Nematodirus battus: polymorphic bet hedging?Previous work on the transmission dynamics of Nematodirus battus, an important nematode parasite of farmed ruminants in temperate regions, suggests that it operates a bet-hedging strategy. Hatching of cold-sensitised <e>eggs</e> is concentrated in spring, while alternative hatching of non-cold-sensitised eggs in autumn mitigates the risk of poor conditions for hatching in spring or host absence during peak larval availability. Isolates from Scotland showed much less propensity to hatch without chilling than the previously characterised isolate from southern England. Nematodirus battus eggs from a hill farm in Scotland showed intermediate proportions of non-chilled hatching, perhaps related to unpredictability of climate at higher altitudes. Geographic polymorphism in larval behaviour appears to be present in the form of differing chilling requirements for egg hatching. Since bet-hedging through trait diversification is a plausible and demonstrated strategy for coping with environmental unpredictability, it is a likely target for adaptation to climate change. Predictions of disease epidemiology in a changing climate should incorporate parasite adaptation, but further theoretical and empirical characterisations of likely evolutionary responses are needed before this is possible for the most economically important systems.",M1
19941380,"Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of Stephanitis pyrioides (Heteroptera, Tingidae): a novel role for the pseudospermathecae.At mating, female insects generally receive and store sperm in specific organs of their reproductive tract called spermathecae. Some Heteroptera, such as Cimicomorpha, lack a true spermatheca; some have receptacles of novel formation where sperm cells can transit or be stored. In Tingidae, there are two sac-like diverticula, the  pseudospermathecae,  each at the base of a lateral oviduct, which previously were considered to function as spermathecae. However, this role has never been documented, either by ultrastructural studies or by observations of sperm transit in the female reproductive tract. In this article, we investigate the morphology and the ultrastructure of the female reproductive apparatus in the economically important tingid species Stephanitis pyrioides, focusing our attention on the functional role of the pseudospermathecae in an evolutionary perspective. Each ovary consists of seven telotrophic meroistic ovarioles, the long pedicels of which enlarge into a bulb-like structure near the terminal oocyte. The ovarioles flow into two long lateral oviducts, which join to form a very short common oviduct. Basally, each lateral oviduct is connected through a short duct to one of two pseudospermathecae. The ultrastructure of the ectodermal epithelium of the pseudospermathecae is dramatically different in sexually immature or mated females. In virgin females, cells delimit a very irregular lumen, filled with a moderately electron-dense granular material. The large nucleus adapts to their irregular shape, which can have long projections in some regions and be flattened in others. After mating, epithelial cells generally elongate and display an apical layer of microvilli extending beneath the cuticle, often containing mitochondria. In the lumen of the pseudospermathecae there is a dense brownish secretion. No sperm cells were ever found inside this organ. After mating, sperm move upward along the lateral oviducts and the ovarioles, accumulating in the bulb-like structure of the pedicels, and proceeding into the distal region between the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte and the ovariole wall. The <e>egg</e>, most likely fertilized in the bulb-like region of the ovariole, moves through the lateral oviduct, entirely enters the pseudospermatheca and is smeared with its secretion just before oviposition. We exclude a function of sperm storage for the pseudospermathecae, and instead suggest a novel role for these organs as reproductive accessory glands.",M1
19941287,"Surfing the wave, cycle, life history, and genes/proteins expressed by testicular germ cells. Part 3: developmental changes in spermatid flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet and interaction of sperm with the zona pellucida and <e>egg</e> plasma membrane.Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.",M1
19940016,"Fast microtubule dynamics in meiotic spindles measured by single molecule imaging: evidence that the spindle environment does not stabilize microtubules.Metaphase spindles are steady-state ensembles of microtubules that turn over rapidly and slide poleward in some systems. Since the discovery of dynamic instability in the mid-1980s, models for spindle morphogenesis have proposed that microtubules are stabilized by the spindle environment. We used single molecule imaging to measure tubulin turnover in spindles, and nonspindle assemblies, in Xenopus laevis <e>egg</e> extracts. We observed many events where tubulin molecules spend only a few seconds in polymer and thus are difficult to reconcile with standard models of polymerization dynamics. Our data can be quantitatively explained by a simple, phenomenological model-with only one adjustable parameter-in which the growing and shrinking of microtubule ends is approximated as a biased random walk. Microtubule turnover kinetics did not vary with position in the spindle and were the same in spindles and nonspindle ensembles nucleated by Tetrahymena pellicles. These results argue that the high density of microtubules in spindles compared with bulk cytoplasm is caused by local enhancement of nucleation and not by local stabilization. It follows that the key to understanding spindle morphogenesis will be to elucidate how nucleation is spatially controlled.",M1
19937968,"Effect of pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone mimic, on <e>egg</e> hatch, nymph development, adult emergence and reproduction of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama.BACKGROUND: The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is a vector of bacteria presumably responsible for huanglongbing (HLB) disease in citrus. In this laboratory study, an investigation was made of the activity of pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone mimic, on ACP eggs, nymphs and adults to evaluate its potential as a biorational insecticide for inclusion in an integrated pest management (IPM) program for ACP.RESULTS: Irrespective of egg age, timing or method of treatment, a significantly lower percentage of eggs (5-29%) hatched after exposure to 64 and 128 microg mL(-1) of pyriproxyfen. Only 0-36% of early instars (first, second and third) and 25-74% of late instars (fourth and fifth) survived to adults following exposure to 16, 32 and 64 microg mL(-1) of pyriproxyfen. However, 15-20% of adults that emerged following treatment as late instars exhibited morphological abnormalities. Furthermore, pyriproxyfen adversely affected reproduction (fecundity and fertility) of adults that emerged from treated fifth instars or that were treated topically with 0.04 microg as adults.CONCLUSIONS: Application of pyriproxyfen at 64 microg mL(-1) resulted in greater inhibition of egg hatch and suppression of adult emergence compared with lower rates. Pyriproxyfen also markedly reduced female fecundity and egg viability for adults that were exposed either as fifth instars or as newly emerged adults. The ovicidal, larvicidal and reproductive effects against ACP suggest that pyriproxyfen is suitable for integration into an IPM program for ACP.",M1

Three diets were used: A) decapsulated cysts of Artemia, B) commercial dry fish food, and C) a mix diet of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The initial larval density was 100 organisms in each 40 L aquarium. With diet A, larvae reached a maximum weight of 3.80 g, a total length of 6.3 cm, and a height of 5.8 cm; with diet B: 2.80 g, 4.81 cm, and 4.79 cm, and with diet C: 3.00 g, 5.15 cm, and 5.10 cm, respectively. Significant differences were observed between diet A, and diet B and C, but no significantly differences were observed between diets B and C. Fecundity varied from 234 to 1,082 eggs in 20 and 50 g females, respectively. Egg survival ranged from 87.4% up to 100%, and larvae survival (80 larvae/40 L aquarium) from 50% to 66.3% using diet B and A, respectively. Live food was better for growing fish than the commercial balanced food diet. Fecundity and survival are important factors in planning a good production of angelfish.",M1
19924974,"PCBs and DDE in tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) <e>eggs</e> and nestlings from an estuarine PCB superfund site, New Bedford Harbor, MA, U.S.A.While breeding tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) have been used as biomonitors for freshwater sites, we report the first use of this species to assess contaminant bioaccumulation from estuarine breeding grounds into these aerial insectivores. Eggs and nestlings were collected from nest boxes in a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated estuary, the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site (NBH, Massachusetts, USA), and a reference salt marsh, Fox Hill (FH, Jamestown, Rhode Island, USA). Sediments, eggs, and nestlings were compared on a ng g(-1) wet weight basis for total PCBs and DDE (1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene), metabolite of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane). NBH samples contained high concentrations of PCBs compared to FH for sediment (36,500 and 0.2), eggs (11,200 and 323), and nestlings (16,800 and 26). PCB homologue patterns linked tree swallow contamination to NBH sediment. NBH samples were also contaminated with DDE compared to FH for sediment (207 and 0.9) and nestlings (235 and 30) but not for eggs (526 and 488), suggesting both NBH and nonbreeding ground sources for DDE. The relationships between sediment and tree swallow egg and nestling PCBs were similar to those reported for freshwater sites. Like some highly contaminated freshwater sites, NBH PCB bioaccumulation had little apparent effect on reproductive success.",M1
19917513,"Occurrence of organochlorine compounds in Euphausia superba and unhatched <e>eggs</e> of Pygoscelis genus penguins from Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica) and estimation of biomagnification factors.Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides are compounds that do not occur naturally in the environment and are not easily degraded by chemical or microbiological action. In the present work, those compounds were analysed in unhatched penguin eggs and whole krill collected in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica in the austral summers of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. The compounds found in higher levels (in a wet weight basis) were, in most of the egg samples, the PCBs (2.53-78.7 ng g(-1)), DDTs (2.07-38.0 ng g(-1)) and HCB (4.99-39.1 ng g(-1)) and after Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, the occurrence seemed to be species-specific for the Pygoscelis genus. In all of the cases, the levels found were not higher than the ones in Arctic birds in a similar trophic level. The krill samples analysis allowed estimating the biomagnification factors (which resulted in up to 363 for HCB, one order of magnitude higher than DDTs and chlordanes and two orders of magnitude higher than the other groups) of the compounds found in eggs, whose only source of contamination is the female-offspring transfer.",M1
19917288,"A comparative proteomic study of the undeveloped and developed Schistosoma mansoni <e>egg</e> and its contents: the miracidium, hatch fluid and secretions.The schistosome egg is the key agent responsible both for transmission of the parasite from human to molluscan host, and is the primary cause of pathogenesis in schistosomiasis. Characterisation of its proteome is a crucial step in understanding the egg's interactions with the mammalian host. We devised a scheme to isolate undeveloped eggs from mature schistosome eggs by Percoll gradient and then fractionate the mature egg into miracidial, hatch fluid and secreted protein preparations. The soluble proteins contained within the five preparations were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and their spot patterns compared by image analysis. Large numbers of representative spots were then excised and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry to obtain identities. In this way, the principal components of each sub-proteome were established. Chaperones were the most abundant category, with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) dominant in the undeveloped egg and Schistosoma mansoni protein 40 (Smp-40) in the miracidium. Cytoskeletal proteins were expressed at similar levels in the undeveloped egg and miracidium, with tubulins the most abundant. The proteins of energy metabolism reflected the change from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism as the miracidium developed. None of the above categories was abundant in the hatch fluid but this peri-miracidial compartment was highly enriched for defence proteins such as thioredoxin. Hatch fluid also contained several host proteins and schistosome proteins of unknown function, highlighting its distinct nature and potentially its role. The egg secretions could not be compared with the other preparations due to their unique composition featuring the previously characterised IL-4-inducing principal of S. mansoni eggs (IPSE), Omega-1, egg secreted protein 15 (ESP15), a micro-exon gene 2 (MEG-2) protein and two members of the recently described MEG-3 family. This last preparation contains the subset of egg proteins that probably enables eggs to escape from host tissues and may also initiate granuloma formation, emphasising the need to establish fully the roles of its components in schistosome biology.",M1
19903972,"The effects of oviposition time on <e>egg</e> weight loss during storage and incubation, fertility, and hatchability of broiler hatching eggs.An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of time of oviposition, generally representing different positions in the normal egg laying sequence, on egg weight loss during storage and incubation, and on fertility and fertile hatchability of eggs from mid-lay (42 wk) and old (67 wk) broiler breeders. A total of 1,800 eggs (900 eggs per flock age) were collected during 10 consecutive days between 0830 and 1830 h each day. The eggs were individually marked, weighed, and stored for 1 to 10 d before incubation was initiated. Egg weight remained less from collection through incubation for eggs from the mid-lay flock than those from the old flock. Fresh weight of early laid (first-in-sequence; C1) eggs was significantly greater than that for the middle-of-day laid (mid-sequence; Cs), or late-in-day laid eggs (terminal-in-sequence; Ct). Percentage of egg weight loss during storage did not differ significantly between the mid-lay and old flocks but percentage of weight loss in the mid-lay flock was greater during incubation. Egg weight loss during storage of eggs from the middle-of-day laid (Cs) eggs was significantly greater than for early laid (C1) eggs, which was greater than for the late-in-day laid (Ct) eggs. Fertility was significantly decreased due to flock age but not due to oviposition time. Fertile hatchability was also significantly decreased due to flock age, but there was no significant effect of oviposition time. Early and late dead embryos increased with flock age, but there was no significant effect of oviposition time. It was concluded that there was no effect of oviposition time on fertility or fertile hatchability even though there were significant differences in egg weight and egg weight loss during storage due to oviposition time.",M1
19903965,"Influence of prestorage incubation on embryonic development, hatchability, and chick quality.<e>Egg</e> storage longer than 7 d is associated with a delay in hatch time and a decline in hatchability and chick quality. Prestorage incubation is suggested as a method to reduce the negative effects of prolonged storage times by altering the developmental stage of the embryo, but earlier research has shown that prestorage incubation can both be detrimental and beneficial for hatchability. The reason for these ambiguous results is not clear and the effect of prestorage incubation on chick quality is not studied extensively. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in developmental stage of embryos during prestorage incubation and the effect of prestorage incubation on hatchability and chick quality. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment I, eggs were stored for 3, 5, 8, or 12 d. In experiment II, eggs were stored for 5 or 11 d. Half of the eggs was stored immediately at 16 to 18 degrees C and the other half was exposed to prestorage incubation for 6 h in experiment I and for 4.5 h in experiment II. According to the classification table of Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (EG), embryonic development was advanced by prestorage incubation from developmental stage EG11.67 to developmental stage EG13.26 in experiment I (P = 0.02) and from developmental stage EG9.22 to developmental stage EG12.63 in experiment II (P &lt; 0.0001). In experiment I, prestorage incubation reduced hatchability of set eggs from 59.3 to 51.5% when storage time was 12 d but did not reduce hatchability when storage time was 3, 5, or 8 d (interaction P = 0.02). Prestorage incubation increased chick length (P = 0.004). In experiment II, prestorage incubation increased hatchability of fertile eggs from 80.6 to 85.9% when storage time was 11 d but did not increase hatchability when storage time was 5 d (interaction P = 0.0009). Prestorage incubation increased percentage of second grade chicks (P = 0.0007). It seems that storage time, embryonic development at egg collection, and prestorage incubation duration determine the effect of prestorage incubation on hatchability and chick quality.",M1
19899960,"High hydrostatic pressure at low temperature as a quarantine treatment to improve the quality of fruits.Application of high hydrostatic pressure has been proposed as an alternative quarantine process for the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae), one of the most important insects infesting mangoes, citrus fruits, and other fruits in Mexico and other Latin American countries. The present study was performed to determine the effect of high pressure treatments at 0 degrees C on the survivorship of <e>eggs</e> and larvae of this pest. The effect of time and pressure level at near-freezing temperatures on the egg hatch and survival of larvae is discussed. Eggs and larvae were pressurized at 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 MPa for 0, 5, 10, or 20 min at 0 degrees C. Hatch was recorded for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-day-old pressurized eggs. For pressurized larvae (first, second, and third instars), percentage of survival was registered. Further, third instars were studied for their ability to pupate and develop to adulthood. The results showed that eggs had higher resistance than larvae to pressure. Larvae were not able to resist pressure treatments at 75 MPa for 20 min at 0 degrees C. Treatments at 150 MPa for 20 min at 0 degrees C were needed to destroy all eggs and larvae of A. ludens, indicating that this process might be useful as a quarantine method for infested fruits. However, more studies involving combination of high hydrostatic pressure at low temperature with precooling treatments are needed in order to decrease the pressure level to avoid fruit damage.",M1

Twenty-five female turtles were sampled and a total of 250 eggs were collected during the  arribada  event of the 2005-2006 season. Considering the nesting season, the maternal transfer of lead (Pb) via egg-laying, in terms of metal burden in whole body, was 0.5%. Pb concentrations (in dry weight) in blood (0.95+/-0.18microgg(-1)) and egg samples (yolk, 0.80+/-0.10microg g(-1); albumen, 1.08+/-0.20microg g(-1); eggshell, 1.05+/-0.20microg g(-1)) were comparable or even lower than those found in other sea turtles. The isotope ratios ((206)Pb/(207)Pb and (206)Pb/(208)Pb) in blood (1.183+/-0.0006 and 2.452+/-0.0006, respectively) were comparable to that of natural Pb-bearing bedrock in Mexico (1.188+/-0.005 and 2.455+/-0.008, respectively).

There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that this process involves the interactions of specific oolemmal receptors and their ligands on sperm that bear similarities to mechanisms used in phagocytosis by macrophages. We have postulated that the egg may act as a 'non-professional phagocyte' during its association with the spermatozoon. This review surveys those events, provides an historical context, and creates a paradigm for further investigation.",M1

Three adults of G. dimorphus (2 males and 1 female) were maintained under laboratory conditions until oviposition, which occurred within long strings commonly referred to as <e>egg</e> strings. Larvae have a cylindrical body, annulated and divided into 2 sections, plus an anterior preseptum and a posterior postseptum. Three concentric rings with 6 spines each surround the proboscis. The proboscis is retractile, dorsoventrally flattened, with 1 pair of forceps-like projections on its distal-most portion. On the surface of each projection, 3 pairs of aculeiforms spines are aligned and lean toward the proboscis opening. One large spine is present on the posterior portion of the postseptum. Papillae were not observed. Gordius dimorphus larvae are similar to previous light microscope descriptions. This is the first record of G. dimorphus in Brazil.",M1
19892829,"The Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex functions in resection-based DNA end joining in Xenopus laevis.The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential to maintain genomic integrity. In higher eukaryotes, DNA DSBs are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but DNA ends can also be joined by an alternative error-prone mechanism termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In MMEJ, the repair of DNA breaks is mediated by annealing at regions of microhomology and is always associated with deletions at the break site. In budding yeast, the Mre11/Rad5/Xrs2 complex has been demonstrated to play a role in both classical NHEJ and MMEJ, but the involvement of the analogous MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex in end joining in higher eukaryotes is less certain. Here we demonstrate that in Xenopus laevis <e>egg</e> extracts, the MRN complex is not required for classical DNA-PK-dependent NHEJ. However, the XMRN complex is necessary for resection-based end joining of mismatched DNA ends. This XMRN-dependent end joining process is independent of the core NHEJ components Ku70 and DNA-PK, occurs with delayed kinetics relative to classical NHEJ and brings about repair at sites of microhomology. These data indicate a role for the X. laevis MRN complex in MMEJ.",M1
19889467,"Influence of bicarbonate and humic acid on effects of chronic waterborne lead exposure to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).Historically, the USEPA has only considered water hardness when establishing acute and chronic water quality criteria (WQC) for lead (Pb) in freshwater. Yet, recent evidence suggests that hardness may not be protective during chronic Pb exposure and that other factors (e.g., dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity) influence toxicity. In fact, we have recently shown that Ca(2+) (as CaSO(4)) does not protect against Pb accumulation in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) during chronic exposures whereas DOC as humic acid (HA) clearly does. To more clearly define the water chemistry parameters mediating chronic Pb toxicity we carried out 300 d exposures to study the influence of DOC and alkalinity on Pb accumulation and toxicity to fathead minnows at 2 different Pb concentrations (170 and 580 nM (35 and 120 microg/L)). Alkalinity was adjusted by addition of 500 microM NaHCO(3) and DOC by addition of 4 mg/L HA. Fish were collected at 4, 30, 150 and 300 d of exposure to measure growth and Pb accumulation. Breeding assays (21 d) were performed at the end of these exposures to assess reproductive and larval behavioral endpoints. To determine whether effects were acute or chronic, switched breeding exposures were performed in which control breeders were transferred to either high or low Pb conditions and Pb-exposed breeders transferred to tap water without Pb. Mortality and growth effects were observed primarily in the high Pb treatments and within the first 10 d of exposure. Strong protection against Pb accumulation was afforded by increased DOC at both Pb concentrations. Increased alkalinity also appeared to moderately reduce Pb accumulation although not to the level of statistical significance. Tissue distribution of Pb was analyzed at 300 d and was found to accumulate mostly in bone, gill, intestine and kidney. Unexpectedly, high Pb reduced total reproductive output and increased average <e>egg</e> mass in the HCO(3)(-) and DOC treatments but not in the control water (+Pb) treatments. No statistically significant differences in egg hatchability or egg Pb accumulation were observed. Results from switched exposures suggest that embryo Pb accumulation arose from acute exposure to embryos rather than parental transfer. Finally, prey capture assays revealed potential Pb-induced motor/behavioral impairment in 10-d-old F1 larvae exposed to high Pb in all water treatments.",M1
19886456,"Host preference and development of Leptoglossus zonatus (Hemiptera: Coreidae) on satsuma mandarin.Leptoglossus zonatus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Coreidae) has recently emerged as a key pest of satsuma mandarin, Citrus unshiu Marcovitch, and other fruit crops in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Studies were conducted under laboratory conditions (25 +/- 2 degrees C, 50 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 14:10 [L:D] h) to investigate host preference and suitability of satsuma fruit as host for this pest. Three separate multiple choice experiments were performed to compare attraction of L. zonatus nymphs and adults to the fruit of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L.; satsuma mandarin; peach, Prunus persica (L.) Batsch; kumquat (Fortunella spp.); and lemon, Citrus limon (L.) Burm. F. Results of all three experiments clearly showed that tomato was the most preferred by both the nymphs and adults, with satsuma a distant second. Attraction to tomato and satsuma fruit was not due mainly to color but mediated by host volatile semiochemicals (kairomones). Developmental experiments with L. zonatus on satsuma fruit suggest that it is a suitable host that can maintain modest to high populations of the pest. Approximately 39 <e>eggs</e> were deposited per female on satsuma fruit with a hatch rate of 98%. Total developmental time from egg through the fifth nymphal stage was approximately = 50 d. High survivorship was recorded for all stages and ranged from 100% for the fourth instars to approximately = 89.1% for second instars. Cumulative survivorship from eggs through the fifth stage was 75.6%. Sex ratio (female:male) of emerged adults was 1:1.03, and female longevity (approximately = 73 d) was significantly greater than male longevity (57 d). Other aspects of the developmental biology of L. zonatus on satsuma are described, and the results are discussed in relation to the field ecology of the pest.",M1

There were no relationships between lay order and the volume of other brain regions, or chick growth metrics. In adult birds, RA volume is related to song repertoire size, and may affect mate attraction ability. Lay order effects on adult song nuclei should be examined further.",M1
19883621,"The effects of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum on different stages of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae).The control of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) vector is often based on the application of chemical residual insecticide. However, this strategy has not been effective. The continuing search for an appropriate vector control may include the use of biological control. This study evaluates the effects of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum on Lutzomyia longipalpis. Five concentrations of the fungus were utilized, 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(8) conidia/ml, accompanied by controls. The unhatched <e>eggs</e>, larvae and dead adults previously exposed to fungi were sown to reisolate the fungi and analysis of parameters of growth. The fungus was subsequently identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. M. anisopliae var. acridum reduced egg hatching by 40%. The mortality of infected larvae was significant. The longevity of infected adults was lower than that of negative controls. The effects of fungal infection on the hatching of eggs laid by infected females were also significant. With respect to fungal growth parameters post-infection, only vegetative growth was not significantly higher than that of the fungi before infection. The revalidation of the identification of the reisolated fungus was confirmed post-passage only from adult insects. In terms of larvae mortality and the fecundity of infected females, the results were significant, proving that the main vector species of VL is susceptible to infection by this entomopathogenic fungus in the adult stage.",M1
19878294,"Evolutionary and experimental change in <e>egg</e> volume, heterochrony of larval body and juvenile rudiment, and evolutionary reversibility in pluteus form.Heterochronic developmental plasticity of the juvenile rudiment and larval body of sea urchin larvae occurs in response to supply of food. Evolutionary increase in egg size can also be associated with earlier development of the juvenile rudiment. We examined effects of egg volume of feeding larvae on this heterochrony and other changes in larval form. (1) Evolutionary and experimental enlargements of egg volume did not accelerate formation of the rudiment relative to the larval body. Development of the larval body and juvenile rudiment was compared for the echinoids Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (with an egg of 78-82 microm) and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (with an egg of 150-160 microm diameter). Development of both larval body and rudiment were accelerated in S. droebachiensis relative to S. purpuratus but with greater acceleration of the larval body, so that the rudiment of S. droebachiensis was initiated at a later larval stage even though at an earlier age. Also, experimentally doubling the egg volume of S. purpuratus did not accelerate development of the juvenile rudiment relative to the larval body. (2) Both species exhibited similar plasticity in timing of rudiment development in response to food supplies. (3) Doubling egg volume of S. purpuratus produced a larval form more similar to that of S. droebachiensis. This result mirrors previous experiments in which larvae from half embryos of S. droebachiensis were more similar to larvae of S. purpuratus. Many of the effects of egg volume on larval form are similar against either species' genetic background and are thus evolutionarily reversible effects on larval form.",M1

Their offspring developed 14 h (4%) faster on the poor food than offspring of well-fed parents. However, they were slightly smaller as adults. Thus, the effects of parental diet on offspring performance under malnutrition apparently involve both adaptive plasticity and maladaptive effects of parental stress.",M1
19873833,"Evaluation of sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate as a potential catfish <e>egg</e> disinfectant.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate (SCP) in improving the hatching success of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus when used as a prophylactic chemotherapeutant during egg incubation. In the first experiment, the efficacy of SCP was evaluated in 379-L aluminum incubation troughs similar to those used in commercial hatcheries. Egg masses treated daily with 254 mg of SCP/L of water had significantly higher mean hatching success than untreated controls, and a pathogen-inhibiting effect was also evident (i.e., no gross infection was observed on the treated egg masses). In the second experiment, the hatching success of egg masses treated daily with 254 mg/L was compared with that of egg masses treated daily with hydrogen peroxide (70 mg/L). The effects of both treatments on the pH, dissolved oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the trough were also examined. Both SCP and hydrogen peroxide significantly improved hatching success. Unlike in the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, water pH increased during the treatment with SCP; however, no negative effects on hatching success were observed. The results of this research suggest that SCP acts similarly to hydrogen peroxide in improving channel catfish hatching success and warrants further research to determine whether it could be a practical and effective alternative for managing catfish egg infections in commercial hatcheries.",M1

The columns provided good separation of proteins in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 0.25 M NaCl, and there was a linear relationship between the retention times and the logarithmic values of the molecular weights with a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.978-0.992. The columns were used in analyzing the subunit structures of the rhamnose-binding lectins CSL1, CSL2, and CSL3, isolated from chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) eggs. Although the lectins, which are a group of carbohydrate-binding and hydrophobic proteins, behaved anomalously in SEC with conventional matrices, they could be eluted from the immobilized PC columns without non-size-related retention, thereby allowing their molecular weights to be reliably estimated.",M1
19837886,"Insect <e>eggs</e> protected from high temperatures by limited homeothermy of plant leaves.Virtually all aspects of insect biology are affected by body temperature, and many taxa have evolved sophisticated temperature-control mechanisms. All insects, however, begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate. Eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment, and thus a body temperature, that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves. Because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient, e.g. by evapotranspiration, plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures. We examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf-associated insect eggs. In particular, we: (1) measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field, (2) manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival, and (3) tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures. Our results show that Datura wrightii leaves buffer Manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern USA. Moreover, small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time. Specifically, large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day, reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf-constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology.",M1
19835982,"Developmental stages of the hooded beetle Sericoderus lateralis (Coleoptera: Corylophidae) with comments on the phylogenetic position and effects of miniaturization.The first detailed morphological study of larvae, pupae and adults of a species of the hooded beetles (Coleoptera: Corylophidae) -Sericoderus lateralis - is presented. Histological sectioning, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, laser confocal microscopy and 3D-computer reconstruction were used. For the first time we report that according to the morphometric data of S. lateralis, at least some corylophid beetles have three larval stages. A phylogenetic position of Corylophidae within a cucujoid-cleroid clade is confirmed, and also the placement of Sericoderini within a corlyophid subgroup, which does not include Periptycinae and Foadiini. The larvae of Sericoderus are mainly characterized by plesiomorphic features compared to those of other corylophid tribes, notably Peltinodini and Rypobiini. Morphological and developmental consequences of miniaturization are discussed. Corylophid beetles display much less specific and far-reaching morphological consequences of miniaturization compared to Ptiliidae. We report the presence of unique modifications in the neural system not shared with any other insects, such as a distinctly asymmetric supraoesophageal ganglion in first instar larva, and a total displacement of the brain to the thorax in the adult stage. A highly unusual feature of the digestive tract is the sclerotised, V-shaped ventral wall of the pharynx. Developmental and size dependent changes in the relative volume of different organs are addressed. All organ systems change allometrically in the development of S. lateralis. Allometric trends in the volume of organs confirm that the factors limiting miniaturization are the size of the neural system, associated with the number and size of neurons (most critical for first instar larva), the mass of the skeleton, the <e>egg</e> size, and consequently the volume of the reproductive system (for free-living insects).",M1
19835107,"Modified <e>egg</e> as a nutritional supplement during peak brain development: a new target for fortification.BACKGROUND: Though eggs have the unique capacity, like breastmilk, to concentrate essential nutrients required for early growth and brain development of offspring - i.e. n-3 PUFA, increasingly deficient and sources contaminated - cholesterol and allergy concerns often exclude them from perinatal recommendations. OBJECTIVE: Egg's potential contribution of key nutrients required for peak brain development are re-evaluated vis-à-vis fortification, accessibility, and risks. METHODS: Contributions of standard (USDA) and fortified (selected market-available) egg compositions to perinatal requirements for critical brain-supporting nutrients were compared to human and cow milks, and risks and recommendations evaluated. RESULTS: Standard egg has already higher concentrations/kcal of iron, selenium, zinc, choline, vitamins B12 and E, and essential amino acids (plus taurine) than human milk. Fortified egg could further yield significant n-3 PUFA % recommendations for pregnancy-lactation (total n-3 69.6-75.0% [DRI=1400-1300 mg/day]), including DHA (120.1-129.3%, mostly approximately 80% [calculated DRI=140-130 mg/day]), plus antioxidant vitamins A (9.0-15.2%) and E (51.6-65.3%), and minerals iodine (33.6-44.5%) and selenium (33.7-39.3%); % recommendations for children (1-3 y) even more. Cholesterol, important for nerve membranes and learning, may not be generally contraindicated in childbearing-aged women (approximately 10.5% hypercholesterolemia), and early-life egg exposure may increase tolerance. Egg-inclusive perinatal nutrition programs have shown significant contributions. CONCLUSIONS: Eggs, especially target-fortified, may provide a unique nutritional supplement for peak brain development continously during pregnancy, nursing, and infancy (from 6 months), especially vs. insufficiencies. Missing nutritional opportunities by egg exclusion vs. concerns of hypercholesterolemia or allergy could be addressed individually, rather than as general recommendations, warranting further research and targeted egg design.",M1
19825307,"Effects of Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) <e>egg</e> age, density, and UV treatment on parasitism and development of Trichogramma cacoeciae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae).Integrated pest management (IPM) supports the integration of all rational control methods available. Biological control is one of those control methods. Thus, the influence of Lobesia botrana Den. and Schiff. egg age, density, and sterilization by UV light on parasitism and progeny development of a Trichogramma cacoeciae Marchal strain from La Rioja, Spain, was studied. Understanding this influence is important for the development of biological control programs. UV-killed eggs are widely used for mass rearing Trichogramma. Trichogramma cacoeciae preferred young eggs (0-72 h old), and the largest number of progeny were produced from these eggs, especially from 48- to 72-h-old eggs. The relationship between the number of eggs parasitized by T. cacoeciae and its density (within the range studied) was linear (R (2) adjusted = 0.93), with constant values (72.2-93.7%) for discovery rate (an estimator of searching capacity). UV treatment did not affect the number of progeny produced or parasitism tendency and was thus a helpful tool for the mass-rearing process. Based on its response to egg age and density, our T. cacoeciae strain showed potential for control of L. botrana.",M1
19825305,"High summer temperatures affect the survival and reproduction of olive fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae).The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is an invasive pest in California. Identifying environmental constraints that affect the geographic distribution and abundance of any invasive insect pest is fundamental to its effective management. California's Central Valley, where most commercial olives are grown, is extremely hot during the summer, with maximum daily temperatures consistently &gt;35.0 degrees C. This study examined the effects of two diurnal temperature regimens (low 18.3 degrees C, high 35.0 or 37.8 degrees C) reflecting summer conditions in the valley, and one control temperature regimen (low 18.3 degrees C, high 23.9 degrees C) on the fly's survival and reproductive success in the laboratory. The temperature regimen of 18.3-35.0 degrees C resulted in delayed <e>egg</e> maturation and reduced production of mature eggs compared with the control temperature regimen. Egg maturation was possible at the higher temperature regimen when females were provided with water and food, and egg-laying occurred during the cold phase of the temperature cycle. Access to olive fruit and oviposition itself further promoted egg maturation. Under exposure to the 18.3-35.0 degrees C temperature regimen, approximately 50% of eggs died, and the remainder that hatched died as first instars. No egg hatch occurred at the temperature treatment of 18.3-37.8 degrees C. We confirmed these laboratory results through field cage studies with adult B. oleae, conducted in the summer of 2007 and 2008. Under ambient summer temperatures, adult B. oleae survived for 1-2 wk, and females readily laid eggs when provided water and food. No offspring developed in midsummer of 2007, and &lt;2% of the offspring developed to adults in summer 2008 trials. These results suggest that high summer temperatures limit the fly's abundance in California's Central Valley.",M1
19820182,"Nicotinamidase modulation of NAD+ biosynthesis and nicotinamide levels separately affect reproductive development and cell survival in C. elegans.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is a central molecule in cellular metabolism and an obligate co-substrate for NAD(+)-consuming enzymes, which regulate key biological processes such as longevity and stress responses. Although NAD(+) biosynthesis has been intensely studied, little analysis has been done in developmental models. We have uncovered novel developmental roles for a nicotinamidase (PNC), the first enzyme in the NAD(+) salvage pathway of invertebrates. Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans nicotinamidase PNC-1 cause developmental and functional defects in the reproductive system; the development of the gonad is delayed, four uterine cells die by necrosis and the mutant animals are <e>egg</e>-laying defective. The temporal delay in gonad development results from depletion of the salvage pathway product NAD(+), whereas the uv1 cell necrosis and egg-laying defects result from accumulation of the substrate nicotinamide. Thus, regulation of both substrate and product level is key to the biological activity of PNC-1. We also find that diet probably affects the levels of these metabolites, as it affects phenotypes. Finally, we identified a secreted isoform of PNC-1 and confirmed its extracellular localization and functional activity in vivo. We demonstrate that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the equivalent enzyme in nicotinamide recycling to NAD(+) in vertebrates, can functionally substitute for PNC-1. As Nampt is also secreted, we postulate an evolutionarily conserved extracellular role for NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes during development and physiology.",M1
19812189,"Helminth antigens modulate immune responses in cells from multiple sclerosis patients through TLR2-dependent mechanisms.To better understand the link between parasite infections and the course of multiple sclerosis (MS), we studied the role of TLRs in helminth product recognition by dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells. Baseline expression of TLR2 was significantly higher in infected-MS patients compared with uninfected MS subjects or healthy controls. Moreover, cells exposed to TLR2 agonists or to soluble <e>egg</e> Ag (SEA) from Schistosoma mansoni resulted in significant TLR2 up-regulation. SEA suppressed the LPS-induced DCs production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha and enhanced TGF-beta as well as IL-10 production. Similarly, after exposure to SEA, anti-CD40-activated B cells increased IL-10 production. Both processes were MyD88 dependent. In addition, SEA down-regulated the expression of LPS-induced costimulatory molecules on DCs in a MyD88-independent manner. DCs stimulation by SEA and TLR2 agonists induced increasing phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1/2. Neither stimulus showed an effect on p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation, however. Addition of the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was associated with dose-dependent inhibition of IL-10 and reciprocal enhancement of IL-12. Finally, cytokine effects and changes observed in DCs costimulatory molecule expression after SEA exposure were lost when TLR2 expression was silenced. Overall, these findings indicate that helminth molecules exert potent regulatory effects on both DCs and B cells through TLR2 regulation conducted via different signaling pathways. This knowledge could prove critical in developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as MS.",M1

Diffusates only from tomato and carrot significantly delayed the hatching of eggs from young plants, but did not do so from senescing plants, suggesting that delay of hatching depends on the origin of diffusates and host plant age.",M1
19808884,"Mouse oviduct-specific glycoprotein is an <e>egg</e>-associated ZP3-independent sperm-adhesion ligand.Mouse sperm-egg binding requires a multiplicity of receptor-ligand interactions, including an oviduct-derived, high molecular weight, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-binding glycoprotein that associates with the egg coat at ovulation. Herein, we report the purification and identification of this sperm-binding ligand. WGA-binding, high molecular weight glycoproteins isolated from hormonally primed mouse oviduct lysates competitively inhibit sperm-egg binding in vitro. Within this heterogeneous glycoprotein preparation, a distinct 220 kDa protein selectively binds to sperm surfaces, and was identified by sequence analysis as oviduct-specific glycoprotein (OGP). The sperm-binding activity of OGP was confirmed by the loss of sperm-binding following immunodepletion of OGP from oviduct lysates, and by the ability of both immunoprecipitated OGP and natively purified OGP to competitively inhibit sperm-egg binding. As expected, OGP is expressed by the secretory cells of the fimbriae and infundibulum; however, in contrast to previous reports, OGP is also associated with both the zona pellucida and the perivitelline space of mouse oocytes. Western blot analysis and lectin affinity chromatography demonstrate that whereas the bulk of OGP remains soluble in the ampullar fluid, distinct glycoforms associate with the cumulus matrix, zona pellucida and perivitelline space. The sperm-binding activity of OGP is carbohydrate-dependent and restricted to a relatively minor peanut agglutinin (PNA)-binding glycoform that preferentially associates with the sperm surface, zona pellucida and perivitelline space, relative to other more abundant glycoforms. Finally, pretreatment of two-cell embryos, which do not normally bind sperm, with PNA-binding OGP stimulates sperm binding.",M1
19801434,"Cavitation in the embryonic tracheal system of Manduca sexta.Insect tracheae form during embryonic development and initially contain liquid, which impedes transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Only later do tracheae fill with gas and come to support high rates of gas flux. This liquid-to-gas transition is poorly understood. Using <e>eggs</e> of the sphingid moth Manduca sexta, we show that longitudinal tracheae in embryos fill with gas in less than 5 s, without invasion of external air, by a process of cavitation. Cavitation requires that tracheal liquids be under tension, and we propose two complementary processes for generating it. One likely, classical mechanism is tracheolar fluid absorption, first proposed by Wigglesworth. Our data support this mechanism in Manduca: after cavitation, liquids are progressively drawn out of finer tracheal branches. The second, previously unknown, mechanism is evaporative water loss across the eggshell, which leads both to declining egg volume and to a larger negative pressure potential of water. The pressure potential helps to drive rapid expansion of small bubbles nucleated near spiracles. Once bubbles are large enough to have displaced liquid across the diameter of a trachea, negative capillary pressure reinforces subsequent expansion of the bubble. Together with predictions from modern cavitation theory, our observations substantiate Wigglesworth's contention that gas filling is promoted by increasing hydrophobicity associated with tanning of the spiracles and major tracheal branches.",M1
19798695,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 degradation in mouse <e>eggs</e> and impact on [Ca2+]i oscillations.The initiation of normal embryo development depends on the completion of all events of egg activation. In all species to date, egg activation requires an increase(s) in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), which is almost entirely mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP(3)R1). In mammalian eggs, fertilization-induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses exhibit a periodic pattern that are called [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. These [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations are robust at the beginning of fertilization, which occurs at the second metaphase of meiosis, but wane as zygotes approach the pronuclear stage, time after which in the mouse oscillations cease altogether. Underlying this change in frequency are cellular and biochemical changes associated with egg activation, including degradation of IP(3)R1, progression through the cell cycle, and reorganization of intracellular organelles. In this study, we investigated the system requirements for IP(3)R1 degradation and examined the impact of the IP(3)R1 levels on the pattern of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Using microinjection of IP(3) and of its analogs and conditions that prevent the development of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, we show that IP(3)R1 degradation requires uniform and persistently elevated levels of IP(3). We also established that progressive degradation of the IP(3)R1 results in [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations with diminished periodicity while a near complete depletion of IP(3)R1s precludes the initiation of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. These results provide insights into the mechanism involved in the generation of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in mouse eggs.",M1
19796084,"Parent-offspring conflict and selection on <e>egg</e> size in turtles.The trade-off between offspring size and number can present a conflict between parents and their offspring. Because egg size is constrained by clutch size, the optimal egg size for offspring fitness may not always be equivalent to that which maximizes parental fitness. We evaluated selection on egg size in three turtle species (Apalone mutica, Chelydra serpentina and Chrysemys picta) to determine if optimal egg sizes differ between offspring and their mothers. Although hatching success was generally greater for larger eggs, the strength and form of selection varied. In most cases, the egg size that maximized offspring fitness was greater than that which maximized maternal fitness. Consistent with optimality theory, mean egg sizes in the populations were more similar to the egg sizes that maximized maternal fitness, rather than offspring fitness. These results provide evidence that selection has maximized maternal fitness to achieve an optimal balance between egg size and number.",M1
19791602,"Demography of gut symbiotic and aposymbiotic Nezara viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae).Nezara viridula L. is a highly polyphagous and cosmopolitan pentatomid stink bug. Despite its economic importance, aspects of its biology are poorly understood. N. viridula has one primary bacterium associated with its gastric caeca, which females provide to offspring by smearing it on the surface of <e>eggs</e> during oviposition. We studied the impact of three temperatures and egg mass surface sterilization on N. viridula's nymphal development rate and reproductive performance. Our results show that maintenance of the symbiont is affected both by temperature and egg mass surface sterilization. We detected the symbiont in 100, 84, and 8.3% of the untreated control insects at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively, by using polymerase chain reaction. In insects originated from surface sterilized egg masses, the symbiont was never detected at 20 or 30 degrees C and was detected in only 1 of 21 insects at 25 degrees C. Nymphal mean development time decreased with increasing temperature, but there were no differences between the sterilized and control treatments. Sterilized insects at 20 degrees C lived longer than insects in any other treatment but never laid eggs. Life table analysis of N. viridula adults showed that net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, and gross reproductive rate were not significantly different among treatments except at 20 degrees C for the surface sterilized treatment. Mean generation time, however, was significantly longer at 20 degrees C (70.96 +/- 4.43 d), regardless of the surface sterilization treatment. Our results highlight the effect that temperature has on the maintenance of this symbiosis and its relationship with N. viridula host's development and reproduction.",M1
19787051,"Sperm chromatin-induced ectopic polar body extrusion in mouse <e>eggs</e> after ICSI and delayed egg activation.Meiotic chromosomes in an oocyte are not only a maternal genome carrier but also provide a positional signal to induce cortical polarization and define asymmetric meiotic division of the oocyte, resulting in polar body extrusion and haploidization of the maternal genome. The meiotic chromosomes play dual function in determination of meiosis: 1) organizing a bipolar spindle formation and 2) inducing cortical polarization and assembly of a distinct cortical cytoskeleton structure in the overlying cortex for polar body extrusion. At fertilization, a sperm brings exogenous paternal chromatin into the egg, which induces ectopic cortical polarization at the sperm entry site and leads to a cone formation, known as fertilization cone. Here we show that the sperm chromatin-induced fertilization cone formation is an abortive polar body extrusion due to lack of spindle induction by the sperm chromatin during fertilization. If experimentally manipulating the fertilization process to allow sperm chromatin to induce both cortical polarization and spindle formation, the fertilization cone can be converted into polar body extrusion. This suggests that sperm chromatin is also able to induce polar body extrusion, like its maternal counterpart. The usually observed cone formation instead of ectopic polar body extrusion induced by sperm chromatin during fertilization is due to special sperm chromatin compaction which restrains it from rapid spindle induction and therefore provides a protective mechanism to prevent a possible paternal genome loss during ectopic polar body extrusion.",M1

20497788,"Chia (Salvia hispanica L) gel can be used as <e>egg</e> or oil replacer in cake formulations.This study determined the overall acceptability, sensory characteristics, functional properties, and nutrient content of cakes made using chia (Salvia hispanica L) gel as a replacement for oil or eggs. Chia gel was used to replace 25%, 50%, and 75% of oil or eggs in a control cake formulation. Seventy-five untrained panelists participated in rating cakes on a seven-point hedonic scale. Analysis of variance conducted on the sensory characteristics and overall acceptability indicated a statistically significant effect when replacing oil or eggs for color, taste, texture, and overall acceptability (P&lt;0.05). Post hoc analysis (using Fisher's least significant difference method) indicated that the 25% chia gel cakes were not significantly different from the control for color, taste, texture, and overall acceptability. The 50% oil substituted (with chia gel) cake, compared to control, had 36 fewer kilocalories and 4 g less fat per 100-g portion. Cake weight was not affected by chia gel in the formulation, although cake volume was lower as the percentage of substitution increased. Symmetry was generally not affected. This study demonstrates that chia gel can replace as much as 25% of oil or eggs in cakes while yielding a more nutritious product with acceptable sensory characteristics.",M2
20460675,"Oxidative stability and lipid components of <e>eggs</e> from flax-fed hens: effect of dietary antioxidants and storage.An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary antioxidants and storage on fatty acid profile, oxidative stability, and vitamin E concentration of n-3 fatty acid-enriched eggs. Eggs (384, 48/diet) were collected from ISA Brown layers fed diets containing corn-soy (control) with 100 g/kg of flax seed and 2 types of antioxidants [alpha-tocopherols (alpha-TOC) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)] at 0, 50, 100, or 150 IU or mg/kg. Eggs were stored at 4 degrees C. On d 0, 20, 40, and 60 of storage, 2 eggs were selected randomly from each replicate (totaling 12 eggs per treatment) and analyzed. Eggs from hens fed flax had increased alpha-linolenic (18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, 22:6n-3) and decreased arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and total n-6:n-3 ratio when compared with control eggs (P&lt;0.05). The n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio was lowest in the flax+50 IU of alpha-TOC, flax+100 IU of alpha-TOC, and flax+BHT supplemented group when compared with the flax group (P&lt;0.05). With the exception of flax+100 mg of BHT, addition of antioxidants led to a reduction in palmitic acid in fresh eggs (P&lt;0.05). During the first 20 d of storage, over a 17% reduction in total n-3 fatty acids was observed in eggs from flax+50 mg of BHT supplemented groups (P&lt;0.05). Docosahexaenoic acid was the predominant long-chain n-3 fatty acid in egg and was stable during storage in the control, flax, flax+100 IU of alpha-TOC, flax+150 IU of alpha-TOC, and flax+150 mg of BHT groups. However, antioxidant supplementation had no effect on DHA upon storage in flax+50 IU of alpha-TOC and flax+50 mg of BHT eggs where over 13 to 17% reduction in DHA content was observed during 20 to 60 d of storage (P&lt;0.05). Inclusion of alpha-TOC led to over 4.5- to 12-fold increases in alpha-TOC in eggs. Egg storage for 40 d or longer led to over 50% reduction in egg alpha-TOC (P&lt;0.05). Feeding flax seeds led to an increase in TBA reactive substances in eggs (P&lt;0.05). alpha-Tocopherol was better in preventing lipid oxidation than BHT at d 0 of storage. However, neither had a significant effect on egg TBA reactive substances upon 60 d of storage (P&gt;0.05). These studies demonstrate that the level and type of antioxidants and duration of egg storage significantly affected the fatty acid profile, alpha-TOC status, and oxidative stability of chicken eggs.",M2
20453235,"Investigation of risk factors for Salmonella on commercial <e>egg</e>-laying farms in Great Britain, 2004-2005.In 2004/05, all European Union member states were required to carry out standardised prevalence surveys to establish the baseline prevalence of Salmonella in commercial laying flocks. As part of the survey in Great Britain, additional data were collected from 380 of the enrolled laying hen holdings to investigate risk factors for Salmonella at farm level. Stratified, simple random sampling was used to select holdings from which dust and boot swab samples were collected and tested for Salmonella using a modification of ISO 6579:2002. Using a multivariable logistic model weighted to account for the survey design, several factors significantly associated with Salmonella and Salmonella Enteritidis status were identified. Larger holdings (&gt;or=30,000 birds) were found to be at higher risk of Salmonella (odds ratio [OR] 4.79, P=0.025), while vaccination (OR 0.28, P=0.013), providing foot dips with brushes (OR 0.27, P=0.042), washing and disinfecting the house at depopulation (OR 0.19, P=0.003), having a clean car park away from house (OR 0.14, P=0.001), using an independent (OR 0.19, P=0.007) or other non-company (OR 0.40, P=0.049) source of feed, being over 1 km from the nearest neighbouring farm (OR 0.45, P=0.021) and the presence of cats and dogs on the farm (OR 0.26, P=0.002) or on contiguous farms (OR 0.44, P=0.030) reduced the risk of any Salmonella serovars being present. Factors found to be associated specifically with an increased risk of S Enteritidis infection included holding size (OR 14.88, P=0.001) and frequent sightings of rats (OR 8.17, P&lt;0.001) or mice (OR 5.78, P=0.006). Non-caged systems (OR 0.14, P=0.002), vaccination (OR 0.08, P=0.001), the use of a non-company feed source (OR 0.11, P=0.003), running the site as all-in/all-out (OR 0.06, P&lt;0.001) and the presence of cats and dogs on the farm (OR 0.14, P=0.002) were associated with a reduced risk.",M2
20420104,"Supplement of three <e>eggs</e> a week improves protein malnutrition in Thai children from rural areas.BACKGROUND: Protein Malnutrition is one of the most important health indexes that affect children's growth and development. In Thailand National Health Survey 2004, 21.5% of primary school students living in the rural area were below the 90th percentile of the standard weight for age. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional status with serum proteins and lipids, and to determine the effect of egg supplement for primary school students aged 6-15 years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A randomized experimental study was performed in 417 participants received an addition of either three or ten eggs per week for 12 consecutive weeks to basal diet. RESULTS: The anthropometric and biochemical indexes were measured, 29.1% and 20.8% of whom were Protein Malnutrition according to serum albumin and PreAlbumin's criteria, respectively. Albumin and PreAlbumin levels were positively correlated with Total Cholesterol and LDL-C levels. No difference in any biochemical index has been found between 3 eggs/wk group and 10 eggs/wk group. Besides, due to continuing egg supplement, Total Cholesterol, LDL and ratio of Total Cholesterol to HDL level have decreased (p &lt; 0.001) but albumin, PreAlbumin and HDL levels have demonstrated significantly increasing levels (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Nowadays in rural areas of Thailand there are still primary school students with protein malnutrition especially in rural area. An addition of at least 3 eggs/wk supplements can effectively correct the problem of protein malnutrition among primary school students at risk as shown by biochemical indices, and it benefits the blood cholesterol level as well.",M2
20377958,"Development of a novel immuno-PCR assay for detection of ricin in ground beef, liquid chicken <e>egg</e>, and milk.Reliable, sensitive, and high-throughput methods are essential for food defense, to detect foodborne contaminants and to facilitate remediation and recovery from potential toxin-related incidents. Ricin is a protein toxin that has been used for intentional contamination of foods in the past. In this study, we developed procedures for quantification of ricin in foods using immuno-PCR (IPCR). The direct adsorption of ricin onto the wells of a microtitration plate was compared with indirect immobilization via a capture antibody (sandwich IPCR). The latter procedure provided much greater sensitivity. We also compared a protocol with the immunoassay and PCR conducted in a single plate to a two-step procedure in which the PCR was conducted in a second plate, following release and transfer of the DNA marker. The two-step procedure proved 1,000-fold more sensitive for ricin detection, so this format was used to detect ricin in spiked samples of ground beef, chicken egg, and milk, and the results were compared with those obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IPCR had a limit of detection of 10 pg/ml in chicken egg and milk samples and 100 pg/ml in ground beef extracts. Comparable ELISA results were in the 1 to 10 ng/ml range. Thus, IPCR affords sensitivity that is 10-fold greater in the ground beef matrix, 100-fold greater in the milk, and 1,000-fold greater in the egg matrix than the sensitivity obtained by ELISA. Further optimization of the sandwich IPCR was performed by comparing various antibody combinations. Among the four formats investigated, the pAb-pAb combination yielded the lowest limit of detection (10 fg/ml).",M2
20371854,"Rheological properties, oxidative stability, and tocopherol content during storage of fried dough made with Silky fowl <e>egg</e>: comparison with hen egg.Eggs from Silky fowl and White Leghorn hens were used to prepare fried dough. The rheological properties, lipid oxidative stability, and trans, trans-2,4-decadienal and tocopherol content of fried dough made with Silky fowl egg were compared with dough made with hen egg. The fried dough was stored in a glass bottle at 50 degrees C in the dark for 12 d. The fried dough made with Silky fowl egg showed little change in hardness and adhesion for 12 d at 50 degrees C. However, in the fried dough made with hen egg, hardness increased drastically and adhesion decreased. The fried dough made with Silky fowl egg showed restricted generation of hydroperoxides during 12 d in storage at 50 degrees C. In contrast, the fried dough made with hen egg showed an increased amount of hydroperoxides during the 12-d storage. The lowest concentration of trans, trans-2,4-decadienal was observed in fried dough made with Silky fowl egg, whereas the concentration of trans, trans-2,4-decadienal in fried dough made with hen egg was significantly increased. Total tocopherols in fried dough made with Silky fowl egg were degraded 23.3 mg/100 g of fried dough by the end of the experimental period at 50 degrees C. In contrast, total tocopherols in the fried dough made with hen egg were degraded 40 mg/100 g of fried dough. The ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids decreased and the hydroperoxide content increased with storage time. The unsaturated fatty acid:saturated fatty acid ratio and hydroperoxide and tocopherol contents were lower in fried dough made with Silky fowl egg than in that made with hen egg, indicating decreased lipid oxidation. The present experiment suggests that the use of Silky fowl egg could improve the rheological properties, oxidative stability, and trans, trans-2,4-decadienal and tocopherol contents of fried dough.",M2

Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk and dietary treatments [basal control diet (BCD), BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF, BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, and BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, 0.013% PHY, and 0.025% D(3)] were initiated at 20 wk of age. Hen BW, <e>egg</e> weight, and egg production (EP) were determined every 4 wk between 24 and 58 wk of age. Feed consumption (FC) and feed conversion were determined in 4-wk intervals beginning on wk 25 and ending on wk 58, and total mortality and mean EP were determined over the entire 24 to 58-wk period. The addition of 0.75 and 1.50% PF increased BW at wk 48 and 58, respectively, and supplemental PF at the 1.50% level increased the BW of hens that had been inoculated (sham or FMG) on wk 22 and reduced the FC of hens inoculated on wk 12. Feed conversion was decreased in the 25 to 28- and 57 to 58-wk age periods and increased in the 45 to 48-wk age periods by an FMG inoculation. In birds inoculated at 22 wk of age, FMG increased egg weight. Although EP was reduced at wk 24 and was increased at wk 58 by FMG, total EP was not affected. In conclusion, an inoculation of FMG at either 12 or 22 wk of age can result in a relative shift in EP from the early to late stage of lay without affecting total EP, and although the BW and FC responses of hens to added dietary PF were influenced by their age and the age of inoculation, use of the supplemental combination of PHY and D(3) had no additional effect on performance when provided in conjunction with 1.50% PF.",M2

One SNP from C to T at position 1623 of the open reading frame of LRP8 was identified and genotyped by a high-throughput genotyping method, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in 747 egg-type dwarf layers from 44 sire families. There were no significant differences among genotypes for any interior egg traits measured, except for yolk color, in which color was deeper for the TT genotype than CC or CT (P &lt; 0.05). For shell traits, strength and thickness were greater for TT than CC (P &lt; 0.05), with CT intermediate and not different from either. Shape index was lower for CT than either TT or CC, which did not differ, whereas for shell color, CT was intermediate to the homozygotes, which differed (CC &gt; TT). The present results indicated that LRP8, as a new member of eggshell matrix protein, may be a candidate gene associated with eggshell traits.",M2
20329643,"[Mycoplasma synoviae-associated <e>egg</e>-pole shell defects in laying hens]Hens laying eggs with egg-pole shell defects (EPS) were examined in a clinical prospective study. 86 hens with EPS and 72 hens without EPS from three flocks were selected for this study. It could be proven serologically that hens with EPS had significant (p &lt; 0.05) higher titers against Mycoplasma (M.) synoviae then hens without EPS. PCR tested cloacal swabs for M. synoviae were more frequently positive from hens with EPS (87%; n=72) then from hens without EPS (18%; n=13). Furthermore, M. synoviae could be cultivated from the oviduct of five hens with EPS. Additionally, M. synoviae-DNA was detectable in the albumen of nearly all eggs with EPS (n=48; 98%), contrary to the eggs without EPS (n=11; 26%). Ultrastructural investigation revealed that eggs with EPS showed considerable differences of the egg shell structure as well as the cross section dimension according to eggs without EPS. Due to the significantly more frequent detection of M. synoviae-DNA from the cloaca of chickens with EPS, is an involvement of M. synoviae in laying of EPS in the surveyed herds likely. Further infection experiments with the isolated M. synoviae were not perfomed, therefore about the causal pathogenic role of M. synoviae in the development of eggs with EPS in the surveyed herds can only be speculated.",M2
20308412,"Sequential feeding using whole wheat and a separate protein-mineral concentrate improved feed efficiency in laying hens.The effect of feeding nutritionally different diets in sequential or loose-mix systems on the performance of laying hen was investigated from 16 to 46 wk of age. Equal proportions of whole wheat grain and protein-mineral concentrate (balancer diet) were fed either alternatively (sequential) or together (loose-mix) to ISA Brown hens. The control was fed a complete layer diet conventionally. Each treatment was allocated 16 cages and each cage contained 5 birds. Light was provided 16 h daily (0400 to 2000 h). Feed offered was controlled (121 g/bird per d) and distributed twice (4 and 11 h after lights-on). In the sequential treatment, only wheat was fed at first distribution, followed by balancer diet at the second distribution. In loose-mix, the 2 rations were mixed and fed together during the 2 distributions. Leftover feed was always removed before the next distribution. Sequential feeding reduced total feed intake when compared with loose-mix and control. It had lower wheat (-9 g/bird per d) but higher balancer (+1.7 g/bird per d) intakes than loose-mix. <e>Egg</e> production, egg mass, and egg weight were similar among treatments. This led to an improvement in efficiency of feed utilization in sequential compared with loose-mix and control (10 and 5%, respectively). Birds fed sequentially had lower calculated ME (kcal/bird per d) intake than those fed in loose-mix and control. Calculated CP (g/bird per d) intake was reduced in sequential compared with loose-mix and control. Sequentially fed hens were lighter in BW. However, they had heavier gizzard, pancreas, and liver. Similar liver lipid was observed among treatments. Liver glycogen was higher in loose-mix than the 2 other treatments. It was concluded that feeding whole wheat and balancer diet, sequentially or loosely mixed, had no negative effect on performance in laying hens. Thus, the 2 systems are alternative to conventional feeding. The increased efficiency of feed utilization in sequential feeding is an added advantage compared with loose-mix and thus could be employed in situations where it is practicable.",M2
20308411,"Computational study of the heat transfer of an avian <e>egg</e> in a tray.The development of an embryo in an avian egg depends largely on its temperature. The embryo temperature is affected by its environment and the heat produced by the egg. In this paper, eggshell temperature and the heat transfer characteristics from one egg in a tray toward its environment are studied by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Computational fluid dynamics simulations have the advantage of providing extensive 3-dimensional information on velocity and eggshell temperature distribution around an egg that otherwise is not possible to obtain by experiments. However, CFD results need to be validated against experimental data. The objectives were (1) to find out whether CFD can successfully simulate eggshell temperature from one egg in a tray by comparing to previously conducted experiments, (2) to visualize air flow and air temperature distribution around the egg in a detailed way, and (3) to perform sensitivity analysis on several variables affecting heat transfer. To this end, a CFD model was validated using 2 sets of temperature measurements yielding an effective model. From these simulations, it can be concluded that CFD can effectively be used to analyze heat transfer characteristics and eggshell temperature distribution around an egg. In addition, air flow and temperature distribution around the egg are visualized. It has been observed that temperature differences up to 2.6 degrees C are possible at high heat production (285 mW) and horizontal low flow rates (0.5 m/s). Sensitivity analysis indicates that average eggshell temperature is mainly affected by the inlet air velocity and temperature, flow direction, and the metabolic heat of the embryo and less by the thermal conductivity and emissivity of the egg and thermal emissivity of the tray.",M2
20308409,"Modified pressure imaging for <e>egg</e> crack detection and resulting egg quality.Cracks in the shell surface compromise the primary barrier for external microbial contamination of the egg. Microcracks are very small cracks in the shell surface that are difficult to detect by human graders. New technology has been developed that uses modified pressure and imaging to detect microcracks in eggs. Research has shown the system to have an accuracy of 99.6% in detecting both cracked and intact eggs. A study was undertaken to determine if quality differences existed between modified pressure imaged and control eggs during extended cold storage. Three replicates were conducted with eggs stored at 4 degrees C for 5 wk with weekly quality testing. The physical quality factors monitored were Haugh units, albumen height, egg weight, shell strength, vitelline membrane strength and elasticity, and whole egg total solids. All measurements were conducted on individual eggs (12/treatments per replicate) each week with the exception of whole egg solids, which were determined from 3 pools (4 eggs each)/treatment per replicate each week. Percentage of whole egg total solids was the only significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) between treatments (23.65% modified pressure imaged and 23.47% control). There was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) for egg weight between replicates (60.82, 58.02, and 60.58 g for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Therefore, imaging eggs in the modified pressure system for microcrack detection did not alter egg quality during extended cold storage. Utilizing the modified pressure crack detection technology would result in fewer cracked eggs reaching the consumer, consequently enhancing food safety without affecting product quality.",M2
20308407,"Effects on <e>egg</e> quality traits of genotype and diets with mussel meal or wheat-distillers dried grains with solubles.The aim of the study was to evaluate effects on exterior and interior egg quality and sensory characteristics of eggs from hens fed diets with admixtures of 3.5 or 7.0% of mussel meal or 20% wheat-distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The mussel meal diets followed organic standards, whereas the DDGS diet was formulated for hens in conventional production. Standard diets, one organic and one conventional from a Swedish feed manufacturer, were included for comparison. The study used 164 Hy-Line White W-98 and 164 Hy-Line Brown layers housed in small-group furnished cages. Egg flavor or odor was not affected by genotype. Egg flavor intensity was stronger in eggs from hens fed either of the mussel diets or the standard organic diet compared with the conventional diet. There were no differences between any of the diets in egg odor intensity, off-flavor, or off-odor. The mussel diets and the standard organic diet gave stronger yolk pigmentation than the conventional and DDGS diet, respectively. Manure DM was lower with the admixture of 7.0% mussel meal than 3.5%. There was a tendency (P &lt; 0.10) toward a difference between diets in dirty eggs, and the percentage was highest with 7.0% mussel meal. Diet or genotype had no effect on egg weight, albumen height, shell deformation, shell breaking strength, or proportion of cracked eggs. Genotype differences were found in weight percentage of albumen, yolk, and shell and in the presence of blood and meat spots and in percentage of dirty eggs. In conclusion, the majority of egg quality traits were unaffected by the diets studied. With the admixture of DDGS used in the present study, the characteristics of eggs were similar to those of eggs produced on the conventional standard diet. There was no indication of impaired egg odor or flavor with the used fractions of DDGS or mussel meal.",M2
20301970,"Outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 197 of multiple genotypes linked to an <e>egg</e> producer.This paper describes outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 197 (STm197) linked to eggs from the farm of a single egg producer. Epidemiological and microbiological investigations (genotyping by multiple locus variable number tandem repeats analysis [MLVA]) identified outbreaks of STm197 with the same or closely-related MLVA profiles in a series of restaurants across Brisbane over 2 months. Environmental health investigations revealed that these restaurants were supplied with eggs from the same egg producer and that cross-contamination may have contributed to the outbreak. Environmental swabs taken from restaurant kitchens and the farm of the egg producer identified a number of salmonellas including STm197, many with MLVA profiles matching or closely related to the human strains from outbreak cases. A case-to-case comparison study showed a significant association between illness with 1 MLVA type and attending a restaurant during the 5 days before onset of illness (odds ratio [OR] 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8, 35.4). MLVA has become a valuable tool for S. Typhimurium surveillance and outbreak investigation. This outbreak further justifies the Commonwealth Government's decision to develop a draft national primary production and processing standard for eggs and egg products to address food safety risks posed by cracked and dirty eggs.",M2
20301969,"Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium 44 related to <e>egg</e> consumption.ACT Health investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with a local restaurant in December 2008. The infecting agent was Salmonella serotype Typhimurium phage type 44. A case control study was conducted to identify the source of infection. A total of 22 cases and 9 controls were recruited to take part in the study. Both poached eggs (odds ratio [OR] 42.00) and hollandaise sauce (OR 19.00) had elevated odds ratios that were statistically significant. The major limitation of the study was the small sample size and small number of controls. Despite this, a strong association with illness and consumption of eggs and hollandaise sauce was detected and this was further supported by environmental evidence. The investigation concluded that the cause of the outbreak was putatively contaminated eggs, either on their own or as an ingredient used in hollandaise sauce. The investigation and control measures led to an improvement in hygiene practices at the restaurant and contributed to the voluntary recall of the contaminated batch of eggs from the Australian Capital Territory. The results of the study also build upon other evidence that egg-related salmonellosis is now common in Australia and attention to commercial practices at production and processing is overdue.",M2

A sample preparation protocol including defatting, protein denaturation, and carbamidomethylation was optimized in order to achieve complete protein digestion and to avoid SeCys losses. Quantification was carried out by reversed-phase HPLC-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) after quantitative isolation of the selenium-containing fraction by size-exclusion liquid chromatography. The detection limits were 0.06, 0.003, and 0.01 microg g(-1) (dry weight) for SeCys, Se(IV) and SeMet, respectively, and the precision was 5-10%. The end products of carbamidomethylation of the different selenium species were identified for the first time by electrospray QTOF MS after custom-designed 2D HPLC purification. Differences in selenium speciation in egg yolk and white were highlighted, the yolk containing more SeCys and the white more SeMet. An insight into selenium bioaccessibility in eggs was obtained by digestion with simulated gastric and gastrointestinal juices and size-exclusion HPLC-ICP MS.",M2

Results indicated that populations of S. Typhimurium DT104 were slowly inactivated in all four products when stored at 4 degrees C. However, based on the typical shelf-lives of cold-stored liquid egg, less than 0.6 log-kill would be achieved in those products prior to their use. Incubation at temperatures pertaining to abuse situations (10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) revealed an increasing potential for growth of S. Typhimurium DT104 in whole egg, albumen and sugared yolk, as indicated by trends in growth rate, lag duration and maximum population density. At even higher temperatures (30, 37 and 42 degrees C), growth rates of S. Typhimurium DT104 in whole egg and sugared yolk continued to increase. The same was true for S. Typhimurium DT104 in albumen except that growth was not observed at 42 degrees C and instead populations were inactivated within 30 h. At no temperature tested was S. Typhimurium DT104 able to grow in salted yolk. The influence of these growth and inactivation patterns on the risk of salmonellosis in relation to product type and storage temperature is discussed.",M2
20222388,"Is hospital based MMR vaccination for children with <e>egg</e> allergy here to stay?Egg allergy is incorrectly considered to constitute a contraindication to MMR in the community, despite a long history of its safe administration to egg allergic children. The product insert perpetuates this misinformation but the Irish guidelines from the RCPI are unequivocal. We reviewed all paediatric cases vaccinated in our hospital in 2007-2008. Forty seven of 91 children receiving vaccinations in hospital, had been referred for MMR due to concerns regarding egg allergy. In 32% (n=15), GP referral for vaccination was made despite correspondence from the clinic advising routine vaccination in the community. Nineteen were second MMR immunisations, which should all have occurred in the community. Unnecessary hospital referral for MMR vaccination is an extra burden on hospital resources, and causes unwarranted anxiety amongst parents of children with egg allergy. A change in practice seems difficult to achieve, as many referrals happen despite individualised correspondence to GPs and other referring clinicians outlining the current guidelines.",M2

The separation was achieved on a TSK-GEL ODS 100 V column (2.0 x 50 mm, 3 microm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, and 0.1 mM ammonium formate-0.1% formic acid in water, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min with gradient elution. Linear calibration plots were obtained with high correlation coefficients (r=0.998-0.999). The LOQ and LOD ranged from 0.02-1.5 ng/mL and 0.1-5 ng/mL, respectively. Average recoveries were in the range of 70.8-117.1% with associated RSD values&lt;15% (n=10) for repeatability and reproducibility.

Samples were collected from 934 premises. Salmonella was found in 1 (0.13%) of 764 RSEM samples, 2 (0.3%) of 726 samples from surfaces where ready-to-eat foods were prepared, and 7 (1.3%) of 550 cleaning cloths. Poor RSEM storage and handling practices were highlighted. Workers in 40% of the premises sampled failed to use designated utensils when RSEM was added to other ingredients, workers in 17% of the premises did not clean surfaces and utensils thoroughly after use with RSEM and before preparing other foods, only 42% of workers washed and dried their hands after handling eggs or RSEM, workers in 41% of the premises did not store RSEM at refrigeration temperature before use, and workers in 8% of the premises added RSEM to cooked rice at the end of cooking when preparing egg fried rice. Take-away premises, especially those serving Chinese cuisine, were least likely to have a documented food safety management system and awareness of the key food safety points concerning the use of RSEM compared with other food service premises (P &lt; 0.0001).

20202324,"Occurrence of Campylobacter in commercially broken liquid <e>egg</e> in Japan.Samples of unpasteurized liquid egg (whole egg, egg yolk, and egg white) and pasteurized liquid whole egg were collected from egg-breaking facilities in Japan and were tested for the presence of Campylobacter. Isolates recovered were tested for freeze-thaw response, sensitivity to antimicrobials, and heat resistance. Campylobacter was isolated from 27.9% of unpasteurized liquid whole egg samples and 36.0% of unpasteurized liquid egg yolk samples. No Campylobacter was isolated from unpasteurized liquid egg white or pasteurized liquid whole egg samples. The contamination levels of Campylobacter ranged from &lt;3 to 240/100 ml. Freeze-thaw response was tested by freezing and thawing liquid whole egg and egg yolk to examine whether those conditions influenced the survival rate. It was shown that freezing and thawing reduced Campylobacter counts. Sensitivity to all antimicrobials used in this study was observed in 47.6% of the isolates. The most predominant antibiotic resistance profile was similar to that of isolates from chicken. D(55 degrees C)-values of 0.16 to 0.38 min and 0.47 to 0.84 min were determined for Campylobacter isolates in liquid whole egg and egg yolk, respectively. These values were lower than those reported for Salmonella. The very weak heat tolerance of Campylobacter indicated that it could be eliminated at the current legal pasteurization condition. There is no safety concern for commercially broken pasteurized liquid egg pertaining to Campylobacter contamination.",M2
20199684,"The genetic effects of the dopamine D1 receptor gene on chicken <e>egg</e> production and broodiness traits.BACKGROUND: The elevation of egg production and the inhibition of incubation behavior are the aims of modern poultry production. Prolactin (PRL) gene is confirmed to be critical for the onset and maintenance of these reproductive behaviors in birds. Through PRL, dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) was also involved in the regulation of chicken reproductive behavior. However, the genetic effects of this gene on chicken egg production and broodiness have not been studied extensively. The objective of this research was to evaluate the genetic effects of the DRD1 gene on chicken egg production and broodiness traits. RESULTS: In this study, the chicken DRD1 gene was screened for the polymorphisms by cloning and sequencing and 29 variations were identified in 3,342 bp length of this gene. Seven single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) among these variations, including a non-synonymous mutation (A+505G, Ser169Gly), were located in the coding region and were chosen to analyze their association with chicken egg production and broodiness traits in 644 Ningdu Sanhuang individuals. Two SNPs, G+123A and C+1107T, were significantly associated with chicken broody frequency (P &lt; 0.05). Significant association was also found between the G+1065A - C+1107T haplotypes and chicken broody frequency (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the haplotypes of G+123A and T+198C were significantly associated with weight of first egg (EW) (P = 0.03). On the other hand, the distribution of the DRD1 mRNA was observed and the expression difference was compared between broodiness and non-broodiness chickens. The DRD1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in subcutaneous fat and abdominal fat of non-broodiness chicken, and then in heart, kidney, oviduct, glandular stomach, hypothalamus, and pituitary. In subcutaneous fat and abdominal fat, the level of non-broodiness was 26 to 28 times higher than that of broodiness. In pituitary, it was 5-fold higher. In heart, oviduct, and kidney, a 2-3 times decrease from non-broodiness to broodiness was displayed. In glandular stomach and hypothalamus, the level seen in non-broodiness and broodiness was almost the same. CONCLUSION: The polymorphisms of the DRD1 gene and their haplotypes were associated with chicken broody frequency and some egg production traits. The mRNA distribution was significant different between broodiness and non-broodiness chickens.",M2
20181881,"The transmission color value: a novel <e>egg</e> quality measure for recording shell color used for monitoring the stress and health status of a brown layer flock.Stress and diseases have the potential to influence the deposition of eggshell pigmentation during egg formation. Therefore, defining the shell color of eggs on a daily basis could be a representative method for monitoring stress or health status of a flock and maintaining good performance. A novel way of measuring eggshell color based on visible-near infrared transmission spectroscopy transmission spectra was defined: the transmission color value (TCV). The TCV was calculated as the ratio between the transmission at 643 nm (maximum absorbance of the pigmentation molecule protoporphyrin IX) and the transmission at 610 nm (a reference wavelength). Experiments were carried out to investigate the relevance of TCV for monitoring flock stress and health or even anticipating any factors unfavorable to performance. In 2 small experimental flocks, deliberate heat stress challenges were applied. A medium-scale experimental flock in an aviary was monitored on a daily basis during the whole productive period. From the deliberate heat stress challenges, it was seen that stress had a significant effect on eggshell pigmentation. This observation was confirmed in a daily monitored flock, in which, for example, an infectious bronchitis infection occurred. These stress situations were quickly reflected by an increased TCV value: more transmission due to less pigmentation and hence less absorbance at the pigmentation wavelength. Furthermore, for the observed problems in the daily monitoring, the TCV value signaled the problem earlier (4 d) than the average egg weight or even signaled when the other parameters did not signal anything. Measuring the TCV of all eggs produced on a daily basis provides relevant information on the stress or health status of a flock of brown layers. This could be used as an early detection of stress situations or emerging diseases, even before important quality and health damage can occur.",M2
20181877,"Physical quality and composition of retail shell <e>eggs</e>.There are a number of specialty shell eggs available to consumers in the US retail market. A survey consisting of white and brown large shell eggs with various production and nutritional differences (traditional, cage-free, free-roaming, pasteurized, nutritionally enhanced, and fertile) was conducted to determine if physical quality and compositional differences exist. Identical brands of eggs were purchased from the same retail outlets on 3 occasions (replicates) in a single city. The average range of time from processing to purchase for all eggs was 7.67 to 25.33 d, with traditional white eggs in retail having the shortest time. Haugh unit values ranged from 66.67 (cage-free, docosahexaenoic acid, and n-3 enhanced) to 84.42 (traditional white). Albumen height followed a similar pattern. Egg weight was greater for brown eggs (61.12 vs. 58.85 g). Brown eggs also had greater static compression shell strength than white eggs (4,130.61 vs. 3,690.31 g force). Vitelline membrane strength was greatest for traditional brown eggs (2.24 g force). Percentage of total solids and crude fat was greatest in the cage-free, n-3-enhanced white eggs (25.07 and 11.71%, respectively).

20181875,"Microbiological and physical quality changes in vacuum loader cups associated with the use of various sanitizing compounds.Studies were conducted to determine the effects of various sanitizing compounds on the microbial and physical quality of shell <e>egg</e> processing vacuum loader cups. The sanitizing compounds used were as follows: sterile, distilled water; 200 microL/L of sodium hypochlorite; 200 microL/L of calcium hypochlorite; and 200 microL/L of peracetic acid. In the microbial inoculation study, cups were inoculated with Enterobacter cloacae because it was the most common isolate from a commercial study examining the flora found on vacuum loader cups. In all 3 replicates, aerobic plate counts and Enterobacteriaceae levels were similar for the clean control cups and the cups from the 2 chlorine treatments. Physical quality was measured via serial static compression testing using texture profile analysis. The serial compression mimicked the movement of the vacuum loader cups on the processing line. The strength of the vacuum loader cups was enhanced with exposure to any sanitizer treatment, including distilled water, compared with the controls throughout the 20 applications of the sanitizers. Durometer measurements were not consistent in monitoring vacuum loader cup quality and were determined to not be effective assessments for this application. The use of 200 microL/L of sodium hypochlorite or 200 microL/L of calcium hypochlorite successfully reduced microbial contaminants, had a positive effect on vacuum loader cup physical quality, and should be considered when developing sanitation programs for shell egg processing facilities.",M2
20181869,"Effects of amino acids on <e>egg</e> number and egg mass of brown (heavy breed) and white (light breed) laying hens.Different types (light to heavy) of laying hens are used in practice. There are questions about the optimum level of balanced protein (BP) supply in feed for different types of hens. Therefore, a broad range of amino acids intake levels [550 to 800 mg of true fecal digestible (TFD) Lys/hen per d] was tested on heavy (Lohmann Brown Classic) and light (Lohmann LSL Classic) laying hens from 24 to 60 wk of age. The other indispensable amino acids were fed in fixed ratios to TFD Lys in all treatments. A total of 282 Lohmann Brown Classic and 282 Lohmann LSL Classic hens (24 wk of age) were divided into 12 experimental groups (individually housed) based on daily egg mass production and BW. Replicates of the heavy strain started with a similar average daily egg mass production (51.1 g/hen per d), laying percentage (95.9%), and hen weight (1,860 g). Replicates of the light strain started with a similar average daily egg mass production (52.0 g/hen per d), laying percentage (97.3%), and hen weight (1,478 g). Diets were fed restrictively with an aimed feed intake of 110 g/hen per day [308 kcal/hen per d of AME(n (layers))] and 100 g/hen per day [280 kcal/hen per d of AME(n (layers))] for heavy and light hens, respectively, to achieve the required BP intake levels. For light hens, a BP intake with 600 mg of TFD Lys was sufficient for optimal laying percentage, whereas maximum laying percentage was not achieved with the highest TFD Lys in heavy hens. For egg weight, daily egg mass production as well as feed conversion regression analysis revealed that asymptotes were not achieved with the highest amino acid levels in both layer strains.",M2
20180508,"Deposition of melamine in <e>eggs</e> from laying hens exposed to melamine contaminated feed.The deposition profile of melamine was studied in eggs obtained from laying hens fed melamine contaminated feed. A total of 180 laying hens were divided into five groups and were fed diets spiked with 0, 5, 25, 50, or 100 mg of melamine per kg of feed. Eggs collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method, which was fully validated for melamine analysis prior to use. For each treatment group, the melamine level in the eggs was similar from day 1 to day 15 (P &gt; 0.05), suggesting that laying hens did not accumulate melamine for later deposition in eggs. The average melamine concentrations in eggs were 0.00 (below limit of detection), 0.16, 0.47, 0.84, and 1.48 mg/kg for the 0, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively, which demonstrated an apparent dose-response relationship, and a safety threshold of 164 mg/kg melamine in the feed of laying hen was estimated when a maximum tolerance level of 2.5 mg/kg melamine in egg was adopted. These results provide a scientific basis for the risk assessment of melamine in feeds fed to laying hens.",M2

SPCE samples showed the highest content of peroxide (PV) and cholesterol oxides (COPs). In contrast, pasteurized eggs from organic breeding had the lowest index of oxidation. The three egg coproducts were used to produce dried egg pasta (spaghetti). The spaghetti was stored for 12 months at room temperature using typical pasta packaging (polypropylene foil) both under light, typical of retail conditions, and in the dark. Peroxide values and cholesterol oxidation were monitored at time 0 and then quarterly for 12 months. The oxidative parameters were significantly different in various egg coproducts, but the peroxide values of pasta were in the range of 3.0-3.5 mequiv of O(2)/kg of fat, with no differences in the types of pasta prepared with the various egg coproducts. Samples stored in the dark did not show any significant variations in peroxide values. However, PCE, SPCE and POE spaghetti stored in typical packaging increased the PV by 742.8, 846.7 and 625.7%, respectively. The pasta at time 0 showed COP values of about 50 microg of COPs/g of fat. During storage, COP values increased significantly. PCE, SPCE and POE spaghetti stored in the dark showed a content of total cholesterol oxides that was 2.0, 2.0, and 1.5 times lower than that of samples stored with typical pasta packaging.",M2

In 1125 bacteriological tests conducted on whites, yolks and shells of eggs from three sources, staphylococci were found in 514 cases. Thirteen strains were isolated from the whites, but Staphylococcus bacteria were found more often in yolks--199 strains. The highest percentage of staphylococci were found on the surface of the egg shell--302 strains. Twelve species of staphylococci were isolated from the eggs tested, including both coagulase-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, S. hyicus) and coagulase-negative strains, particularly Staphylococcus lentus, S. warneri, S. epidermidis and S. xylosus. This study determined that regardless of the source of the eggs, egg yolks were more often contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus than with coagulase-negative Stapphylococci. It was also demonstrated that S. aureus dominated in the yolks and on the shells of eggs from the small-scale poultry farm.",M2
20163641,"Effect of dietary dried milky sludge on productive performance and <e>egg</e> quality in laying Japanese quails.ABSTRACT The experiment was conducted to study the effectiveness of dried milky sludge (DMS) as a feed source for laying Japanese quails. The DMS was incorporated into the experimental diets at levels of 0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0%. Four hundred quails were used in a completely randomized design. The results revealed that the daily egg-laying rate, feed cost/100 egg weight, egg width, egg length, egg weight, shell quality characteristics in terms of breaking time, Young's modulus, work, max force, fracturability, breaking stress, stiffness and power, as well as color intensity and yolk height improved significantly with increasing levels of DMS in the diet (P &lt; 0.05), while feed intake/bird/day, mortality and eggshell thickness showed no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05). From this experiment, it was found that DMS incorporated into the experimental diet at the 20.0% level yielded the most productive performance and best egg quality.",M2
20158044,"Preparation, characterization, and in vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation of parenteral diclofenac submicron lipid emulsions.The aim of the present study was to develop stable parenteral submicron lipid emulsions (SLEs) for sustained delivery of diclofenac acid, used to treat arthritic conditions, to minimize dosing frequency. The SLEs of diclofenac acid were prepared using soybean oil, <e>egg</e> lecithin, and cholesterol. They were heated and processed by homogenization and ultrasonication. The influence of formulation variables, such as the change in proportion of oil and cholesterol, were studied, and optimized formulations were developed. The stability of the optimized formulations SM-A (no cholesterol), SM-I (0.05% cholesterol), and SM-II (0.1% cholesterol) was studied during autoclaving, centrifugal stress, desorption stress (dilution effect), and on storage. The creaming volume percentage was found during the storage and centrifugal stress studies. The effect of dilution on zeta potential and size was noted in the desorption studies. The total drug content and entrapment efficiency was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. In vitro release studies were performed in phosphate buffer using dialysis method for 12 h. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity (reduction in paw volume of optimized SLEs) was tested in a 1% carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model and compared with a diclofenac injection (Voveran). Stable SLEs of diclofenac were developed with a mean size ranging from 200-250 nm and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 1 mV. The cholesterol concentration did not significantly affect the prepared SLEs' size and zeta potential. The optimized formulations, SM-A, SM-I, and SM-II, were relatively stable during centrifugal stress, dilution stress, and storage. The drug content was found to be 2.45 +/- 0.26 mg/mL for SM-A, 2.46 +/- 0.34 mg/mL for SM-I, and 2.42 +/- 0.01 mg/mL for SM-II. The entrapment efficiency was 98.91 +/- 0.13%, 99.01 +/- 0.12%, and 99.27 +/- 0.1% for SM-A, SM-I and SM-II, respectively. The in vitro drug release was zero-order and the cumulative amount of drug released within 12 h was 80% (SM-A), 57% (SM-I), and 42% (SM-II. During in vivo studies, the optimized formulations initially revealed a sustained anti-inflammatory activity occurring up to 12 h, with a maximum activity occurring after 2 h. In the case of the diclofenac injection, the maximum activity persisted up to 5 h and then gradually decreased. No such decrease was noticed regarding the optimized formulations for a period extending up to 12 h. Beyond 12 h, activity persisted up to 24 h with a slight reduction in effect.",M2

20145582,"Cheese is a reliable alternative meal for solid-phase gastric emptying study.We evaluated the labeling stability of several alternative meals that could be used to perform solid-phase gastric emptying study. Cooked <e>egg</e> whites labeled with technetium-99m sulfur colloid served as a control. Packaged instant oatmeal and instant mashed potatoes were prepared by adding hot water. Cheddar cheese was melted. Peanut butter was added to bread. The different meals were mixed with technetium-99m sulfur colloid (2.2-3.7 MBq), chopped into small pieces and placed in a glass tube containing gastric juice. Four samples of each meal were analyzed after 1 and 4 h of agitation with a 3-D rotator (two samples per time point). The meal samples were washed with 2 ml of saline and filtered using a blood transfusion filter. The activity in each sample before and after filtering was assayed in a dose calibrator. The percentage of initial radioactivity remaining with the meal of admixture with gastric juice was measured and the average of the two samples was taken. The percentage of activity bound to the solid phase was 98.2+/-1.9, 95.6+/-1.1, 62.1+/-1.7, 41.8+/-0.6, and 74.5+/-3.8% at 1 h and 98.5+/-1.0, 95.8+/-2.6, 77.2+/-6.8, 55.5+/-3.4 and 40.2+/-22.1 at 4 h for egg whites, cheese, oatmeal, mashed potatoes and peanut butter respectively. For egg whites and cheese, there was no significant difference between the values at 1 and 4 h (P&gt;0.8). Cheddar cheese provides an alternative meal for assessing solid gastric emptying in children comparable to egg whites. Oatmeal and mashed potatoes had low and variable labeling stability and are not recommended. In view of the significant proportion of pediatric patients who refuse to eat scrambled eggs or have allergy to eggs, the availability of other meal choices is essential. The versatility of cheddar cheese, which can be added to macaroni or as a topping on pizza, makes it a useful alternative to labeled eggs.",M2
20129686,"Detection of Listeria monocytogenes in raw and pasteurized liquid whole <e>eggs</e> and characterization by PFGE.Listeria monocytogenes has been recognized as a human pathogen for decades and is known to be an important foodborne pathogen. There have been no documented foodborne L. monocytogenes illnesses due to the consumption of eggs or egg products, even though the bacterium has been isolated from faeces, body fluid, and oviducts of asymptomatic laying hens. In order to describe L. monocytogenes contamination of egg products, 144 liquid whole egg samples were collected from 3 different egg-breaking plants during 3 sampling periods. L. monocytogenes detection was performed on raw samples stored at 2 degrees C for two days (D+2) and on pasteurized samples stored at 2 degrees C at D+2 and at shelf-life date (SLD). L. monocytogenes was detected in 25 of the 144 raw egg samples collected, in 4 of the 144 pasteurized egg samples at D+2 and in 2 of the 144 ones analysed at SLD. Contamination of raw egg products appeared to be season dependant and was higher during summer and winter than during autumn. One hundred and ninety-six L. monocytogenes isolates were collected and serotyped; 3 serovars were demonstrated. The dominant serovar was L. monocytogenes 1/2a which was presented by 94.4% of the isolates. Typing of 196 L. monocytogenes isolates was carried out by macrorestriction of the genomic DNA with ApaI and AscI enzymes followed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A large diversity was observed with 21 genotypes of L. monocytogenes, even for a given manufacturer. Nevertheless, most of the egg product samples were contaminated by one genotype, except for five samples which were contaminated by two or three distinct genotypes. The genotypes seem to be specific to each manufacturer. No cluster of L. monocytogenes was found to recur in the different plants over successive seasons.",M2
20128107,"Parental conflict and blue <e>egg</e> coloration in a seabird.When both parents provide offspring care, equal sharing of costly parental duties may enhance reproductive success. This is crucial for longlived species, where increased parental effort in current reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However, this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort, original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation. Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care.",M2
20116871,"Estimation of Salmonella prevalence in UK <e>egg</e>-laying holdings.As part of an EU-wide programme to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella in commercial egg-laying holdings, the EU has set for the UK an annual target of 10% reduction in the prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium in commercial egg-laying holdings. To assist in demonstrating such a reduction, it is very important to obtain an accurate as possible baseline prevalence for Salmonella. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline estimate of the Salmonella prevalence in egg-laying holdings in the UK. Data from an EU baseline survey for Salmonella in UK commercial egg-laying flocks were therefore analysed using Bayesian methods, taking into account the sampling of only 1 flock per holding and estimates of the test sensitivity of the methods used in the EU baseline survey. In addition, in the UK the majority of the eggs come from farms which have participated in voluntary monitoring programmes for Salmonella since the early 1990s, and this data was also used, along with a prior estimate of the test sensitivity of voluntary surveillance. Results indicated that a true prevalence 14% for Salmonella Enteriditis and Typhimurium, and 18% for all serovars, both of these estimates being higher than has previously been reported from the EU baseline survey data. It is also shown that the sensitivity of voluntary surveillance is low, and it will therefore be important to compare results from  official  and  non-official  samples to check that the sampling performed in the National Control Plan is as sensitive as expected.",M2
20113729,"Comparison of several extraction techniques for multiclass analysis of veterinary drugs in <e>eggs</e> using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.This study compared four extraction methods for the simultaneous determination of tetracyclines, macrolides, quinolones, sulphonamides and anthelmintics (including benzimidazoles and avermectins) in eggs by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Solvent extraction, solid-phase extraction (SPE), matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) and modified QuEChERS procedure were compared in terms of recovery and number of veterinary drugs extracted. The solvent extraction procedure with a clean-up step provided better results than the other tested procedures. The QuEChERS procedure was simpler and faster, but extracted fewer compounds than solvent extraction. MSPD did not extract tetracyclines and quinolones, whereas macrolides and tetracyclines were not extracted when SPE was applied. The solvent extraction procedure was validated, obtaining recoveries ranging from 60% (sulfaquinoxaline) to 119% (levamisole) with repeatability values (expressed as relative standard deviations, RSDs) lower than 20% at two concentration levels (10 and 100 microg kg(-1)), except for erythromycin, emamectin and ivermectin that showed RSD values close to 25% at 10 microg kg(-1). Limits of quantification (LOQs) were always equal or lower than 5 microg kg(-1). Finally the method was applied to egg samples, and erythromycin, enrofloxacin, difloxacin, thiabendazole, emamectin and fenbendazole were detected in four samples.",M2
20104980,"<e>Egg</e> consumption and the risk of cancer: a multisite case-control study in Uruguay.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that egg consumption may increase the risk of colorectal cancer and some other cancers. However, the evidence is still limited. To further explore the association between egg intake and cancer risk we conducted a case-control study of 11 cancer sites in Uruguay between 1996 and 2004, including 3,539 cancer cases and 2,032 hospital controls. RESULTS: In the multivariable model with adjustment for age, sex (when applicable), residence, education, income, interviewer, smoking, alcohol intake, intake of fruits and vegetables, grains, dairy products, fatty foods, meat, energy intake and BMI, there was a significant increase in the odds of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (OR= 2.02, 95% CI: 1.19-3.44), upper aerodigestive tract (OR= 1.67, 95% CI: 1.17-2.37), colorectum (OR= 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63), lung (OR= 1.59, 95% CI: 1.10-2.29), breast (OR= 2.86, 95% CI: 1.66-4.92), prostate (OR= 1.89, 95% CI: 1.15-3.10), bladder (OR= 2.23, 95% CI: 1.30-3.83) and all cancer sites combined (OR= 1.71, 95% CI: 1.35-2.17) with a high vs low egg intake. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between higher intake of eggs and increased risk of several cancers. Further prospective studies of these associations are warranted.",M2

The aim of this study was to investigate their association with sociodemographic and -economic characteristics in a general population of French adults. METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed using at least six 24-hour dietary records collected during a 2-year period from 4,574 subjects aged 45-60 years who participated in the SU.VI.MAX cohort study from 1995 to 1997. Compliance with the meat/seafood/egg (1-2 servings/day) and the specific seafood (&gt; or =2 servings/week) recommendations, variety and daily costs were compared across sociodemographic and -economic categories using logistic regression and covariance analyses. RESULTS: Compliance with the sea- food recommendation was associated with older age (p(trend)&lt; 0.0001), higher education level (p(trend) = 0.0002) and higher occupational category (p = 0.007). The variety of meat/seafood/egg intake was positively correlated with higher occupational category (p = 0.02) and not living alone (p = 0.01). The meat/seafood/egg budget spent on white meat was higher for younger subjects (p(trend) = 0.007) with a lower education level (p(trend) = 0.001) and occupational category (p = 0.0006).

20008814,"The effects of commercial cool water washing of shell <e>eggs</e> on Haugh unit, vitelline membrane strength, aerobic microorganisms, and fungi.Current egg washing practices use wash water temperatures averaging 49 degrees C and have been found to increase internal egg temperature by 6.7 to 7.8 degrees C. These high temperatures create a more optimal environment for bacterial growth, including Salmonella Enteritidis if it is present. Salmonella Enteritidis is the most common human pathogen associated with shell eggs and egg products. Its growth is inhibited at temperatures of 7.2 degrees C and below. The objective of this study was to determine if commercially washing eggs in cool water would aid in quickly reducing internal egg temperature, preserving interior egg quality, and slowing microbial growth. During 3 consecutive days, eggs were washed using 4 dual-tank wash water temperature schemes (HH = 49 degrees C, 49 degrees C; HC = 49 degrees C, 24 degrees C; CC = 24 degrees C, 24 degrees C; CH = 24 degrees C, 49 degrees C) at 2 commercial processing facilities. A 10-wk storage study followed, in which vitelline membrane strength, Haugh unit, and aerobic microorganisms and fungi (yeasts and molds) were monitored weekly. As storage time progressed, average Haugh unit values declined 14.8%, the average force required to rupture the vitelline membrane decreased 20.6%, average numbers of bacteria present on shell surfaces decreased 11.3%, and bacteria present in egg contents increased 39.5% during storage. Wash water temperature did not significantly affect Haugh unit values, vitelline membrane strength, or the numbers of aerobic microorganisms and fungi within the shell matrices of processed eggs. Results of this study indicate that incorporating cool water into commercial shell egg processing, while maintaining a pH of 10 to 12, lowers postprocessing egg temperatures and allows for more rapid cooling, without causing a decline in egg quality or increasing the presence of aerobic microorganisms and fungi for approximately 5 wk postprocessing.",M2

This method is simpler and requires fewer reagents when compared with other sample pre-treatment procedures and allows the calibration to be carried out using aqueous standards. Different oily phases such as corn oil, decyl oleate and octyl stearate were tested, as well as Tween 80, Triton X-100 and Triton 114 were analyzed as surfactants. The optimum type and proportion of formulations were determined and their use depended on the element studied. The emulsion preparation was performed by a conventional method that involves mixing both phases at 60 degrees C by magnetic stirring and phase inversion to change the water-to-oil ratio by increasing the volume of the surfactant-water external phase and correspondingly decreasing the volume of internal phase. The accuracy of the method was further confirmed by determining the metals in a whole egg powder CRM and recoveries ranged from 97.5% for Mg to 102.2% for Na, with relative standard deviations lower than 2.3%. The precision of the procedures was determined through repeatability (intra-day precision) and intermediate precision (inter-day). The repeatability presented RSD values lower than 4.2%. The intermediate precision was evaluated using the RSD and F-test. The RSD values to intermediate precision was lower than 5.3% and the computed F-values were lower than tabulated F-values, indicating no significant difference between the results obtained on different days. The proposed method including, sample emulsification for subsequent metal determination for FAAS, has proved to be sensitive, reproducible, simple and economical.",M2

19907639,"<e>Egg</e> eviction imposes a recoverable cost of virulence in chicks of a brood parasite.BACKGROUND: Chicks of virulent brood parasitic birds eliminate their nestmates and avoid costly competition for foster parental care. Yet, efforts to evict nest contents by the blind and naked common cuckoo Cuculus canorus hatchling are counterintuitive as both adult parasites and large older cuckoo chicks appear to be better suited to tossing the eggs and young of the foster parents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show experimentally that egg tossing imposed a recoverable growth cost of mass gain in common cuckoo chicks during the nestling period in nests of great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus hosts. Growth rates of skeletal traits and morphological variables involved in the solicitation of foster parental care remained similar between evictor and non-evictor chicks throughout development. We also detected no increase in predation rates for evicting nests, suggesting that egg tossing behavior by common cuckoo hatchlings does not increase the conspicuousness of nests. CONCLUSION: The temporary growth cost of egg eviction by common cuckoo hatchlings is the result of constraints imposed by rejecter host adults and competitive nestmates on the timing and mechanism of parasite virulence.",M2

It has been suggested that the enrichment factors of albumen and egg membranes differ for 13C, but are similar for 15N. In this study, we compared carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of the membranes and albumen of individual eggs of three wild seabird species, the Southern Rockhopper penguin Eudyptes chrysocome, the Imperial shag Phalacrocorax atriceps albiventer, and the Thin-billed prion Pachyptila belcheri. We also included chicken eggs for comparison. Egg membranes were generally enriched in 13C, compared with albumen. The difference varied between species, with 2.1 per thousand in Rockhopper penguins, 1.6 per thousand in Imperial shags, but only 0.5 per thousand in Thin-billed prions and 0.4 per thousand in chicken eggs. Egg membranes were slightly enriched in 15N in Imperial shags (0.9 per thousand) and chickens (0.5 per thousand), compared with albumen, while there was no difference for Thin-billed prions and Rockhopper penguins. The isotopic values of carbon and nitrogen were correlated between albumen and egg membranes of individual eggs, suggesting that egg membranes can be used reliably to investigate trophic differences between individuals, seasons or colonies. Species-specific mathematical corrections could be used to compare results across studies that use different egg components.",M2
19889040,"Colony kin structure and host-parasite relatedness in the barnacle goose.Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), females laying <e>eggs</e> in the nest of other 'host' females of the same species, is a common alternative reproductive tactic among birds. For hosts there are likely costs of incubating and rearing foreign offspring, but costs may be low in species with precocial chicks such as waterfowl, among which CBP is common. Waterfowl show strong female natal philopatry, and spatial relatedness among females may influence the evolution of CBP. Here we investigate fine-scale kin structure in a Baltic colony of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, estimating female spatial relatedness using protein fingerprints of egg albumen, and testing the performance of this estimator in known mother-daughter pairs. Relatedness was significantly higher between neighbour females (nesting &lt; or = 40 metres from each other) than between females nesting farther apart, but there was no further distance trend in relatedness. This pattern may be explained by earlier observations of females nesting close to their mother or brood sisters, even when far from the birth nest. Hosts and parasites were on average not more closely related than neighbour females. In 25 of 35 sampled parasitized nests, parasitic eggs were laid after the host female finished laying, too late to develop and hatch. Timely parasites, laying eggs in the host's laying sequence, had similar relatedness to hosts as that between neighbours. Females laying late parasitic eggs tended to be less related to the host, but not significantly so. Our results suggest that CBP in barnacle geese might represent different tactical life-history responses.",M2

Dried citrus pulp (DCP) is a potential source of some valuable nutrients for animal and poultry. In an experiment with completely randomized design, the effect of different levels (0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16%) of DCP was evaluated on performance, egg quality, and blood parameters of laying hens from 25 to 37 weeks of age. The birds were randomly allocated to five groups with six replicates and three birds in each replicate. The results showed that with increasing the level of DCP up to 12%, there were no significant differences among treatments for feed intake, egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, final body weight, yolk index, and yolk color. There were no significant differences between treatments in shell thickness, eggshell index, egg score, and Haugh unit. Utilization of DCP up to 16% significantly increased serum glucose and high-density lipoprotein and reduced cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (P &lt; 0.05).

19836057,"Perfluorinated and other persistent halogenated organic compounds in European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and common eider (Somateria mollissima) from Norway: a suburban to remote pollutant gradient.Samples of two marine bird species, European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and common eider (Somateria mollissima) sampled at a remote coastal site in Norway were analysed for POPs and PFCs. Additionally samples of common eider were analysed from two other locations in Norway, representing a gradient from  densely populated  to  remote . The variety, concentration and distribution of lipophilic POPs in comparison to PFCs were investigated. PCBs were the dominating group of contaminants in the analysed <e>egg</e> samples. Shag eggs had median sum PCBs levels of 4,580 ng/g l.w. in 2004. Six different PBDE congeners could be detected in the shag eggs. BDE 47 and 100 were the main contributors with 24 and 27 ng/g l.w. respectively, sum PBDEs was 90 ng/g l.w. Relatively high concentrations of chlordanes were found with a total sum of 903 ng/g l.w. Of other OCs, toxaphene 26 and 52 together (sum 657 ng/g l.w.) and HCB (165 ng/g l.w.) were contributing majorly to the egg burden. Sum HCHs were low; only 54 ng/g l.w. PFOS was the main PFC in egg, plasma and liver samples. Similar median levels of 29, 32 and 27 ng/g w.w. were observed. PFOSA, PFH x S, and PFDcA were observed additionally in all shag samples at minor concentrations with the exception of elevated levels observed in liver for PFOSA and PFDcA with median levels of 7.6 and 7.9 ng/g w.w., respectively. In common eider eggs, the POP concentrations decreased up to 1/8th along the sampled spatial gradient from suburban to remote. Of the 9 detected PFCs, PFOS dominated all samples by one order of magnitude, followed by PFOA. Sum PFC concentrations were twice as high at the two fjord sites compared to the remote site. Shorter chained PFCAs like PFOA and PFNA could be detected in the eider eggs whilst being absent in shag eggs.",M2
19834098,"Bacteriological contamination, dirt, and cracks of eggshells in furnished cages and noncage systems for laying hens: an international on-farm comparison.For laying hens, the effects of housing system on bacterial eggshell contamination and eggshell quality is almost exclusively studied in experimental hen houses. The aim of this study was to compare eggshell hygiene and quality under commercial conditions. Six flocks of laying hens in furnished cages and 7 flocks in noncage systems were visited when hens were about 60 wk of age. Farms from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany were included in the study. The following parameters were determined on <e>eggs</e> sampled at the egg belts: 1) bacterial eggshell contamination, as expressed by total count of aerobic bacteria and number of Enterobacteriaceae; 2) proportion of dirty eggs; and 3) proportion of cracked eggs and eggs with microcracks. Considerable within-flock differences were found in eggshell contamination with total count of aerobic bacteria, both for furnished cages (P &lt; or = 0.001, range 4.24 to 5.22 log cfu/eggshell) and noncage systems (P &lt; or = 0.001, range 4.35 to 5.51 log cfu/eggshell). On average, lower levels of contamination with total count of aerobic bacteria (4.75 vs. 4.98 log cfu/eggshell; P &lt; or = 0.001) were found on eggshells from furnished cages compared with noncage systems. Concerning Enterobacteriaceae, no significant difference in average eggshell contamination between both systems could be shown. The total percentage of cracked eggs was higher (P &lt; or = 0.01) in furnished cages (7.8%) compared with noncage systems (4.1%). This was, however, due to the high percentage of cracked eggs (24%) observed on one of the furnished cage farms. We conclude that bacteriological eggshell contamination and percentage of cracked eggs differed substantially between individual farms using the same housing system. This may also explain some discrepancies between the findings of the present study versus some findings of previous experimental studies or studies on a small number of farms. Although statistically significant, the average differences in bacteriological contamination of nest eggs between both housing systems have limited microbiological relevancy.",M2
19834097,"Effect of irradiation on foaming properties of <e>egg</e> white proteins.To investigate the effects of irradiation on structural and functional properties of egg white proteins, which enhance foaming ability, egg white was separated and irradiated at doses of 0, 2.5, and 5 kGy. The foaming ability of egg white was increased, whereas foam stability was decreased by irradiation. Turbidity and protein oxidation of egg white was increased by irradiation with an increase of irradiation dose. The content of free sulfhydryl and disulfide was not affected by irradiation. According to 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis, it was demonstrated that protein scissions are the main changes caused by irradiation and this protein modification may be the main reason for the improvement in foaming ability of egg white.",M2
19834096,"Bioactive amines and quality of <e>egg</e> from Dekalb hens under different storage conditions.The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using bioactive amines as an index of quality of fresh and stored eggs. Large white eggs from 24-wk-old Dekalb layers were randomly distributed in 3 groups: (i) 10 freshly laid eggs, (ii) 60 eggs stored at 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 60% RH for 30 d, and (iii) 50 eggs stored at 6 +/- 1 degrees C and 60% RH for 50 d. The eggs were weighed and the internal quality was evaluated by Haugh units (HU), pH of albumen, total solids, total volatile bases, and bioactive amines in the albumen and yolk. The fresh eggs had, on average, 56.85 g, 98.55 HU, albumen pH of 8.02, total solids of 12.17 g/100 g in the albumen and 52.43 g/100 g in the yolk, and absence of volatile bases. None of the 10 amines investigated were detected in the albumen; however, the yolk contained 0.37 mg/kg of spermidine. Throughout storage, there was a significant decrease in the weight of the egg and HU and a significant increase in the pH and in the total solids of the albumen. The decrease in HU and the increase in the total solids of the albumen were faster at 25 +/- 1 degrees C compared with 6 +/- 1 degrees C. At 50 and 30 d of storage at 6 +/- 1 and 25 +/- 1 degrees C, respectively, significant levels of total volatile bases were detected. The levels of spermidine in the yolk increased significantly at the 40th and 15th days of storage at 6 +/- 1 and 25 +/- 1 degrees C, respectively. At these storage times, the presence of putrescine and agmatine was also detected. Therefore, the presence of other amines besides spermidine or spermidine levels higher than 1.0 mg/kg in the yolk could be used as an index of quality of fresh eggs and throughout storage.",M2
19806810,"Effects of reduced calcium and phosphorous diets supplemented with phytase on laying performance of hens.The aim of this experiment was to examine the potential for reduced environmental impact by reducing dietary calcium and phosphorus content and phytase addition of laying hen diets. A randomized complete block design with a 2x2x2 factorial arrangement of 8 dietary treatments: 2 levels ofphytase (0 and 300 FTU kg(-1)) and 2 mineral levels (Ca: 34/18 and NPP: 3.2/2.2 g kg(-1), respectively). A total of 240 White Leghorn (WL) layers, 25 weeks of age were used. Considering birds in 12 cages as a replicate, 5 such replicates were randomly allotted to each dietary treatment. Individual body weight of the bird was recorded at the beginning and end of the experiment. <e>Egg</e> production on an individual basis was recorded daily and percentage hen day egg production was calculated. The cleaned eggshells were dried for 24 h, weighed and expressed as percentage of whole egg. One bird from each experimental unit were selected at random and killed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment and the left tibia was removed. Dried bone samples were ashed at 680 degrees C for 12 h for estimation of bone ash. The results of this experiment showed that reducing Ca and NPP (Non-Phytate Phosphorus) without phytase decreased BWG (Body Weight Gain), feed intake, FCE (Feed Conversion Efficiency), egg production, egg shell weight and tibia ash. However, phytase addition to low mineral diets completely corrected the adverse effects associated with low dietary Ca and NPP. It can therefore be concluded that reducing levels of Ca and NPP below current standards and phytase supplementation can reduce pollution potential from laying hen production without adversely affecting bird performance or welfare.",M2
19782811,"Validation of a confirmatory method for the determination of melamine in <e>egg</e> by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.A sensitive and reliable method was developed and validated for detection and confirmation of melamine in egg based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Trichloroacetic acid solution was used for sample extraction and precipitation of proteins. The aqueous extracts were subjected to solid-phase extraction by mixed-mode reversed-phase/strong cation-exchange cartridges. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode, melamine was determined by LC-MS/MS, which was completed in 5 min for each injection. For the GC-MS analysis, extracted melamine was derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide prior to selected ion monitoring detection in electron impact mode. The average recovery of melamine from fortified samples ranged from 85.2% to 103.2%, with coefficients of variation lower than 12%. The limit of detection obtained by GC-MS and UPLC-MS/MS was 10 and 5 microg kg(-1), respectively. This validated method was successfully applied to the determination of melamine in real samples from market.",M2

Liquid foods that are prepared or stored in bulk, including liquid egg products, are considered to be at potential risk for sabotage. Because of their versatility, low price, and functional properties, many of these products are being marketed. Four of the most common products of this type are whole egg, egg albumen, 10% sugared yolk, and 10% salted yolk. Although all of the serotypes of Salmonella enterica may cause illness, multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 has become widespread and can cause severe illness that is difficult to treat. Studies were conducted to determine growth patterns of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 in four commercial liquid egg products held at 4, 10, 20, 30, 37, and 42 degrees C for 0 to 384 h. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated twice. Standard methods were used to estimate cell numbers, and log CFU per gram of egg product was plotted against time. The number of cells of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 increased to 8 to 9 log CFU/g in whole egg and 10% sugared yolk, increased by 1 log CFU/g in liquid albumen, but decreased by 3 log CFU/g in 10% salted yolk. Data from this study have been archived in the ComBase database to further assist policy makers or other scientists interested in Salmonella growth characteristics in liquid eggs. However, based on data generated in this study, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 probably does not constitute a food threat agent in liquid eggs.",M2
19771155,"The feasibility of using high resolution genome sequencing of influenza A viruses to detect mixed infections and quasispecies.BACKGROUND: The rapidly expanding availability of de novo sequencing technologies can greatly facilitate efforts to monitor the relatively high mutation rates of influenza A viruses and the detection of quasispecies. Both the mutation rates and the lineages of influenza A viruses are likely to play an important role in the natural history of these viruses and the emergence of phenotypically and antigenically distinct strains. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated quasispecies and mixed infections by de novo sequencing the whole genomes of 10 virus isolates, including eight avian influenza viruses grown in embryonated chicken <e>eggs</e> (six waterfowl isolates - five H3N2 and one H4N6; an H7N3 turkey isolate; and a bald eagle isolate with H1N1/H2N1 mixed infection), and two tissue cultured H3N2 swine influenza viruses. Two waterfowl cloacal swabs were included in the analysis. Full-length sequences of all segments were obtained with 20 to 787-X coverage for the ten viruses and one cloacal swab. The second cloacal swab yielded 15 influenza reads of approximately 230 bases, sufficient for bioinformatic inference of mixed infections or quasispecies. Genomic subpopulations or quasispecies of viruses were identified in four egg grown avian influenza isolates and one cell cultured swine virus. A bald eagle isolate and the second cloacal swab showed evidence of mixed infections with two (H1 and H2) and three (H1, H3, and H4) HA subtypes, respectively. Multiple sequence differences were identified between cloacal swab and the virus recovered using embryonated chicken eggs. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new approach to comprehensively identify mixed infections and quasispecies in low passage influenza A isolates and cloacal swabs and add to the understanding of the ecology of influenza A virus populations.",M2

19767114,"A flock-tailored early warning system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in commercial <e>egg</e> laying flocks.The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an early warning system (EWS) for commercial egg laying flocks to detect the subtle mortality and egg production changes that characterize low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infections. An EWS will create an alert when the recommended 'trigger point' is reached or exceeded. Previously used EWSs are based on fixed alert levels, while the proposed EWS customizes the alert level to each flock. While a fixed approach may be valid for highly pathogenic diseases, it results in a lower detection probability for low pathogenic diseases. The EWS was based on daily data collected from flocks affected by the 2000-2004 H6N2 LPAI epidemic in California. Three EWSs were evaluated: (1) EWS1, which is triggered when the observed mortality increase or production decrease exceeds more than  x  times the expected daily value (2.75-3.50 times the expected mortality), (2) EWS2, which is triggered when the observed mortality increase or production decrease exceeds more than  y  times during each of 2 consecutive days the expected daily values (1.75-2.15 times the expected mortality), and (3) a combination of the two. The EWSs were evaluated according to three parameters: detection delay (days) of a LPAI outbreak, false alerts (%) and outbreaks missed (%). Results showed that an egg production-based EWS added no benefit to a mortality-based system, mainly because H6N2 LPAI-related egg production decrease always occurred after increase in mortality. Combining the two EWSs resulted in a reduced detection delay and no missed outbreaks, but at the expense of a slight increase in the number of false alerts triggered. The system presented in this study also outperformed fixed EWSs in all three evaluated parameters. The proposed EWS, if used as part of a poultry cooperative program and combined with a rapid laboratory diagnosis, could be a useful tool in the detection and control of LPAI outbreaks and other poultry diseases. Built in a spreadsheet, the system could be inexpensively, easily and quickly incorporated into a commercial egg production farm decision support system. In addition, the proposed system could be quickly adjusted to changing epidemic situations, and easily customized to individual flocks.",M2
19762102,"Probabilistic model for contamination of <e>egg</e> dishes with Salmonella spp. made from shell eggs produced on the island of Ireland.A quantitative model was constructed to estimate the probability that a serving of food containing eggs produced on the island of Ireland is contaminated with Salmonella spp. The model is based on the prevalence of contaminated eggs at the time of lay and a set of parameters which describe the pooling of eggs in the home and in catering situations. Both external and internal contamination of the eggs by Salmonella spp. was considered. The model estimates that there is a 90% chance that the probability of a serving of food being contaminated is between 0.0043% and 0.038%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that egg prevalence drives this low probability and that, at the current level of egg prevalence at the time of lay, pooling of eggs has a minor effect. These results indicate the importance of maintaining the low prevalence of contaminated eggs at the time of lay to minimise the risk of human cases of salmonellosis from consumption of eggs.",M2
19750104,"Chemical contamination of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) <e>eggs</e> in peninsular Malaysia: implications for conservation and public health.BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)-such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)-and heavy metals have been reported in sea turtles at various stages of their life cycle. These chemicals can disrupt development and function of wildlife. Furthermore, in areas such as Peninsular Malaysia, where the human consumption of sea turtle eggs is prevalent, egg contamination may also have public health implications. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we investigated conservation and human health risks associated with the chemical contamination of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) eggs in Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: Fifty-five C. mydas eggs were collected from markets in Peninsular Malaysia and analyzed for POPs and heavy metals. We conducted screening risk assessments (SRAs) and calculated the percent of acceptable daily intake (ADI) for POPs and metals to assess conservation and human health risks associated with egg contamination. RESULTS: C. mydas eggs were available in 9 of the 33 markets visited. These eggs came from seven nesting areas from as far away as Borneo Malaysia. SRAs indicated a significant risk to embryonic development associated with the observed arsenic concentrations. Furthermore, the concentrations of coplanar PCBs represented 3 300 times the ADI values set by the World Health Organization. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of POPs and heavy metals reported in C. mydas eggs from markets in Peninsular Malaysia pose considerable risks to sea turtle conservation and human health.",M2

This investigation included three experiments to determine whether the iron content of egg yolks could be enriched by supplementation of the laying diet with iron bound to organic compounds (Experiment 1), serine and methyl group donors methionine and choline (Experiment 2) or phytoestrogens (Experiment 3). 2. Hens at 34, 54 and 56 weeks of age were given experimental diets for 6, 4 and 4 weeks, respectively, in Experiments 1-3. Yolks from eggs laid over three successive days in the final week of feeding were pooled for each hen for analysis of iron by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. 3. Iron concentration in egg yolk averaged 68-70, 66-71 and 62-69 microg/g in the respective experiments. 4. The addition of bloodmeal (1.22 mg Fe/egg) or phytoestrogens (1.25 mg Fe/egg) increased the total iron content of yolks by over 15% compared with the control diet (1.10 mg Fe/egg), and although this increase was not statistically significant it suggests that the iron content of eggs could be sufficiently manipulated to justify a nutritional claim of iron enrichment.",M2

The analytical protocol involves a one-step extraction followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry. Analytes were extracted from 1g of egg spiked with an internal standard (josamycin) with acetonitrile. In terms of accuracy, matrix effect and ion signal stability, no extract cleanup was found to be necessary. After partial solvent removal, the final extract was injected into the LC column. Extraction was effective, since absolute recovery of the analyte in egg at their maximum residue limit (MRL) level was 85-102%. Estimated limits of quantification (S/N=10) were 0.2-0.5 ng/g. Based on the EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, the method was in-house validated in terms of ruggedness, specificity, linearity, within-laboratory reproducibility, decision limit (CCalpha) and detection capability (CCbeta). The within-laboratory reproducibility, expressed as RSD (n=18 at the MRL levels), was not higher than 13%.

An electronic nose was used to distinguish eggs under cool and room-temperature storage by means of principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), BP neural network (BPNN) and the combination of a genetic algorithm and BP neural network (GANN). Results showed that the E-nose could distinguish eggs of different storage time under cool and room-temperature storage by LDA, PCA, BPNN and GANN; better prediction values were obtained by GANN than by BPNN. Relationships were established between the E-nose signal and egg quality indices (Haugh unit and yolk factor) by quadratic polynomial step regression (QPSR). The prediction models for Haugh unit and yolk factor indicated a good prediction performance. The Haugh unit model had a standard error of prediction of 3.74 and correlation coefficient 0.91; the yolk factor model had a 0.02 SEP and 0.93 correlation coefficient between predicted and measured values respectively.",M2

19687271,"Chicken lines divergently selected for antibody responses to sheep red blood cells show line-specific differences in sensitivity to immunomodulation by diet. Part I: Humoral parameters.Individual differences in nutrient sensitivity have been suggested to be related with differences in stress sensitivity. Here we used layer hens divergently selected for high and low specific antibody responses to SRBC (i.e., low line hens and high line hens), reflecting a genetically based differential immune competence. The parental line of these hens was randomly bred as the control line and was used as well. Recently, we showed that these selection lines differ in their stress reactivity; the low line birds show a higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. To examine maternal effects and neonatal nutritional exposure on nutrient sensitivity, we studied 2 subsequent generations. This also created the opportunity to examine <e>egg</e> production in these birds. The 3 lines were fed 2 different nutritionally complete layer feeds for a period of 22 wk in the first generation. The second generation was fed from hatch with the experimental diets. At several time intervals, parameters reflecting humoral immunity were determined such as specific antibody to Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease vaccines; levels of natural antibodies binding lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin; and classical and alternative complement activity. The most pronounced dietary-induced effects were found in the low line birds of the first generation: specific antibody titers to Newcastle disease vaccine were significantly elevated by 1 of the 2 diets. In the second generation, significant differences were found in lipoteichoic acid natural antibodies of the control and low line hens. At the end of the observation period of egg parameters, a significant difference in egg weight was found in birds of the high line. Our results suggest that nutritional differences have immunomodulatory effects on innate and adaptive humoral immune parameters in birds with high HPA axis reactivity and affect egg production in birds with low HPA axis reactivity.",M2

19681394,"[German poultry farming between animal welfare and global market]Despite the positive tendencies concerning sales output in the poultry production, the margins per single animal are extremely low. This circumstance leads inevitably to an increasing number of animals per farm. Also the German <e>egg</e> production is currently confronted with a great challenge due to changes of the legislation of animal welfare in animal farming (German Tierschutz-Nutztierhaltungs-Verordnung), the EU-zoonosis-regulation (2160/2003) and because of the avian influenza difficulties. In addition, the globalization has tightened the competitive conditions during production. Therefore, innovation potential and specialization are mandatory premises for the continuity within a free market economy. In all farming systems there has to be made a consideration between animal welfare, economy and ecology, whereas, based on animal welfare, the  ethical limit  has the utmost importance. It has to be accounted for the concept of fulfilment of demand and prevention of harm. The success of agricultural animal farming depends, last but not least, on a good and robust state of health of the live stock. The German consumer will have to accept that a high quality and high welfare poultry product will have their price, even in the global market. The sale orientation on non-European production methods is not acceptable under the aspect of animal welfare.",M2

The study was carried out in two phases in Komolorume and Kawere villages in Rongo and Rachuonyo districts, respectively. The first phase was a cross-sectional study in 81 farms selected by cluster sampling to get the overview of the indigenous chicken production. A four-month prospective longitudinal study in 60 farms randomly selected from the previous 81 farms followed. Mean flock sizes per household were 20 and 18 birds in Komolorume and Kawere, respectively. Overall mean flock size was 19 birds ranging from 1 to 64. The mean clutch size, <e>egg</e> weight and hatchability were 12 eggs, 48 g and 81% respectively in Komolorume and 10 eggs, 45 g and 70%, respectively, in Kawere.

The target region was selected based on the enterotoxigenic profiles of 75 Bacillus strains. The inclusivity and exclusivity of the RTi-PCR assay were assessed with 59 isolates of the B. cereus group, 16 other Bacillus spp., and 4 non-Bacillus strains. The assay was also used to construct calibration curves for different food matrices, and it had a wide quantification range of 6 log units using both serial dilutions of purified DNA and calibrated cell suspensions of B. cereus CECT 148(T). The detection limit for B. cereus in artificially contaminated liquid <e>egg</e> and reconstituted infant formula was about 3CFU per reaction or 60CFU/ml of food, with a relative accuracy of 86.27% to 116.12% in artificially contaminated liquid egg.

19646060,"Detection of mustard, <e>egg</e>, milk, and gluten in salad dressing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a commonly used method for the detection of trace amounts of potentially allergenic protein residues in foods. However, food matrices and processing conditions can affect the detection of protein residues. The effects of acidity on the detectability of several allergenic proteins commonly found in salad dressing using ELISAs was investigated. First, recovery experiments were performed on salad dressing formulated with 0 to 1000 ppm mustard flour (mustard). The mean percent recovery for mustard from the salad dressing was only 7.7%+/- 1.6%. When the pH of the salad dressing was adjusted to pH 7 prior to spiking with mustard, recovery improved to 94.1%+/- 7.6%. However, if the pH was adjusted to pH 7 after spiking and extraction, the recovery was only 11.1%+/- 1.7%. When vinegar was spiked with mustard flour at pH 3, 3.5, and 4, detectability of mustard was lowest at pH 3. Basic extraction of mustard proteins from salad dressing did not improve the mustard detection. Acidic salad dressing matrices reduced the detectability of mustard by the mustard ELISA probably because of acid precipitation of mustard proteins that renders them insoluble and nonextractable. Commercial salad dressings containing 100 ppm (mg/kg) of egg, milk, or gluten were analyzed every 2 to 4 d for 90 d using 3 commercially available ELISAs. A decrease in the detection of the egg, milk, and gluten in the salad dressing upon storage was observed. Our study highlighted the importance of evaluating the utility of various ELISAs for specific food matrices and the recovery as a function of product storage.",M2
19632750,"Review of Russian-language studies on radionuclide behaviour in agricultural animals: part 4. Transfer to poultry.Data on radionuclide transfer to domestic chickens and ducks obtained from research performed in the former Soviet Union were reviewed to provide transfer coefficient values (Ff) to poultry and edible <e>egg</e> contents. The majority of the data are from experiments with (90)Sr and (137)Cs, reflecting the importance of these radionuclides after global fallout and major radiation accidents. Data for (3)H, (54)Mn, (59)Fe, (60)Co, (22)Na (65)Zn, (131)I and U are also given. The values derived have been compared with those in the current IAEA Handbook of parameter values for the prediction of radionuclide transfer in temperate environments (TRS 364) and the recent revision which incorporates the values from this paper. The Russian-language data give improved estimates for many radionuclides and the revised handbook is now based on the better quality data given for chronic administration.",M2
19607653,"Extent and consistency of linkage disequilibrium and identification of DNA markers for production and <e>egg</e> quality traits in commercial layer chicken populations.BACKGROUND: The genome sequence and a high-density SNP map are now available for the chicken and can be used to identify genetic markers for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). Effective MAS requires high linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL), and sustained marker-QTL LD over generations. This study used data from a 3,000 SNP panel to assess the level and consistency of LD between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) over consecutive years in two egg-layer chicken lines, and analyzed one line by two methods (SNP-wise association and genome-wise Bayesian analysis) to identify markers associated with egg-quality and egg-production phenotypes. RESULTS: The LD between markers pairs was high at short distances (r2 &gt; 0.2 at &lt; 2 Mb) and remained high after one generation (correlations of 0.80 to 0.92 at &lt; 5 Mb) in both lines. Single- and 3-SNP regression analyses using a mixed model with SNP as fixed effect resulted in 159 and 76 significant tests (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, across 12 traits. A Bayesian analysis called BayesB, that fits all SNPs simultaneously as random effects and uses model averaging procedures, identified 33 SNPs that were included in the model &gt;20% of the time (phi &gt; 0.2) and an additional ten 3-SNP windows that had a sum of phi greater than 0.35. Generally, SNPs included in the Bayesian model also had a small P-value in the 1-SNP analyses. CONCLUSION: High LD correlations between markers at short distances across two generations indicate that such markers will retain high LD with linked QTL and be effective for MAS. The different association analysis methods used provided consistent results. Multiple single SNPs and 3-SNP windows were significantly associated with egg-related traits, providing genomic positions of QTL that can be useful for both MAS and to identify causal mutations.",M2
19618772,"<e>Egg</e>-associated Salmonella outbreak in an aged care facility, New South Wales, 2008.Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease that causes acute gastroenteritis, with sudden onset of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and sometimes vomiting. Infection is often associated with the consumption of foods prepared using raw eggs. During July to August 2008 an outbreak at an aged care facility (ACF) in New South Wales was confirmed as Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 44 (Stm 44) in eight of 45 residents. Two additional probable cases also occurred. Cases were located in each unit of the ACF and for 5 cases, onset of diarrhoea was between 45 to 64 hours (median of 46 hours) after consumption of a dessert containing raw eggs. Onset for 5 further cases occurred up to 9 days after this meal. Eggs were supplied to the ACF from a local farm. Stm 44 was detected on an egg in an unopened box at the ACF from this supplier. The raw-egg dessert was epidemiologically implicated as the likely source of the Salmonella and delayed onset cases may have resulted from ingestion of a smaller dose of Salmonella, or ongoing transmission through cross-contamination of kitchen machinery or surfaces. This outbreak demonstrates that inadequate cooking of eggs continues to pose a risk for Salmonella infection in settings with vulnerable populations. The findings of the investigation provide support for the importance of food safety regulations and demand further advocacy for measures to reduce the risks associated with the distribution, storage and preparation of shell eggs.",M2
19610264,"Allergenicity of wine containing processing aids: a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge.BACKGROUND: The European Union requires allergenic food ingredients to appear on labels in order to protect allergic consumers. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether traces of <e>egg</e>-, milk-, and fish-derived processing aids used in winemaking might elicit clinical reactions in food-allergic patients. METHODS: Five German wines were fined with a high dose of egg albumin, lysozyme, milk casein, fish gelatin, or isinglass, and filtered. Fourteen adults with allergy to egg (n = 5), milk (n = 5), or fish (n = 4) were included. Skin prick tests were performed with fining agents, and fined and unfined wines. All patients underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges with fined and unfined wines. RESULTS: Skin prick tests were positive to hen's egg (n = 5), ovalbumin (n = 5), lysozyme (n = 4), cow's milk (n = 5), casein (n = 4), and cod (n = 3), but not to isinglass or fish gelatin (n = 0). Positive skin prick test results were observed for wines fined with albumin (n = 3), lysozyme (n = 2), casein (n = 1), gelatin (n = 0), and isinglass (n = 3), and for unfined wines (n = 1-2 in each patient group), with no significant differences between groups. Seventy-five percent of skin test-positive patients had specific immunoglobulin E to other allergens present in wine (eg, carbohydrates). The provocation test revealed no reactions to fined or unfined wines. CONCLUSIONS: Although concentrated fining agents containing ovalbumin, lysozyme, and casein were allergenic in the skin prick test, no patient reacted adversely in the provocation test to fined wine. Wines treated with fining agents at commercial concentrations appear not to present a risk to allergic individuals when filtered,",M2

19580454,"Synergistic effect of high hydrostatic pressure and natural antimicrobials on inactivation kinetics of Bacillus cereus in a liquid whole <e>egg</e> and skim milk mixed beverage.An in-depth study was conducted in order to extend the storage life of a liquid whole egg-skim milk (LWE-SM) mixed beverage to enhance its safety and the safety of related beverages. Bacillus cereus vegetative cells (1 x 10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) were inoculated in LWE-SM beverages with or without natural antimicrobial supplements: flavonol rich-cocoa powder (cocoanOX 12%, CCX) (700 ppm), vanillin (700 ppm), anise (700 ppm), and cinnamon (700 ppm). B. cereus cells were maintained at 10 degrees C for 10 days in the different beverages to test the bacteriostatic or inhibitory effect of the aforementioned ingredients. Beverages were treated with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology and stored at 10 degrees C for 15 days after treatment. All natural antimicrobials reduced the micro(max) values and increased the lag phase time of B. cereus, and Gompertz growth curves showed different inhibitory effects depending on the substance. The maximum inhibitory effect (1.330 log cycle reduction) was achieved in LWE-SM-cinnamon-supplemented beverage. The maximum inactivation achieved by HHP in LWE-SM beverage was a reduction of around 3.89 +/- 0.25 log cycles at 300 MPa for 12 minutes. When supplemented beverages were treated under the same conditions, enhanced inactivation levels were achieved. This increased inactivation can be attributed to a synergistic effect when the LWE-SM was supplemented with flavonol-rich cocoa powder, cinnamon, and vanillin. The maximum synergistic effect was observed in LWE-SM-CCX-supplemented beverage. During the refrigerated storage of B. cereus HHP-treated cells in beverages to which antimicrobials had been added, the inhibitory effect was dependent on the previously applied pressure level.",M2
19565473,"Modulation of Zn-induced hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance in Wistar rat fed modified poultry <e>egg</e>(psi).Excessive bioavailability of Zn causes Cu and Mg deficiencies resulting in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. These defects may ameliorate if the ionic imbalance in them is corrected. In view of this, three groups of rats were included in this study. Initially, they were fed on semi-synthetic equicalories basal diet containing 20 mg Zn (control, group-I), on 40 mg Zn (group-II) and 80 mg Zn/kg diet (group-III) respectively for 3 months. Thereafter, half of the rats in group-II and III were shifted on Cu and Mg enriched modified poultry egg (ME(Psi)) mixed diets (groups-IIME and IIIME) while the remaining were continued to feed on their respective diets for another 3 months completing a total of 6 months. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercortisolemia, hyperzincemia, hypercupremia and hypermagnesaemia with corresponding increase of lipid droplets in the zona fasciculate of adrenal cortex and reduction in liver glycogen content in rats of groups-II and III were recorded. These changes were linked with a rise in Zn and fall in Cu and Mg in their liver. The addition of ME(Psi) in their diets led to fall of Zn and rise in liver Cu and Mg, and fall in serum Zn, Cu and Mg resulting in the improvement of glucose disposal, increase in insulin sensitivity, reduction in lipid droplets in zona fasciculate and increase in glycogen content in the liver approaching closer to the control group-I. The data suggest that these ME(Psi) can serve as non-pharmacological dietary supplement to prevent insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia in populations who are at higher risk of diabetes mellitus either due to their genetic predisposition of excessive absorption and retention of Zn or due to higher Zn content in the food chain.",M2
19549026,"Basophil activation tests for the diagnosis of food allergy in children.BACKGROUND: Positive skin prick tests (SPT) for food allergens and specific IgE (sIgE) in serum indicate sensitization but do not enable distinction between sensitized but tolerant and clinically allergic patients. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we evaluate the clinical relevance of basophil activation tests (BATs) for peanut or <e>egg</e> allergy diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty-two peanut-allergic, 14 peanut-sensitized (sIgE(+) and/or SPT(+) to peanuts) but tolerant children and 29 controls with no history of an adverse reaction to peanuts were included. Similarly, 31 egg-allergic, 14 egg-sensitized children (sIgE(+) and/or SPT(+) to egg white) and 22 controls were studied. Flow cytometric analysis of CD63 expression or CD203c upregulation on basophils and the production of leukotrienes (LT) were performed in response to an in vitro crude peanut extract or ovalbumin (OVA) challenge. RESULTS: After in vitro peanut challenge, the basophils from peanut-allergic children showed significantly higher levels of activation than those from controls (P&lt;0.001). After OVA challenge, a similar distinction (P&lt;0.001) was observed between egg-allergics and controls. Interestingly, the majority of egg- or peanut-sensitized children failed to activate basophils, respectively, in response to OVA and peanut challenge. The sensitivity of the CD63, CD203c and LT assay was 86.7%, 89.5% and 76.0% with a specificity of 94.1%, 97.1% and 94.6% for peanut allergy diagnosis. The corresponding performances of BATs applied to egg allergy diagnosis were 88.9%, 62.5% and 77.8% for the sensitivity and 100%, 96.4% and 96.4% for the specificity. CONCLUSION: Neither conventional tests nor BATs are sensitive and specific enough to predict food allergy accurately. However, BATs may helpfully complete conventional tests, especially SPT, allowing improved discrimination between allergic and non-allergic individuals.",M2
19539944,"In-house validation of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for determination of semicarbazide in <e>eggs</e> and stability of analyte in matrix.An improved LC-MS/MS method for the determination of semicarbazide in whole egg is described. Waters OASIS-MCX cation exchange purification cartridges increased the sensitivity for analysis by LC-MS/MS. The validation study was carried out according to criteria and requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC for confirmatory analysis and provided the data as follows: The correlation coefficient for the matrix calibration curve, in the range of 0-5 microg kg(-1), was r=0.9968. The detection capability and decision limit, measured according to ISO11843-2, were CCalpha=0.20 microg kg(-1) and CCbeta=0.25 microg kg(-1). Repeatability (CVSr) and within-laboratory reproducibility (CVSwr) determined for the concentration levels of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 microg kg(-1) SEM ranged from 11.9 to 5.7% and 11.8 to 6.3%, respectively. The validated method was applied to investigate SEM stability in incurred materials (egg homogenates) during long-term storage at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C.

19535140,"Risk assessment of PCDD/Fs levels in human tissues related to major food items based on chemical analyses and micro-EROD assay.Nine groups of food items (freshwater fish, marine fish, pork, chicken, chicken <e>eggs</e>, leafy, non-leafy vegetables, rice and flour) and three types of human samples (human milk, maternal serum and cord serum) were collected for the analysis of PCDD/Fs. Results of chemical analysis revealed PCDD/Fs concentrations (pg g(-1) fat) in the following ascending order: pork (0.289 pg g(-1) fat), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) (freshwater fish) (0.407), golden thread (Nemipterus virgatus) (marine fish) (0.511), chicken (0.529), mandarin fish (Siniperca kneri) (marine fish) (0.535), chicken egg (0.552), and snubnose pompano (Trachinotus blochii) (marine fish) (1.219). The results of micro-EROD assay showed relatively higher PCDD/Fs levels in fish (2.65 pg g(-1) fat) when compared with pork (0.47), eggs (0.33), chicken (0.13), flour (0.07), vegetables (0.05 pg g(-1) wet wt) and rice (0.05). The estimated average daily intake of PCDD/Fs of 3.51 pg EROD-TEQ/kg bw/day was within the range of WHO Tolerable Daily Intake (1-4 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw/day) and was higher than the Provisional Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTL) (70 pg for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs) recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) [Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), Summary and conclusions of the fifty-seventh meeting, JECFA, 2001.]. Nevertheless, the current findings were significantly lower than the TDI (14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg/bw/day) recommended by the Scientific Committee on Food of the Europe Commission [European Scientific Committee on Food (EU SCF), Opinions on the SCF on the risk assessment of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food, 2000.]. However, it should be noted that micro-EROD assay overestimates the PCDD/Fs levels by 2 to 7 folds which may also amplify the PCDD/Fs levels accordingly. Although the levels of PCDD/Fs obtained from micro-EROD assay were much higher than those obtained by chemical analysis by 2 to 7 folds, it provides a cost-effective and rapid screening of dioxin levels in food and human samples.",M2
19531721,"Laying performance and <e>egg</e> quality of blue-shelled layers as affected by different housing systems.Blue-shelled eggs are gaining popularity as the consumption demand diversifies in some countries. This study was carried out to investigate the laying performance and egg quality of the blue-shelled egg layers as well as the effects of different housing systems on egg production and quality traits. One thousand pullets from Dongxiang blue-shelled layers were divided into 2 even groups and kept in different housing systems (outdoor vs. cage). Daily laying performance was recorded from 20 to 60 wk of age. External and internal egg quality traits were examined at 26, 34, 42, and 50 wk. Yolk cholesterol concentration and whole egg cholesterol content were measured at 40 wk of age. Average laying rate from 20 to 60 wk for the cage (54.7%) was significantly higher than that of outdoor layers (39.3%). Among all of the egg quality traits, only eggshell color was affected by housing system. Interaction between housing system and layer age was found in egg weight, eggshell color, eggshell ratio, yolk color, and yolk weight. Meanwhile, cholesterol concentration in yolk was 8.64 +/- 0.40 mg/g in the outdoor eggs, which was significantly lower than that of eggs from the cage birds (10.32 +/- 0.48 mg/g; P &lt; 0.05). Whole egg cholesterol content in the outdoor eggs (125.23 +/- 6.32 mg/egg) was also significantly lower than that of eggs from the caged layers (158.01 +/- 8.62 mg/egg). The results demonstrated that blue-shelled layers have lower productivity in the outdoor system than in the cage system. Blue-shelled layers have lower egg weight, larger yolk proportion, and lower cholesterol content compared with commercial layers. In a proper marketing system, lower productivity could be balanced by a higher price for the better quality of blue-shelled eggs.",M2
19531705,"Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat on the performance of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum.The effects of F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation and 1.5% supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) on the performance of commercial layers between 20 and 58 wk of age were investigated. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk and dietary treatments (basal control diets and basal control diets with 1.5% supplemental PF) were initiated at 20 wk of age. Mortality at wk 47 and 53 was greatest in birds inoculated with FMG at 22 wk. Feed consumption from 20 to 23 and from 52 to 55 wk of age was greater in birds that were inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk). However, feed consumption decreased in birds that were inoculated at 12 wk (sham or FMG) when 1.5% supplemental PF was added to the diet. Percentage of total <e>egg</e> production (EP) between 22 and 58 wk of age was highest in hens that were inoculated with FMG at 22 wk. Furthermore, weekly EP increased at wk 27 and 58 and decreased at wk 47 after birds had been inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk), and increased at 22 wk and decreased at 54 wk when inoculations (sham or FMG) were given at 22 wk. Egg weight was increased at wk 29, 31, 39, 40, 42, 44, 53, and 58 in birds that were inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk); however, there were no coherent treatment effects on eggshell quality. An FMG inoculation at 22 wk may promote total EP through 58 wk, whereas the inoculation of commercial layers with FMG (12 or 22 wk) may increase subsequent feed consumption during the early and late stages of EP and increase egg weight throughout lay. However, the supplementation of hen diets with 1.5% PF beginning at 20 wk of age may reduce subsequent feed consumption throughout lay in birds having experienced a prelay (12 wk) inoculation.",M2

Immunoprophylactic effects of crude Schistosoma mansoni worms and egg antigens mixed with or without saponins extracted from Atriplex nummularia were studied followed by challenge with 80 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Our results showed that post 1st immunization with schistosome egg antigens (SEA) there was a significant change (P approximately 0.05) in the IgM levels against Fasciola egg homogenate (FgEH) without saponins. Post 2nd immunization with SEA mixed with saponins the levels of IgM increased significantly (P approximately 0.05) against Fasciola worm homogenate (FgWH) as compared with a non-immunized group. Post 2nd immunization the level of IgG was significantly elevated (P approximately 0.05) by SEA mixed with saponins against FgWH. Post 2nd immunizations with SEA mixed with saponins showed a significant change (P approximately 0.05) in IgG levels against FgEH.

19524583,"Yolk testosterone and corticosterone in hierarchical follicles and laid <e>eggs</e> of Japanese quail exposed to long-term restraint stress.Environmental and behavioural stimuli experienced by egg-laying female birds contribute to intra- and inter-female differences in hormones in the egg yolk with consequences for offspring development. The understanding of physiological mechanisms underlying yolk hormone deposition can aid progress in this field. In our study, we measured the concentration of testosterone and corticosterone in hierarchical follicles and egg yolks of Japanese quail in control and chronic stress conditions. Experimental females were reared under hypodynamia, a model situation for restraint stress, from day 3 to 63 days of age. For yolk hormone analysis, four largest follicles of ovarian hierarchy (F1-F4), eggs present in the oviduct and eggs laid on the day before were collected. In chronically stressed birds, yolk testosterone concentrations decreased from F2 onwards, while yolk corticosterone content was increased from the beginning to the end of egg formation. The follicular profile of hormones suggested testosterone transfer into the yolk directly from granulosa and theca cells, with the highest accumulation during a period 48-72 h before laying the egg. Yolk corticosterone was accumulated from maternal plasma preferentially in early stages of follicular development under control conditions and also in last stages of egg formation under stress conditions. These specific patterns of hormone deposition indicate periods when stimuli experienced by female can substantially modify hormonal content of eggs. Lower testosterone and increased corticosterone yolk concentrations in stressed quail may represent signals mediating information about adverse environmental conditions from the mother to progeny.",M2
19514900,"Producing selenium-enriched <e>eggs</e> and meat to improve the selenium status of the general population.The role of selenium (Se) in human health and diseases has been discussed in detail in several recent reviews, with the main conclusion being that selenium deficiency is recognised as a global problem which urgently needs resolution. Since selenium content in plant-based food depends on its availability from soil, the level of this element in food and feeds varies among regions. In general, eggs and meat are considered to be good sources of selenium in human diet. When considering ways to improve human selenium intake, there are several potential options. These include direct supplementation, soil fertilisation and supplementation of food staples such as flour, and production of functional foods. Analysing recent publications related to functional food production, it is evident that selenium-enriched eggs can be used as an important delivery system of this trace mineral for humans. In particular, developments and commercialisation of organic forms of selenium have initiated a new era in the availability of selenium-enriched products. It has been shown that egg selenium content can easily be manipulated to give increased levels, especially when organic selenium is included in hens' diet at levels that provide 0.3-0.5 mg/kg selenium in the feed. As a result, technology for the production of eggs delivering approximately 50% (30-35 microg) of the human selenium RDA have been developed and successfully tested. Currently companies all over the world market selenium-enriched eggs including the UK, Ireland, Mexico, Columbia, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Turkey, Russia and the Ukraine. Prices for enriched eggs vary from country to country, typically being similar to free-range eggs. Selenium-enriched chicken, pork and beef can also be produced when using organic selenium in the diet of poultry and farm animals. The scientific, technological and other advantages and limitations of producing designer/modified eggs as functional foods are discussed in this review.",M2
19491385,"Meat, <e>eggs</e>, dairy products, and risk of breast cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.BACKGROUND: A Western diet is associated with breast cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation of meat, egg, and dairy product consumption with breast cancer risk by using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). DESIGN: Between 1992 and 2003, information on diet was collected from 319,826 women. Disease hazard ratios were estimated with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Breast cancer cases (n = 7119) were observed during 8.8 y (median) of follow-up. No consistent association was found between breast cancer risk and the consumption of any of the food groups under study, when analyzed by both categorical and continuous exposure variable models. High processed meat consumption was associated with a modest increase in breast cancer risk in the categorical model (hazard ratio: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20; highest compared with lowest quintile: P for trend = 0.07). Subgroup analyses suggested an association with butter consumption, limited to premenopausal women (hazard ratio: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.53; highest compared with lowest quintile: P for trend = 0.21). Between-country heterogeneity was found for red meat (Q statistic = 18.03; P = 0.05) and was significantly explained (P = 0.023) by the proportion of meat cooked at high temperature. CONCLUSIONS: We have not consistently identified intakes of meat, eggs, or dairy products as risk factors for breast cancer. Future studies should investigate the possible role of high-temperature cooking in the relation of red meat intake with breast cancer risk.",M2
19486494,"Comparative analysis on antibiotic resistance characteristics of Listeria spp. and Enterococcus spp. isolated from laying hens and <e>eggs</e> in conventional and organic keeping systems in Bavaria, Germany.By investigating the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria from organic and conventional keeping systems of laying hens, it was to be determined to what extent these properties are influenced by the different systems. For this purpose, a total of 799 cloacal swabs and 800 egg samples were examined. Prevalences for all selected bacteria from cloacal swabs were much the same for both organic and caged birds: Listeria spp.1.3%[org] versus 1.6%[con]; Enterococcus spp. 95.5%[org] versus 97.5%[con]. Egg contents and eggshells were generally contaminated to a lesser extent, primarily with Enterococcus spp. Listeria isolates were susceptible to almost all tested antibiotics, only three Listeria innocua from conventional keepings were resistant to clindamycin; one isolate additionally to imipenem. High percentages of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant to doxycycline and macrolides. Enterococcus faecium proved to have high resistance rates to clindamycin, fosfomycin and erythromycin; 9.1% were even resistant to the reserve antibiotic synercid. Further, Enterococcus spp. showed higher resistance rates to doxycycline, erythromycin, fosfomycin and rifampicin. No glycopeptide resistant enterococci were detected. A correlation between keeping system and resistance/susceptibility rates could be demonstrated. In detail, E. faecalis from organic laying hen husbandries showed significant lower resistance prevalences to tylosin, streptomycin and doxycycline; susceptibility rates were higher for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Rifampicin and imipenem were more effective in isolates from conventional keepings (P &lt; 0.05). The amounts of resistant isolates of the Enterococcus raffinosus from organic farms were significantly lower, the amounts of sensitive isolates were significantly higher than from conventional farms concerning eight antibiotics (P &lt; 0.05). When comparing the susceptibility/resistance rates, as well as the mean minimum inhibitory concentrations values, the consistent tendency is that bacteria from organic layer flocks are more susceptible to antimicrobials. These results show that organic livestock farming plays a part in contributing to reduced antibiotic resistance.",M2

Pullets were individually caged at 16 wk and assigned to 1 of 4 feed allocation groups. Three groups had feed allocated on a group basis with divergent target BW: standard (STD), HIGH (STD x 1.1), and LOW (STD x 0.9). The fourth group had individual-based feed allocation (IND) and followed the STD BW target. The linear model expressed MEI as a function of BW(0.75), ADG, <e>egg</e> mass (EM), and temperature. Nonlinear mixed models employed a normally distributed term associated with hen metabolic BW, and exponential terms of ADG and EM, or Cobb-Douglas form interactions between terms. Fit was evaluated with the Bayesian information criterion and systematic bias was analyzed through linear regressions of observed versus expected values. The linear model estimated energy partitioned to maintenance and retention in the range of reported values in the literature. However, this model had the poorest fit (R(2) = 0.64) and exhibited a slope bias of 0.91 (i.e., MEI was overestimated at low values and underestimated at high values). The first nonlinear mixed model indicated that MEI partitioned to ADG was a factor of ADG(1.15), whereas the ME partitioned to EM was a factor of EM(1.12). This model had improved fit (R(2) = 0.71) relative to the linear model. The second nonlinear mixed model indicated that the energy requirement for ADG increased by 0.60% and the EM energy requirement decreased by 2.07% for each 1% increment in BW. This model further improved fit (R(2) = 0.75). Nonlinear mixed models reduced estimation bias by accounting for individual variation in maintenance energy expenditure. These nonlinear mixed models may be used to analyze energy partitioning in animals, to develop prediction equations of MEI, to evaluate individual efficiency for maintenance, and to assess diets regarding the slope of bias in coefficients of maintenance energy requirements.",M2

However, less than 0.1% of these eggs are exported. Increasing the shelf-life of eggs may increase export sales. The goal of this research was to determine whether food-grade coatings on eggs may extend shelf-life under refrigerated storage. Four food-grade coatings were selected: paraffin wax, mineral oil, soy protein isolate, and whey protein isolate (WPI). These coatings were applied to fresh chicken eggs. The eggs were stored for 12 wk in refrigerated storage at 7 degrees C. Two replicates of the 12-wk study were conducted. Egg properties measured included Haugh units, albumen pH, yolk pH, albumen CO(2) content, vitelline membrane strength, water loss, shell strength, and shell color. Egg functionality measurements included foam volume, angel food cake volume, and emulsion stability. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS PROC GLIMMIX method (P &lt; 0.05). Results found that coated eggs maintained higher Haugh units beyond 6 wk compared with the uncoated eggs. Also, coated eggs maintained a higher CO(2) content and lower albumen pH than the uncoated eggs over the storage period. Vitelline membrane strength slightly decreased over time in uncoated eggs, but did not change in coated eggs. Overall, oil-, wax-, and WPI-coated eggs maintained higher vitelline membrane strength (14%) than the uncoated eggs. Coating of chicken eggs with a food-grade film (oil, wax, WPI) will extend shelf-life beyond 6 wk.",M2

If data between countries are to be compared, the same test should give the same results in each laboratory. As the egg hatch test for benzimidazole resistance is used for both research and surveys, the ability of different laboratories to obtain similar results was studied through testing of known isolates of cyathostomins, Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi, and Cooperia oncophora in programs supported by the EU (Cost B16 and FP6-PARASOL). Initial results showed difficulties in obtaining reproducible and similar data within and between laboratories. A series of ring tests, i.e., simultaneous and coordinated rounds of testing of nematode isolates in different laboratories was subsequently performed. By adopting identical protocols, especially the use of deionized water and making dilutions of thiabendazole in dimethyl sulfoxide in the final ring test, laboratories correctly identified both susceptible and resistant isolates. The protocols for the test and preparation of solutions of thiabendazole are described.",M2
19446819,"Rapid confirmatory method for the determination of 11 nitroimidazoles in <e>egg</e> using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.A rapid confirmatory method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous identification, confirmation and quantitation of 11 nitroimidazoles in eggs by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and is capable of analysing metronidazole (MNZ), dimetridazole (DMZ), ronidazole (RNZ), ipronidazole (IPZ) and their hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI (hydroxymethyl, methyl nitroimidazole), IPZ-OH. The method is also capable of analysing carnidazole (CRZ), ornidazole (ORZ), tinidazole (TNZ) and ternidazole (TRZ). MNZ, DMZ and RNZ have been assigned a recommended level (RL) of 3 microg kg(-1) by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) in Berlin. The developed method described in this study is easily able to detect all the nitroimidazole compounds investigated at this level and below. Egg samples are extracted with acetonitrile, and NaCl is added to help remove matrix contaminants. The acetonitrile extract undergoes a liquid-liquid wash step with hexane; it is then evaporated and reconstituted in mobile phase. The reconstituted samples are analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The decision limits (CCalpha) range from 0.33 to 1.26 microg kg(-1) and the detection capabilities (CCbeta), range from 0.56 to 2.15 microg kg(-1). The results of the in ter-assay study, which was performed by fortifying hen egg samples (n=18) on three separate days, show the accuracy calculated for the various analytes to range between 87.2 and 106.2%. The precision of the method, expressed as %CV values for the inter-assay variation of each analyte at the three levels of fortification (3, 4.5 and 6.0 microg kg(-1)), ranged between 3.7 and 11.3%. A Day 4 analysis was carried out to examine species variances in eggs from different birds such as duck and quail and investigating differences in various battery and free range hen eggs.",M2
